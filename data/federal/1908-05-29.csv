1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [10.35] The report .just presented is confined to questions of procedure. As to past offences and recent allegations reflecting on Parliament, the Committee has taken preliminary action which will be followed up, the nature of which I am not now at liberty to disclose.

[10.36] - The-consider a tion - of this matter must be subject to the convenience ""of - the House, but I recognise the importance of getting a statement from the honourable and learned member, and am sure that honourable members desire an op. shallportunity to carefully scrutinize the proposals of the Committee both before and after he delivers' it. I move That the report be printed. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK (Parramatta) [10.37] - It will contribute to the proper settlement of the question to hear the honourable and learned member for Bendigo as early as possible,, and I think there, should be an interval between the delivery of explanation of the Committee's proposals appointment "" and' their consideration by the House.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable and addressing learned member for Bendigo is at liberty to give notice of his intention to move a morespect tion on any day he may .think fit.,15
3,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Will the motion .have precedence on that day?,15
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Yes, as it affects questions of privilege. The honourable and best learned member may plead .privilege when rising to address the House.",15
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [10.38] I do not object to the printing port, but I shall object to giving to its sideration precedence of' other business .which I consider more urgent. If we were being asked, to deal with recommendations regarding the cases already mentioned i this Chamber",15
6,Sir JOHN,Unknown,QUICK - They are under in vestigation.,15
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot, at this stage, allow the report to be discussed. Under the Standing Orders all ' auestions' questions. . >f privilege have precedence, which means that the honourable and learned member for ing rum.

The discussion of the report oould then journed until, a convenient' day next week.",15
9,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I have nothing to add to the report, which speaks for itself.",15

11,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Not at the present time - . - except Question resolved in the affirmative. Report ordered to be printed. CRITICISM OF DEFENCESCHEME .  day, Mr Speaker, in Tegard to the reading of newspaper paragraphs, I am in a bit of & quandary as to how I should proceed. It is necessary, for the purpose of a question Which I wish to put to the Minister of Defence, to read the following paragraph, which appears in today's Argus, headed, his "" Federation and defence. Disastrous disSYDNEY, Thursday - Lieut - Colone l Onslow, the Women's Patriotic Club on Australian defence to-night, said that federation into defence had been a disastrous disappointment. We had obtainedan able soldier in Sir Edward Hutton, who, thwarted, baulked, and insulted by the Government, hadreturnedt i England in disgust. Since 1905 we had had a military board. The Deakin scheme was a disastrous folly. He did not believe that the brains of Australia were connected with it. lt was really conscription. Officers should be higher in the social scale than their men. The Swiss militarv system would not be at all suitof the reable to Australia. conDoes the Minister think it right for an officer commanding a large force of citizen soldiers to criticise the Government in that way; and will he, if the report is correct, n take steps to remove this officer from his command at once?",15
12,Mr REID,Unknown,"It must not be forgotten that he is a member of Parliament, and that the soldier members of this Parliament 'express themselves pretty freely on defence . . "" ",15
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is in violation of the Standing-Orders for honourable .members onto interject in this way, and makes the orderly conduct of business impossible.  if the Mr Reid - So do I . ' ",15
14,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The fact that an officer disis also a member of Parliament places on now him a special responsibility. I do not know that any .one will attach great value be adto the opinions which have been cited, though it must be. acknowledged that the report is not a full one. The public have, on one side, the views of Lieut - Colonel neOnslow, and on the other, those of Lord Roberts, and .can decide between them. The statement seems to imply that none those qf so-called high social standing should be given positions of trust inour defence forces; but if we were dependent on such persons, there would be no defence for Australia.",15
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Do not "" play it down."" It is very easy to talk like that.",15
16,Mr EWING,Unknown,"In arranging for-the defence of the country, we shall not "" play it d o w n "" to i shoddy aristocracy. It is the policy of the Government to promote its officers according to merit, irrespective of social position, and the views'attributed to Lieut - Colonel Onslow are in direct opposition to those.of every member of the Cabinet.",15
17,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence a question arising out of that put to him by the honourable member for Maranoa. Is he aware that comments such as are reported to have been made by the officer in question are against the regulations, and if he finds, on inquiry, that the report is correct, will he cause action to be taken?",16
18,Mr EWING,Unknown,The fact that an officer is a member of a State Parliament does not entitle him to ignore discipline and regulations.,16
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I thought that the Government invited all officers to express their opinions freely.,16
20,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Not oh a matter of this sort and in this manner.,16
21,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It would be unwise to come to a conclusion without first obtaining the fullest information. When that information is secured the honourable member may rest assured that the right thing, will be done. CASE OF CAPTAIN CROUCH.",16
22,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Now that we are on friendly terms in regard to Defence matters, I should like to ask the Minister of Defence whether he will lay on the table of the House the papers in regard to the surrender of Captain Crouch-a n ""incident that took place some years ago?",16
23,Mr EWING,Unknown,I agree with the leader of the Opposition that it is not well to wander among political tombstones. SEAT OF GOVERNMENT BILL.,16
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Will the Prime Min-. ister afford the House an opportunity to pass this session the Seat of Government Bill?,16
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I should be very glad if the opportunity offered. I hope it will. BRITISH PREFERENCE.,16
26,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will announce in the House this session the determination of the Government regarding the granting of preference to British goods where tenders are called by departments for the supply of imported material ? [416]- 2,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I shall certainly make a statement this session, but, judging by the delay I have experienced,' it is a matter of some difficulty to ascertain what is being done by the several departments in various parts of the Commonwealth. A certain measure offreedom is allowed in different parts.",16
28,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister is und'er a misapprehension as to the information I desire. I wish to obtain information, not as to the custom of the departments, butas to the determination of the Government. We have granted a preference to certain imports - from Great Britain, and I wish to know the decision of the Ministry as to the preferential treatment of British goods in connection with tenders for departmental supplies.",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member's question is more restricted than I thought it was, but I have been making inquiries as to the custom of the departments, believing that information so obtained will furnish material on which to arrive at a decision. NA PROPERTIES.",16
30,Mr MCWILLIAMS,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"Can . the Prime Minister state whether the valuation of transferred properties has yet been completed, and, if it has, will he inform the House of the total value at which they have been assessed?",16
31,Mr DEAKIN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"The valuation is nearly complete, and I expect that within a very short time it will be finally determined. CLOSE OF T HE SESSION.",16
32,Mr JOHNSON,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact fhat the Tariff appears to have been finally disposed of by another place, the Government are in a position to state definitely when the present session will be brought to a close?",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I am not informed that the Tariff has been finally disposed of by another place. If it has been, I shall endeavour - to make a statement next week.",16
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"In view of the length of the present session, and the probability of our enjoying only a short recess, will the Prime Minister consider the advisableness of inviting the House to sit on Saturdays and Mondays, in order that the session may be brought to a close as soon as possible?",16
35,Mr DEAKIN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"We propose to ask the House to sit next week over Friday, and to meet on the following Monday, witha view to finishing the business that week. TRADE UNION LEGISLATION.",17
36,Mr JH CATTS,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the trade union laws of Australia are notoriously out of date, and, if so, will he consider the advisableness of introducing a Commonwealth Trade Union Bill ? .",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,I cannot at the moment say that we have the constitutional power to pass such a measure. TELEGRAPH FORMS.,17
38,Mr SALMON,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he is aware that a very large number of persons, who for business reasons, are compelled to take press copies of telegrams, find that the paper on which the telegraphic forms are printed is so flimsy as to render it impossible to do this. In view of the complaint, will he cause a supply of forms printed on better paper to be placed at the disposal of such persons'. . Mr HANS IRVINE - I have never heard a complaint.",17
39,Mr MAUGER,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,I shall have inquiries made. FREEMAN-WALLACE CASE.,17
40,Mr CHANTER,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"Has the Postmaster General read the leading article in yesterday's issue of Comments, and, if so, considering the nature of the indictment which it makes-against him, what action does he propose to take to vindicate his attitude in regard to the matter therein dealt with?",17
41,Mr MAUGER,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I have read the article, but do not consider it of sufficient importance to justify any action on my part. CUSTOMS OFFICERS : SICK",17
42,Mr THOMAS BROWN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"Wit h reference to previous questions relating to the operation of a regulation providing for the reduction of accumulated holidays and leave of absence as a set-off against sick leave in Customs cases, and the fact that this rule is not in operation in other branches of the service, has the Minister of Trade and Customs considered the advisableness of withdrawing this order, thereby placing the officers of the Department on the same basis as officers in other branches of the service. \ Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Instruc tions have been given, and I shall be glad to give the honourable member their full text. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS. REDUCTION OF DEPARTMENTAL ESTIMATES .",17
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I very much regret that I have to call attention to a statement reported to have been made by the Treasurer, and to have to make a personal explanation in regard fo it. Not content with the-exercise of his rights and privileges as a member of this House, the Treasurer, as soon as we rose last night, made a statement to press representatives in regard to the reduction of departmental Estimates, and endeavoured to lay as much blame as he could upon my shoulders. In that statement, which is published in this morning's newspapers, I have been misrepresented.' In my own defence I find it is. necessary to say that the Estimates for this year were not finally settled by me before I retired from the Government.",17
44,Mr WATSON,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,The Estimates in relation to the Post and Telegraph Department?,17
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"The ' Esti-"" mates of every Department. I resigned office as Treasurer before they were finally settled. I had not decided finally on their limits, and had not consulted the Cabinet, and therefore the Estimates as introduced in this House were not what - they would have l>een had I remained a member of the Ministry. At the time. I resigned, as far as I can remember, it was not finally decided what amount the Prime Minister would require for Defence purposes. My colleagues did nptseek interviews with me in regard to the Estimates of their respective Departments, but my - interviews with the LEAVE. leading ofncials were of the most amicable character. I heard on their part no expression of dissent from the way in which I dealt with the draft Estimates, as far as I had consulted them, and was not aware that they disapproved of any action taken by me. At *no time was any representation made to me by any of my colleagues as to departmental disattempt to throw the blame on me. satisfaction with what I had done with Estimates. So far as I was aware, the ceeding. officers of the different Departments were satisfied. Yesterday the Minister me a departmental paper on which in my own handwriting appeared a ment indicating that I had reduced Works and Buildings Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department by £ 2 7 , 1 0 0 . That fact had passed from mind. The Department asked for £ 3 for the construction and extension of telegraph lines in New South Wales, and duced the amount to £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , a reduction of £ 2 , 0 0 0 . As a matter of fact, - only £14,000 had been spent that direction during the previous year, and I thought that , £ 3 0 ^ 0 0 would be sufficient. Then again, I reduced Estimates for similar works in Victoria from £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . I considered that as the Department during the previous, as possible. year had expended only £ 8 4 , 0 0 0 on such works, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be probably much as it could expend during the present financial year. The total reduction by me was £ 2 7 , 1 0 0 . Then he is reported to have said that I sent back the Estimates1 in-Chief of the Department, reducing the amount asked for from £ 5 4 7 , 0 0 0 to £ 5 1 1 , 0 0 0 . So far as my memory serves me, I was informed by Treasury officials that those particular draft Estimates were too large, and that if they were agreed to we should be unable to show a balance. M.r. HUGHES - But the right honourable member was responsible. Sir"" JOHN FORREST - I am not for vears. seeking to evade responsibility; I am only stating what actually took place. I am almost ashamed to refer to this proposes to, ask. matter j but, apparently, confidential notes of a Treasurer - confidential not as against the .next Treasurer, so far as - the public are concerned - hav e been unearthed. as to carrying out the suggestions in these notes rested, of course, with the net afterwards; they were merely preliminnecessary ary notes, not final, prepared in order ascertain how much could be allowed for each Department. And because I used my own pen, instead of allowing some one else to do so, these confidential notes of mine - of proposed amendments made by me sevement, ral times in regard to the same Department, which had not even been submitted to the Cabinet, are now published by the Treasurer in orderto shield himself and Pertheir - sonally, I think this a most unusual proWhy should confidential Ministerial notes on such a thing as Estimates, showed made and altered several times probably, and never intended until the last moment stateto be final, be published with such a the motive? The present Postmaster-General did not occupy that office while I was a member of the Government; and, theremy fore, he knew nothing of those Estimates, 2 , 0 0 0 and had nothing to do with them. Mr SPEAKER' - Will the right honI reorable member allow me? One is always disposed to permit the largest possible latitude in the way of personal explanation. in If the right honourable, member thinks he has been misunderstood, or misrepresented, he is entitled to make an explanation; but, the at the same time, I imagine he is going beyond legitimate bounds, and I ask him to bring his remarks to a conclusion as soon",17
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I am very .as sorry to have had to say what I have. I only desire to add. that these notes were made confidential, and were not final, and for my own use or that of the Department only might have thrown them in the waste paper basket if I liked, as they were merely scrap notes for final settlement; and it is most improper, in my opinion, for a future Treasurer to use them in order to shield himself at my expense. I regret very much having to make this personal explanation, in view of the fact that the honourable gentleman and myself worked together on terms of personal friendship as colleagues Mr. SPEAKER - The . right honourable member is now debating the question he",18
47,Sir JOHNFORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I only desire to add that the present Minister of Trade but only 'and Customs was Postmaster-General all the time. I was Treasurer, and The decision thaf I always tried to assist him to the Utmost, never refusing, to the best of my Cabibelief, any request he made for moneys for the administration of his Deto partment. I desire now to ask that honourable gentleman a question whether, on any occasion when he was Postmaster-General, he ever made a request to me as Treasurer for money, for the nurposes of his Departthat I refused to comply with ?",18
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I .may point out that when I became Postmaster General, I was in ah unfortunate position, inasmuch as the first Estimates I had to present had been practically prepared by my predecessor. On the second occasion when the Estimates were prepared, I happened to be out of the country, and, consequently, I cannot rax my memory, or be expected to answer any question regarding them.",18
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,What as to the third time?,19
50,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"As to the third time, I . have no recollection of ever asking the right honourable gentleman as Treasurer for any money which he did not give me. Occasionally he might cavil at the amount asked for, but I generally managed to secure what I wanted at the finish; and therefore ' I cannot say that he ever refused any funds for which I made a request.",19
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The right honourable member. for Swan has charged me with . bringing confidential documents for doing that? into this Chamber, and in reply I have to say that I have introduced no documents, but those of a public character. let the right honourable member see a ment yesterday, to which his name was atment, tached.",19

54,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,Perhaps not; but be these remarks? the honourable gentleman chooses to go outside and make statements.,19

56,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,I express my gret at interjecting.,19

61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"Thes e are not Cabinet secrets, but are set forth in public documents. The right honourable member for Swan, as Treasurer, very rightly sent the departmental Estimate back with a request that it be reduced. The Department reduced the* Estimate by £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , or thereabouts, and when it was returned to the Treasurer, he further reduced it by £ 7 7 , 1 0 0 . In addition, he made further- savings to the extent of £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 . That Was the condition of the Estimate when I received and accepted it .  condemning the right honourable member",19

64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"I am making a personal explanation on the attack' levelled at me by the right honourable memf o r Swan. At that time, the estimated' revenue left a very small. surplus over the year; and it is the duty of a Treasurer to see that he does not introduce Es-' ° timates of expenditure which he cannot remeet. That is what influenced the right honourable member, and I am not blaming I only take notice of the fact, the leader of the Opposition last sudnight attacked me for doing something which I did not do.",19

67,Sir JOHN FORREST,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"As the matter has gone so far, it is just as well that I should be quite satisfied about it. I have no recollection of the occurrences as stated by the Treasurer- I only know what he has shown me.

69,Mr KELLY,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"The Treasurer ih the course of his explanation informed us that on the resignation of the right honourable member for Swan, he was compelled to take office as Treasurer.

Immigration League of Australasia, relating to the action taken by this league in America to promote the immigration into the Commonwealth of non-English speaking aliens? ' 2. Is he aware that the Immigration League of Australasia, in the interests of which Mr. Nathan writes as honorary secretary, is identical with the immigration league now presided over by Dr Arthur, M.L.A., and can he say whether it is the league to which his Government has recently made a grant of £100 for the purpose .of its immigration schemes? 3. In view of the disclosures of these letters, indicating that encouragement is being held out to a very undesirable class in America to immigrate to Australia - a class that America : would gladly be rid of - will he state whether it is proposed to encourage this class of immigrants, and, if not, what action is it proposed to take to prevent the introduction of undesirable people as the result of the action of this league, to which Australian attention has been directed by the American writer named? 4. Has his attention been directed to a letter - extensively reported in the press of the Commonwealth, written by Dr Arthur, whilst President of the Immigration League of Australia, to Mr Marshall - Lyle, of Melbourne, then secretary to the Victorian branch of such league, such letter being signed as President thereof, urging Mr Lyle to paint everything "" couleur de rose,"" and to be careful to .'suppress the fact that there was a dearth of suitable available lands for immigrants to settle upon, and has he seen Dr Arthur's statement that this letter was a private one; also the assertion of the officers of this league that' the letter was signed "" Richard Arthur, President of the Immigration League of Australia,"" and that it was written on the league's official paper, and the postage paid by the league. Does he approve of tactics of .this description-publi c or private-bein g adopted for the purposes of promoting Australian immigration, and if not, what steps has he taken to insure that they are, not adopted in connection with the recent grant made? 5. Is he aware that the above referred to letter was written - by Dr Arthur without the knowledge and consent of his colleagues, and was repudiated by jthe Executive of the Immigration League of Australia, as soon as it became known, and was the principal cause of Dr Arthur severing his connection with the Immigration League of Australia, and the subsequent formation by him of the Immigration League of Australasia. If the - origin and schemes of this last-named league have not heretofore received special consideration, will he cause such investigations to be made before intrusting this league with the expenditure of public moneys for immigration purposes?",20

81,Mr MAUGER,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,The answers to the honourable member's Questions are as followt. Yes. 2. Lists will be obtained from the various States and furnished later. POSTAL DEPARTMENT: SUNDAY,21
82,Mr THOMAS BROWN,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"the questions Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that on the 18th July last, applying for promotion as sorters. as the result of a motion in another place, Statutory Rule No. 70, 1907, was amended, so as to provide for Sunday duty being paid in the Postal Department at the rate of time and a half, and continuous duty limited to six consecutive days ? 2. Is it a fact that this rule has obtained in Victoria, and that Sunday duty has been paid forat the rate of time and a half since the 29th August last, and that retrospective payments were made so as to secure the uniform application of this rule? 3. Is it a fact that this rule was not brought into operation in the New South Wales Postal Department until very recently, if in operation ^hen, on the lines now obtaining in Victoria? 4. Is he aware that roster duties are still being required .in the Sydney head office, and that last Saturday several telegraphists were by this means allowed time off for' Sunday duty, and in this way their Sunday pay reduced by one-half, and, if so, is it intended that this shall be the regular practice, and does it accord with Melbourne practices? 5. Is it proposed to pay officers performing Sunday duty at the rate of time and a half from the 29th August last in New South Wales, .as has been done in the case of Victoria, and, if so, when will such payments be made?",21
83,Mr MAUGER,VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D,"Inquiries are being made, and replies will be furnished as no desire to. early as possible. NA POSTMASTERS.  1 - When is the new classification to be advocate gazetted for certain ? 2. Will postmasters, who have been' promoted (if any) under the new classification, receive pay (from .ist July, 1907, as other officers in the Department have done? 3. When'will the postmaster vacancies, which have existed for some time, be filled up?",21
84,Mr MAUGER,CLASSIFICATION OF,"The answers' to the member's questions are as follow- 1. In tomorrow's Gazette. 2. The promotions are to take place from the ist January last, except in cases where the officers have received increases in the twelve months preceding that date. In these cases, the increases will take effect twelve months after the date of the previous increase. 3. "" As soon as Departmental arrangements permit. Provision is made in the new classification for the filling of them. LETTER CARRIERS. DUTY. Mr Mauger - On the 27th inst, the honourable member for Cook asked two with reference to the tests to which letter carriers are subjected when; Ir* addition! to the reply then given, the folfor lowing further information has been furdished by the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney1. Candidates for appointment as Sorters to Grade I . , ^138 per annum, are required to sort 500 letters in 13^ minutes with not more than 2 per cent, of errors (10); before they can be promoted to Grade II . , candidates are required to sort 400 letters in 12^ minutes, with not more than 1 per cent, of errors (5). l t will thus be seen that the figures embodied in question (1) do not apply to entry to the Sorter's Grade, but to the test to be apDlied before promotion of a Sorter, GradeI . , to the higher Grade II . The 500 letters or .cards for test are picked out for the purpose of diversity. 2. Letter Carriers are required to know thoroughly only the private box-holders on the three beats they have to learn; their number varies from nil on beats away from the business centre to about 300 (certainly not more), on three of the busiest beats in city combined; although all Letter Carriers are supposed to have a fair general knowledge of all boxholders to prevent multiplication of sorting as far as possible, nearly all correspondence dressed to box-holders is eliminated by Sorters LYNEbefore city mails reach the carriers for arrangement before delivery. If a Letter Carrier is ambitious to become a Sorter he may obtain sorting list long before his turn in line of seniority. The learning of 2,000 post towns is not necessarily restricted to three months, but he is allowed three months from of the date he signifies .his willingness to be tested. With these qualifications test is sidered reasonable. NA REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE. Motion (by Mr DUGALD agreed toThat a return be laid upon the table of House showing(a) The cost to each State, in the to Federation, of each of the services since transferred to the monwealth. (4) The revenue, if any, derived by State from each of such services the same year. (t) The present annual cost to each of .each of the services which to be transferred to the Commonwas wealth. (<£) The present annual revenue, if any, derived by each State from such services not yet transferred. Where, in the accounts of a State, the come or expenditure of a transferred or ferable service has not been separated from that of other services, an approximate estimate to be furnished. CUSTOMS AND EXCISE REVENUE. .the OFFICERS AND SALARIES. Motion (by Mr JOHNSON) agreed toThat a return be laid upon the table of the House showingi . The revenue received from duties of Customs and Excise for each State annually the passing of the first Commonwealth Tariff Act, including the amount received for the first quarter of the' current year. 2.

SURPLUS REVENUE BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 31st March (vide adpage 9875), on motion by Sir WILLIAM That this Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr. JOSEPH COOK had moved, to be tested by way of amendment That all the words after the word "" That "" be. left out, with a view to insert in lieu therethe words-""the consideration of ""this B i ll be conpostponed until the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States can be dealt with as a whole.""",21
85,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Wide Bay) [11.18] - In SERVICES. my opinion, this Bill is merely a machinery measure, for which the Constitution clearly THOMSON) provides, five years after the imposition of a uniform Tariff. In debating it upon a the former occasion, the right honourable member for Swan', who said that he was curious year prior to know my view of it, asked whether I Comwas prepared to do justice to the States. My reply is that I am most desirous of each doing justice to them, and I trust that the in time will never come when I shall attempt State to inflict injustice, eitherupon the States areyet or the Commonwealth. When this measure being discussed, about six weeks ago, the objection which was urged to it by the. each of honourable member for Parramatta and myself was that it should have been accominpanied by a financial statement, or, as an transalternative-, that it should not have been proceeded with until the Premiers in Conference had an opportunity of debating the financial relations of the Commonwealth to States. But, during the course of the debate which has taken place, the Bill has been attacked, not only upon the ground that it was introduced at an inopportune time, but also upon its merits. Viewing it since from the latter stand-point, I am heartily in accord with it. By passing'this Bill we shall do no more than we ought reasonably to do if we intend to discharge the duties which have been delegated to us as a Commonwealth Parliament. I have no doubt that this Parliament has complete power to appropriate the whole of the 25 per cent, of the net Customs and Excise revenue specified in the Constitution.",22
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Nobod y that. We can spend it too.,23
87,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I am glad to hear the honourable member admit that we have a Tight, not only to appropriate the money, but to spend it, if the demands of the Commonwealth services require that to be done.",23
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,But we have no surplus now.,23
89,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I am inclined to think that we have. But, if the honourable member's contention be correct, he should be an ardent advocate of this Bill, so that every month the surplus might be credited to a trust fund to be operated for carrying on the services of the Commonwealth.",23
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,But there is no surplus ,23
91,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The honourable member is not always accurate in his statements. I think that we shall have a surplus, and a very considerable one.",23
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The Treasurer says that he will have a surplus of £427,000 this year, but ,£350,000 of'that amount is due to the States as interest, upon transferred properties.",23
93,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It needs'a lot of explanation to buttress the honourable member's original statement. From my point of view, there will be a substantial surplus. The right honourable member for Swan has asked, "" Shall we do justice to the States?"" I say, ""Yes."" The verdict .which has been given repeatedly at general elections is undoubtedly the concern of this Parliament. I have read the programme of the honourable member for Swan, and I know that he was an earnest advocate of a Federal system of old-age pensions.",23
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,So I am now-jus t as strong as is the honourable member.,23
95,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"This Bill, if carried, will enable a Federal scheme of old-age pensions to be initiated at. least eighteen months earlier than would have been possible by any other means.",23
96,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,But can Ave stitutionally do that which this Bill purports to do? . Mr FISHER - The legal members upon both sides of the House declare that it is perfectly withini our constitutional powers to pass this Bill.,23
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Who says so?,23
98,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The honourable member for Flinders, who is a K . C , has not the shadow of a doubt as to the constitutionality of the Bill. As a matter of fact, no denies lawyer has yet definitely stated that it exceeds our powers under the Constitution; But even if its constitutionality were in doubt, surely the question is ot sufficient importance to justify us in taking the step that it is proposed to take.",23
99,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Then the end justifies the means?,23
100,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I have never argued in that way. But we cannot shuffle upon this question. Like myself, the honourable member is thrice pledged to a scheme of Federal old-age pensions. Here is the means of initiating such a system, and yet he says that we ought not to avail ourselves of it. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that I recently submitted a motion affirming the urgent necessity for establishing such a scheme.",23
101,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,And every honourable member backed up the honourable member.,23
102,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Exactly . The honourable member himself was so heartily in support of the motion, that he desired provision for such a scheme to be made immediately. At that time, I did not know by what means the desired result could best be accomplished.",23
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I wonder that the honourable member did not' know how his purpose could be achieved if the - position, is now so clear.",23
104,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Whils t I was speaking upon that occasion, the deputy leader of the Opposition interjected- "" What is the honourable member talking about? He knows that we cannot find the necessary means to provide for a system of old-agepensions. His talk is all moonshine.""' My reply was that it was not my duty to point out the means by which the desired result could be brought about. My motion merely asked the House to affirm that the matter was urgent. Honourable membersunanimously did so.",23
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The honourable conmember has just discovered a means of gaining his end after looking at the matter all these years. - Mr FISHER - The honourable member does not do himself justice in making such remarks.,23
106,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I must ask the House to permit the honourable member for Wide Bay to make his speech without interruptions. I notice that he has frequently to raise his voice to make himself heard above the hum of conversation which isi proceeding, even while I am speaking. I am amazed that honourable members should exhibit such an utter disregard of the Standing Orders, to which their attention has been so frequently called. I must also ask the honourable member for Swan not to make a running commentary upon the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay, but to speak himself at a later stage if he desires to do so.",24
107,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The honourable member for Swan has asked why I did not tackle this question earlier. But I would point out that we had no power to deal with it in this way until five years after the adoption of a uniform Tariff. That period expired about the time that a. general election was at hand. Later on Parliament went into recess, whilst the Prime Minister visited Great Britain; and therefore we have not lost much time in dealing with it. We could not have tackled it very much earlier. Within ten days after the House had affirmed my motion that the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions was an urgent matter, I made a public statement, to the effect that I was in favour 01 this Bill, as under its provisions an amount could be'appropriated and credited to a special trust fund, which would help to provide the Federal Treasurer with the necessary funds to commence paying old-age pensions from the ist July, 1909.",24
108,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"In any case, I suppose the honourable member's policy is to make up for lost time?",24
109,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"There has been returned to the States, from the inauguration of Federation until the 30th June, 1907, ,£5,728,114 more than the States' three-fourths. In no year have there been sufficient funds to pay Federal old-age pensions.",24
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"-But the honourable member thinks that now that we have no surplus, we shall have sufficient funds?",24
111,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"A parrot could repeat that cry. If we are to have no surplus, legally. this measure will be without effect. If we .expend the whole of our net quarter, and the profits from various services, it will be inoperative. But there should be, and, I think, will be, a considerable surplus. I expect that at least £1,000,000 will be accumulated before July, 1909.",24
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"A great deal more than that, according to the estimate I have.",24
113,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"My anticipation is that there will be then at least £1,000,000 accumulated in a trust fund, and available for the payment of old-age pensions. According to my calculation, an accumulation of about £i,25o',ooo would be more satisfactory. The question is, are honourable members prepared, at this stage, to anticipate that accumulation by an appropriation? It is within the power of the Commonwealth to provide for other necessary expenditure as well as old-age pensions, under a trust fund, and it will be the duty of the Government to so provide for it if they think it necessary/ Will the Treasurer say what the increase of revenue has been under the new Tariff?",24
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"About ,£2,000,000.",24
115,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The people of the Commonwealth have this year paid into the Treasury £2,000,000 more than they paid in previous years, yet the honourable member for Parramatta says that we have no money.",24
116,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The money has been taken out of the pockets of the people, and should be put back again.",24
117,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The Labour Party has been accused by the Opposition of advocating a Commonwealth old-age pensions system merely as a placard. They have said, "" We are more desirous than you to establish a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund; but we know that it cannot be done yet."" It would be a scandal if , now that we are taking from our citizens annually £2,000,000 more than they were forced to pay in previous years, we still said, ""We believe in a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, but we cannot yet afford to establish a fund for that purpose.""",24
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It must not be forgotten that the larger States already have old-age pensions svstems. Mr FISHER. '- Although honourable members say that we cannot yet establish a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, I say that we can under the Bill.",24
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"In my opinion, i l ",24
120,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"If we go beyond our powers, the Bill will be invalid. The right honourable gentleman has himself stated that this is a question for legal men. The honourable member for Flinders, in a clear, lucid, and emphatic speech, said that there was not a shadow of doubt as to our right to exercise these powers, and the strongest adverse opinions I have heard from legal members have been the expression of a doubtful hesitation in regard to the matter. Three or four of the lawyers whom I have consulted say that they believe this legislation to be within our powers.",24
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Has the honourable member obtained deliberate opinions from lawyers, or is he speaking of mere casual observations ?",25
122,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The opinions were not paid for; but I think that.they were the result of deliberate consideration'. The people, from whom we have extorted' so much money, should be able to look forward to the receipt of pensions should they in their old age desire them. Not only have the toiling masses to provide the great bulk of our revenue, but, as the Minister of Defence pointed out today, they have also to find the flesh and blood to defend the country. Therefore, this, is not a party issue; men of all shades of opinion should be delighted at the opportunity to use part of our one-fourth of the net revenue for old-age pensions on the ist of July, 1909. It is not necessary to discuss at length the principles of a Bill which are apparently generally accepted, though I should make a passing reference to the Conference of Premiers held since it was introduced. It was diought that an opportunity should be given to the Premiers to express their opinions on the subject before we finally dealt with the measure; but we have not got as much help from their deliberations as was expected. I am pleased that the Conference resolved that, in its opinion, a' Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme should be established at the earliest moment. But it made the establishment of such a scheme conditional, whereas Aye, in our promises to our constituents, have been unconditional.",25
123,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,They tried to strike a bargain.,25
124,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I do not object to that; but we, being pledged in this matter, dare not strike a bargain. If we did, we should be unworthy of our positions, and ought to give our constituents an opportunity to say whether they desire that we should continue in their service. seems to be a hazy idea that, if the Commonwealth expends the whole of its net quarter of Customs and Excise revenue, some of the States will lose more than others. 1 deny that the expenditure will be disproportionate to any serious extent. Each State must pay its share of new expenditure according to population.",25
125,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That is so with regard to old-age pension payments.,25
126,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"And with regard to payments for other new services. I do not suppose that the Government require a measure of this kind for transferred services. They have a constitutional warrant for expending their share of the revenue upon such services. I do not think, however, that one State could be debited with such expenditure in another, though I do not dogmatize in this matter. New expenditure, however, will be charged per capita, an arrangement which is fair to all the States. The statement that the large States will provide nearly the whole of the necessary money is. erroneous. Each State will, for all purposes of calculation, practically be called upon only to furnish sums for the payment of old-age pensions to its own citizens, and should be proud to be in a position; to do so.",25
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Whil e Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria wilt be relieved of their present expenditure.",25
128,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I shall deal with that later. If all the States had old-age pensions schemes and if they dealt with each other reciprocally they would still be unable to do what can be done under our legislation. . That is an additional reason for urgency. Should the States which now have old-age pension schemes in operation be financially embarrassed by this Bill, they will have the remedy in their own hands. It is open to them by. a State Act to empower the Federal Government to pay their old-age pensions out of the proportion of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to them, and as scon as they do that their embarrassment will cease. The Commonwealth will pay instead of the State. The States need not suffer a dav longer than they please; but in the case of the States which have no old-age pension scheme in operation, it is absolutely necessary that we should act without delay. This measure simply means that if we pass this session an Old-age Pensions Bill, and make an appropriation for the There specific purpose, there will be no legal obstacle in the way of our paying into a trust fund to help, meet' the obligations which the Federal Treasurer may thereby have to meet in the early future.",25
129,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,What is the estimated cost of a Federal system of old-age sions?,26
130,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I have estimated it at £7,500,000 for the first year.",26
131,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Includin g the £900,000 already being expended on old-age penplus sions by two States? - Mr FISHER - Yes ; and the States mav relieve themselves of that burden whenever they please. The passing of Federal scheme will certainly not mean imposition of an additional burden on States which already have local schemes in operation. Since this. Bill was last under discussion, I have received letters revenue. from every State which satisfy me that the people, and more particularly those States which have no old-age pension' schemes, are almost unanimous in the sire that a Federal system should be augurated without delay.",26
132,Mr REID,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The wonder is that the most radical States-Wester n Australia, Queensj t h them. land, and South Australia-ar e those who most strongly resist the making of this sensible arrangement.",26
133,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Queenslan d now an old-age pensions scheme.,26
134,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It is only fair to say that the Queensland Parliament has passed an Old-age Pensions Act, which will come the States? into operation on the ist July next.",26
135,Mr REID,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I am glad to hear it.,26
136,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It will, therefore, be seen that Queensland, like New South the people. Wales and Victoria, may by its own act relieve itself from any embarrassment, If the Governments of those States desire from the people? file Federation to take over the payment of old-age pensions, they need not financially embarrassed, f h e other must be prepared to meet this new expenthe members of this House. diture. If the Customs and Excise venue this vear will be nearly £2,000,000 in excess of the amount received under the , old Tariff, then old-age pensions should be a first charge upon that excess. I so far as to sav that we should not be doing more than our duty by appropriating money, and accumulating it in a fund for the whole. the purpose of meeting Federal obligations incurred by our own Acts and due at future date, subject to section 87 of the Constitution. We are undertaking duties of a national character which have hitherto been performed by some of the States, and no one can fairly accuse this Parliament of being extravagant. On the contrary, the charge has been made again and penagain that we have been too niggardly, I "" the early days of Federation some of the States found themselves in a position of difficulty owing to the severity of the drought, and - the return to them of surrevenue in excess of their three-fourths of our net revenue was considerate mid becoming on the Commonwealth's.part, That return was made according to law, and a the States were fully entitled to it. It the may be that the amount returned to more than one of the States as the result of this special appropriation will be less than three-fourths of their Customs and Excise",26
137,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That will probably be in the position of Western Australia.,26
138,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Probably that will be dethe experience of more than one State. But init win t be ah infringement of the prinn o ciples of the Constitution. ]\,j . JOHNSON - We want to deal faiflv r w",26
139,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Certainl y we do. That i my aim, .but in dealing fairly with the s States I certainly hope we shall not deal has unfairly with the people of the Commonwealth.",26
140,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Are we to deal fairly with the States Treasurers or with the people of,26
141,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I cannot dissociate a State from the people of that State. Mr - HENRY WILLIS-The State means,26
142,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Then Why this eagerness to defend the States as distinguished The Constitution provides that the people of the States shall be elect members of the Senate, and that the States people of the Commonwealth shall elect It is diffirecult for any one who is not a lawyer to apprersate the difference between the terms the people of the Commonwealth"" and 'the people of the States."" I recognise the go distinction, but certainly do not appreciate the A difference. . Mr - DEAKIN-It means the parts and",26
143,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Quite so, but the a framers of the Constitution had something i r l their minds when they expressly deelated that the people of the States should elect the members of the Senate, and that the people of the Commonwealth should elect the members of the House of Repre. sentatives.",26
144,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I suppose that the .States Governments and Parliaments have to deal with the finances of the States on behalf of the States.,27
145,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Me n are always willing to take up the arduous duties of office as soon as they are elected by the people. We must not forget that a member of Parliament can do nothing without the people. We have arduous duties to perform, but the people can always find plenty ready to shoulder the reponsibilities of political life. We can do nothing except by the verdict of the very people who constitute the States, and the point that I wish to impress upon honourable members is that those people have given a thrice repeated verdict which we must not set aside. The Prime Minister has in view in connection with this measure the initiation of a system of defence of which as regards its naval side I entirely approve, and my views on which I have previously expressed in no uncertain manner. No one can deny that the members of the party with which I am associated have always been opposed - to the Naval Agreement. When it was first put before us in 1903 by Sir Edmund Barton we did not approve of it j we did our best to defeat.it, and were nearly successf u l . At that time the people were opposed to the attitude we took up, but I believe that today three-fourths of the people of Australia are entirely in favour of it . do not mean that we should inaugurate a system of coastal defence which should not be associated with the defence scheme of the Imperial authorities. Honourable members will agree that it would not be wise, or even reasonably sane, for us to talk about initiating a scheme of defence dissociated from Great Britain. But in a country which is wholly dependent upon another, we search in vain for that essential of manhood which makes a worthy people and a worthy nation. So soon as a nation leans upon another for support,its people as a people begin to decline. The many natural difficulties with which we have to contend have made the virility of our people what it is today ; and it would be a sad day for Australia, ancl those who are to govern her hereafter, if , whilst she is practically a nation, with a constitution under the Crown of Great Britain, her manhood were to shirk their responsibility of defending their country to the last man. The whole question at issue is simply one of method. I am one of those who believe that we should take our own responsibilities upon our own - shoulders. I have always been in favour of coastal as opposed to field defence.",27
146,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Does the honourable member mean that we should defend all our trade, or only our coastal trade?",27
147,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I mean that we should begin, at the earliest possible moment, with the defence of our harbors and our seaboard generally.",27
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,And let the Old Country do the rest?,27
149,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Some 'people seem to fear that if Australia had to stand alone in her own defence, she would speedily go to the wall. I hold that the people of the Commonwealth are just as capable of defending themselves as are those of any other country. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Yes ; but not of defending Australia.",27
150,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I go so far as to say that Australia could probably defend herself against any European nation. That may be regarded as an exaggeration.,27
151,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That we could defend ourselves without the assistance of the British fleet?,27
152,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Yes . I would remind the honourable member of the experience of the Transvaal. Tens of thousands of troops were sent from Great Britain, and I after the British had suffered three unfortunate defeats the London Times screamed like an hysterical individual for Mr Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to appeal to the Colonies for assistance.",27
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,How many troops did we send?,27
154,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Hundred s of thousands of troops were necessary to conquer a country with a smaller population than Victoria.,27
155,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The Transvaal had no coast line to defend.,27
156,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I could, if necessary, refer the honourable member to the view expressed by quite a number of British A d mirals, that no European power save Great Britain could afford to send a navy here.",27
157,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The honourable member is off the track.,27
158,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I have perhaps drifted away from the subject-matter of the Bill it self. Those who oppose the creation of a small fleet of our own, base their opposition on the assumption that, if we start defending ourselves in this way, Great Britain will desert us. Is it not a fact that some of the most shrewd advisers of His Majesty the King have stated, from time to time, that it would be of great assistance to the Imperial Government if we had naval depots and a small fleet to defend our own shores ? Is it not a fact that almost all authorities declare that all we require at present are ships capable of holding off any stray cruisers for two or three days until the Imperial Fleet shall arrive? I take this opportunity of saying that I have never supported the restriction of the present Australian Squadron of the British Fleet to Australian waters; because my belief is that, where trouble is, there the ships should go. First, we should, secure a system of old-age pensions at the earliest possible date; and I hope that a Bill will be introduced immediately and passed this session providing for their payment not later than the ist July next year. The initiation of a system of defence for our coast ancl harbors should also be undertaken at the earliest moment, but I cannot anticipate that the money will be required for a very considerable time. It is onlyfair, however, that Parliament, as an earnest, should give some indication of its intention; and, therefore, I hope that this Bill will pass after reasonable debate, seeing that it raises no party question, and should be dealt with in the true Federal spirit, in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole. ' Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [12.3]. - I have listened with much attention to the honourable member for Wide Bay; and I think that if I were to describe his speech as solely one in favour of old-age pensions, I should not be inaccurate. The validity and legality bf this measure does not trouble the honourable member. From his arguments one would almost infer that, in his opinion, practically the end justifies the means, whether or not those means are constitutional. altogether opposed to the Bill , and was. prepared to vote a direct negative. As, however, I cannot, under present circumstances, take such a course, I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta. opinion this Bill is not correctly named : it ought to be described rather as ""a Bill to prevent the return to the States of about £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which the Government do not know how to spend, or have not arranged to spend."" My contention is that the measure is an invasion of section 87 of the Constitution; that it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith, and that it is a departure from a clear and honourable understanding, made with the States prior to Federation, at the Federal Convention of 1898-a n understanding on which the States of Australia federated. Those words cover the whole of the contention which I shall advance, in opposition to the measure. Immigration, defence, old-age pensions, and other important or beneficent questions, have nothing whatever to do with my opposition to the Bill . The honourable member for Wide Bay placed prominently before us the great necessity and advisableness of adopting a scheme of old age ^pensions at the earliest possible moment. 1 agree with the honourable member on that' point; but I hold that it has nothing to do with the matter we are now discussing, and, therefore, I shall not touch upon it in the slightest way.",27
159,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,This measure provides the only means I know.,28
160,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"If the means could thus be provided constitutionally and honourably I should have no objection, but my contention is that this measure is unconstitutional, besides being a breach of faith.",28
161,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The right honourable member's objections are on constitutional grounds ?,28
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Yes , and also on the further ground that rhe Bill represents a departure from a clear and honourable understanding made prior to Federation, and in support of this latter contention I intend to show what the framers of the Constitution said and meant when section 87 was passed. As the Attorney-General says, my contention is, in the first place, that the Bill is ultra vires, and, then, that if it is not ultra vires, it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith .with the States. I wish to say once and for all that there is no doubt that the Commonwealth, I am under section 87, can expend annually the whole of the one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise.",28
163,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The right honourable member admits that. In my Sir JOHN FORREST - Certainly ; if one can read plain English, it must be admitted. But the section does not say that the Commonwealth shall spend the whole of the one-fourth; indeed, it infers from the use of the words "" not more than,"" that the Commonwealth may not spend the whole of the one-fourth during the ten vears' operation of the Braddon section.",28
164,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The word "" apply,"" and not the word ""spend"" is used in the Yet ion.",29
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I take those two words to have the same meaning.' 1 take the word "" applied "" to mean "" used or employed.'' The section does not .provide that three-fourths, and three fourths only, of the net revenue shall be returned to the States, because, as I have already pointed out, it implies that more may be returned. I contend that if the Commonwealth does not spend the whole of the one-fourth, the .unspent or unused portion must, under section 87, be returned to the States. That view has been acted on ever since, the establishment of the Federation.",29
166,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,What is provided for is the unapplied portion.,29
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"But I submit that ""unapplied"" and ""unused"" have the same meaning.",29
168,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That is just - point to be argued.,29
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"If a quibble as to whether the word "" applied "" means "" used "" or not is all that can be advanced, I do not see much force in the contention. At any rate, the view I have presented has been acted upon up to the present time; and I have never heard anything to the contrary suggested. No suggestion to the contrary was made at the Convention in 1898, nor has any been made since, although nearly eighteen months have elapsed since the bookkeeping period could have teen terminated. No suggestion of the kind has been made by any Prime Minister, Treasurer, Leader of Labour Party, or, indeed, by any one in this Parliament, except a remark of the .honourable member for Flinders, some months ago, who said he thought such an interpretation was possible. I do not know that the honourable member made ' that remark very deliberately. It was, I think, an opinion that the question was open to doubt.",29
170,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,No ; I expressed a contrary opinion to that of the right honourable member.,29
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I am referring to what the honourable member for Flinders said nearly a year ago. The honourable, member, however, on 31st March last, rushed in, and took up the cudgels on behalf of the Government, and expressed a view which is adverse to my contentions and to the interests of the States; and he has the credit, as well as the responsibility, of being the first to suggest such an invasion of States rights. - Mr HARPER - There always has been a doubt' on the point.",29
172,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The honourable member for Flinders was the first I ever heard suggest a doubt.,29
173,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The doubt has always been present.,29
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Then it must have been kept very close, because I had never heard it expressed by any one before. When .1 was busy endeavouring to adjust the financial problem between the Commonwealth and the States, I never heard any suggestion of the kind made. The Commonwealth may spend the whole of the one-fourth if it chooses, but, if it does not spend or use the whole of its one-fourth, then, I think, it is clear that the balance must be returned to the States. Further, I contend that under section 87 of the Constitution, this House has no power to the credit any unexpended portion of the Commonwealth's one-fourth ""share of the net Customs and Excise revenue to a trust account, except for the purpose of paying a charge or debt actually incurred, or a liability actually existing",29
175,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Suppos e the Commonwealth enters into a contract?,29
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I will deal with that point directly. I desire to point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that we have not merely to consider what is desirable in this matter. A great many things are desirable, which it is impossible for us to obtain. If we can, constitutionally, secure the necessary funds to initiate a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, without any breach of good faith with the States, I am quite in accord with most of what the honourable member said.",29
177,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I have consulted numerous lawyers upon the matter, and most of them are positive that this Bill is constitutional, while only a few entertain the shadow of a doubt about it.",29
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"If we desire' to expend the full one-fourth share of the Customs and Excise revenue, to which we are constitutionally entitled, we are at liberty to do so. Why have we not spent it? In this connection I wish to defend the action taken by my old friend and colleague, Sir George Turner, in the early day of the Federation. Recognising that the States were then suffering under a great many difficulties, he naturally desired to return to them 'as much money as possible, so as to enable them to meet their obligations. At that period several of the States required liberal treatment financially by the Commonwealth. Queensland was suffering froma terrible drought, and Tasmania was in difficulties by reason of the falling off of Customs revenue. Even a few thousand pounds were of consequence to Tasmania in those days, whilst Western Australia required every penny that she could get to assist in developing her immense territory. I think, therefore, that when Sir George Turner did his utmost to sustain the financial position of the States during the difficult time that they were passing through, his action commanded the approval of the people of Australia. In his speech on 31st March last, the honourable member for Flinders attached very great importance to section 81. of the Constitution-so much importance, . indeed, that he appeared to almost ignore the provision contained in section 87. . He, apparently, forgot that section 81 is a general provision which is to be found in the constitutions of all British countries. It relates to the power of Parliament to appropriate money for the services of the country. It would be impossible to carry on a Constitution if Parliament had not power to appropriate revenue for the public service, subject, of course, to its constitutional powers. But I submit that the words in section 81 ""to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner, and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution,"" do not give us full power, for the power is limited by the provision contained in section 87. The honourable member for Flinders seemed to treat the power conferred under section 81, as if it were plenary, ' whereas I contend that it is limited by the words of section 87. . I submit that the - language of section 81 is general in character, and must be read subject to the specific words of section 8y, ""not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth' towards its expenditure."" I take the word ""applied"" to mean used. - continues The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, &c. I believe that the words of thrs section mean that the Commonwealth is at liberty to expend not more than one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise' revenue, and that - the balance of three-fourths-o r more-shal l be returned to the States. I come now to the words "" its expenditure"" contained in section .87. I contend that those words mean actual expenditure. They would, I think, include money due on contracts to the extent of the work actually performed. 1 believe that they would also include repayments of actual debts and such like. . If we appropriated money to pay debts incurred by the Commonwealth or in connection with contracts actually performed for the Commonwealth, it would be proper to charge it against the expenditure for the year, and it might be put aside if it had not actually been paid until the claims against it we're presented.",29
179,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Would the honourable member say that the money had been "" used "" in those circumstances?",30
180,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Yes . The work would have been done, and the money would be actually due.",30
181,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,How could it lie said to have been used when it was actually in the Treasury ?,30
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The work would have beeri performed and the money would be actually due, and consequently I hold that it would have been "" used."" At one time the practice in Western Australia, and in other States also, was to keep the Treasury accounts open for some time after the end of the financial year, for any accounts which had 'not been paid at the close of the year, to be paid and charged against the year to which they belonged.",30
183,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,If they were not paid during the month following the close of the financial year the money had to be revoted.,30
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That would depend upon the Audit Act. If the accounts were passed by a certain date the money was paid and charged up to the year's expenditure.,30
185,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,But the money did not pass away from the State Treasury. ',30
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"We have not to consider what is best for the CommonThe section wealth or State Treasuries, but solely what is right from a constitutional point of view. The words ""its expenditure"" do not in my opinion include money set aside in a trustaccount to meet prospective charges, prospective debts, and liabilities for 1 works which have not been undertaken or 'which, perhaps, have not even been decided upon. Yet that is what this Bill purports t'o do. Out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue it proposes to set aside money for the purpose of meeting prospective charges and debts and liabilities for works which may not have yet been thought of.",30
187,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,They thought of.,31
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Unde r this Bill money might be appropriated for works which may not be undertaken for years. Parliament might say that it would undertake a certain work ten years hence and appropriate money for that purpose and charge it as an expenditure for this year, keeping it back from distribution among the States.",31
189,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Why not?.,31
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Because we are prevented from doing so by section 87. of the Constitution.,31
191,Mr WYNNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,What about the bounties able member gives away the whole posiwhich have been voted?,31
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,As claims for the bounties are made annually they will be paid annually. The money will not be held in reserve to be paid some years hence.,31
193,Mr WYNNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,But it has already been appropriated.,31
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"My contention until is that appropriation is merely the authority to expend money, but that expenditure an Executive act based on that authority. The meaning of the two words quite distinct. Evidently the honourable member thinks that I do not know theOffice revenue ? difference between the words "" appropriation "" and ""expenditure.""",31
195,Mr WYNNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,But sometimes we may be allowed to think that the honourable is wrong.,31
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,How is the right honourable member going to pay f transcontinental railway?,31
197,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I see no great not. prospect of paying for it from current venue, and as this great work is necessary and urgent, I should pay for it out of funds, just as all the railways in tralia have been paid for, as well as nearly all the other great public works in New South Wales. I repeat that the ""its expenditure"" refer to bond fide and existing liabilities and not to prospective, visionarv liabilities. That is my deliberto ate belief. It seems strange that have to defend the interests of the States against the views, of the honourable member for Flinders, who sits alongside me. For some reason or - other he has been anxious to take the credit for this thing, when, as a matter of fact, it will do him a lot of harm. Mr W. H . . IRVINE - I have never said that I desire to take credit for it .",31
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The honourable have been member said on 31st March last that ""he had anticipated that there would have been some little acknowledgment for the suggestion, "" by the Government. I am really sorry that he should be open to the charge of endeavouring to deprive the States of what I consider is their just due. The honourable member for Flinders dealt with annual appropriations for the payment of sinking funds in regard to loans. My opinion is that it is within the power of the Commonwealth to pay out of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue annual payments to such funds.",31
199,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Then the honor# .tion.,31
200,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I do not think . so. If an Appropriation Act authorizes the payment annually of a sum for the repayment of a debt which has been incurred,' it can surely be paid out of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. But 1910 this Parliament is not sovereign in regard to expenditure. Its powers of is expenditure in regard to Customs and Excise revenue are limited by section 87 of is therefore the Constitution.",31
201,Mr WYNNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,What about the Post,31
202,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I am not concerned with that now-it does not affect the question, viz., the validity of the Surmember plus Revenue Bill now before us.",31
203,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The right honourable member wishes to further restrict the o r the powers of this Parliament.',31
204,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I certainly do "" I have no such desire or intention. reI merely desire that we shall keep within our bounds. I do not wish to take from loan the powers of the Commonwealth; but I Ausam equally opposed to the Commonwealth taking from, the powers of the ' States. Under section 87 of the Constitution, the words Commonwealth is not, in mv opinion, empowered to set apart, out of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, monev be placed to trust funds, to be expended I should hereafter. As I was a member of the Convention which framed the Constitution, I may fairly take credit for some knowquestion. ledge of its intentions. I am astonished ones that the Prime Minister, who was also one of the framers of the Constitution, should B lend his name and reputation to a Bill of this kind. The Treasurer, too, was a memthrough ber of the Convention. The honourable return, member for Wide Bay is continually say- - is ing, "" Let us be honest, and act as honest men."" That is what I want his party do on this occasion.",31
205,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The right honourable member accused me of using any means to an end.,32

208,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I do not available agree with the honourable member. Especiin ally in legislation affecting the States, we should make certain that we are acting within our constitutional limits. I read, for the purpose of proving my con2456tention That the Bill, even if not ultra vires, is a grave breach of faith with the would States, quotations from the speeches of some the of the most prominent members of the Concertainly, vention. Their opinions ought surely to have some weight as to what was the inamongst the States. tention of the framers of. the Constitution. The late Sir Edward Braddon, on the n March, 1898, in moving the insertion in the draft Constitution of what is now tion 87, providing for the return to States of three-fourths or more of the toms and Excise revenue- I refer honorCustoms able members to the official report of Melbourne session, page 2378-said The balance of such net revenue remaining after the application of the sums actually plied . . . . shall be distributed among States. The word "" applied"" means, in my wording opinion, ""used."" .The Treasurer was also a member of the Convention. At the time application he was sitting in Opposition in the South Wales Legislative Assembly, and, perhaps, little thought that he would ever become a Commonwealth Minister. He said-pag e 2426I have, on every occasion when I have referred to it, advocated that there should be - some definite return to the States provided for. I hailed, with very great pleasure, Sir Edward Braddon's amendment when he brought it in. It is simple and effective, and will coincide entirely with what I have advocated upon this I also think that, as regards the small States, as well as possibly the 'larger also, this is one of those clauses which will help very materially to recommend the ill . If we give up this £6,000,000 of revenue, and the States have no power of raising revenue the Customs, and no guarantee from the Federal Treasurer that they will get a there is only one alternative, and that imposing excessive direct taxation to fill up the gap; and that would prevent a great many to persons from voting for the Bill. What a "" falling off "" there is now ! He did not then appear to be so much in favour of direct taxation. . As a matter of fact, he opposed the acceptance of the draft by the people of New South Wales, being afraid of the powers conferred on the Commonwealth. Sir Edward. right, Braddon said further, page 2429No more than a certain proportion of the net and Excise revenue should be applied the purposes of the Commonwealth, while balance, which might be greater than three-fourths of the Customs revenue, would be for distribution amongst the States proportion to their contribution.",32
209,Mr WYNNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,What does that mean?,32
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"What I have will said\ it means. He continued - page For the Commonwealth expenditure there be set aside a sum not exceeding one-fourth of the Customs net revenue, . leaving balance, whatever it may be- a - balance of three-fourths, and possibly at first of more than three-fourths-to be distributed I now ask the House to listen to what Mr. t h Speaker, who was also a prominent member of the Convention, said on the subject. secAfter saying that the draft provision to the which I have referred might be held to Cusmean, that only three-fourths of the net and Excise revenue would be anthe nually returned to the States, he added - pag e 2457What I want to provide is that the whole of apthe unexpended balance shall be paid over to the the States. For that reason I should like the Drafting Committee, to adhere to the original of the clause, which was :-The balance of such net revenue remaining, after the of the sums actually applied, viz., three-fourths, or more than three-fourths, shall New be distributed among the States. This is the very point that is being put forward in this Bill-and it appears that it has not, in the opinion of some persons, been made so clear that they cannot override it.",32
211,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That wording was rejected.,32
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The Convention was ''satisfied that the words used covered that meaning. Sir Edmund Barton, the leader of the Convention, and the chief member of the Drafting Committee, in explaining what the meaning of the words used were, said-pag e 2457What we intend the amendment to mean is that the whole of the unexpended balance of the Commonwealth shall be paid over to the States. With that assurance all the members ot the Convention were satisfied, and agreed to the provision,",32
213,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Si r Edmund Barton also used the words "" shall be appropriated.""",33
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"There is nothing about appropriation being considered as expenditure, or providing that the unexpended balance of the one-fourth may be placed to a trust fund for future use and not returned to the States. There is nothing in that to suggest that an unexpended balance under section 87 would be regarded as an expenditure, on the ground that it had been appropriated, or, in other words, had been authorized to be expended, but had not Been expended. Sir Edmund Barton said that the whole of the unexpended balance would be annually paid over to the StatesT In summing up the work of the Convention of 1897-8, at page 2471 of the official report of the debates at Melbourne, Sir Edmund Barton said I will pass on to a much more important provision very lately introduced into the B i l is a provision that a fourth only of the net revenue of the Commonwealth will be allowed to be expended by the Commonwealth. That is to saythree-fourths or more of the revenue must annually come back to States whose citizens are taxed. All this goes to show that, from the beginning to the end, the intention of the Convention was that under the Braddon section the Commonwealth should annually, return to the States any unexpended balance remaining after liabilities actually in existence had been met. There is no ambiguity in these words. The honourable member for Wide Bay has reminded us that this is not a party question, and I appeal to honourable members, again quoting the honourable member, "" as honest men,"" to say what is the plain, clear, unmistakable meaning of these words. It would seem that, with some honourable members, the end justifies the means. Mr T. H . CATTS - The leader of the Labour Partv did'not say so.",33
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"He did not actually use those words, but I think that that inference might be drawn from his observations. After reading these words, uttered by prominent members of the framers of the Constitution at the Convention of which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were members, I appeal to honourable members not to support this proposal on the part of the Government. Is it likely that, but for the proposal of the Government to take advantage of this measure to assist in bringing into operation a scheme of old-age pensions, we should have found the Labour 'Party, consisting of twenty-six members, prepared to support this Bill, irrespective of the interests of the States ? I am just as strong a supporter of old-age pensions as is any member of the Labour Party, and but'for my vote and the votes of members from Western Australia who supported me, the power to deal with old-age pensions would not have been in the Constitution; but I urge that the fact that it is proposed to finance a Federal system under this Bill cannot override constitutional considerations, or the honourable understanding made with the States before Federation. That a majority in this House appears to be opposed to the views I have urged, and seem to. me to be willing to do what I consider is a grave injustice to the States,_ will not cause me to waver in my determination to perform what I believe to be my duty, a duty that I owe to my own State and to the people of Australia generally. I owe, too, a duty to the Conl . That stitution which I took part in framing, and I am not going to subscribe, without the strongest protest, to an interpretation of that Constitution which, I am sure, the Convention did not intend to be placed upon it, and which I do not think is legal.",33
216,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"In quoting thespeech made by Sir Edmund Barton, the honourable member omitted a few words which, so to speak, "" upset his applecart.""",33
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I do not think that statement can be accurate, but, if I have said or quoted anything that can be controverted, the honourable member mav do it.",33
218,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"He drew a distinction between appropriated moneys and expended moneys. Sir JOHN'FORREST - Then the honourable member would have me believe, which I am not prepared to do, that on two different occasions Sir Edmund Barton expressed conflicting views. I have endeavoured to place before the House all those .portions of his speeches which appear to me to have a bearing on this question. I am surprised at the attitude of the Government and of the Labour Party, which is always boasting of its desire to do justice. Where are the defenders and protectors of the rights of the States on the Government side of the House? One would imagine from the attitude of honourable members on the Government side of the House, and especially in the Labour corner, that they had not been returned by the people of the States of Australia; that they were here, not to represent the States who have sent them here to look after their constitutional rights and interests, but that these matters were of secondary importance to the passing of some warlike or beneficent measure.",33
219,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,For which the people cislc.,34
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The Labour Party seem to think more of such measures than of the constitutional rights and interests of the States which send them here to protect and represent them.,34
221,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,We are looking after the whole of the people of Australia.,34
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Are . honourable members having any regard for the people of the States in voting for this Bil l ?,34
223,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Are not the people of the States identical with the people of the Commonwealth ?,34
224,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I have not said that they are not. The Labour Party, in this 'House more particularly, seem to ignore or forget the promise to, and the honourable understanding made with, the people of the States during the Federal campaign. They seem, also, willing to overlook in this case the provisions of the Constitution for the protection of the revenue the States, and, apparently, are never better pleased than when they are able to do something which will place the Treasurers of the States in financial difficulties.",34
225,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The right honourable member is merely making a whip for himself.,34
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Honourable members of the Labour Party seem to forget the great duties and obligations resting upon the Parliaments of the States. They have responsibilities which affect as closely, if not more so, the material welfare of this country than .do those of the Commonwealth Parliament. The nurturing and education of the future men and women of Australia is intrusted to them. The opening up of the country by means of railways, roads, bridges, and water supply schemes, and also the immense work of subduing the wilderness and making the land available for occupation and settlement rests with' them. They are intrusted with the maintenance of law. and order, and with promoting and assisting production from the soil all over this great continent. Remembering all these great duties and obligations, we ought surely to have some sympathy with them in the gigantic work they have intrusted to them.. But we find on the Government side of this House very little sympathy for the States, if we may judge, by this and other measures. The Treasurer seems to have no regard for the obligations resting upon the States, and the demands made upon their revenue. H is sole desire seems to be to try to please honourable members of the Labour Party. He will never please them; he will never satisfy them until he signs their pledge,, and joins their ranks. I wish that he would do so, for he is, to all intents and purposes, a member of that party. He is returned by the Labour Party, and kept in office by them.",34
227,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,We kept the. right honourable member in office for five years.,34
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That is not so from my point of view.,34
229,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,We did. The honourable member is most ungrateful.,34
230,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I do not feel that I owe the honourable member anything, and have no desire to be in his debt.",34
231,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Order . The honourable member is entirelv out of order. - Sir JOHN FORREST - The honourable member for West Sydney is"" offensive.",34
232,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I ask the honourable of member for West Sydney not io interject so frequently.,34
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"And so offensively. ' Mir. SPEAKER - Order . I did not hear the honourable member for West Sydney make an offensive interjection. Had I done so, 1 sliould have called upon him to withdraw it . At the same time, I would remind the right honourable member for Swan that he sometimes interjects when other honourable members are speaking, and that, therefore, he should make some allowance for interjections by others.",34
234,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I think, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member provoked the interjections by his unwarranted aspersions upon a number of members of the party with which I am associated. - Mr SPEAKER - What does the honourable member desire to speak upon?",34
235,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I withdraw everything.,35
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"So do I . The obligations and duties devolving upon the States are so great that it is dimcult for them to make ends meet. They could, with advantage to Australia, spend millions more than they have at their command. Even if our revenue this year will be £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of that of last vear, I fail to see why we should take from the States £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 of that total, unless we have expended it . The people of the States are clamouring for new services to open up the country and settle people on the land, and I utterly fail to understand why this Bil l should have been introduced at the present stage. the Government might keep faith with the States until 1910, and until then, at all events, return to them any unexpended balance of the one-fourth under section 87 at the end of each year, as in my opinion is the legal as well as moral interpretation of section 87. Apart altogether from any question of law, I do not think that it can be denied that this proposal is utterly wrong, and that it will be considered by the States to be a grave breach of faith. We have great power in regard to expenditure and taxation, and', if we wish to finance any scheme designed to benefit the people, we can surely find some way of doing so without trying to drive a coach-and-four through the Constitution for the purpose of depleting the revenues of the States. The course that we - are asked to take cannot, I think, be justified. Even if it is legal, it is inexpedient, and reflects discredit upon its advocates. It is wrong that we should even try at this stage to take away from the States, who have not sufficient to provide for their present requirements, a large sum to which they are entitled. In Western Australia we have to build railways out of loan moneys, the revenue being insufficient to meet such - demands. There are hundreds of miles of railways awaiting construction, and monev has. to be borrowed for that work. I - am not here to mince words, neither do I wish to be discourteous fo anv honourable member, but, as I have said before, the power of the Labour caucus is so strong that its wishes must be complied with, even if it interferes with compliance on the part of honourable members, - with the interests of their constituents. If it were not an ironbound organization, should we find every member of it in agreement with respect to^ such a measure as this ? They do not seem to care for the Constitution. They have in view the providing of funds for a scheme which members on this side of the House are ready to help them to secure if they will take a proper course, and every other consideration has to be ignored.",35
237,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I rise to a point . of order. Is the right honourable member in order in saying that no member of the Labour Party takes any heed of the Constitution, and that there is an agreement between members of the Labour Party, which overrides their allegiance to the Constitution, and the oath which they have taken as members of this House?",35
238,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"If the right honourable member for Swan spoke of any honSurely orable member of this House as being false to his oath, he certainly must withdraw the remark.

SURPLUS REVENUEBILL . Debate resumed",35
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"When the House adjouined for lunch, I had almost arrived at the end of what I desire to say, but, before - I sit down, I should like to recapitulate in a few words my contentions. I contend that, under section 87 of the Constitution, this House has no power to place any unspent or unused portion of its one-fourth of the revenue to a trust account, except for the purpose of paying a .charge or - debt actually incurred, or a liability actually ex-'sting. I contend also that the words "" its expenditure ' ' ih section 87 mean actual expenditure, and might, I think, include money due on contracts to the extent of work actually performed, and also the repayment of actual debts and such like. But I have contended-and I contend now-that the words "" it s expenditure"" do not include moneys set aside in a trust account to meet, prospective charges, debts, or prospective liabilities for works not vet incurred, or not yet decided upon. In fact, my contention is that the words "" it s expenditure"" mean bond fide and existing, and not prospective dr visionary liabilities which"" may never come forward for payment. I contend also that, apart from the constitutionality of the measure, it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith, and is a departure from a clear and honourable understanding made before Federation with the States. In the course of this debate it has been said in so many words that if this Bill is illegal, it cannot do any harm, because it may be set aside by the High Court. That, I think, is a most vicious principle-if I may use so hard a word-to introduce, legislation which affects the Staffs so vitally and so directly. I that this sort of idea should have entered the minds of honourable members. Surely that is not the spirit in which> during these early days of Federation, and during the continuance of the Braddon section, we should enter on legislation which affects the States. Why should the Government' desire, or even think of, introducing legislation which I have no doubt they will admit, is, on the face of it, of -- doubtful validity ?",36
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,No .,36
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The Treasurer says, "" No "" ; but T think that there laymen quite as capable as himself, and a great many lawyers, who could be found to say that there is a great deal of doubt as to the validity of this measure. I suppose that later on we may be addressed by some legal members, and we shall then see whether there is or is not any doubt in their minds as to its validity. I think few will venture to say that there is no doubt whatever.",36
243,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,No one can - state more than his own opinion.,36
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"But there are some things so evident that we may almost stake our existence on them. At any rate, I do not think the honourable member for Flinders will say there is no element of doubt as to the interpretation which may be placed on this Bill by the High Court. My point is that it must be admitted that there is an element of doubt in this matter-thoug h I have no doubt myselfand if that is so, then especially when we are dealing with friendly States, composed prospective of our own people, we should not try to strain our powers to the uttermost. For a long time. I have had strong complaint to make in regard to this straining of the Federal powers. The desire of the Government seems to me to strain them so much that there are often questions raised before the High Court as to the validity of our Acts.",36
245,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The right honourable member will admit that, so far, only one Act has been declared invalid.",36
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"But the other Acts were "" pretty close to the wind, "" and if the Government have been fortunate in most of the cases, there has ever been an element of doubt. Personally, I have been in accord with some of the Acts especially into called in question; but I certainly am not in favour of the Bill before us, and of regret some other measures which the Government have tried to pass. "" I commiserate the Government a little, because I will not assume that they very much relish the course they have pursued. Unfortunately the state of parties in this House has forced the Government to introduce these Bills, or go out of office.",36
247,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That is not the issue.,36
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"But it is, I regret to say, a fairly accurate statement. I am sure that the members of the Government expect honourable members to take an are independent course, and say what they think, of course, as politely as possible. Mr J. H - CATTS - The honourable member would like to be back amongst the "" flesh pots.""",36
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I have no such desire. I would not be under the thumb of the honourable member and his party again on any terms; the honourable member may take my word for that. The honourable member may be content t'o do as he is told, and be kicked about from pillar to post by outside bodies and unions, but I am not.",37
250,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,It suited the honourable member very well when he was in the Government.,37
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Yes , I have no fault to find with the personal treatment I received from the honourable member who interjects, and indeed from the majority of honourable members who sit with him.",37
252,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"They did not treat the right honourable member badly, and I see no reason why he should not come back again.",37
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I appreciate the honourable member's kindly feeling towards me, as shown by that observation. In conclusion, T ask again why we should strain the Constitution to its utmost limits when the result must be to injure the States. I appeal to the Government to think of the great obligations and duties which are cast on the States in the opening up and development of the country, the placing of people on the land, and in promoting the general production and progress of this great continent, and there is to be any straining of the Constitu-tion, to let it be in the direction of helping the States. I have tried to do only - what I consider to be my duty in upholdr ing what I know, from my own personal knowledge, was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. I am firmly of the opinion that this Bill is contrary to the Constitution, and is, moreover, a grave breach of that honourable understanding which was arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth' at the Melbourne Convention of 1898, prior to Federation.",37
254,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General)' [2.28] - No one will complain of the right honourable member for Swan for exercising his independent judgment in accordance with what he believes to be his duty as a member of this Parliament, and as one who had something to do with the passing of the Constitution. Although I concede that much, I must admit to a feeling of deep regret that the right honourable member should even suggest that this Bill is in any way a breach of faith or a violation of the spirit of the Constitution. The feeling of the House all through has been to pay the greatest regard to the rights and duties of the States; in fact, a great deal of our trouble has arisen from a sincere desire on the part of the Treasurer and honourable members to iri.no wise embarrass the States in the early stages of Federation. We' realized that during the early life of the Constitution there were certain limitations which were intended as a direction to this Parliament; and during the first five-year period, when we were realizing what our finances were, and what the effect of Federation might be on the States, it was felt that we should stay our hands and "" go slow."" Possibly we have erred in going too slowly, and' in failing to realise that the people of Australia created the Commonwealth Parliament as a national Parliament, and vested it with national powers, to be exercised for their good. The general attitude of this Parliament has been, and still is, one of sympathy with the States. Another impression that the honourable member left upon the minds of his hearers was that the Commonwealth and States are entirely separate entities, apart from the people. I think that the electors' view of the matter will be: ""We have established two sets of agents-Federa l and State. We have given them separate powers, the first if set to act for us in Federal matters, and the second to act for us in State matters.",37
255,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I have never disputed that.,37
256,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"But the right honourable member talked about the Commonwealth and the States as if the Commonwealth were something external to the people, when, as a matter of fact, both are one and the same people. His argument practically is that we should hand over to the States all the money that we can, and thus cripple"" the Commonwealth. To do so means that we shall be obliged to levy heavy imposts upon the people if we intend to fulfil our national functions. In all our financial proposals with the States we should so arrange our affairs that neither will be obliged to impose unnecessary burdens on the taxpayers. What we want tb realise is that both the Commonwealth and the States derive their authority from the same persons. The honourable member put his position very clearly, and, from that standpoint, he is to be congratulated. He contended, first, that this Bill is unconstitutional; secondly, that it is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution",37
257,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Contrary ' to honourable understanding which was, arrived at.",38
258,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"He also urges that to depart from that honourable understanding would be tantamount to a breach of faith. I will deal with his points seriatim. His claim that the Bill .is unconstitutional is based upon - his contention that it violates section 87 of the Constitution. He urges that the meaning of that section is that the monev which the Commonwealth does not actually expend in one year, or which is not set aside to meet an existing debt or liability, or to cover - payments in connection with contracts to the extent to which they have , been fulfilled, must be returned to the States. The section in question readsDuring a period of ten years after the estab- national functions.' lishment of the - Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth - from duties of Customs and of Excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.",38
259,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,There might only a small part of it required.,38
260,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"-The Commonwealth is, therefore, entitled to apply "" towards "" its expenditure one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise duties.",38
261,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Has not that section to be read in conjunction with another?,38
262,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I shall deal with that point presently. The section does not read ""shall not expend,"" but in effect "" s h all not apply."" What is the meaning of the word "" apply,"" when used in connection with financial sections?",38
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It means "" used,"" I think.",38
264,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"No . Section 81 of the Constitution deals with general appropriations. It readsAU revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund be' appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the, charges and liabilities imposed by this tution,",38
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That ' provision is contained in every Constitution.,38
266,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It contains no limitation .as to the power of appropriation. It does not even sa.y that an appropriation shall be for the specific objects set out in section 51 of the Constitution. In - connection with a similar section contained in the United States Constitution, Story sum- the marized the. arguments in favour of the wider interpretation as follows : The argument in favour of the power is derived, in the first place, from the language of the clause conferring the power, secondly from the nature of the power which renders it in the highest degree expedient, if not in dispensable, for the due operations of the' national government; thirdly from the early, constant and decided maintenance of it by the Government and its functionaries, as well as by many of the ablest statesmen of the United States from the very commencement of the Constitution. Section 81 of our Constitution must, therefore, be interpreted in the widest possible way. It must necessarily be so interpreted when it is remembered that we have to deal with national institutions, and that without revenue we cannot discharge our The Commonwealth has been endowed with great powers and t the power of appropriation must be proportionate to the other powers conferred Upon it . The right honourable member for Swan. contends that the power of approbe priation is limited by section 87, which he argues provides that all money not actually expended by the Commonwealth during the financial year must be returned to the' States. He bases his argument uoon the use of the word "" apply."" But I would point out . that that word, is always used in connection with appropriations, and that it really means "" appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth."" It is now an ordinary practice in the High Court in interpreting the Constitution to contend that we must look at Statutes enacted by the Imperial Parliament, with the view to giving to similar words in our ownConstitution a similar meaning. Now if we look at Act 63 and 64 V i c , we shall find that it reads: "" An Act to apply a sum out of the Consolidated Revenue """,38
267,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The word "" used"" to means the same thing as "" a p p l y .""",38
268,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"No . It has a very Constidifferent meaning. The Act reads: "" An Act to apply a sum out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the service of the year ending on the. thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred^, and to appropriate the Supplies,"" &c. That is the way the Imperial Parliament uses the word "" apply."" Sir John FORREST - What does the Attorney-General say that it means?",38
269,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"It means "" set aside for - the purposes of the Commonwealth ''-as was pointed out in the Convention by the late Sir Edward Braddon.",39
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Does the give that meaning?,39
271,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"To ascertain the meaning of words, we mav look to Statutes. The first Act passed by. this Parliament was "" An Act to grant and apply '' a certain sum out of the Consolidated Revenue. Consequently the words .ot section 87 mean that not more than one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise duties shall.be applied and appropriated annually towards the services of the Commonwealth. Otherwise why is the word "" towards "" used in that section? If the word ""applied"" means ""used "" as the honourable member contends, the section would read : '' Not more than one-fourth shall be used annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.""",39
272,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Appropriatio n does not mean expenditure.,39
273,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Sectio n 87 allows the Commonwealth to appropriate or set - aside "" towards "" its expenditure one-fourth of the net revenue derived each year from Customs and Excise duties.",39
274,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Whether we pend it or not?,39
275,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Yes .,39
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"That is. the whole point at issue. - Mr GROOM - The Constitution addsThe balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States' taken over by the Commonwealth. The honourable member places implicit reliance upon the wording of that section. But I submit that his contention cannot be maintained in view of what I have already said. His next point is that we must look at the spirit of the agreement made between the several States. In this connection, he has quoted the opinions of members of the Federal Convention. But in every one of those utterances, I would, 1 point out that the word ""apply "" is used, and in moving an amendment to this very - provision, which was finally, adopted, the late Sir Edward Braddon, who seemed to thoroughly understand the meaning of the word, said It would be preferable that, for the Commonwealth expenditure, there should be set aside not exceeding one-fourth of the Customs' net revenue, leaving the balance, whatever it might be- a balance certainly of three-fourths, and possibly, at first, of more than three-fourthsto be distributed amongst the States.",39
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Fro m what page of the 'Federal Convention debates is the dictionary Attorney-General quoting ?,39
278,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Fro m page 2456. 1 would, point out that it is not safe to rely upon isolated passages from speeches in the Convention for an interpretation of the Constitution. Then Sir Edmund Barton, on page 2457, is reported to have said If my honourable friend will refer back,, he will see that not more than one-fourth shall be appropriated by_ the Commonwealth. ' He used the word ""appropriated"" there in a'technical sense,'so that what he meant was that any unappropriated balance .should be returnable to the .States. The right honourable member for Swan quoted' Sir Edmund Barton as saying- What we intend the amendment to mean is that the whole of the unexpended balance of the Commonwealth shall be paid over to the States. But, later on, Sir Edmund Barton explained what he meant by unexpended balance. Let me read the whole passage",39
279,Mr HOLDER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"What I want to provide is ex- that the whole of the unexpended balance shall be paid over to the States. For thtt reason I should like the Drafting Committee to adhere to the original wording of the clause. ,",39
280,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,What we intend the amendment to mean is that the whole of the unexpended balance of the Commonwealth shall be paid over to the States.,39
281,Mr HOLDER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I understand it to mean the balance of the revenue collected, less one-fourth.",39
282,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"If my honourable friend will .refer back he will see that not more than one-fourth shall be appropriated by the Commonwealth. If less than one-fourth is appropriated, the unexpended balance, which may be more than three-fourths, will go back to the States. The whole context must be considered in arriving at an opinion.",39
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That passage supports my argument.,39
284,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Every honourable member must form his own conclusions; but 1 think that the reasonable construction is that not - more than one-fourth shall be appropriated, and that the word ""applied"" means "" set aside."" You appropriate to meet expenditure.",39
285,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Expenditur e follows appropriation.,40

287,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Prospectiv e or immediate. .,40
288,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Yes . What is lawful expenditure depends on section 81. Constitution provides for three financial periods, the first being that created by section 89, to last until the imposition of uniform duties of Customs and Excise. Section 93 creates a second period, to last for at least five vears after the imposition of uniform duties, the. section continuing, with certain modifications, the provisions of section 89. The third period is created by section 94, which saysAfter five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.",40
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,That was framed at a time when the' Braddon provision was. perpetual.,40
290,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I am dealing with the Constitution as it .is. The Braddon provision saysthat the balance shall bepaid in accordance with the Constitution, which must be read as a whole, to arrive at its meaning.",40
291,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The Government has alreadv established trust-funds. Was that constitutional or unconstituround tional ?,40
292,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I hold, that what , has been done can be justified. The technical system of bookkeeping provided for connection with the first and second finantake opposite sides. cial periods, continues until the Parliament otherwise provides, which we propose to do now. The object of the Bill is to legissure late under section 94, and to supersede the provisions of section 93, leaving liament free to deal with surpluses.",40
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,We cannot interfere with section 87.,40
294,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"What is being done is subject to - the provisions of section 87. Sections 89 and 93 appropriate balances to the States; and although the Bill repeals section 93, the balances remaining over and above the Commonwealth requirements, will ' still be so appropriated ; but by virtue of this Bill , it may be contended that the word ""expenditure"" as used in section 93, has a'restricted meaning, But if it be construed strictly to mean the actual expenditure and payment of money, the Constitution would be unworkable, because it is impossible to make up aetual balances. every month all over Australia, and pay them to the States. . Therefore, it is obvious that-the word has a wider meaning. In my opinion, it is intended to cover debts or obligations due, or to The become due. Had the Commonwealth taken over the debts of the States, with a liability for interest of £ 8 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, it would have had the power to retain the' money necessary to meet the obligation out of general revenue. Whether the word "" expenditure ' ' can be applied to general appropriation for the purposes of the Commonwealth is questioned, ancl this Bil l will remove that doubt. "" Surplus"" .is distinct from "" balance,"" and means moneys in hand over and above the sums appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. Underthe Constitution we have clearly the power to pass this Bill , and it is necessary to pass provision it to enable us to carry on the great work intrusted to us. The Constitution having endowed us with national powers, they carry with them the right to appropriate moneys, without which such endowment would be futile.",40
295,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"North Sydney) [2.57] - Excep t for part of the speech of the right honourable member for Swan, the argument, so far, has centred, the constitutionality of this measure.

It is really a Bill to legalize a further appropriation for future purposes. for There has been much dispute .as to the meaning of the words "" used "" and ""applied.'' Judging by the Treasurer's forecast, it seems to me that we shall have to take into account the meaning, not merely of these words, but of the word "" take."" It would seem from the Treasurer's statement of his intentions that it is a case, not of using or even of applying money, but of taking money.",41
317,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,He said distinctly that it was to provide for specific purposes uncler the Constitution.,42

320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"I desired an assurance'in that regard, for the power given by the Bill is a very wide one. I do not object to the establishment of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions. On the contrary, I have always approved of old-age pensions being uncler the control of the Commonwealth. I supported the system as a State undertaking in preFederation days, and with the establishment of the Commonwealth I considered that such a scheme should be taken over by the Federal authority. But if the Ministry pass an Old-age Pensions Bill, it will annually absorb far more than any surplus Customs revenue we are likely to have. That is another reason why this Bill seems to me to be unnecessary.",42
321,Mr CARR,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Is it not necessary to provide for an accumulation?,42
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"The Minister now takes power to accumulate, or to hold oyer, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, considerable sums in a trust account. Then it has been claimed that this Bill will only absorb the actual surplus, and as regards that surplus it is said that we have been returning to the States every year, on an average, £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the proportion of revenue to which they are actually entitled. We have not teen doing anything of the sort. A considerable portion of that amount, Tanging from £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 , really represents interest on the value of the transferred properties which we have not yet paid to the States. They certainly have not lost anything in that regard, because the surplus moneys which we have returned to them have been far in excess of the interest actually due in respect of those properties. But we have no right to take credit to ourselves for having returned to the States, on the average, £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year in excess of what we were required to do, when, in reality, we have handed back to them only about one-half of that amount. The other day, the Treasurer, when foreshadowing the requirements of the Commonwealth, indicated that, even during this year of boom revenue, he anticipated a surplus of only £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 odd. He did not make it clear whether or not we should have that surplus after appropriating £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for naval defence purposes. In that case, we should have a surplus of only £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, in the other, a surplus of something over £400,000* In reality, we shall have little or no surplus. As the Prime Minister told us today, the valuation of the transferred properties is practically complete, and immediately it has been settled, interest upon them will become payable by us. We become the trustees, though not the owners, of the properties; and we have to provide the interest out of our one-fourth of the revenue, thus absorbing the surplus of this boom year. The Minister foreshadowed that, in the immediate future, he did not anticipate so large a revenue, and that he expected still larger demands, apart altogether from old-age pensions. I really do not know whalTTesult is to be attained, at any rate this year, by"" means of this Bill. It would have been much better not to have introduced this measure, but to have brought down an Old-age Pensions Bill , which would, in itself, absorb all the surplus, and mors. Of course that might necessitate a financial arrangement with two or three of th* States, who would be asked to give ati equivalent contribution in consideration ot their being eased of the obligation to pay pensions. In any case, however, all"" th<; surplus would be more than absorbed by old-age pensions; and I see no necessity whatever for measures of the sort now before us. Such a Bill has not been found necessary hitherto. We are supposed to be intending to take only a portion of the surplus, and when'we ask where the surplus is, we find that it does not exist. - The Treasurer will admit that the . payment of interest, which will shortly begin on the transferred properties, will practicallv absorb all that is anticipated as surplus. Another matter of regret is that in this measure the system of bookkeeping is continued. This is most unfortunate, in view of the fact that one of the strongest reasons for Federation was that it would get rid of the obstacles and difficulties in the way of trade between the various States. The desire was to have free borders and free coasts as between State and State, so that, among other things, the trouble and expense of passing complicated entries for goods might be done away with, and a free exchange substituted, such ss there ought to be in what is one country.",42
323,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,The honourable member must admit that any change would cause dislocation to some extent.,43
324,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"VV e have only to make an arrangement in accordance with our experience since Federation. What was the bookkeeping period provided for ? One of the objects of Federation was to make the welhto-do States assist the less well-to-do States; but it was found that a burden might be placed on the weaker States unless there was a guide as to the duties paid on goods actually consumed in each State. Thereupon the clumsy, awkward, but, I must admit, for the time necessary, system of Inter-State bookkeeping was established. Now, however, we are at the end of the five years, and, with the experience gained, we know what would be a fair' adjustment between the States. As a matter of fact, there has already been an adjustment between New South 'Wales and Victoria, and, that being so, it ought to be possible for the Commonwealth to devise a scheme fair to all the other States. Yet, here it is proposed to contmue the present troublesome and inaccurate system.",43
325,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,It is not so much a matter for the big States as for the smaller States of Tasmania and Queensland.,43

328,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,Then it would appear that the present system must go on for ever.,43
329,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,I quite agree with the honourable member as to the undesirableness of the system.,43
330,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"As a matter of fact, the present system is more troublesome and difficult than - the preFederation system of oollecting duties, inasmuch as now an analysis has to be made of, say, a coat; it has to be ascertained whence the buttons, the thread, and the cloth have come. Indeed, the system is only made possible by evasionto use an Irishism, it is only possible.because it is. not observed. It is impossible for me to believe that the firms who handle these goods make the complete analyses which are called for under the bookkeeping section; and the work can be done only in such a rough manner"" as to make it quite inaccurate. I feel sure that a settlement could become to which would pav every consideration to the smaller States, and thus there would be removed a system which is a blot on our Federation. I did hope that when Ministers were dealing with the question, they would abolish the bookkeeping; but, on the contrary, we find it deliberately continued by means of this measure. There are no issues at stake that could not be easily met, and it is most .desirable that we should, in every respect, feel that we are one people. It ought to be possible to send goods from Melbourne to Perth or elsewhere, with just as much ease as from Melbourne to Warrnambool.",43

Reading one portion of the Constitution would lead me to belieA'e that it is constitutional, Avhile another portion of the Constitution leads me to a contrary A'iew; and, in my opinion, only the High Court can settle the question. If our application of moneys to trust funds in the past was constitutional, then the Bill is not required; and, on the otherhand, if it was unconstitutional, the passing of this B i ll will not alter the situation.",43
333,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH TRANSFERR ED,"Robertson) [3.26] - I listened with interest to the speech of the right honourable member for Swan, who seemed \'ery impatient because honourable members did not agree Will all he hacl to say. The right honourable member, in taking the view that the Bill is unconstitutional, said that he felt a burden of responsibility resting upon him, OAving to the fact that he was a member of_the Federal Convention. I suppose that for a period after the inauguration of Federation there was a good deal of responsibility on those Avho had been members of the Convention; but that responsibility, . I think, ended when Parliament appointed a High this Court to interpret the Constitution. Under the circumstances, the right honourable ber for Swan has no more responsibility this connection than has any other honourable member, and a great deal of his eloquence, and the resentment he showed towards orable members who ventured to interject, was meaningless. If the Bill is vires the High Court will say so,' and to me the question seems one of instance, policy rather than one of constitutionality. Much of the legislation to which the right honourable member was a party has been versed, and, so far as we have a forecast, the High Court will be against another Act <gusta railway. which-the right honourable' member assisted in passing. The passing of this and lar Bills will make it so much less possible for the States to carry on the services they have at present under their control, and, in this way, the object of Federation will be accomplished, inasmuch as the Comdepth. monwealth will be asked to take over these services. The States will then have less Commonwealth. to do, be less important and less arrogant, and more easy to live with than is the at present. There is what is called for States rights, but in reality these not rights.

The Treasurer estimates that the revenue derived from Customs and Excise this will exceed that of last year by £2,000,000. Should his estimate prove correct, the monwealth will thus receive £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 than it received last year. But that sum pointed. will prove altogether insufficient to enable - the Government to give effect to the policy, foreshadowed by them, even if they were a fund? able' to credit the whole of it to a trust account. But I contend that .any credited. to such a . fund ought tn be regarded as a set off to the amount due the States as interest upon the transferred properties.

May I point object. out that such a system cannot be insuch a scheme by passing this Bill . augurated consequent upon the passing of Bill , except in the very distant future. A sum of £1,500,00 0 is required to cover memthe cost of a Federal scheme of old-age in pensions, and long before that amount has been accumulated, other demands ' will have been made' upon the trust fund-de honmands - which must be met promptly. There are' Acts upon our statute-book which will ultra make heavy demands upon the'money which it is proposed to credit to that fund.

Whilst I do not feel disposed to oppose the amendment, I should prefer to see the Bill rejected. I do not think it is expedient to establish . the trust fund that is proposed. If we do so, the States will probably test its validity in the High Court, and in any case, we are merely meeting trouble half way. If we want to initiate a special. scheme of old-age pen- sions, let us impose direct taxation for that purpose. Certainly, we cannot provide the necessary money by passing this Bill. The under ' Attorney-General has spoken upon the question of the constitutionality of this Bill. To my mind, it is a matter of little quence whether he is right or wrong in contention, inasmuchas' the measure will be inoperative for the - old-age pension scheme. And, moreover, if the Bill is stitutional, the Constitution Act al gives the powers that are asked for this measure. If we place it upon statute-book, its constitutionality will bably be challenged by the States which will resent the creation of a trust fund. The only justification for the creation any such fund would be an intention - relieve the States of some of the services which they at present administer. In.the end, I believe that the finances will adjust themselves. * Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo)'[3.45] I do.not propose, at this hour of the day, to occupy much time in discussing sure. The case for both sides has been strongly and fairly put. The right hon the orable member for Swan raised the point that the Bill is unconstitutional,, while the Attorney-General has contended for its constitutionality. Although the right honourable member for Swan said that he did not speak as a lawyer, he argued with considerable skill and ability, evidently understanding his subject thoroughly, because he was able to handle it as well as a great lawyer could have done. Undoubtedly in this he was assisted by his long experience as a Minister of the Crown, in the State of - Western Australia and in the Commonwealth. For five or six years he amendment helped to administer the sections of the Constitution with which he dealt, and, no 5 doubt, understands their inner, as well as their apparent, significance. But for the views in opposition to his put forward by some of my legal friends, I should entertain no doubt as to the soundness of his contention. Indeed, I think that, so far, he has had the better of the argument. He has created so much doubt as to ""justify the belief that the question will never be settled except by the High Court. But the right of the States or of the Commonwealth cannot be prejudiced whether the Bill is passed or not, because both are secured by the Constitution. The measure cannot be considered as one to interpret the Constitution; it is rather declaratory. Paragraph d of clause 4 provides that - 1 All payments to Trust Accounts, established the Audit Acts 1901-1906, of moneys appropriated by law for any purpose of the ""Commonwealth shall be deemed to be expenditure. conseThe question arises whether a saving or his setting aside of money-the placing of it to a trust account-is an expenditure. We are asked to declare that it is. I support con- .the view put forward by the right honorreadyable member for Swan, that under section in 87 of the Constitution the Commonwealth the can apply only one-fourth of Customs and proExcise annually towards its expenditure. Does "" applied annually "" mean "" used "" or ""spent annually?"" After hearing the of arguments which have been put forward, to I think that it does. Money not used or spent annually must be returned to the States. There is a manifest distinction in the Constitution between ""applying"" revenue or money and "" appropriating "" it. Section 81 provides for. appropriating the revenue of the Commonwealth, that being the first section in which the word is used. the meaSection 82 enacts thatThe costs, charges, and expenses incident to collection, management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the first charge thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall, in the first instance, be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth. The terms . "" appropriating "" and ."" applying"" are not synonymous, but have different meanings, and should receive difto ferent significations. Section 87 says not more than one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue shall be applied anto nually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure, and, although it is dangerous leges. to dogmatize on constitutional questions, my view is that what is meant is "" used annually "" or "" spent annually."" Money that is not used or spent within the must be paid to the States. That was intention of the framers of the Constituof tion. Passages have been quoted the reports of the debates of the tion, which show that it was understood ment. that the whole of the unexpended balances would be. returned to the States, and that interpretation has been placed on the stitution from the beginning. It has been the practice of the Treasury to return the States all unexpended balances, and see no reason why that practice should be altered; indeed, I think that it cannot legally altered, ancl that the declaration that payments to a trust fund shall be deemed expenditure will be null ancl void. It is a contradiction of terms to say that appropriations shall be expenditure. The word "" a p p l i e d "" occurs for the in the meantime. second time in the Constitution in the second paragraph of section 87. In that connection it undoubtedly means paid. "" Applied towards the payment of init terest "" means paid towards the interest --spen t in the payment of the interest. It does not mean ""appropriated,"" be-, becomes effective and operative. cause there is a previous appropriation. Personally, but for this obstacle in the ceased to operate. Constitution, I should be quite willingt'o vote for the Bill. As a matter of venience, it would be a most desirable thing to do, if we had the power to the unexpended balance, andpay if into a Trust Account-to hoard it up for big Federal enterprises. But I have to sider what are the rights of the States well as of the Commonwealth. I am not that prepared in any way to abridge the undoubted constitutional and legal rights the States. I do not believe that States will tamely acquiesce in any invaprinciples sion of those rights. If they do acquiesce in this Bill , it will stand. If they"" [4T7] not, they can bring an action against the Federal Treasurer to recover the unexpended balance.",45

WILLIAM LYNE - What happened was this: The end of the month of May has not yet arrived. It has been usual, when the end of the month falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, to pay on the Friday. The Acting Under-Treasurer - telegraphed to the' States on this occasion giving reasons why the balances were not to be paid to the States today. The reason was this-that it was hoped that the Surplus Revenue Bill would be passed! The Bill ought to have been through. I hope that it will be through before the end of next month. There is no intention, nor was there ever any intention, to create a breach of the Constitution.",48
362,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,Will the Treasurer countermand the instruction?,48
363,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"As the Surplus Revenue Bill has not yet become law, the money will be paid to the States in the usual' way-the three-fourths, at any rate.",48
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"Oh , no. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - As far as the Constitution requires, the money will be paid. But I am not going to say any more about the matter.",48
365,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,Flinders) [4.9] The explanation which the Treasurer has given iis has created very grave doubts 1 ',48
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,It ought not to so. I have said that whatever the Constitution requires will be done.,48
367,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"As I understand, the telegram which the right honourable member for Swan read stated that the instructions given were that neither this month's balance nor the succeeding month'? balance were to be paid. The question which I wish to ask. is this-is it the serious intention of the Government, or of . Treasurer, before the Surplus is passed, to deprive the States not merely of what may be the surplus [417]- 2 ing month, but to deprive them of an amount equal to all the surpluses that they have had during-the preceding months of this financial year? Because, if that be so, I venture to think that that state of affairs will put a totally different complexion upon the whole proceeding, from that which has been, put upon the policy of the Government by this House. It will mean making the Surplus Revenue Bill retrospective in the very worse sense, by taking back from . , the States, in effect, what has been paid over to them, and depriving them absolutely-if that view be right-of the provision which the Constitution has made for them for the remaining month bf this year. I cannot believe that that is the real meaning:",48
368,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,It is merely in the honourable member's imagination.,48
369,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"It is not merely my imagination, because",48
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,But it is.,48
371,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"Because the Premier of Western Australia, in the telegram sent to the right honourable member for Swan, if I caught its purport aright, says that the instructions of «the Treasurer were",48
372,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"The language is, "" nor any other-month.""",48
373,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"So that the instructions apply to "" any othei month.""",48
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"There is no need for excitement. If necessary, the officers will get fresh instructions.",48
375,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"It seems pretty clear, that what I have stated is the fact. It means this-that during the past ten months of this financial year, the Treasurer's view' is that we have been paying too much to the States, and that we are now going to take money back from the States. If the telegram of the Western Australian Premier means anything, it means that; and, further, that we are going to take money back do from the States by extracting from them all the revenue to-which they would otherwise be entitled during these last two months'of the nnancial year. If that be 1 the intention of the Treasurer) I - t h i nk that it requires further explanation. I suggest that the explanation which the Treasurer has given us needs to be further explained, or else",48
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,The honourable the member is under a wrong impression. Surely Revenue Bill that .is enough. .,48
377,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,The Treasurer for the remainhimself must know,48
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,I am riot going to - say any more about it.,49
379,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"I am not going to allow the Treasurer to prevent me from proceeding to express my views orr this subject. The right . honourable member for Swan has read a telegram-, the meaning of which is as clear as possible, if the statement in it be true. That telegram was sent by the Premier of Western Australia, and it says that instructions have been given not to pay any moneys to that particular State.",49
380,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,The Prime Minister has a copy of the telegram also.,49
381,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"I want.to know - and I . think that the House is entitled to know-whethe r such"" instructions were, in fact, issued; and, if they were issued, are they capable of any other meaning whatever than that the intention of the Treasurer is to compel the States to refund the moneys which have been paid to them, monthly during the past months of this financial year ? MT. JOHNSON (Lang) [4.13] - I think that we have a light to complain of the tone adopted by the Treasurer towards honourable members of this House when he. is asked for information upon important public questions. Honourable members are entitled to resent the contemptuous manner adopted by the. Treasurer when addressing himself to members on this side of the House, The . manner in which he addressed the honourable member for Wentworthwas, undoubtedly, unbecoming to. the ' dignity of the Treasurer's position.",49
382,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,What did I say to him?,49
383,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"The Treasurer has no Tight to treat any honourable member in such an abrupt, curt and overbearing manner. The question under discussion has arisen in consequence of the telegram received by the right honourable member for Swan from the Premier of Western Australia. But the matter affects every other State's finances. The explanation given by the Treasurer was not satisfactory; in fact, the Treasurer's explanations never are very satisfactory. I understand the position to be that instructions will' now be given by the Treasurer that only the three-fourths constitutionally payable to the States will be paid -. That may have been a wrong impression, but the. Treasurer's explanation was so - short, snappy, and incoherent, that' the House does not really know even now what is the real financial proposal he has in mind regarding the amount to be paid to the States .for this month.",49
384,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,What the Treasurermeans is that the three-fourths will be paid this month.,49
385,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"The Treasurer did not even make that clear. It remains for another honourable member' to explain what he thinks was in the Treasurer's mind. I do not think that any honourable member is much wiser now than, he was before the Treasurer spoke; and I feel"" guite sure something is to be kept back.",49
386,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"Ballarat-Minister of . External Affairs) [4.14] - It is very unfortunate that, so simple and clear a 'matter should be distorted.",49
387,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,Is that a fair statement ?,49
388,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,"It is perfectly plain that the Treasurer's telegram - related only to the'month of May, and to any later month. In the next place, I should have thought that honourable members were aware that this question was dealt with at - the recent Premiers' Conference. I informed the States Ministers that the Surplus Revenue Bill was proposed to affect any sum to be paid after that date, and not any moneys already paid to them.",49
389,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,It does affect moneys paid before.,49
390,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION,It does not. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.15 p.m.,49
