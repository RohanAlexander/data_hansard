2,Mr REITH,STANDING ORDERS,"I move: That the following amendments to the standing orders be made: (1) Omit standing orders 303, 308, 309, 310, 311 and 312 and substitute the following standing orders: Disorder by Member 303. If any Member has(a) persistently and wilfully obstructed the business of the House; or (b) been guilty of disorderly conduct; or (c) used objectionable words, which he or she has refused to withdraw; or (d) persistently and wilfully refused to conform to any standing or sessional order; or (e) persistently and wilfully disregarded the authority of the Chairthe Member may be named by the Speaker. Speaker may adjourn House or suspend sitting in case of grave disorder 308. In the case of grave disorder arising in the House, the Speaker may suspend the sitting for a time to be specified, adjourn the House without any question being put. Members ordered to attend 309. A Member who wilfully disobeys any order of the House may be ordered without notice to attend to answer for his or her conduct. Arrest of strangers in House, Main Committee or gallery 310. The Serjeant-at-Arms shall remove any stranger who causes a disturbance in any part of the Chamber or the room in which the Main Committee is meeting or any gallery of those places, or who does not withdraw when strangers are directed to withdraw, while the House or the Main Committee is sitting. Arrest of Member or stranger to be reported 311. When any Member or other person has been taken into the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, such arrest shall be reported to the House by the Speaker without delay. Admission of Senators and strangers 312. Only the Speaker shall have the privilege of admitting strangers into the lower galleries, but Senators shall have the privilege of admission into the Senators' gallery without orders. While in the Senators' gallery Senators shall observe instructions concerning order issued by the Chair. The Speaker may admit distinguished strangers to a seat on the floor of the House. (2) Omit standing order 313. (3) Omit standing order 320 and substitute the following standing order: Papers are public and may be inspected and copied 320. The publication of all papers and documents presented to the House is authorised by this standing order. This motion implements the government's response to two old reports of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure: the 1992 report on standing orders governing disorder and strangers and the 1988 report on the publication of tabled papers. The explanation for us dealing with these reports is that we asked the committee to go over all outstanding prior reports of the committee, update those reports and advise the House accordingly. The government has or therefore responded. We have consulted with the opposition and other members on the proposed changes to the standing orders and we understand that the opposition is in agreement with the changes. Very briefly, the changes in relation to the standing orders governing disorder and strangers are essentially housekeeping in nature and are in accordance with recommendations of the Procedure Committee report. The amendments will include a reference to sessional orders in part (d) of standing order 303 in relation to the naming of a member; transpose the wording of standing order 308 so that the less severe action of suspension of sitting is referred to first ahead of the reference to the more severe action of adjourning the House in the event of grave disorder in the House; enable a motion requiring a member to attend the house to be moved without notice understanding order 309; remove from standing orders 309 and 310 the references to taking a member or stranger into custody, as the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 now qualify such actions; remove from standing order 311 the reference to members or other persons being brought to the bar for disciplinary action as such action would be most unlikely given the provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988; require senators, when in the senators gallery, to observe instructions concerning order issued by the chair, standing order 312; and omit standing order 313, which nominally restricts the daily admission of visitors to the general galleries. The restriction was relevant in the old House where gallery space was limited but is no longer necessary on a day-today basis in this Parliament House. I now refer to the government response to the publication of tabled papers. Last but not least on the issue of tabled papers, we are proposing to remove the present anomalous situation of tabled documents being treated differently by the two houses of parliament. The Senate has for many years accorded absolute immunity in respect of all documents tabled in the Senate. In the House at present tabled papers attract absolute immunity only if a publication order is carried. It would be true to say that most members and the community at large would not be aware of its distinction or its implications and would assume that anything tabled in the parliament is a readily available public document. The amendment before the House in relation to standing order 320 will provide absolute immunity for all documents tabled in the House so that there is uniform treatment of papers tabled in the parliament. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) for his cooperation in these sensible reforms.",13
3,Mr CREAN,STANDING ORDERS,"We are pleased to support the motion. The changes are effectively housekeeping but they are important for the continuing work of the parliament. They are intended to bring the standing orders into line with the Parliament Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988. As the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has indicated, the changes to standing orders regarding the tabling of publications will lead to greater procedural consistency between the two chambers. We are pleased to support the amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA",14
4,Mr REITH,REFERRED TO IN THE HOUSE,"I move: That: (1) Where a person who has been referred to by name, or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the House, makes a submission in writing to the Speaker: (a) claiming that the person has been adversely affected in reputation or in respect of dealings or associations with others, or injured in occupation, trade, office or financial credit, or that the person's privacy has been unreasonably invaded, by reason of that reference to the person; and (b) requesting that the person be able to incorporate an appropriate response in the parliamentary record; and if the Speaker is satisfied: (c) that the subject of the submission is not so obviously trivial. or the submission so frivolous, vexatious or offensive in character as to make it inappropriate that it be considered by the Committee of Privileges; and (d) that it is practicable for the Committee of Privileges to consider the submission under this resolution, the Speaker shall refer the submission to that Committee. (2) The Committee may decide not to consider a submission referred to it under this resolution if the Committee considers that the subject of the submission is not sufficiently serious or the submission is frivolous, vexatious or offensive in character, and such a decision shall be reported to the House. (3) If the Committee decides to consider a submission under this resolution, the Committee may confer with the person who made the submission and any Member who referred in the House to that person. (4) In considering a submission under this resolution, the Committee shall meet in private session. (5) The Committee shall not publish a submission referred to it under this resolution or its proceedings in relation to such a submission, but may present minutes of its proceedings and all or part of such submission to the House. (6) In considering a submission under this resolution and reporting to the House the Committee shall not consider or judge the truth of any statements made in the House or of the submission. (7) In its report to the House on a submission under this resolution, the Committee may make either of the following recommendations: (a) that no further action be taken by the House or by the Committee in relation to the submission; or (b) that a response by the person who made the submission, in terms specified in the report and agreed to by the person and the Committee, be published by the House or incorporated in Hansard, and shall not make any other recommendations. (8) A document presented to the House under paragraph (5) or (7): (a) in the case of a response by a person who made a submission, shall be succinct and strictly relevant to the questions in shall not contain anything offensive in character; and (b) shall not contain any matter the publication of which would have the effect of: (i) unreasonably adversely affecting or injuring a person, or unreasonably invading a person's privacy, in the manner referred to in paragraph (1); or (ii) unreasonably adding to or aggravating any such adverse effect, injury or invasion of privacy suffered by a person. (9) The Committee may agree to guidelines and procedures, not inconsistent with this resolution, to apply to the consideration by it of submissions. (10) This resolution shall continue in force unless and until amended or rescinded by the House in this or a subsequent Parliament. The passing of the motion will establish a detailed procedure dealing with protection of persons adversely named in the House. In brief, the procedure envisages that any person adversely referred to in the House may make a submission in writing to the Speaker. The Speaker would then have to be satisfied that the submission is not trivial, frivolous, vexatious or offensive and that it is practicable for the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges to consider the submission before referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges. The committee has to be then similarly satisfied before going ahead with its consideration of the submission. In reporting to the House on a submission, the committee may recommend that no further action be taken or that a response by the complainant in terms agreed to by the complainant and the committee be published by the House or incorporated in Hansard. The same procedure has been in place in the Senate since 1988 and has apparently worked well. It appears that the relatively stringent ground rules in the procedure are effective in filtering out vague complaints and guarding against rash and clumsy approaches. All members would be aware that there is a level of concern in the community about the use sometimes made by members of the privilege of freedom of speech in the parliament. It is said to be misused on occasion. I issue and am sure members on all sides are aware of these concerns. The matter was considered thoroughly by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege some years ago. It concluded that the privilege of freedom of speech was of fundamental importance and that it should not be circumscribed. It recommended, however, that a right of reply procedure should be introduced in each House. In 1991, the Procedure Committee recommended that we introduce the procedure that is now before the House. The procedure will enhance the parliament's standing as, consistent with the rule of natural justice, citizens who feel genuinely aggrieved by adverse mentions in the House will have the ability to seek to reply to the comments made about them. It is my understanding that in the Senate the procedure was never exercised retrospectively when it was introduced in 1988, and now the government intends that any use of the procedure in the House will also be in relation to future proceedings after passage of this motion. This motion is long overdue. Again I thank the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) and other members of this place for their cooperation, and I commend this motion to the House.",14
5,Mr CREAN,REFERRED TO IN THE HOUSE,"The issue of parliamentary privilege has been a contentious one for some time. It has been practised in this place over many years, but the original concept was first adopted in the UK Bill of Rights as far back as 1688. The concept of privilege was conferred to ensure that elected representatives of the community could carry out their duties without fear of intimidation or punishment and without improper impediment. However, it is important for us, as members of the parliament, to recognise that, whilst we obtain the privilege in being elected here, it also imposes a responsibility on us to ensure that Australian citizens are not disadvantaged by our immunity. The right of reply, which is proposed here, allows them the opportunity to make their case to the Privileges Committee and, where appropriate, to ensure that the record accurately reflects events. It is just and fair that citizens have the right to ensure that they are able to represent themselves where they feel they have been aggrieved by adverse mention in this place. It is consistent with our system of natural justice and the Australian fundamental sense of fair play. The Senate was the first parliamentary chamber in the world to adopt this practice, and it has been in their chamber since 1988 and used very successfully. The Senate Privileges Committee has developed a number of practices in relation to applications for the right of reply. Such an example is the practice that citizens need to make an application within three months of being named in the chamber. While this is not necessarily a hard and fast rule, it does ensure that applications are genuine and in the spirit of the resolution. The Senate resolution, which was introduced in 1988, has never been exercised retrospectively, and it is the Labor Party's expectation that any use of this procedure in the House will accord with the practice of the Senate and relate to future proceedings. This is a significant occasion for this House and for the Australian people, and I join with the government in commending the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Use of Electronic Communication Devices",16
6,Mr REITH,COMMITTEES,"I move: (1) That the House authorises the use of electronic communication devices by a standing or select committee of the House in order to: (a) take oral evidence from a witness who is not in attendance at a meeting of the committee; and (b) enable one or more members of the committee not in attendance to participate in a public or private meeting of the committee, as provided for by this resolution. (2) That a committee using electronic communication devices shall adhere to the following conditions: (a) the committee must authorise by resolution each occasion the committee is to meet, or on which evidence is to be heard from a witness in a remote location, using electronic means; (b) a quorum of members must be in attendance at one location within Australia or its territories; (c) in camera evidenGe must not be heard by electronic means from a witness in a remote location; (d) members who are not in attendance where a chair and the quorum are present may not vote; and (e) before proceeding to make use of electronic communication at a meeting the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) whether any benefit can be gained from the use of electronic communication compared with traditional techniques; (ii) whether the anticipated evidence is from a subject specialist or expert or is of a non-contentious nature; (iii) whether it is necessary for a witness to be tested rigorously for truthfulness; (iv) whether the administration of an oath is necessary (which would, unlike an affirmation, require the presence of an authorised officer to administer); (v) whether the identification of a proposed witness is acceptable; (vi) the real cost comparisons of alternative means of evidence collection, taking into account the possibility that videoconferencing may involve significant additional costs to committees, whereas the costs of members' travel are met from Special Appropriations and not from committee budgets; (vii) the value of the committee being present at a location away from Canberra; (viii) the value of the public being able to physically see the committee in action; and (ix) any other matters the committee may consider relevant. For the purposes of these conditions ""in attendance"" means physically present at a meeting of the committee. (3) This resolution shall continue in force unless and until amended or rescinded by the House in this or a subsequent Parliament. Members may recall that in March this year the House agreed to arrangements enabling the use of electronic communication devices by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for a trial period until the end of the last sittings. The arrangements were derived from the recommendations of a 1994 Procedure Committee report on the application of modern technology to committee proceedings. Members may also recall that the chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), reported to the House at the end of the last sittings on the committee's very positive experience with the use of videoconferencing facilities during the trial and recommended strongly that the House extend the use of such facilities to all its committees in light of the efficiencies and cost savings that could be achieved in committee proceedings. The successful trial of the arrangements is the basis of the motion now before the House to extend the arrangements to all House committees so that they may make use of modern technology as appropriate in future committee proceedings. In putting forward this motion, the committee has also had the benefit of the very encouraging views of other House committee chairmen. I understand that it was the unanimous view of the first meeting of the informal liaison committee of chairs of committees, established by the Speaker in the last period of sittings, that the House proceed in this way. Again, on this matter I acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) and other members of the House. I therefore commend the motion to the House.",16
7,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"Again we are pleased to be supporting the government on this motion. The Labor members on the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training who were involved in the trial of the videoconferencing facilities all felt that it was a useful device to assist the committee in its work. The extension of these facilities to all other committees is viewed by us as a step forward. We want to note, however, that these facilities should be used to assist the committees in their consultative processes. We would be very concerned if videoconferencing and electronic devices became a substitute for committees consulting with citizens outside the state capitals. The role of the committees in the parliament is fundamental. Through our committee members and the parliament, consultation with Australian citizens about policies and issues that affect them is a very important function. Labor understands that it is the intention of the motion to provide a range of options to committees when considering their forward programs and consultative processes. We have pleasure in supporting the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",17
8,Mr MCGAURAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 2 and 3 (1997) Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 5 and 6 (1997) The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1997) and Customs Tariff Proposal No.5 (1997) formally place before parliament, as required by law, proposed reductions in the excise and customs duty on aviation gasoline (Avgas) which were notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. S261, on 2 July 1997 during the recent winter recess of parliament. The excise and customs duty on avgas contains a component to recover the costs of aviation terminal and en route navigation services provided to the general aviation sector by Airservices Australia. In reviewing the costs of providing these services for the 1997-98 financial year, Airservices Australia proposed a reduction in the duty of 0.6c per litre, which represents a five per cent decrease in real terms. This reduction in costs to aircraft operators follows the implementation of an election commitment by the government. This commitment was to freeze the airways component of avgas duty in 1996-97, except for movements in the consumer price index, while working towards the implementation of a fairer system of funding for the general aviation sector's contribution to Airservices Australia. The component of duty on avgas payable to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for the costs of aviation safety regulation remains unchanged. The Excise Tariff Proposal No.3 (1997) and Customs Tariff Proposal No. 6 (1997) also formally place before parliament proposed increases in the excise and customs duty on certain tobacco and petroleum products which were notified in Commonwealth Gazettes Nos. S313 and S314 on 6 August 1997, again during the recent recess of parliament. As many, if not all, honourable members will know, on 5 August 1997 the High Court gave judgment in the cases of Ngo Ngo Ha v. State of New South Wales and Walter Hammond and Associates Pty Ltd v. State of New South Wales. The decision invalidated the New South Wales tobacco business franchise fees and cast considerable doubt, to say the very least, upon the constitutional validity of all other state and territory business franchise fees on tobacco, alcohol and some petroleum products. At the request of and on behalf of these governments, the Commonwealth government decided to use its tax powers to collect the revenue that the states and territories would forgo due to the High Court decision. These proposals increase the excise and customs rates of duty on certain tobacco products by $167 per kilogram and on certain petroleum products by 8.1 c per litre. The Commonwealth government has, wisely, received written guarantees from the states and territories that, should the new receipts exceed those that would have been collected under their previous taxing systems, the additional revenue will be refunded to product distributors. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 August, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.",17
9,Mr ROBERT BROWN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 is one item of legislation that has been brought forward by this government which is almost unbelievable. This amendment is not designed to withdraw any legislation that was introduced by the previous Labor government and it is not designed to amend any legislation that was introduced by the previous Labor government, because the previous government's industrial relations legislation was withdrawn entirely by the Howard coalition government. What this amendment proposes to do is to amend this government's own legislation in relation to unfair dismissals. There are provisions in the government's Workplace Relations Act, as we know, to deal with the question of unfair dismissals. What this amending legislation proposes to do is to withdraw the protection against unfair dismissals-using the government's own expression and term-from all of those employees who are employed in small businesses which are identified as businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. Not immediately but as soon as the amendment becomes operative, any people who become employed by a small business will have that protection withdrawn from them. The protection was designed to ensure that employees right across all employment areas in Australia would not be subjected to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. In this amendment the only exception for those people employed by small business is apprentices. That is an interesting exception too, because it causes us to raise the question as to whether this proposal to withdraw that protection from employees in small businesses is fair, just and equitable, whether this government in introducing this amendment believes that the amendment has those qualities. If the amendment has those qualities, why then exclude apprentices? Quite clearly the government is embarrassed about the application of these provisions to apprentices in small businesses, but it will apply to everyone else, including trainees. Any young employee not identified as an apprentice will have this unfair dismissal protection withdrawn from him or her. The government, to protect what shambles of a reputation it has left, has chosen to exclude apprentices because it is embarrassed and ashamed. It is claiming that this legislation is signed to assist in its package of proposals benefit small business. Small business is not concerned about this issue. As some of the other people speaking for the opposition have indicated, small business is concerned about economic growth, they are concerned about sales and they are concerned about the capacity of their own businesses to satisfy the growing demands of a buoyant, growing economy. If the government was so concerned about small business or about the economy generally, it would be ensuring that the economy was growing instead of applying the brakes to the extent that it has been. The bill proposes the removal of protection from a large and growing number of employees. It will apply only to those employees who are employed by small business from the moment they are employed after the amendment becomes effective-it will not apply to those current employees in small businessbut obviously that will be a growing number and eventually it will overtake the lot. Since the government itself identifies the question of unfair dismissal in the terms that I have indicated-harsh, unjust or unreasonable-it is clear that the government is prepared to see employees in small business dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way. There is no other explanation. While this is an amendment to the government's own legislation, we are not unmindful of the fact that the government is using this simply as another device to belt industrial protection which exists in Australia for Australian employees and which in a very real sense has developed a coherent structure of industrial protections since, I suppose, 1904, the original Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which incidentally, Mr Speaker, as you know and as all members should know, was introduced by a conservative government, a coalition government under Deakin. Deakin made the point when he was introducing it that it was designed, in effect, to civilise the industrial system and the industrial process. It is this government, the contemporary coalition conservative government, which puts all that asunder. There will continue to be some forms of de- protection under the anti-discrimination law to and the common law, particularly the common law in relation to contracts, but that obviously is not enough. If it had been enough, the government would not have made provision for questions of unfair dismissal in its legislation in the first place. The shadow minister for the opposition, Bob MCMullan, the member for Canberra, last night gave some good examples of unfair dismissals for which there will be no protection for employees in business with fewer than 15 employees when this exemption becomes fully operative. He included examples where males or females subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace in a small business can be unfairly dismissed without any recourse to the court or to the systemharsh, unjust and unreasonable. He gave examples of employees who had refused to cook the books for their employers who wanted to rip off the taxation system and who had suffered unfair, unjust and unreasonable dismissal, with no protection. He gave examples where employees would refuse to carry out instructions which could have endangered them or their workmates and as a result of that could be dismissed without protectionunfair, unjust and unreasonable. What a shameful piece of legislation. This government should be ashamed of it. I will be interested to hear members of the government get up and try to defend it and attempt to justify it-people who I know have some conscience, people who have concern and people who have considerable experience in areas of this kind. Shame on them! Members are aware that this legislation is discriminatory. It discriminates, for example, between employees in large and small business. If you are in large business you are protected; if you are in small business you will be thrown to the wolves. It discriminates between those who were employed before and those who are employed after the proposed amendment begins to operate. If you were employed before it you are protected; if you are employed after it you are thrown to the wolves. It discriminates between apprentices, who will continue to be protected, and others, including trainees of the same age as the apprentices. If you are a kid in small business and you are a trainee and you are dismissed in an unfair, unreasonable or harsh way, you can be thrown to the wolves. I am not suggesting that all owners, all proprietors, all managers in small business the wolves, but clearly some of them are. We know them. Don't let's pretend that they are not. We know that some of them sexually harass. We know that some of them intimidate. We know that some of them try to rip off the taxation system. We know that there are some people who will take short-cuts on questions of safety. We know they are there and we on this side believe that their employees should be protected against them. The government and those on the other side who support the government do not believe, apparently, that that protection is necessary or desirable. If the legislation that the government is introducing is fair and equitable and just and appropriate, why exclude the apprentices? Is it because the government is embarrassed that this legislation, which it is responsible for, will apply to apprentices, that apprentices will be seen to be sometimes dismissed as a result of harsh or unjust or unreasonable procedures by small business? I heard the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles, last night when he was attempting, obviously in an embarrassed way, to defend the government's proposal, make out a case against any unfair dismissal protection and the ways in which that might be implemented. What he did not do was to make out a clear case in favour of this discriminating legislation. I think we are going to see, in the pattern of the government supporters' approach to this legislation, criticism of unfair dismissal legislation and the need for proprietors, owners and managers to have some flexibility in their approach to management. In the process of their doing that, they will be in effect endorsing the type of comment which has been made by their own Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to give an example of that. On 7 July this year on the Today Show the Prime Minister was urging striking workers at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, an area just near me, employing some of my constituents, to accept the pay offer that they had been made. The Prime Minister's comment in relation to that was almost unbelievable to me; it was incredible. He told the workers, The pay deal you are being offered are by the company is greatly in excess of what you now have and I think it is only fair and reasonable that' - and I emphasise these last words-'a company be able to run its mine.' That is the sentiment which underlies this government's approach to the whole issue of industrial relations. The government believes that the people who have any proprietary interests in business are the owners and the managers; the employees are the factory fodder. The government believes you have the bosses and the workers; you have the masters and the servants. The point I want to make in connection with this is that that exists no longer. Production is a social process undertaken by equals. There are no longer masters and servants. Production is a social process undertaken by equals. It is an offence as well for the Prime Minister to say to my constituents, 'Listen, cop it. Here's a pay deal that you're being offered which is greatly in excess of what you now have. In effect, we'll buy your dignity, we'll buy your self-respect, we'll increase your pay packet and you can cop it.' My constituents at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine said, 'Like hell we will!' and they were right. I endorse them, I support them and I applaud them. They will not sell their rights. They have fought hard enough and long enough in order to secure those rights and they will not sell them. I urge them and appeal to them to never sell their rights and to never accept a proposition that it is only the manager and the owners of a business who have any right to say how it operates. I conclude on this point: I repeat again, for the benefit of those people who do not know the changes that have taken place in the last 97 years in Australia, that production is now a social process. Production is undertaken by equals. Production is no longer a relationship of master and servant. We will not allow that to return, nor will the trade union movement, nor will the honest, dignified and honourable employees throughout Australia.",18
10,Mrs STONE,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"As an Australian who is concerned about jobs for the unemployed and who is concerned about the young people who have not had a chance to even take their first tentative steps work force, I rise today to support the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997. This bill is designed to exclude from the federal unfair dismissal provisions new employees in businesses with fewer than 15 workers. The particular proposed amendment does not affect employees' rights in relation to unlawful dismissal. Let me stress that. The previous speaker, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), seemed most concerned that somehow a clock was being turned back to Dickensian times where employees were once again to be subjected to conditions in the mines where children have harnesses on their backs pulling out coal. Let me remind the previous speaker that this proposed amendment does not affect employees' rights in relation to unlawful dismissal. The bill will not apply to existing employees, only to employees who are employed after the passage of this legislation. Some people may argue that all employees should be subject to the same work force regulation. I think the previous speaker was trying to say that. But, unfortunately, this ignores a fundamental reality. Small, often family businesses, those with fewer than 15 staff, typically do not have the resources to sustain a long, drawn-out legal battle with an employee who has been given a bit of an opportunity to make some extra money from the boss when they have been dismissed on the grounds of some activity which has endangered the rest of the work force, or has been illegal in itself, or it might be that the business can no longer afford to employ that person. Any activity requiring management time to be diverted from normal business activity could and in the past has created a serious threat to the viability of many small businesses, and therefore of course to the very jobs of the other people employed there. If the boss goes down, so do the other people's jobs. We do not believe that is in the interests of the Australian economy, and certainly the work force out there has had it in the neck for too long. They along with the employers in this day and age want a fair deal. A culture of fear was created by Labor's unfair dismissal laws. The reality of falling into the victim to a vexatious claimant became commonplace in the last years of the Labor government. Businesses knew that, no matter how justified their dismissal of an employee was, they could expect to see the charges of unfair dismissal laid. They knew that along with that went costly financial and emotional implications-the damage to their business's reputation and the loss of their good standing in the community, as stories were circulated about how they had treated that employee in a cavalier or illegal manner. In a small munity, you can imagine that the damage done to a small business can last for a very, very long time. So commonplace were these vexatious unfair dismissal actions under Labor that small businesses-the small shops, offices, little garages, the little manufacturers-began to think that it was in fact safer not to take risk with the employment of a young, inexhis perienced new worker, perhaps someone new to the community, someone they had not known before, someone who did not have references that they could check out. They decided that it was better not to take the risk to take on that new person in fear of being taken to the cleaners through the unfair dismissal laws that gave a vexatious claimant a windfall final payment. Every member of this House will have of horror stories in their electorate offices where small business people have recounted to them the usual cost-about $8,000 out of pocket-if someone decides to 'go you' unfair dismissal. The horror stories are all about how it is much better to roll over, the $8,000 and try to get on with your busises ness, than stand up for your rights, and fairness in the old unfair dismissal claim process. Is that what this nation wants happen? Is that what this nation really needs to be on about when our most important serious priority as a government is jobs, jobs and more jobs? Just how many businesses are going affected by this amendment? The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia calculated that 55 per cent of private sector jobs in Australia are in the small business sector and that accounts for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million jobs created in the decade 1994-95-in other words, 92.5 per cent-were generated by small firms. Our large firms have used the recession to become labour efficient. They will not be the major sector taking up Australia's unemployses. ment slack, because they are essentially efficient users of capital. Smaller firms ploy people to produce and the larger ones employ capital to produce. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics, businesses comwith fewer than 20 people represent 94 per cent of the businesses in Australia and two-thirds of these employ fewer than five people. Across Australia, we are talking about tiny little outfits with perhaps the husband and wife and one or two people. They are the the sorts of businesses who are caught up in Labor's absurd unfair dismissal merry-goa round. You can imagine a dairy farmer and wife taking on, for perhaps the first time in their lives, a young person to support them with their milking. They have an unfair dismissal claim brought against them. That $8,000 that should have been going into their own business support pays this person off. In the future, they do not employ another person. They work harder and longer hours in their dairy exercise, trying to make up for the employed staff that they have had to pay the files $8,000 for. They are driven further and further, without holiday, without relief on the weekends, because the fear of taking on another person who might yet again take them for to the cleaners is just too great. Small businesses are the engine room of the pay Australian economy. Allowing small businesto grow, employ, export and invest is a for top priority of this government, and it is certainly a top priority in my electorate of to have Murray. Any impediment to the shortor long-term survival of a small business is a threat to this government's key objective: to push down unemployment levels and create an environment where there is real to be work for all who can do it. The government's small business package has is critically important for the growth of regional economies and for Australia as a whole. Manufacturing in the region which I represent in northern Victoria is almost totally to dependent on small, local primary industries-industries where the average employed unit is less than five-but, unlike most of the rest of Australia, we continue to have a predominance of local ownership of businesWe have lots of cooperatives. One of the most significant effects of the emdependence on primary industries in a region like ours is the seasonal fluctuation in emthe ployment. This can vary by 50 to 100 per cent each year. So we must have flexibility in work force arrangements. It is essential for the survival of businesses which follow the seasonal cycles of round-the-clock work and down time. Under the Labor work force relationships regime, too many enterprises were straightjacketed into inflexible arrangements which took away their ability to negotiate with their employees and which took away, in the long run, their ability to compete. We saw countries like New Zealand revolutionise their meat works sector with enterprise agreements which put ownership largely back into the hands of New Zealand nationals and put abattoirs back into a profit mode. Australia still limps along behind. In Victoria, an abattoir owner was driven out of Dandenong by relentless industrial unrest over years. The workers were pitted against the owner in such a manner that, eventually, he simply walked away. He has now opened up a greenfields site abattoir in my electorate. It is operated in a most highly efficient manner as a totally exporting abattoir with workers whose loyalties are absolutely to the business and who understand that their own futures and their own ability to continue to support their families is dependent on the viability of that business in the long term. They understand that they are in a partnership. It is that sort worker-employer relationship that is the difference between survival and bankruptcy in all economies. Throw unfair dismissal laws, such as we had, into that arena and the sense of cooperation and equal dependence on one another goes; and instead you have an atmosphere of opportunism, conflict and divisiveness. This bill still imposes a number of obligations on employers with regard to termination of employment. Employees will continue to have the right to take action against unlawful dismissal. The prohibited reasons for dismissal under the Workplace Relations Act are substantially the same as under the previous Industrial Relations Act. The bill, as the previous speaker mentioned, does not affect the rights of apprentices because apprentices are already excluded under the federal unfair dismissal provisions by regulations under the act on the basis that they are under a contract of employment for a specified period of time. Nothing in this amendment affects the responsibility of employers to treat their employees in anything other than a lawful manner. We are not setting the clock back; we are in fact marching forward. Every successful business person knows that their business is dependent on a loyal, skilled and efficient work force. Quality of service and quality of output depend on employee attitudes to their work and their sense that they are valued by their employers. A good manager knows that employees expect fair reward, recognition and respect in return for their loyalty and commitment. Any small business that tries to take unfair advantage of its employees' exemption from the unfair dismissal laws could and should expect to see the productivity of their remaining work force fall, and absenteeism and staff turnovers rise. They should expect to reap the consequences of being un-Australian and poor business people. Under this amendment, employees are still protected by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. In particular, section 170CK protects employees against dismissal for any discriminatory reason; for example, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental of disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. No-one will be able to be dismissed on any of those bases. Section 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee if she or he engages in protected industrial action. Section 298K is about freedom of association. It prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age. This is with the exception of cases where there is serious misconduct. The coalition's commitment to the new amendment for micro-business was announced on 24 March 1997 as part of the government's small business package. Since that date, I am sure that representatives from both sides of this House have heard of its unanimous support and have received congratulations from the small business sector of Australia. We are no longer going to see the balance between the rights of employers and employees tipped so far towards the side of the employees that the work force is jeopardised. In fact, the young, the least experienced and people setting out on their first job were finding barriers to their employment because of the reputations of others in the work force who had gone before. The number of unfair dismissal claims has dropped dramatically since the Workplace Relations Act came into effect on 31 December 1996. In the first half of 1997 the number of federal unfair dismissal claims was down 55 per cent over the same period in 1996. If all the unfair dismissal claims in the past bona fide, why have we had that incredible drop in numbers since we introduced this new legislation? One business leader in our area has told me that this new unfair dismissal amendment is going to make the difference between him working longer and harder hours himself and putting on six new employees-young people who he thought would probably make a good go of it but the risk of taking them on under the old regime was too great. Australia has a long and proud history of worker advocacy-a history peppered with world firsts: milestones like the eight-hour day and the secret ballot, which is called 'the Australian ballot' in the us. What this simplified, more flexible system does is recognise the independence and individuality of Australian workers. It gives them a chance to speak for themselves and to work out arrangements that work for them and their employers as they try to deal with one another in a way that ensures that business is sustained and grows. We have not yet seen the full impact of a new system where industrial relations are more cooperative but I can assure this House that, with our government's intention of bringing back a balance, we will see more jobs-and that is what this government is all about.",21
11,Mr WILTON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"One can but wonder at the reasons for debating this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill in the House today. Are we debating this bill because the government honestly believes it will bring tangible benefits to the small business sector-the constituency it likes to call its own? Or does the necessity for this legislation arise from some base and cynical motive that puts the coalition's interests above those of hundreds of thousands of decent, hard working Australians-an agenda perhaps driven by the H.R. Nicholls Society? All the evidence presented to date would indicate that the latter is the case. Please allow me to explain. There has been much hue and cry over the previous government's unfair dismissal legislation and regulationsin particular, its impact upon employers-ever were since the Labor government first addressed this issue back in 1994. The coalition made no bones during the last federal election campaign that one of the centrepieces of its industrial relations policy would be the rewriting of the unfair dismissal legislation. But the only serious review of the operation of Labor's unfair dismissallegislation showed that the conservatives' hyperbole was simply not supported by the facts. Amongst claims by opponents of the scheme were suggestions that, firstly, the legislation by its nature encouraged too many claims, many of which were not serious and were simply unjustifiable. These led to increased pressure on employers through increased legal costs and time commitments. The second claim that I would like to draw the House's attention to is the fact that Labor's scheme was costing jobs. We had claims like the one from the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales, Gary Brack, that anecdotal evidence indicated that the unfair dismissal laws may have dissuaded Australia's small business sector from creating an extra 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. I cannot imagine where he could have pulled that one from. The Industrial Relations Court of Australia-unlike Mr Brack-has carried out a thorough investigation of the workings of the unfair dismissal legislation and has provided what can only be described as a detailed critique of many of the employer criticisms of the previous law, in its 1995-96 annual report. On the basis of the findings detailed in that report, Chief Justice Wilcox was able to claim, during the 1996 election campaign, that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were generally working well and that, rather than employees being to blame, the main problem was the bad conduct and poor human resource management practices of many of the employers who were involved in unfair dismissal cases. Amongst the 1995-96 Industrial Relations Court annual report's findings were that the controversy over the unfair dismissal provisions was fuelled by a degree of deliberate misrepresentation. It found that the Labor government had not successfully explained and justified its laws; hence, public perceptions, according to the court, were able to be unfairly swayed. It also found that in 1994-95 only 12 per cent, and in the following year 15.8 per cent, of the finalised cases were resolved either at or after trial. In other most of those cases did not even come to trial; they were effectively settled out of court. From late 1995 onwards the total number of unfair dismissal applications represented approximately only two per cent of total involuntary terminations-far from the perception that employers actually had a good success rate under the old law. So much for the claim by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) that employers suffered at the hands of vexatious claimants, given the court's findings that employers had a good sucCess rate under the old law. The court also found in its report that, contrary to some suggestions, people who win unfair dismissal claims represent a fairly normal cross-section of the work force. Finally, it found that, although according to ABS figures 91.7 per cent of employers have fewer than 20 employees, a survey of those employers involved in unfair dismissal showed that only 33 per cent of respondents were small businesses, proving that small businesses are indeed underrepresented in unfair dismissal actions. So much for what the member for Murray termed Labor's unfair dismissal merry-go-round. The Industrial Relations Court annual report's findings clearly put paid to such claims on her part. Nevertheless, the coalition had set its course and we saw the unfair dismissal laws undergo extensive amendment as part of the government's Workplace Relations Act. This of course came into effect on 1 January this year. The government has since been falling over itself in attempts to praise its own policies. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said of the legislation in parliament on 23 May last year: The government is replacing Labor's arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme-a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal, based on the principle of a fair go all round. It is a scheme that . . . ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims Similar sentiments were uttered by the same words, minister on 21 November last year, when he said: We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous ... system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. That was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it. Despite demonstrating that many of the allegations levied against Labor's unfair dismissal regulations were fatuous and clearly without foundation, and despite the government singing the praises of its own recent reforms in this area, it now wishes to exempt small business from the operation of its own unfair dismissal laws because it says that this is necessary to boost employment growth. If the government, in mounting this argument, is admitting that its Workplace Relations Act has added to the tide of unemployment, then I can see why it would want to exempt small business from it. The evidence to date suggests that changing the unfair dismissal laws has not led to an improvement in employment. Since January this year, when the new laws came into effect, national trend employment growth has continued to fall according to the ABS. Compared to the government's lack of faith in its own legislation, I find myself in the somewhat novel position of counselling it to have a little faith and give its own scheme a chance to operate before it loses confidence in it. After all, it has only been up and running now for a few months. The editorial in the Canberra Times of 22 July this year summed up the situation rather succinctly when it said: The government wants to amend the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Bill to make them less exacting on small business-those employing fewer than 15 peoplebecause it thinks present provisions are an impediment to employment in the business sector. Mr Reith seems to overlook the fact that it was he who introduced the present provisions less than a year ago, claiming that they provided a 'fair go all round'. The government is now saying the laws need to be changed because they still represent a disincentive for small business to employ people. The editorial went on to say: In any event, from the employees perspective, why should they be in any different position just because they are employed by a small business rather than a large one? The danger here is an erosion of the principle of equality before the What this legislation undeniably does is create two classes of workers. We will have an estimated 1.6 million workers in small business who will lose their right to challenge for unfair dismissal and who, in the quite correct words of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), will be thrown to the wolves. These workers will be compared to around 6.8 million of their colleagues in the non-small business sector who do have access to unfair dismissal provisions. The opposition, and in particular the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who is at the table this morning, have clearly demonstrated many cases where dutiful and hard working Australians would be denied basic justice under the government's proposals. I can demonstrate many recent examples from the retail industry, for example, where employees in small business have needed to access unfair dismissal procedures. One such case involved a 23-year-old employee in a delicatessen section of a supermarket who had been employed for six weeks and was sacked simply because a newer employee had more experience. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said on the John Laws program in January last year: I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard working employee. Yet, if this bill exempting small businesses from unfair dismissal procedures passes, I contend that is exactly what we will have, despite the Prime Minister's claims. With regard to unfair dismissals, at no stage prior to the election did the coalition ever foreshadow that it would exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws. In fact, the coalition made it quite clear-as, indeed, did the member for Flinders, my electorate neighbour-that small business exemption was not on the agenda. Briefly, as well as some of the points I have already detailed, the opposition believes the following key issues. We believe that the proposed exemption to unfair dismissal laws is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Bell report; that the proposal will also add law. to job insecurity; that the proposal does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of the merits of the case; that the proposal is fundamentally flawed and unfair to small business employees; that the proposal is fundamentally unfair to many decent employers; that the proposal may work as a disincentive to the growth of small businesses; and, finally, I contend that the proposal may encourage the use of artificial employment arrangements. It is abundantly clear that the government is not enacting these changes because it is heeding a call from the small business sector. A recent Morgan and Banks job survey showed that 80 per cent of small businesses stated that the current existence of unfair dismissal laws would not affect their decision to employ further staff. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index showed that just five per cent of small businesses were concerned about industrial laws. Also, in a survey the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry ranked unfair dismissal laws as coming seventh in a list of eight main impediments to employment. Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to conclude my comments by highlighting a source of pressure which I alluded to in my opening paragraph and which I think is driving the government's agenda on this issue. Michael Warby, the H.R. Nicholls Society board member, said as recently as last Thursday: The Workplace Relations Act is a policy failure and a political failure. The government betrayal of basic promises was not only morally wrong, it was also politically foolish. It has broken basic promises, not only without benefit to itself, but in ways which positively damage itself. Mr Warby went on: On this matter, the government can be respected neither for its moral backbone nor its political acumen. Michael Warby went even further the next day by saying: Not only does the act do little or nothing for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians, this pallid compromise signifies a government giving away its political soul for a mess of pottage. I contend that it could well be that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is at least, in part, attempting to mollify the H.R. Nicholls Society, of which his close friend the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is a prominent member, by arguing so hard for a piece of legislation that he inherently knows is both unwarranted and unfair.",24
12,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"--I rise to speak in support of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997, and at the same time. I would call on all small business owners in Australia to let the opposition know that they will no longer stand for job destroying policies, anti-small business policies, and policies that discourage small business from taking on more workers-those that discourage small business from employing our young people and giving them a chance. In fact, I urge small business proprietors to ring, fax or e-mail the member for Brand (Mr Beazley) and the other few Labor Party members and senators in this country about this issue. I call particularly on small business owners in my electorate of Swan and, indeed, everywhere and anyone who is looking for a job in Swan to ensure that the opposition knows that 13 years of a Labor government was enough to dampen their confidence; that letting apprenticeships reach their lowest levels in 30 years reduced job opportunities; that higher interest rates stifled growth and employment; that labour market programs promised the world but did not deliver real and lasting jobs; and, finally-and I see him sitting here-that Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal laws were the final nail in the coffin for small business and employment growth. In a twist of irony, Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal laws were very popular with small businesses in Swan; in fact, they were so popular that, when I surveyed small business owners in my electorate, Laurie Brereton's damaging legislation was consistently listed as the No. 1",27
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member should refer to members by their titles.,27
14,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It was consistently listed as the No. 1 item that they would like to see reformed as soon as possible. The legacy of the member for Kingsford-Smith, Laurie Brereton, was at the top of the charts in the countdown to changing government policy from being job destroying and anti-small business to a new deal that is pro-jobs and pro-small business. Indeed, these unfair dismissal laws have been on the minds of small business owners in Swan for quite some time, and they want them changed. The government's workplace relations reforms, encompassing the Workplace Relations Act and now the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, were overwhelmingly supported by the people of Australia when this government was elected in March 1996. This bill seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act to exclude small businesses with fewer than 15 staff members from the operation of the federal unfair dismissal provisions where the staff member has been employed for less than 12 months. This is a common sense measure that recognises that small businesses of this size face additional pressure and the current laws are especially damaging to business growth and employment. The current unfair dismissal laws have had a disproportionately adverse effect on these small businesses, with the proprietor being obliged to attend the unfair dismissal hearings personally. We are not talking about BHP; we are talking about small businesses, whether they be a bakery, a news agency or a lunch bar. They do not have a personnel manager, they do not have a chief of staff or a human resource manager or a proprietor. More often than not, the small business owner personally employs these staff, pays them each fortnight, works alongside them and works extremely hard for long hours to make a Ii ving. I know those on the opposition benches are a bit out of touch with small businesses, as they cannot see past their ACTU roots, but the current unfair dismissal laws are damaging to these businesses. Let me give you an example of a business proprietor in my electorate who is currently embroiled in an unfair dismissal appeal-an appeal which has had several adverse effects on not the employee but the employer. This person, who had a formerly successful real estate agency, is now busy and preoccupied with this protracted legal case. It is having a negative effect on both the productivity and the success of the company. The agency proprietors are throwing bad money after bad money trying to bring this episode to a close. The case was resolved originally with the court awarding several thousands of dollars to an employee who has been paid a retainer but who was not selling anything. Obviously the employer, after a certain amount of time, decided this was not viable. The person was costing the company money and was not bringing in any returns. He was not being productive. There is no sin against wanting to be productive or wanting to make a profit. The agency proprietor, whom I have known locally for some time, had dormant multiple sclerosis which has resurfaced as a result of the trauma of this case and the associated financial and business costs. This person is presently wheelchair bound, adding further stress to the situation. Commonsense would tell you that the employer should have the right to employ the best person for the job in their own businesses. Of more concern is that this proprietor will now be extremely wary of employing more staff, which is obviously a disincentive for jobs. Unfortunately, the environment that the member for Kingsford-Smith has left us with is that small businesses now view taking on staff more as a gamble which could have a costly side effect if it does not pay off. Instead, we should be encouraging small business owners to think, 'Business is going well. I need more help to expand. Employing more staff is going to help me. Employing more staff is a positive move. Employing more staff is good for business.' I have said in the House that I do not deny for one moment that there are some unprincipled employers who unfairly dismiss staff. However, realistically, employers have nothing to gain by dismissing staff at will. Recruiting new staff is a lengthy and involved process which is followed by a large investment from the employer in time, money and training as well as experiencing the productivity slump that often occurs with the commencement of new staff. Any good business person will tell you that a high turnover of staff is certainly not good for business. Even so, under the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, employees are still protected by the Workplace Relations Act in the following ways. Employees are protected against dismissal for discriminatory reasons such as AIDS, pregnancy, et cetera. Employees are protected from dismissal if they take part in industrial action and seek a certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement industrial action. Employees are protected from dismissal involving victimisation in the freedom of association section of the act. Employees are protected if they are an apprentice in small business in recognition that their formal qualifications may be affected by dismissal. I am amused to hear the Labor Party say over and over again that small business does not want to change the unfair dismissal laws, that small businesses which employ fewer than 15 people or small businesses with staff who have worked less than 12 months do not want to be exempt from the laws. They are oblivious to the calls from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, from the Australian Hotels Association, from the Australian Retailers Association and many others for the ALP and the Democrats to let this amendment pass and go through the Senate, where we know it will probably be log-jammed on the instruction of their leaders-their weak leadership. I would like to invite those members of the opposition to take some of the phone calls that I receive in my office on this issue from the small business owners in Swan. These include small business owners that completed the survey which I mentioned earlier. These include the small business owners that welcome the government's move to give them a fair go after listing the current unfair dismissal laws as a major impediment to growth. The very same businesses were ringing my office to find out further details in the legislation and to find out when it would come into effect. They wanted to get on with it. They were generally gob-smacked to find out that it was being blocked in the Senate by the Labor Party and the Democrats. They asked, 'Didn't the Labor Party say they were going to support this? Didn't the Labor Party say the legislation made sense? Doesn't the Labor Party want to help us?' These are the real concerns of the business community and the employers out in the community. I cannot speak for the Labor Party, naturally, but the opposition also said that the work for the dole scheme was not wanted for the voters, and the backflip of the member for Brand, Kim Beazley, on that is now legendary. Since the legislation on work for the dole was enacted, more than 17,000 work for the dole handbooks have been requested by community groups looking to take part in this. Since work for the dole was instituted, there have been more requests from the unemployed to take part than there are positions available. In other words, it is very popular; they want to be a part of it. Since then the government also has been looking at the possible extension of the scheme because of the overwhelming support from industry. This is the same initiative that the Labor Party said the people of Australia did not want. Work for the dole and now the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill both are examples of how the Labor Party has not learnt its lesson since March 1996. The ALP refuses to listen to the unemployed and small business owners of Australia. Small businesses in Australia know what they want, and now they have to look to the coalition to get that delivered. They are now working with the coalition to achieve the goals that will bring real benefits and create real jobs, not the mickey mouse training jobs that the previous government gave to unemployed Australians. This amendment is evidence that the coalition listens to employers around the countryemployers who provide jobs and create a workplace, not the people who make a living out of telling people how to create problems in the workplace, that is, the declining trade unions and their officials. It is high time that balance is restored in our unfair dismissal laws to give small businesses a fair go, at the same time protecting the mechanisms that assist workers who have been unfairly dismissed. The Labor Party knows this is wanted by the small business community. I support this amendment because it allows small businesses to get on with what they do best, which is providing jobs for all Australians, particularly our young people. I hope that the opposition finally admits to this. I say to the member for Brand, Mr Beazley, that small business people looking for work at the moment would certainly welcome another backflip from you.",27
15,Mr ANDREN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996, as has been pointed out, in order to exempt businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of that act. These changes do not affect the rights of employees in relation to unlawful as opposed to unfair dismissal, and obviously that is as it should be. The former Labor government extended minimum protections to all workers and established that federal laws were dominant over state based systems in regard to the termination of employment. However, a series of regulations amended this cover to allow exemptions for fixed-term, casual and probationary employees, and, again, in 1994 further changes were made to exempt employees engaged to perform a specific task and probationary employees whose terms of probation were determined prior to hiring. There was nothing new in this. As an employer in the media industry, I had utilised such understandings for many years in the hiring of journalists, camera operators and editors in a highly competitive environment where excellence of product and no room for inefficiency were hallmarks of the news business. That flexibility and workplace arrangement gave me the freedom to review employment after three months, and I must say that only once in 20 years was it necessary to invoke the terms of the out clause in the agreement. That was in a workplace that involved about 15 to 20 workers. So it was a small employer although the company overall was fairly large. While the Keating government was trying to accommodate employers who regarded the Industrial Reform Act 1993 as too inflexible, there were other employers in the community going about their business with no difficulties in reaching probationary agreements with their employees. However, there were obvious difficulties for very small businesses which were unable to absorb the inefficiency of a poorly performing employee if that employee dug his or her heels in or where the reasons for termination were obvious but the employee was prepared to exploit every avenue of compensation. The unfair dismissal law was a disincentive to employment, and that was made patently clear to me when I spoke with many in the course of the last election campaign. However, I put to the House and the government that, if we think the unfair dismissal issue the key factor impacting on small business, then we are way off the mark. One dominant, major concern of small business, by quite an amount more important than the unfair dismissal provisions, apart from continuing slack demand and a public that has no spending confidence, is the exploitative rental regime, particularly in major regional centres. Overheads for small business are crippling and continuing high interest rates for business loans are also part of the problem. The tax system is another concern, with this government taking some small steps towards removing compliance costs on tax, particularly in the area of fringe benefits. But they do not really benefit the very small business much at all. Small business is struggling, and the 800,000 small businesses in Australia are not prepared to take on that extra one worker-not because of the unfair dismissal law, but because of all those other costs of doing business in this country. I have been a cautious supporter of a goods and services tax as part of overall tax reform in this country. But the more I look at it the more it seems it could well be another huge impost on small business, with 800,000 small businesses becoming tax collectors and the only real beneficiaries being the tax assessment industry. Tax reform is the single biggest issue confronting this economy. In emphasising the cost to employment of the unfair dismissal laws, the government is being too cute by half. The unfair dismissal laws are not the reason small business is not putting people on. It is those other slugs-indirect and direct taxes-that hit business at every turn. I spoke with a tax expert yesterday, and he said that most small businesses declare only about 50 per cent of their income to survive-not necessarily to avoid their public responsibilities but to survive. They simply cannot afford to put more people on. The other reasons for small business failure lie in the pages of Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Here lie the secrets to struggling small business. It has is nothing to do with unfair dismissal laws, which the government has trumpeted as virtually the only reason why small business is reluctant to employ. The need for regulation of franchising; failure of banks and finance companies to fulfil obligations to clients; unfair conduct in commercial transaction affecting small business-it is all there in the report. The Wallis report on the financial system is still there on the shelf alongside the fair trading report. Each has a wide-ranging set of recommendations for improving the lot of small business in Australia. Retail tenancy and franchising are probably the two major issues affecting the small business operators with whom I speak. Unfair dismissal regulations are way down the list. In one of the contributions to this debate last night I think I heard that something in the order of three per cent of respondents to surveys say that unfair dismissal is their major concern. It is all those other things that are impacting so heavily on small business that we should be legislating on and dealing with to get small business moving again. The people I speak with say, 'We want to be in a position to employ before we worry too much about the terms and conditions of employment.' Let me recount the tale of one employer in a small smash repair business in my electorate. That business, which employs 30 people, was caught by the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. They paid their compulsory superannuation contribution late, but they paid-as they were asked to by the fund-directly to a fund and not through the voucher system, as required by the act. They thought that by paying the amount, which was about $13,000, late they had met their obligations. However, they have since found out that the act does not recognise such payments, and they have been forced to pay the same amount to the tax office, as well as interest, a late payment fee and an administration charge. That was $21,000 all up, on top of their original obligation of $13,000. They have been forced to pay more than twice for one innocent oversight. I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) seven weeks ago, detailing the plight of this small business, but so far I have received no response. What is needed is an amendment to the act so that a small business of this nature is not penalised in such away. In all innocence these people paid the same superannuation contributions on demand to both the fund and the tax office. They paid twice and, so far, advice to me from the firm's accountants, the super fund and the tax office is that the double payments remain in force and are likely to do so. That is not a very happy group of operators of small business out there in terms of the sorts of promises that were made about helping small business to get back on its feet. How absurd that set of situations is for them. It is little wonder that my constituents are wondering what all the hype about a new deal for small business is. This problem could be solved by a simple amendment, but that seems to be too difficult. The overwhelming message I get is that the climate for small business has to improve markedly before confidence returns. That will only come through taxation reform, the overhaul of the ridiculous anomalies in the system, exemplified by the case I have just recounted, and through implementation of the recommendations-which go to the heart of small business confidence and ultimate survival in this country-of a bipartisan committee of this House. This and future governments will never again have quite the opportunity to tackle these issues head on and show real leadership on the big ticket items affecting our economy. It has been argued that this bill is necessary to ensure continuing growth in employment in small business and that it reflects the special burdens carried by small business in defending unfair dismissal claims. It has been argued that it does not affect the rights of existing employees or apprentices and is consistent with the exemptions available under the ILO termination of employment convention. I have no great objections to these arguments. What I do object to is the emphasis given to this measure as the panacea for curing the ills of small business. It will not do that, and every small business operator knows that. It is no good standing here in question time and arguing the unfair dismissal case and saying, 'That is what is worrying small business out there,' because it is not. These changes will have but a marginal impact on the viability of small business. I have detailed the big ticket items confronting small business and the reasons why small business is not generating the employment it should. I believe employment should be based on mutual trust. It certainly is in most rural and country employment situations. The complexity of unfair dismissal laws has acted, no doubt, as a barrier between employer and employee but it is not the major barrier to small business revival. I am concerned that these amendments will enable some unscrupulous employers to exploit their current position of strength in labour market. This does tilt the industrial legislation more in favour of the employer. But, if it helps encourage more jobs, I can only support it, with those reservations. But, as I have said, unfair dismissal laws are not the albatross to small business and employment growth that this government would have us believe - the rights of apprentices; or Get out there and talk with small business operators, many of whom are now looking beyond the government and the opposition for answers to their problems. Sadly, some of those apparent answers being peddled by populist reactionaries are not answers at all; they target quite unfairly groups within our society as the cause of our economic ills. But small business's frustration-that times are not improving and that both this government and the one before do not understand-is such that many are prepared to embrace a simplistic asking of the questions that bother them, thinking that they are also hearing the answer.",29
16,Mr MAREK,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I have owned my own small business-a panel beating and spray painting shop in central Queensland in the town of Claremont. Like many small business people, I borrowed all the money to get my shop up and going. I took the risks-I took a mortgage on my house and had an overdraft. I got heavily involved with bureaucratic red tape, battled with the bureaucracy, paid good money hand over fist to workplace health and safety-I and the many other small business people I dealt with and met through seminars received no benefit from that government service for the fees we paid; and I use the word 'service' there very loosely and hope they have cleaned up their act over the last few years-and the cost of unfair dismissal. The list goes on and on. I have said it before and I will say it again: if you are going to come into this parliament, you must at least have had first hand experience of what effects the pertinent legislation introduced into the parliament will have on various sections of the community. The amendment is very clear. It states: Schedule 1 to this Bill will provide that an employee (other than an apprentice), who is first engaged the by the relevant employer after the commencement of the Bill, will not be able to make an application on the ground that the termination of his or her employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, or on grounds including that ground, if he or she was employed by an employer who employed no more than 15 employees. The exclusion will not affect: - the rights of existing employees; - the rights of small business employees to take action against unlawful termination of employment. It is important at this point to clarify what we consider to be 'unlawful'. The Bills Digest states: 'Unlawful' (as opposed to 'unfair') dismissal includes dismissal for discriminatory reasons such as sexual preference, age, union membership and family responsibilities. It is also unlawful to dismiss a worker because they engaged in protected (lawful) industrial action in negotiating a new certified agreement or Australian Workplace Agreement. Allegations of unlawful dismissal are initiated in the AIRC. The Commission must seek to resolve a claim by conciliation before determining whether to refer it to the Federal Court of Australia. With that in mind, there have been many examples put forward by the ALP here today and yesterday. These statements are nothing more than blatant attempts to mislead the people as the majority of these examples were unlawful dismissals. They would not stand up in court and they would constitute an unlawful dismissal and, of course, as I said, be challenged. At this point it is now necessary to define 'unfair dismissal'. The Bills Digest states: 'Unfair dismissal' refers to those situations where the employer's conduct in bringing the employment relationship to an end can be characterised as 'harsh, unjust or unreasonable'. As far as that is concerned, it goes on: Actions for unfair dismissal are instituted in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) which under the present law must give weight to the interests of the employer and the dismissed worker in determining both the merits of the case and any remedy granted. Many small businesses are doing it tough, and the current 'square peg in the round hole' legislation is not helping. Some people have a perception that if an employer can dismiss someone then there is no job security. This thought process is not correct and, in fact, more often than not it could not be further from the truth. This amendment will create employment. Small business relies on the people in its employ to work and make the business prosper. An employee who is working in the best interests of the business is the employer's greatest asset. Anyone who owns a small business or who works at one knows that this is a fact. I know this because of those who worked in my small business, my panel beating shop in Clermont. I refer to Mr Steve O'Neil, Dallas Tolhurst, Darren Herman and Glen Crawley. These people were not only my employees but also some of my most trusted friends. This happens in small business. A small group of individuals work not just to make the boss a buck but to ensure that the shop keeps its head above water because they have families to feed. If the business is unsuccessful, everyone loses. It is never an easy decision for a small business employer to let someone go. I know that the majority of small business operators who are doing it tough will often go without so that they can keep people on. I know that this is the case because I have been there. I did it tough and I survived. On the other side of the fence, I have employed people who just do not fit; they do not get on with the other staff, they might take from the cash till, as we have heard from some employers in other operations, or they may continually not tum up to work, which only puts pressure on the others because they have to carry the load. The list of all the individual problems that happen when people do not fit into a business goes on. You cannot afford to keep these people on the payroll because ultimately it causes division amongst the staff, the camaraderie starts to fall apart and the business goes backwards. It is like being in a marriage: if you cannot trust your other half, you are in trouble. The relationship between employees and small business is the same. In line with this argument, under the Labor government's unfair dismissal policy small business employers are reluctant to take on staff because of the fear that, if they did not work out, they could not let them go. Should an employer try to let someone go they are in for major compensation payouts. No employer can afford this. In other words, you cannot employ whoever you like-not to mention the fact that it is the employer's business and, therefore, they should have the right to manage that business as they see fit. This is the way small business works. Many in the parliament may not understand this because they never had the pleasure or, after the impediments placed on small business by the Keating Labor government, felt the hardship that small business operators are battling through nowadays.",32
17,Mr CADMAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,He is in the chair; the man is in the chair.,33
18,Mr MAREK,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The person who instituted it? I can see where you are coming from. They were an interesting team. The trouble is that they have lost half the team. This unfair dismissal legislation is for the employers of not more than 15 permanent employees. That must be very clearly understood. I can understand why it has been capped at 15 because I have worked in operations of more than 300 people. Sometimes it happens in big business that people get set up or picked on, or there are some restructuring processes. I remember a case in a large company this year where an individual was looking at being dismissed for allegedly writing some graffiti on a noticeboard. The individual stated that he did not do it, and there were no witnesses. The company decided to make an example of the person, with no proof. This is a perfect case where the unfair dismissal law should work. Incidentally, I know the individual I mentioned personally. The person is a sound, honest, upstanding individual in the community and there is no doubt in my mind that they did not do the alleged act. As I did at the time-and I would do it now-I would back the person to the hilt. Very understandably there are two particular cases here: for businesses with 15 or less get rid of the unfair dismissal laws-it is as simple as that-but for large businesses, where, as I said, you have 100-odd people working there and people can be set up and those sorts of things, it is reasonable to say that there have to be safeguards in place for dismissal. In big business they are still in place, and rightly so. Many small businesses have learnt to operate without staff because of Labor's antidismissal laws. It is interesting to note that years ago small businesses, because of the unfair dismissal laws and all the imposts that were put on them, learnt to get away from having employees. A lot of them have restructured their operations. I remember in particular a shop that sells a lot of stationery in township of Rockhampton. They have restructured their floor plan. They had about four staff and the husband and wife worked in the place as well so there was a total of six. Because of the imposts and all the things that were going on and the heartache that was caused by having to let one employee go and having to pay so much compensation, they decided eventually to let most of their staff because they could not handle the heartache. They were also going through a severe time of downturn in the market and sales were low. So they got down to a position where there was just him and his wife. They restructured the floor plan, put the cash register at the front door and operated like that. I must say that they have said to me in recent months that it has been very hard-there is just he and his wife running a business where they had six people before, and they are doing it tough. At present one, as I said, is on the till and the other roams the shop assisting people at the shelves-helping them to get what they want-or restocking the shelves and, of course, working back late at night. Consequently these people are doing horrendous hours and it is affecting them. They have said to me that they could employ people tomorrow because they are doing fairly well now-business has picked up and they can afford to take people on. The gentleman said to me that he would immediately take on three people if they did not have to go through the pressure of the unfair dismissal laws because it is like anything: you do not know who you are going to get in your business until you start them, and it is as simple as that. As far as I am concerned, once again we are in a position where these unfair dismissal laws are causing nothing more than heartache. We have heard the Labor Party carryon and say various bits and pieces about them, saying, 'We have already amended the unfair dismissal laws once,' but that was to tidy it up, the way it used to be. Now we need to fix it up for small business to make it operational. This amending legislation is fundamental to the growth of small business and if ever the there was an issue to go to the people then this is it. I commend the bill to the House and deplore the Labor Party's petty politics on this issue.",33
19,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), said that these unfair dismissal laws were causing nothing but heartache. The only problem with that obsergo vation is that it is the government's unfair dismissal laws that are now in operation so, if there is any heartache being caused, it is being caused by the government's legislation. This bill takes away the rights of all new employees in businesses that employ 14 or fewer staff to protection against unfair dismissal. This is manifestly, on the face of it, a bad thing-workers should have protection against arbitrary or capricious dismissal by their boss. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said this prior to the election when they were busy promising that they would not do what they are now proposing to do with this legislation. But the government says this bill ought to be supported-notwithstanding the damage that it does to workers' rights-and its big claim for it is that it will reduce unemployment. That claim is entitled to be tested because this nation is clearly not doing well enough in reducing unemployment. I want to say to the House that this claim is nonsense and that it is just one more example of the Liberal government dressing up its ideological agenda in the guise of a cure for unemployment. I want to demonstrate this by taking the House back through the Prime Minister's track record of miracle cures for unemployment, of which this is one. If we go to Barry Cohen's book, we find the Prime Minister saying about unemployment in 1979 that the most effective response to unemployment is to have more jobs. We want to see how well the Prime Minister has progressed since then. Back in August 1995, he talked about unfair dismissal laws as being a cure for unemployment. He said the coalition would deliver 'some fair and balanced unfair dismissal laws which will improve the job prospects for young people'. That was his cure for unemployment in August 1995. If we move on to January 1996, we come across miracle cure No.2: tax breaks and less red tape for small business. These were the 'key planks in the coalition's plan to reduce unemployment', according to the Prime Minister in January 1996 as quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald. In February 1996, just prior to the election, we hear of miracle cure No.3: education and training. At the time the Sydney Morning Herald said: The Opposition was offering a combination of policies to attack [youth unemployment]-to provide a good education system, to offer effective training programs, and to give a new emphasis to the apprenticeship system. We move along to September 1996. There has been a change of government. Unemployment has not been cured. On the contrary, it is going up. We come across miracle cure No. 4: pass the 1996 budget. The Prime Minister said: The reality was that unemployment in this country would not be turned around until the policies of the new Government were allowed to operate. These policies include the passage of the Budget and the passage of the industrial relations legislation. That was in September 1996. Indeed, the budget was passed but, regrettably, far from producing jobs it had an adverse effect on them, as reported by the Treasury recently. We also heard at that time of miracle cure No.5: the Workplace Relations Act. In October 1996 we heard from the Prime Minister: It remains the fact that in the medium to longer term a freer market will over time produce a lower rate of unemployment. He was supported by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in January 1997: I think you'll see the significant improvement in unemployment when you get the significant improvements in the industrial relations system. That was miracle cure No.5: the Workplace Relations Act. We move on to miracle cure No.6: a committee, of all things! The Prime Minister said: The great difference is that for the first time we have a committeethe cabinet's employment committeewhose principal objective is to marshal all economic policy towards the goal of job creation. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business agreed. He said: To have a high-powered economic committee, a sub-committee of Cabinet, focussed on the issues, meeting on a regular basisHow regular? taking advice, looking at the issues from every angle, I think it's a very sensible and welcome move. That was miracle cure No.6. Also in October 1996 we come across miracle cure No.7: privatise the CES. Let me quote from the Financial Review, from the Prime Minister again: The revamp of the previous Government's Working Nation jobs package is also being cited as another reason why unemployment will fall. The theory is that private sector placement agencies will do a better job in placing the unemployed into real and sustainable jobs. Again in October 1996 we get miracle cure No.8: micro-economic reform. The Brisbane Courier-Mail states: [Prime Minister Howard] said he remained committed to accelerating microeconomic reform to create more jobs. One month later, November 1996, miracle cure No.9: test every government policy for its jobs impact. The Australian of 13 November 1996 reports: Mr Howard's statements have again drawn attention to his commitment to test every Government policy against a benchmark of its potential impact on employment. One month later, cures Nos 10 and 11: trade liberalisation and falling interest rates. The Age states: Prime Minister Howard said his government had set the foundations for lower unemployment, especially with industrial relations reforms, interest rate cuts, trad- liberalisation and proposals to ease paperwork demands on small business. But still unemployment remains intractable, going up rather than going down. So in February of this year we got miracle cure No. 12: work for the dole. Again, the Prime Minister, in February of this year, said: 1 want the work-for-the-dole scheme to be one element of the total armoury of policies that the Government has in order to tackle the problem of youth unemployment. That is the government's miracle cure No. 12: work for the dole. But it did not work either. So we come to miracle cure No. 13, in June of this year: move. That is what he said to the unemployed. Prime Minister Howard sparked a bitter row yesterday after suggesting Australians should consider leaving home to find work. ""The thing about the American economy and American society is that people have a culture of shifting around in pursuit of jobs that Australians don't have,"" Mr Howard said. That is from the Sun-Herald. I wonder whether the Prime Minister was reading Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath at the time he made that observation. July 1997 was a rich month for miracle cures. We saw miracle cure No. 14: removing the capital gains tax on proceeds invested in small business. Let me quote again: During a garden party speech, [ Mr Howard] said the best way to boost employment was to create the conditions for small business to prosper. He said the Government had made great strides in that direction through ... removing the capital gains tax on proceeds invested in new businesses. We also saw miracle cure No. 15: a meeting! Speaking on Townsville radio stations, Mr Howard made it clear he wanted to explore more radical methods of tackling unemployment, and confirmed he had set aside a full day (August 5) for the Cabinet to discuss the issue. We all know what happened at that meetingnothing. The Prime Minister was not there, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was not there, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) was not there, and nothing whatsoever was decided. We also saw in July miracle cure for unemployment No. 16: cut wages. Let me quote again: This week, Mr Howard called for a national debate on Australia's minimum wage and its adverse link with unemployment ... ""I don't want anybody out there thinking we're sitting on our hands whistling and hoping unemployment is going to come down"". Heavens no-not when we have got to miracle cure No. 16. He was supported by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), who said that lower wages generally produce lower unemployment. So now unemployment has become our fault. The Prime Minister said one month before the election, 'If I have one message for the Australian people, it is that I can make a difference,' but they now say that unemployment is our fault. We also saw miracle cure No. 17: investment projects. I quote again: There are many things coming on stream in the next few months that will help the employment outlook .... Literally tens of billions of dollars in investment is waiting to go in the resource sector. Miracle cure No. 18 was low inflation: The economy is strengthening and that will flow through to a much better employment outlook in 1998 ... if you look at the very stable low-inflation rate. We also saw miracle cure No. 19: economic growth. When asked questions by the SunHerald about the fall in the number of Australians in full-time employment, the Prime Minister referred to the economic growth indicators. To talk about economic growth is only marginally more useful than his 1979 effort, that the most effective response to unemployment is to have more jobs. It seems the Prime Minister has not come very far at all. All his unemployment cures, including the bill before the House, tum out to be either banal remedies taking us nowhere, pure stunts, like the cabinet employment committee and the special cabinet meeting, or things that suit the Liberal Party's ideological agenda of the moment. This bill is one of those things. The 1996 budget did not give us more jobs; it cost them.",34
20,Mr CADMAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Let it through, if it is so bad.",37
21,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The member for Mitchell says, 'Pass this bill.' But you said last year, 'Pass the budget. That will us more jobs.' Instead, we have fewer. You said, 'Pass the Workplace Relations Bill.' The Workplace Relations Bill has gone through the Senate and it has become law. We have not got jobs from that. So don't keep coming back to us and saying, 'Pass the bill,' because your track record is simply that the bills will not deliver jobs at all. All the Prime Minister's unemployment cures have one other thing in common: they do not work. Unemployment was 8.5 per cent at the time this government was elected. They forecast that it would fall to 8.25 per cent. Instead, it has risen to 8.8 per cent and term unemployment has risen and youth unemployment has risen. So when the Prime Minister comes along with his next miracle cure for unemployment, the 20th miracle cure for unemployment-and what is the betting that that will be a GST-we need to remember that none of these cures has worked. We do not need another quack remedy. What we need is a new doctor.",37
22,Mr RICHARD EVANS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to support the amendment to the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill confident in the knowledge that, listening to my colleagues opposite waxing lyrical with their arguments as to why this bill should not happen, the government will be returned resoundingly at the next election, if not as a result of this bill then because of its other strategies. It is interesting to note the arguments put by the other side. They say that Armageddon is here with us right now: Armageddon is here if this bill gets passed, the bill will bring bad industrial relations, everyone will be on the unemployment list and there will be hard employers treating workers very badly. Those opposite have lost the plot about industrial relations. The Labor Party is not the party it used to be back in the 1940s and 1950s, when it had people of ethics working for it in the party and in the parliament, people with real values, the values of the working man and woman, although in those days I guess it was the values of the working man in the majority of cases. The Labor Party does not represent those people now. It certainly does not represent the disadvantaged in our community. It give does not represent anyone other than the union movement. I say that because the union movement pulls the strings in the Labor Party. The union movement has in here as representatives of this party a number of former employees of that movement. Who does the union movement represent? Does the union movement represent the young people in Australia today? The answer is no. If you look at the membership lists of the union movement you will see that young people are not joining unions. Does the union movement represent women workers? If you look at the membership lists you will see that long- it does not represent women workers. Does the union movement represent the new industries, the growth industries? Does it represent the information technology industries? Does it represent the hospitality industries? Does it represent the services industries? Clearly it does not. The unions have dwindling memberships. So who does the union movement represent? Just taking a cursory glance at the front bench and those speaking on this bill, they represent an employment agency for the Labor Party to bring their people into parliament. Let us look at the shadow ministry and the opposition front bench. What was the shadow minister before he came into parliament? He was a union man. If you look at the list in The Parliamentary Handbook-a new edition has just come out-{)f those on the opposition front bench we have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), a former teacher. He was a university lecturer, I guess. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) was another teacher. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was a union leader. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) I would recognise as an engineer. We need more engineers in this parliament. The honourable member for Kingsfordworst Smith (Mr Brereton), a former member of parliament, was an electronics trainee, accordyears. ing to the list. The honourable member Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) was a union member. The honourable member for Brisbenefits bane (Mr Bevis) was a union member. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was a union member. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) was a union member and a teacher at Williamstown High School. In fact, he was my teacher. What is he in here? He is a bit old for this place, I have thought. The honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was in community affairs. The earnings honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was a union member. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was a party member and adviser. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was lawyer and member of a union of lawyers. The honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) was a public servant and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) was a union member. They were parliament all union members. The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) was a union member. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr plethora Tanner) was a union member. The honourable of them. member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who is speaking on this bill-another union memone, too. ber. Does this tell you that there is a conflict interest regarding industrial relations on this bill? The opposition complained bitterly about the conflict of interest of our former small business minister with his small businesses. Surely this shows a clear conflict of interest. Not one of these opposition members has been a small business operator, yet they in here saying how bad this bill is for small business. They do not understand how small business operates. Let us think about the former Labor government. I have a book here called How Labor has failed Australia-I3 years. Let us all remember how Labor failed Australia. As a small business operator in the late 1980s I remember when interest rates were 24 to 26 per cent. The then government gave us the recession in 60 years. They increased foreign debt by over 800 per cent over 13 They gave us the worse unemployment for since the Great Depression. The Labor government introduced fringe taxes. They increased the whole tax base by increasing wholesale sales taxes. They increased taxes by over $10,000 million in their last three years after they had promised not to put up tax in 1993. They had the worse current account deficit in the OECD, doing including Mexico. We were worse than would Mexico! That is what the Labor Party gave us. They gave us falling investment levels for 13 years. They gave us falling average weekly resulting in less disposable incomes, which was hurting small business. They gave us the unfair dismissal laws, which Mr Brereton, the member f-r Kingsford-Smith, introduced. They also gave us unfair levels of a provisional tax uplift factor. The opposition have no idea of what operating a small business is like. They have a lot of ideas on how to manipulate the system, how to get the union movement into the and they talk about all these great issues, but they have no answers for small business. By contrast, on our side we have a of slllall business operators. I am one",37
23,Mr CADMAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Hear, hear! And a very good Mr RICHARD EV ANS-A successful of one, because success is determined by whether you can sell your small business and I was able to do that. My own background is from a little place called Williamstown. Williamstown in Victoria is a so-called working class suburb, or it used to be when I lived there, anyway. It is probably a bit more genteel are now. Williamstown had a dockyard and was a railway town. What is a Williamstown boy doing on this side of the parliament? I will tell you. The Labor Party let us down in Williamstown, they let us down through the 1980s, they let us down all over the over the countryside. That is why people like the honourable member for Capricornia, Paul Marek, who is a former apprentice, and I, a former apprentice, are on this side of parliament-because the Labor Party do not stand for anything other than their own greed and their own self-interest. I remember my first experience with a union operator. I was a manager of a company in Perth. Unfortunately we retrenched 15 people at that time because of poor economic circumstances in the mid-1980s. I had a union man, he was 65, come into my office, lean all over my desk, belt my desk and say, 'You are going to pay, son; you are going to pay.' 'Pay what,' I thought. I did not know what he was talking about, but this went on. This particular union operator did not reappear with these workers that were put off. I then negotiated with these workers and my own employers to re-employ these people into the company. We were successful enough to get them back in. It was my first day as manager on the job, which was a bit of an experience. I had another experience on a work site as a builder's labourer. I came back from a 10minute morning tea sucking on my milk. An employer said to me, 'Where have you been?' I said, 'I got the milk.' He said, 'You can't take 10 minutes to get milk these days.' I said, 'How long do I take?' He said, 'It is 7Y2 minutes for morning tea, half an hour for lunch and 7Y2 minutes for afternoon tea; no more.' I thought then, 'There must be something wrong with workplace relations if you cannot go to a milk shop, buy a bottle of milk, come back and renew your strength before you start moving those rocks.' I got an interest in workplace relations then. I learnt then that the confrontation the Labor Party talks about and the confrontation the union movement wants",38
24,Mr CADMAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It doesn't work. Mr RICHARD EV ANS-does not work. What does work is including employees and having employees working with you for the betterment of the company, the betterment of the stakeholders involved in that company and the betterment of their own families. But all that those opposite want is confrontation, place, all confrontation, confrontation. Mr Tanner interjecting Mr RICHARD EV ANS-I will bring the member for Melbourne into the conversation. There is a new age of industry right now. We have the empowerment of employees. You cannot do that when you are in confrontation. You need the empowerment of employeesget them thinking and contributing. It is not this fine line between management and workers anymore; it is an inclusive arrangement. It has to be values driven. The work is quite different: hours are longer, training is much higher and employees are now considered as assets of an organisation or an enterprise, rather than just as the workers. Unfortunately the Labor Party still thinks in the past and still thinks about what used to be. There are new industries now-service industries, finance industries, information systems industries-all involved in this new empowerment of the workplace which the Labor Party still does not quite understand. We need new workplace relations; we need better ways of guiding managers and employees to work together. Mr Tanner-Hallelujah! Mr RICHARD EV ANS-The member for Melbourne says, 'Hallelujah.' He is a union man. He says, 'Hallelujah,' so he has seen the light; he has changed. A sudden bolt of light has struck this old union man and he now understands that we need new workplace relations. But we also need new management techniques. Some of these old managers sitting in some of these companies need to get trained up as well. I agree with the Labor Party on this particular issue; they do need training up. These old techniques of confrontation are well and truly over, and the Workplace Relations Act addresses that. But those confrontations could be said about workers as well. We need the sharing of information and the sharing of wealth as well. Having been a small business operator, I understand that there are a lot of things involved in small business that take your mind off employing people. There are things like worrying about the daily sales figures, your own family, where the food is coming from this week and how you are going to do it. It affects your health and it affects a whole lot of other things. You have standards to meet and you have documents to fill out. You are not thinking about employing people, because you know that if that particular employee does not work out you are going to be hit with a massive bill of over $8,000 through an unfair dismissal claim and the costs involved in all that. The member for Calare (Mr Andren) said that it is not high in the minds of small business operators. I agree that it is not high in the minds of small business operators. But, if they were allowed to employ people, if the hardship of employing people was taken away from them, making it easier for them to employ people, that worry would go and it would help small business operators to deal with those other worries that they have. He mentioned the fair trading report. He said that there was no mention at all about unfair dismissals in the fair trading report. Having been a chair of that particular committee for a short time, I can tell you that it was not part of the terms of reference; that is why it was not even mentioned. We did not discuss it. We did not ask one question about it. We asked about other things other than employment and unfair dismissal. If I were still in business-I sold my business, therefore it must have been successfulI would be employing people on a casual work rate, employing them on a three-month agreement renewable every three months. I think that might be what a lot of other employers are doing at the moment, hence the reason for casual employment rates increasing. I wonder what would happen if we were able to diminish-in particular this amendment helps people with fewer than 15 employees-the worry of those employees of unfair dismissals, whether that would give them more security of tenure. I think that may in fact happen. This amendment will benefit small business. It will benefit micro-businesses, those that really are thinking about trying to expand but cannot because they are worried about unfair dismissal procedures. Small business employers do not want to take advantage of peoplesome do, but not all of them do. They want to grow their businesses. The only way they can grow their businesses is to increase their sales. The only way they can increase their sales is probably to have other people do some work to help them. They may be doing that through subcontracting out right now, they may be doing it through casual labour, but they may want to have permanent employees working for them. They have not been able to employ people because they are afraid of this unfair dismissal provision, which in some cases involves costs of up to $8,000. Since last year we have had some examples of how this is working. I have some figures from Western Australia. In the week ending 31 January 1997 there were three applications relating to unfair dismissal. In that same week last year there were 32. In the week ending 4 July 1996, 49 applications were lodged. In the same week this year, there was none. That is clearly an indication that the Workplace Relations Act that the Hon. Peter Reith introduced is in fact working; it certainly is in Western Australia. I support this amendment bill because I know it is going to work for small business. It is going to give them enough confidence to be able to go out and employ people. Those who speak against it do not understand the world of small business. I encourage themthe young and the restless-to understand small business a little bit better than they currently do. They should talk to those who are in it, talk to those who are successful in it, and try to find out how it works and what they think about it. They do not necessarily think about employees all the time, because they are thinking about other things. But, if they had employees to help them, they would readily go out and employ. What stopped them in the past was unfair dismissals. This will help them and I support the bill.",39
25,Mr TANNER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It gives me great pleasure, after that contribution from the thick and the useless, to be able to make some comments on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill. The mask is off in this legislation. The Liberal and National parties are reverting to type. They are reverting to the traditional position that they occupy-the class position of unfettered support for employers and complete lack of any interest in ensuring that justice is available to employees, be they in large or small business. What they are about is ensuring that the people whom they see as their supporters have got an unfettered right to hire and fire regardless of whether there is any justice in their actions and regardless of whether the people, who are the subject of those actions, are actually being subjected to severe injustice-and these people include a very large number of people whom they would tag as battlers. They see small business people as battlers. They are battlers, but the battlers work for small business, oh, no, they are not entitled to similar treatment. What this law does is exempt employers who employ under 15 employees from unfair dismissal legislation requirements. There are, in fact, one or two precedents for this. For example, the technological change and redundancy clause that is in most awards as a result of an ACTU case back in the mid-1980s has a similar exemption from requirements for redundancy pay for smaller businesses under 15 employees. There is, though, a substantial difference between the two. There is a difference between providing minimal redundancy pay entitlements which, under the TCR clause, are fairly minimal anyway, and basic human rights-the basic right to have your day in court; to have your situation judged by an independent umpire to determine whether you have been treated fairly, whether your life has been turned upside down and whether your livelihood has been removed unjustly by dismissal by an employer. There is a fundamental difference between the two things. The second thing that can be said about the legislation is that it creates substantial loopholes. There is clearly no rationale-no logic-inherent in the figure 15. There is no reason why employers who employ over 15 employees are more likely to unfairly dismiss their employees and, therefore, require the intervention and the protection of the state as opposed to employers who have fewer than 15 employees. What this distinction does is set up an incentive for employers to avoid the reach of the legislation by structuring their organisations in a way that means that they are separate business units, for example, with 12 employees here, 14 there, 10 there, and the like. It will happen, and the people on the other side of the fence will not care. They will not know about it. There will be a larger reach of this legislation than they pretend as a result of people exploiting those loopholes. We were told last year by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), then Minister for Industrial Relations-he has now had a name change and has a new plate up-that Labor's unfair dismissal laws had been fixed; that we had a who bra ve new world of the conservati ve government's unfair dismissal laws that would provide justice to employers and employees. We were told that they had removed the negative features of Labor's unfair dismissal laws and that unfair dismissal protection was still available to all employees; there was still a court that people could go to, a forum where they could litigate, if they felt that they had been unjustly dismissed-but there was now a balance. This legislation today is an implicit acknowledgment that that legislation was a failure. We were told that this was going to solve the alleged problems associated with the unfair dismissal laws that Labor had introduced. Yet, within months of those laws having been passed, the government is back in here proposing changes. It was amusing that, when the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, introduced some finetuning-and it was finetuning-to Labor's unfair dismissal laws, this was described in the media and by the then opposition as a backflip. Nobody in the media has yet described what we are seeing today as a backflip, but why isn't it? It is an implicit acknowledgment that they have failed. It is an implicit acknowledgment that their laws have failed. Yet, it is not seen as a backflip. It also gives an indication, which we have seen hints of from time to time, that this will not be the end, by the coalition, of the H.R. Nicholls Society agenda. There have been a few touch ups from the H.R. Nicholls Society and other associated uglies in this debate in recent times, and people on the government benches are smarting as a result. They are pretty touchy about it because they have seen Peter Reith and Cheryl Kernot dance and they do not like it-the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in particular, is of that view. What this legislation indicates is that there is going to be a workplace relations bill mark 2 and substantial further deregulation of the labour market, and it may even be before the next election rather than after it. In December of 1996, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that the new unfair dismissal laws, passed by the parliament last year, provided a fair go all round. Now, all of a sudden, he is going to gut those laws and remove unfair dismissal protection entirely for peolJle working in businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Yet, those same laws-that same protection for those same people-only nine months ago were a fair go all round. There is a stark contradiction here which he, of course, has not explained. It is also interesting to note that in the report, with respect to government regulation in small business, there is no recommendation along the lines that we have before us today in this legislation. There is no suggestion that unfair dismissal provisions should not apply to small business, there is simply a recommendation that after 12 months the new laws be reviewed. We have not got anywhere near 12 months and the government has already decided that the new laws are inadequate and that protection needs to be removed from employees in smaller businesses. John Howard, the Prime Minister, said on the John Laws Show on 23 January 1996, 'I am not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard working employee.' He lied. We have a situation here where that is precisely what the House is being asked to adopt today: a law that says that, if you work for a certain sized firm and you are dismissed, it does not matter one iota what the cause of the dismissal was or how justified or unjustified that was, you do not have the right to take unfair dismissal proceedings. 1 agree with the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) on at least one thing, and that is that not all employers are bad-there are good and bad, as there are in all walks of life-but the problem with issues of this nature is that inevitably the bad drag the good down. If the bad get a competitive advantage out of their behaviour, if they are able to squeeze their employees, mistreat them in various ways so that they can gain a competitive advantage, that puts the good employer on the horns of a dilemma. They have two choices: they can either sit back and watch their competitiveness erode and, ultimately, their livelihood put at stake or they can follow the example of the bad employer. There will always be a mix of responses to that; it is not a hard-and-fast, black-and-white situation. Nonetheless, it is a reality. This means that, in the final analysis, the number of employers who do behave badly will be a lot greater than the number of those who are intrinsically bad or intrinsically prone to mistreat their employees or dismiss them unfairly. Many will be forced to do it because Bell their competitors do, and that applies to the issue of labour market regulation generally. One of the other claims that we heard ad nauseam in the debate on these issues in 1995 was that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were destroying jobs. If this were true, the country could thank its lucky stars that the government legislated, because you can imagine what unemployment would be like now if it had not. Look at what has happened to unemployment since the coalition has been in office. Since the coalition has been in office, unemployment has been steadily rising, in spite of the fact that they were handed an economy in fundamentally good shape. Longterm unemployment in particular is rising steadily and, in some regional hot spots, it is becoming even more serious. The coalition told us that the unfair dismissal law was the primary problem, that it was preventing all those thousands of small businesses out there from employing people. Presumably, they are going to come back and say that there needs to be no unfair dismissal law in order to ensure that all these small businesses are going to go out and employ people. Consistently in surveys small businesses indicate that the unfair dismissal legislationand industrial relations regulation generallyis a relatively limited issue. It does not score highly as a major problem. Obviously, some say it is a major problem for them, but most do not. The most recent Morgan and Banks job survey of over 3,500 businesses indicated that 16 per cent of those surveyed said that an exemption from unfair dismissal laws would be of benefit to them. So 84 per cent are in a sense saying, 'VVe are quite comfortable with a law that provides our employees with a right to an independent umpire if they believe they have been dismissed unfairly.' That is what 84 per cent of small businesses are saying. This legislation indicates the real coalition position. As I said at the outset, the mask is off. Their real position is-and this goes back to the beginning of the 19th century-that a contract of employment is the same as a contract to buy a sack of spuds, that there is no difference between human labour and human participation in the process of production as to how it should be treated by the law and the law relating to the sale of a bag of jelly beans. It is a contract and that is it; and it should receive no separate or special status. Implicit in that view is that the status, strength and bargaining power of the two parties to a contract is fundamentally equalthe view that the worker's alternative to starve is a real alternative. It is equivalent to my decision today not to buy a packet of chewing gum because I do not feel like it. That is implicit in the conservative position on labour market regulation. That is where we got jobsback and the $3 an hour wage figures from. That is why no Liberal government has ever introduced unfair dismissal laws. There were no unfair dismissal laws in Victoria at all until the Cain government was elected-none at all. There were Liberal governments in Victoria for decades. They felt that they did not have to protect any employee-not only in small business but in large business-from the threat of unfair dismissal. VVhy? Because they are the party of employers. It has been Labor governments that have introduced that protection, and it is always conservative governments that fight against it. If they could get away with getting rid of unfair dismissal laws altogether, they would do it. And this is probably the first step. The member for Cowan, who spoke before me, indicated that there have been fewer claims under the new legislation. I think the figure of 27 per cent fewer claims was quoted elsewhere. There is an obvious response to that. Does that mean that there are 27 per cent fewer instances of employers unfairly dismissing people or does it just mean that there are fewer people making claims? I would suggest to you that it is the latter, that there has been no change in behaviour in the workplacethere are still people being unfairly dismissed-and all that is happening is that a proportion of them are being discouraged or prevented from pursuing claims. That is a victory for employers who unfairly dismiss people. It is not a victory for justice and it is not progress. It is simply a situation of locking out the problem, sweeping it under the carpet and avoiding doing anything about it. The fallacy in the conservative position on all of this is the notion that if you make it cheaper and easier for employers to employ people they will. It is the notion of the benevolent employer who has got a bit of loose change. If you say to that employer, 'You can employ somebody with that loose change,' they will. Employers do not employ people because they have got a bit of loose money lying around the place. They employ people because they have work for them to do that cannot be done under their existing arrangements. That is why employers employ people. Demand drives employment. Supply-side views are fundamentally flawed, and that is the view that drives this legislation-the notion that if you make it easier to employ all these benevolent employers will go out there and suddenly put a whole lot of people on. The predominant thing that drives employment is demand. Therefore, issues of growth and economic activity are fundamental to that. Now is the time to nail the critical furphy in all of this, and that is the question of labour market deregulation-the sort of view that is pushed by columnists like Judith Sloan, who has written one article that the Australian has published about 48 times, and no doubt they will publish it again. Mr Martin Ferguson-There is a fee for each of them, too.",40
26,Mr TANNER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is right. I think what they do is get the paragraphs and throw them all up in the air; they come down in a different order and they are published as a new article. There are some very facile comparisons made between Europe and the United States. People say, 'Unemployment in the United States is about five per cent whereas in Germany and France it is 11 or 12 per cent; therefore, because you have a less regulated labour market in the US, if you diminish labour market regulation and get rid of minimum wages and awards that will mean more employment.' Let us go through the rea-ons why that is a complete fallacy. Firstly, the experience in Europe is mixed. The Netherlands, for example, has an unemployment rate that is barely higher than that of the US; Denmark's is roughly the same. There are a number of other examples. Secondly, in the case of Britain, which is also highlighted as an example similar to the US, the figures are rorted. Under the conservative government a whole swathe of older men were pushed off unemployment benefits onto other benefits which do not give them an unemployed tag, such as the equivalent of the disability support pension which does not require them to be medically tested. Thirdly, roughly two per cent of the American unemployment problem is in gaol; there is nothing like that equivalent in Europe. Fourthly, illegal immigration complicates the equation, especially in the United States. You have an enormous black economy and an enormous degree of illegal immigration, particularly in certain parts of the US, which make it very hard to get accurate figures. Fifthly, there are other factors involved. One of the key factors contributing to unemployment in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, is overvalued currencies and harsh monetary policy, which has its origins largely in the approach taken by the German government to the reunification issue. These factors tend to be ignored by the Judith Sloans of the world. One of the factors that they often run in debate about industry policy in Australia is the misallocation of resources that occurs as a result of intervention and not letting markets decide where investment and resources should go. If there is any merit in that criticism it certainly applies to Europe, with all of the agricultural protection in particular and the underdevelopment of the services industry as a result of a variety of government policies in places like Germany. If you actually take the arguments of the economic rationalists seriously then surely that makes a contribution to additional unemployment in places like Germany. It is also worth noting the comment of Lester Thurow in his very interesting recent book The Future of Capitalism in which he points out that a person who is unemployed in France is actually better off than a low paid worker in the United States, at least in material terms. I recommend to members of the government work by Robert Solow, a very distinguished American economist, who studied the so-called stickiness of wages, social factors and the like that do influence wages above and beyond formalities of regulation. The final, outrageous and obscene thing about the Judith Sloan line-the deregulate the lot line-is that even if it is correct that solving unemployment will be the outcome of deregulating the labour market, it still means that the people who will carry the burden and pay the price are the lowest paid, economically and industrially weakest members of our society. Even if it were true-and it is not true-the people who will pay the cost are the weakest, poorest members of the community. They are the ones who are at the bottom of the scale, who are earning the least and who would earn less as a result of her approach, the approach of those who support her and the approach that is harboured by members of the government. Even if it were true, it would be a massively socially unjust way to deal with the problem. A point that the government has to come to grips with is that the role of labour in our society is not one-dimensional. Labour performs three functions in human activity and society. Obviously it is an input in the process of production, therefore the efficiency of that input is of great importance. That is not the only function of labour yet, according to the economic rationalists of the Judith Sloan school, that is all there is. But labour performs two other functions. The second is that it is still the primary means of the distribution of the proceeds of production, and we have an interest not only in it being an efficient input but also in it being a socially efficient and equitable means of distributing the proceeds so that we do not have masses of people with huge rewards and others starving. Its third role is essentially psychological. Most people define themselves by their role in the process of production. It still remains a dominant part of human selfesteem, participation in society, acceptance and recognition. All of these are critical factors in people's participation in society. When looking at regulation of labour we have to look at three imperatives, not one. This legislation is an outrage and a disgrace. (Time expired)",44
27,Mr WAKELIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 is a consequence of a notice of motion of disallowance debate in the Senate on 26 June 1997 after the government introduced a regulation to give effect to an exclusion for new employees of small business until the employees have given 12 months continuous service. The Democrats and the ALP voted for the disallowance of the regulation made by the government, hence the requirement for this bill now which represents a purer expression of government policy for small business. The purpose of this act is to allow an employer the right not to go through the process of some court action where the employment numbers are below 15 in his or her business. To pick up some points from the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), he started on the old chestnut of class-the battlers, justice, and the unfettered right of the employer. I think that the greatest thing any community can do leading up to the 21st century is to offer jobs to all of its people. All of this old world class structure approach is, I believe, related to another era and to almost another centurythe 19th century. We heard about the H.R. Nicholls Society, the Bell report, the drag down effect and-I think he quoted-the 16 per cent of those employers who believed that they were badly affected by the current unfair dismissal regulations or legislation. But even if he is right about the 16 per cent, if we consider the number of employers and businesses throughout Australia who may take on just one more person because they find it more amenable to do so, that would mean tens of thousands of jobs. I doubt, of course, whether his numbers are right. The issue of human labour and jelly beans was raised. If you were to ask employers whether they consider human labour-the cost of employment of people, in other words-in the same way as the buying of a bag of jelly beans, I think they would point out the number of protections that are in the law for all employees. Whether it is workers compensation, superannuation, occupational health and safety, training, whatever it might be, I would suggest that it is somewhat different from going into a shop and buying a bag of jelly beans, as the member for Melbourne was trying to have us believe. The old perennial about starvation was raised. I would suggest it has been a long time in Australia since we seriously have raised that as an issue. The ALP were touted as the only people who could protect the workers from the terrible employer, and I think we all know the history of the last decade or more during which up to a million Australians have been unemployed. Some protection, some Labor solution to the issues of unemployment! There was the issue of 'cheaper and easier to employ', as if it were a matter of loose change, demand and supply. The issue of the ability to employ puts this old class nonsense right up there again. The reality, I believe, is that no more egalitarian society exists than exists in Australia. There is no fairer society in the world; there is no more of a classless society anywhere on the planet. It is not a matter about whether you are of a class or not, and it is just an insult to suggest that it is. It is a matter of the initiative, the entrepreneurship and the ability of someone to create a business and to employand that is what we need. It is nothing to do with how we might view ourselves in a class or otherwise; that has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is to do with the ability of an individual of whatever gender, whatever religion, whatever belief to go out there and create a business and employ. It is an absolute insult to suggest otherwise. What we need in this country are more and more and more of those sorts of people who are prepared to do it. The more incentives, the more capacity that government can give and the more it can harness individuals to do that, obviously the more chance there is to employ people who wish to be employees. Judith Sloan, as usual, comes up in these debates. I happen to believe that her contribution to the labour market issues of Australia over the last decade has been overwhelmingly positive, honest, and has an integrity about it. Whether you agree with her or not-and I do not always agree with Judith Sloan-there is an integrity and a well researched case on which she bases her arguments. I always welcome her contribution. We talked about the US, Germany and the UK. We all know of the issues of unification in the German situation which have created their own particular problems. We understand that in the US there is a dynamic private enterprise economy, and that that country does things in certain ways that perhaps Australia would not choose to. Nevertheless, it has a dynamic private enterprise ethic which has made it the greatest economic power ever in the history of civilisation. So perhaps it would not hurt us to look at, even if not to adopt totally, what happens overseas. I would commend not only the US experience, with my limited knowledge of it, but also many European countries. From the point of looking at both sides of the coin, perhaps we could look at some of the Scandinavian countries as well. I was quite interested in the Swedish model. I have only learnt in recent months that the Swedish experience has been somewhat disappointing and that delivery, in terms of employment outcomes, is very tough indeed. So let us not rule out what might help us to give every Australian who wishes to have a job the opportunity to have one. The measures that the government has brought into place to endeavour to encourage business-small business, particularly-are dealt with in the context of the financial position that we inherited; I think most Australians understand that. Nevertheless, the job has gone forward. We have the issues of the industrial relations bill that has been negotiated, particularly with the Democrats. We also have the issues of the Bell report. Many of those recommendations have been brought into effect and are continuing to be brought into effect, whether they relate to the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the rollover, the paperwork, the provisional tax uplift factor, et cetera. That does not mean there is not much to be done. There is still a lot to be done. But in the terms of this government's nearly 18 months in office, I think it is a commendable record. I want to tum back to the legislation and to the reasons the ALP brought forward the disallowance of regulations on 26 June 1997. It was said that the employees who have been treated unfairly would, be left without any remedy. However, the previous government, the ALP government, which was recently voted out as of March 1996, also had a range of exclusions from its unfair dismissal provisions-casual employees, probationists, et cetera. Remember that you only have to go the first 12 months and after that you would be subject to the conditions of the legislation, Another point that the ALP brought forward in the Senate debate was that it is unfair to provide different rights for different classes of employees on the basis of the size of their employer. However, the different treatment is justifiable given the different impact of an unfair dismissal claim on a small business. It is as fundamental as that. The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) made significant reference to the background of our opponents. That is fine. We all come to this place from different backgrounds, and we bring what we can to it. But this sort of approach only demonstrates the ALP's total ignorance and lack of understanding of those who work in small business. I repeat: unfair dismissal has a different impact on a small business. The fact that the proprietor has to attend hearings personally is just one example of the inconvenience that can occur. Another objection was that there is insuffiresponse cient evidence that the unfair dismissal are still a problem for small business insufficient evidence that limited coverage the unfair dismissal laws will increase ployment. The response is that the decisions on expansion to employment are influenced by many factors. The government should Party, remove as many obstacles as possible. It fundamental as that. To come back to the point the member for Melbourne made towards the end of his contribution when he talked about the weak and the vulnerable in our society, the best thing that any government in any society do for its active members of society between the age of 16 and 65 is to provide them with regular work. Anything that a government can do to remove obstacles should be done. not about some theory of ours of sitting in opportuni ty . this place having wonderful philosophical debates. It is about remembering that there millions of Australians who look to us to leadership in these matters. Another objection that our opponents raised in the Senate was that the unfair dismissal laws as amended by the government in 1996 already require the Australian Industrial the Relations Commission to have regard to the impact of any order on the viability of employer's business before ordering reinstatedispatch ment or compensation. The obvious response is that this does not remove the burden of defence of a claim apart from any order made. You are still left with defending the claim. These things are practical They take time, money and attention away from the job in hand of working a small business. We should never forget that we specifically cannot wax lyrical without remembering that the reality is that there are millions of tralians out there trying to work, trying to create a business, trying to create wealth and trying to employ. The success of their businesses depends on their ability to produce. The ACTU repeats the criticism and argues that it is a breach of Liberal Party policy to fail to provide access to an unfair dismissal hearing for any group of employees. The opposition should know a lot better. The response is quite clear; it is unequivocal. The is, 'However, the previous ALP laws government also had a range of inclusions and from its unfair dismissal provisions, for by example, casual employees, probationists, emtrainees,' and the ACTU agreed with all of this. The ACTU really needs to be consistent. Whether it is the Labor Party, the Liberal the National Party or the Democrats, if is as the ACTU treated us with consistency it would win greater respect. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is an important part of the government's program. It shows the government's support for small business and for ordinary Australcan ians who are endeavouring to work in small business and to create small business. I welcome the legislation. I remind the Senate that we have a responsibility to every AustralIt is Ian to make sure we maximise every job",45
28,Mr MCCLELLAND,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I oppose the Workplace Relations give Amendment Bill 1997. The former speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), said that the more incentive we can give small business to employ, the better. That is not objectionable, and indeed it is a worthy comment. But incentive offered in this bill is the incentive of depriving workers of a 'fair go all an round'. They were the words shouted at the box by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), then the Minister for Industrial Relations, on a number of occasions when he referred to this government's approach to unfair dismissal-a matters. fair go all round. Indeed, section 170CA of the act-the objects of the unfair dismissal provisionsrefers to that expression: a fair go all round. Reference is again made in that Aussection by way of a note to a famous case of Lotty and Holloway; the case relied upon for the concept of a fair go all round. In that what did Mr Justice Sheldon say that concept involved? It involved the fundamental right of due process, of procedural fairness based on principles going back to the due process clause in the Magna Carta-a fair go all round. What did Justice Sheldon say? It was the absence of adjectival tyranny. The government is trying to restore to small business the ability to sack people by carrying out adjectival tyranny. The fact of the matter is that dismissal is a punitive weapon that strikes right at the heart of a cial survival. It is not only a worker who is affected but also the worker's family. Put dismissal on one side of the equation and on the other the inconvenience that the former speaker mentioned of having to attend a conciliation conference. What a terrible thing! There is a worker and his family on one side, and on the other is the inconvenience of having to spend half an hour at a conciliation conference. There is no equation. There is simply no correlation at all. ABS statistics show that federal unfair dismissal laws are going to affect at best seven per cent of small business employers. The government knows that its unfair dismissal provisions apply to only small businesses under federal awards; indeed, most are under state awards. So it is a con. Professor Ron MCCullum, of the University of Sydney, said, 'This is at best a symbolic gesture; at worse a big con.' It is a complete and utter con because, in any event, it will not quarantine small businesses from actions for wrongful termination. There are a number of cases where common law damages have been given because of the action of wrongful dismissal. It amounts to a breach of contract. Such cases include Gregory v. Phillip Morris, Wheeler v. Phillip Morris and the Georgevski case, to name a few. They are legion in the United kingdom and in the United States. They are cases in which damages for breach of contract have been awarded because workers have been wrongfully dismissed. Also, the government fails to appreciate that under section 178 of the act there still remains the right to impose penalties for breaches of case awards, enterprise agreements or Australian workplace agreements. Because the jurisdiction has been referred back to the Federal Court, it has the power to grant injunctive relief, that is, to enjoin an employer from sacking someone unlawfully. So, again, a remedy is already there under section 178 of the act. It is a con to all concerned to say that this is going to quarantine small businesses from actions for wrongful dismissal. What it does is take a simple procedure out of the equation, one in which all parties are afforded worker's finan- a fair go all round. The Federal Court, on authority, has the power under its accrued jurisdiction to grant the relief of specific performance of a contract of employment. Turner v the Miners Federation is a well-known authority for that proposition, where the contract of employment was specifically restored on the orders of the Federal Court of Australia. It is a con to suggest that this is going to quarantine small business. You should be telling your small business constituents, if they are feeding you that line, that they are under a fundamental misconception. The paradox of the government's bill is that it is actually going to make life more difficult for non-unionists. Section 170HA of the act specifically says that the unfair dismissal provisions do not pre,:,ent unions notifying industrial disputes and seeking awards or orders under other general provisions of the act. I refer again to well-known cases where unions have been successful in obtaining reinstatement orders on behalf of workers: Ranger Uranium, the Boyne Smelters case, the Wool Dumpers case and the famous case of Vista Paper Products. These are all cases in which unions were able to establish an unfair dismissal remedy even before the former government's unfair dismissallegislation. They were able to establish a remedy because of the way their dispute notifications were framed on behalf of union members. So, paradoxically, this government has deprived non-unionists of a fair go all round, but unionists still have these mechanisms. A speaker said earlier that employers were anxious that they were going to be sucked down a litigation route. If anyone wants to know a complicated litigation route, they just have to be sucked into this system. They will then find out that a simple procedure which allows for conciliation, where the vast majority of claims are resolved, is far more preferable. You will find that small business owners facing these complications will be saying, 'Take us back to a simple procedure, a procedure where everyone is given a fair go all round.' Let us test the rhetoric of the government and see whether it is correct that there is genuine anxiety on the part of small business in employing people. On the minister's figures, there has been a 56 per cent reduction in unfair dismissal claims under his legislation. Has this led to a 56 per cent increase in employment? No, it has not. It is absolute rubbish. As the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said, the Morgan and Banks survey indicated that less than 16 per cent of employers were concerned about it. So we are talking about less than 16 per cent of seven per cent of employers, that is, small businesses under federal awards. How many jobs are going to be created because of dispelling this unfair dismissal claim anxiety? Not one job. Mr Hardgrave-You don't really believe that, do you?",47
29,Mr MCCLELLAND,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I do not believe it? With respect, you can say in your speech how many jobs are going to be created because of this legislation. I will hold you to it. Not one will be created. I will tell you why not one will be created.",49
30,Mr CADMAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Because of the New South Wales government.,49
31,Mr MCCLELLAND,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Before you speak, you have a look at each other state's legislation--except Victoria, of course. If there is genuine anxiety, as was noted by the former speaker, existing small businesses have a way around it. They can employ people for a specified time. They can employ people for a specified task. They can employ people on a period of probation. They can employ people for a qualifying period. Indeed, they can employ people on a casual basis. These options exist now. Instead of beating up these fear campaigns when you are addressing meetings of Rotary and so forth, you should be trying to get Australians employed by dispelling the anxiety. You should be saying, 'If you do have an anxiety, these remedies already exist.' They already exist in section l70CC and the regulations. With respect, those on the government benches are as bad as another infamous member of this parliament who is whipping up scare campaigns on various other issues. If, as appears to be the case, the economy is slow because of insecurity-which results in the fact that people are not spending their money through small businesses thus reducing the turnover of small businesses-what is this bill going to do? It is going to do nothing at all to dispel that insecurity. How can you dispel insecurity by making it easier for workers to be sacked? The reality these days is that virtually any worker over 40 has problems if they are dismissed, and if they are unskilled they are certainly worse off. If they have a disability they are worse off still and, in terms of disability, a lack of English skills is a significant disability. How are those vulnerable people going to feel more secure and more prepared to spend their money if they are deprived of a fair go all round? That is what this bill seeks to do. If that fundamental right, the concept of a fair go all round-which is a concept, as I have noted, based on principles going back to the due process clause of the Magna Carta-is to be removed, it should only be removed if it is clearly demonstrated, on the basis of fact and not of hollow rhetoric, that it is in the greater public good. As I have indicated, that cannot be demonstrated, for two fundamental reasons. The first is that, in any event, this bill will not quarantine small businesses from wrongful termination actions. They will still exist to give courts the ability to award damages and to give common law courts and the Federal Court the ability to award specific performance. The second point is that, if genuine anxiety exists, it should, as I have commented, be relieved by responsible leadership of the country. And that responsible leadership should point out to small businesses, if they experience that anxiety, the options they have, including employing someone on a three-month probation. All that is going to happen under this bill is that you are going to flatten the wage rates. Small businesses will be able to employ juniors and, as they start to creep up in age and are about to jump up another leg of their award entitlement, it will be out the door for them. But you will have to get them out the door before the 12 months is up. It is going to be a revolving door for younger workers, because you can only pay younger workers lower wages. Economic growth unquestionably is being impeded by job insecurity, and that insecurity is fundamentally affecting small business. This bill is depriving workers of a fair go and adding to their insecurity and, hence, actually damaging small business. I understand that this bill is the first bill down. that may give rise to a double dissolution. If it does, it will do so-in the words of Professor Ron MCCullum--on the basis of a con. If it is on that basis that a trigger is activated, this government is in real trouble. I, for one, would welcome an election conducted on the issue of whether workers in this country are entitled to a fair go all round.",49
32,Mr HARDGRAVE,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"A fair go all round-the concept which was introduced as a result of the election of this government and the policies we promised the people of Australia and which we enacted last year through the Workplace Relations Act-is a term never heard of or used by the Australian Labor Party before. In the time of the previous government the concept of a fair go all round was something we never heard of, but we have heard a lot of talk about it here today from my friend and colleague the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland). In the course of my address today I will address a couple of the reasons why there is so much passion on the Labor side of this chamber about this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill before us. It amends various provisions of last year's Workplace Relations Act, essentially to finetune the arrangements that came through and, in a lot of other ways, to try to say to small business in Australia, 'Yes, we know the bill mangled by the Senate is not what you want and need in order for you to get on with business and employ more people, so we as a government are responding, to try to make things better for you.' This bill also proves the pro-worker credentials of the Howard government yet again. We are not anti-union but we certainly are pro individual worker. We are about the return to Australian workers of freedom of choice and the right to choose. Let us face it, the original act-which we are amending today-did not go as far as many people in my electorate wanted. They certainly ended up with a compromise, watered down by the Senate alliance of the ALP and the Australian Democrats-the real left wing of Australian politics. Those two parties should stand condemned for the way they have let Australian workers Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made under the legislation passed last year. The states have certainly played their part with complementary legislation. There is greater flexibility and industrial relations have become more harmonious as a result of promoting the cause of workers ahead of the union movement. Over 1,600 new agreements have been ratified----47 directly-between employees and their employers. So we have bosses and workers talking with each other again, without the union bosses interfering. Over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved, and the safety net for workers-which people often talk about-is still strongly in place through the no-disadvantage test. So a fair go all round is being proved on a daily basis in this country. There is still much more to be done. A small business operator told me the other day at Sunnybank in my electorate about how he has workers who regard the concept of the warning letters as a badge of honour. Some of his more militant workers regard the whole system of industrial relations as a big joke; they can do anything they like and, because he is a fairly small business operator, he is held over a barrel. Because of the way the system still operates, he has to be able to time off to go to hearings and conciliation sessions to try to sort out problems with workers. This is very unfortunate, because I submit that most bosses are essentially very good people. The honourable member for Melbers. bourne (Mr Tanner) made this concession before, as the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) noted, and the honourable member for Barton agreed. Most bosses in country this country look at their work force as a responsibility. They need them to work very lieutenants. hard and to work in the comfort of knowing they will be rewarded amply for their efforts. A lot of bosses I have spoken to simply say, 'If I have a dozen workers on my staff I have 13 mortgages to worry about.' They worry very much about the lot of their workers. This bill before us today is essentially summed up this way: it is a pro-small ness, pro-worker and pro-jobs initiative. discriminates in favour of small business employers with 15 or less workers. It allows greater freedom for managers in small busiensure nesses to exercise their prerogative without any great fear of expensive and tedious unfair dismissal proceedings. Bosses do not sack good staff. But when they want to exercise their managerial prerogative the system established by the previous government beats them up. This is cermovement tainly the fault of the ALP-Democrat alliance in the Senate which did not allow the full range of changes the people of Australia clearly voted for in the March 1996 election. The reason members opposite are so pasa sionate about the argument they are putting the bosses of the big unions in Australia not like it. If this is the case, then of the members of the Australian Labor Party this place certainly do not like it, because they are attached like puppets on a string their union masters. Union bosses ALP do not like it because it prevents the unions from getting as a right the subscripin tions and therefore the memberships of Ausand tralian workers. I submit union bosses in this country would be better off earning the support of workers as shown through their membership by being take proper advocates for workers, not just simply nest featherers at the expense of workers. I his see a lot of trade union magazines from time to time. The ones I have seen lately are spreading a lot of lies about this current government to try to garner some new memThe rest of the magazines seem to promote the need to go out and headhunt new members for the union movement. We all know union membership is declining in this as workers vote with their feet against the out-of-touch super union bosses and their The ACTU opposes provisions in this bill related to freedom of association. People in other countries on this planet have died for the right to associate and, for that matter, to disassociate and here we have the ACTU opposing provisions in this bill relating to freedom of association. I guess it means the busiACTU obviously has no faith in its own It ability to prove on merit to workers in Australia it deserves the membership they would want of their unions. Rather, they want to there are preference clauses existing in certified agreements to give union members an unfair advantage over non-union members or, worse still, to discriminate against those workers who rightly demand not to be part of the union. I am just left staggered as to how the union will respond to the various challenges they face in an environment where workers believe the union movement itself is out so of touch. What has the union movement done so far? They have got more out of touch by process of amalgamation, creating bigger is unions and bringing union bosses and hierdo archies further away from average workers. course This super union concept has simply made in matters worse and has confirmed in the minds of so many Australian workers why the union to movement is not worth supporting through the and the form of membership. This pro-worker government has included this bill provisions for disamalgamation for secret ballots initiated by workers themselves through the Federal Court to bring the union back to them and out of the high rise towers and the 7-series BMWs like the type I remember seeing the member .for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who has Just left the chamber, in on several occasions when he was travelling around as President of the ACTU. In fact, this policy approach by the government means that it will be possible for more unions to be established, not less. Better still, they will be unions responsiv- to workers needs, and this makes the Ulllon bosses even more beholden to the workers. The current approach seems to be !he revers-. This bill tidies up matters relatmg to thiS dis amalgamation process. The challenge is for the union movement to become more relevant-to become a 'must join' organisation. If they are doing a good job, workers are going to say, 'I hav- to be a part of that.' Obviou-ly work-rs beheve that the union movement IS not domg an adequate enough job. I certainly do support workers' righ!s to associate. to group together, to form Ulllons. The concept seems very reasonable to me, especially if it is a mechanism to truly protect the weak. However, the organised labour approach in this country has lost the support of most workers because it obviously is a case of the super unions instead manipulating the weak. We have heard scare campaigns conducted in the course of this debate here today. These sorts of scare campaigns are the way the organised labour movement in this .country and their puppets in this place deCIde to promote the need to be in a union. I encourage workers to get organised, to get angry if they feel they need to, and to take over the unions that they belong to. Do not allow your subscriptions, which are drawn automatically and taken from your wage, to be used simply by those who are actually trying to use you. There is another matter I want to touch on in regard to freedom of association. I once belonged to the AlA. When it wanted to be affiliated with the ACTU and the professional hacks took over I could not bring myself to be a part of that organisation. Mr Tanner-Madam Deputy Speaker, the point of order. I raise is the question of relevance. I understand that there is some liberty on these matters, but the member has not yet addressed the content of this bill, which relates to unfair dismissal provisions. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-There is no point of order. Resume your seat.",50
33,Mr HARDGRA VE,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I have been addressing the content of this bill throughout this contribution. I got out of the AlA because I decided when it wanted to affiliate with the super ACTU it was of no use to me. I went to the ABC about 18 months later and they told me they expected me to be a member. I then wrote to the AlA and said I would rejoin, but they told me that my resignation was not recognised, and in fact they asked me for I8-months back dues, which is extraordinary. It is absolutely extraordinary t.hat I could not possibly resign-make a chOice to actually get out of the organisation. I paid. Fortunately, this is no longer the case under the legislation we have introduced and - i!h what we are talking about today. I submit m most cases a compulsory anything is bad. I tum to the example of the Queensland University of Technology Student Guild. The new president of the QUT Liberal Club, L-e Benjamin, wrote to me the other day. He will take over from a chap called Gurdip Singh, who did a great job in the Liberal club. Lee, and people like Dan Hillier, Karl Eaves, Cameron Kretschmer-even Kylie Lindsay, the daughter of the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is a member-and members of t-e Griffith University Liberal club, run by Cassie MCAuliffe, are all concerned about compulsory student unionism. The QUT student elections are coming up in mid-September. The guild controls $3 million worth of student funds each year. Who controls it? The socialist dominated guild at the QUT controls it. In fact, at last year's federal election it slipped $34,000. of the $3 million into my electorate to campaign to put the Liberals last. This was the use of everybody's funds in a purely partisan way. Happily, the campaign backfired because the students and parents of the students in my electorate were outraged. The guild played such a role in the federal election it basically turned the whole thing back around and assisted the Liberal Party campaign. I am optimistic the QUT Liberal Club will be successful. One of the things they are very concerned about, and I agree with them, is that to date voluntary student unionism has not been introduced in Queensland. Mr Tanner-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order, again on relevance. I suspect that the member is under the misapprehension that we are debating a different Workplace Relations Amendment Bill here. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I have been listening to this. There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Tanner-We are debating the amendment bill relating to unfair dismissals. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Resume your seat! Mr Tanner-He has not mentioned that at all. He is now talking about voluntary student unionism. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-You have already made one speech. Resume your seat! I warn the member for Melbourne. You may not rise on a point of order vene in another member's speech in that manner. Mr Tanner-I wasn't intervening. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order!",52
34,Mr HARDGRA VE,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I am just about to conclude my remarks. I certainly am very concerned about matters relating to unfair dismissal, and I have talked about it in the course of my speech here today. The whole area of compulsory unionism, which is also a matter we are discussing and have been discussing in previous contributions today, seems to me to have at its heart, in areas like university campuses in my city of Brisbane, something that needs to be addressed. As far as voluntary student unionism is concerned, it would be a sign to the universities in Queensland that power is back in the hands of the students. It would have an effect on the financial base of student unions-it would stop their extensive support of Labor candidates in marginal seats-but, by the same token, I believe quite rightly the only good union is a voluntary union. If unions-at the student level, the workplace level and at the national level-are being responsive and doing the sorts of things that workers need them to do, they are going to get the membership they want and, they say, they deserve. That really is what we are talking about here today: freedom for workers, greater flexibility in the workplace, greater rights for small and medium enterprise employers and, hand in hand as a result, greater challenges for the union bosses who are so very much out of touch and who, in so many cases, are represented by people in this place. I commend the bill to the House.",53
35,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It is obvious that the Labor member who was listed to speak has been so overwhelmed by the positive arguments put forward by the coalition that he has run away from the debate. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 we are currently debating is a very simple piece of legislation that, once and for all, sounds the death knell for Laurie Brereton's jobs destroying unfair dismissal law for small businesses employing no more in order to interthan 15 people. I have listened very carefully to the debate and to the contributions made by opposition members. The way they go on piously talking about the rights of the workers, about the legislation introduced by the former Labor government, as though somehow it was a paragon of virtue, is absolutely sickening. Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan, they ought to remember, as you do, that when the Labor Party brought in its reform legislation in 1993 it shifted the pendulum away from the employers to employees resulting in employers, particularly small business proprietors, simply being too afraid to put on extra staff. The Labor Party is not known as the friend of small business, yet even it appreciated that the Brereton reforms went too far. The Labor Party itself, by regulation and by amendment through the parliament, sought to water down the devastating impact of the unfair dismissals laws. When those opposite come in here today to complain about what we are seeking to do, I believe they are displaying a very great degree of hypocrisy. The Labor Party in government ought to have done exactly what is being done in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill: that is, giving a fair go to small business. If we can generate, as we are, the environment in which small business is not afraid to put on staff, more jobs will be created and more Australians, particularly young Australians, will have the opportunity of getting into productive work. Members on this side of the House and I suspect members on that side of the House, if they were honest, would have to admit that since the 1993 legislation became law there has been a constant trail of constituents to doors of members of parliament complaining over the draconian consequences of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws, about the fact that they were simply not prepared to put on extra staff because they were concerned about the consequences if they found an employee was simply unable to do the job. As colleagues on this side have indicated, often an employer does not know how good an employee is until the employee is on staff. Most of us could relate horrendous situations where people who had been on the payroll for a relatively short period have been sacked and there have been very substantial claims made against employers. So this government decided that it simply was not going to huff and puff. We were not going to mouth pious platitudes; we were not going to go out there and tell an untruth. What this government has done is bring in legislation which once and for all will restore a situation where there is a fair go for all, where small business does not have the law slanted against it, so that small business will be able to give extra employees a chance of having a job. Mr Tanner interjecting",53
36,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I think that really is very important, and I am rather saddened that the honourable member for Melbourne is not supporting this legislation brought in by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). As announced in the government's statement of 24 March 1997 entitled More time for business, we aimed to have employees of small businesses employing no more than 15 people excluded from unfair dismissals provisions up to the time they have 12 months of continuous service. This change was to be made by regulation but, regrettably, in the Senate the regulation was disallowed following debate on 26 June 1997. Predictably, the Democrats and the ALP voted for the disallowance of this very important regulation which would have given some relief to small business. The government, of course, was not prepared to wear these attitudes in the Senate where what they were doing was preventing the small business from having an environment where it could actually put on extra staff. So the government announced on the same day that it would introduce legislation, and it brought in legislation providing for an indefinite general exclusion for small business from the draconian provisions of the unfair dismissals law. There also has been much noise emanating from those opposite about what this bill seeks to achieve. I think it is important to set the facts straight so that the people of Australia will know that this government is not attempting to destroy the rights of workers. We are not seeking to tum the clock back to the last century and we are not trying to deprive workers of a fair go. We are planning to create a balance. We aim to redress the inequities introduced by the Labor Party which remained on the statute books right through until we sought to alleviate them by a regulation. So what we are doing now is once and for all fixing up the disastrous changes that were made by the Labor Party. The definition of a small business for the purpose of this bill will be an employer employing 15 or fewer employees. For the purpose of counting employees, a casual employee need not be counted unless he or she has been employed on a regular or systemic basis for at least 12 months. The bill does not take away employees' rights to take action against unlawful termination of employment, that is, dismissal for any discriminatory reason such as age or pregnancy or dismissal without minimum notice. It is important to recognise that employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act, which protects employees against dismissal because of discriminatory reasons, as I have indicated, or because they have engaged in industrial action. The legislabusiness tion will also prohibit dismissal which involves victimisation. Employees must also be given one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct. We all recall that, under the legislation of the former government, people who were stealing from businesses often succeeded in their unfair dismissals claims and that employers were unable to put off people who were sexually harassing staff or customersthey were unable to sack those who were dishonest-but I think it is important to recognise that this legislation does achieve what our predecessors should have done and what regrettably they did not do. The bill does not apply to existing employees but only to an employee first engaged by the employer after the new law comes into operation. We believe very strongly in the rights of apprentices, and consequently the bill will affect the rights of apprentices, who have particular need for protection, given the impact that any break in continuity of service may have in the matter of the attainment of their qualifications. Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. It makes an enormous contribution to economic growth and job creation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be interested to know that there are 927,000 enterprises making up the Australian economy and that 810,000 of those are private, nonagricultural businesses, and that of these 97 per cent are small business. Small business generates one-third of the gross domestic product and accounts for 50 per cent of total employment in Australia. It is responsible for almost half of business employment in Australia-that is, 3.6 million jobs. Over the past 10 years employment in the small business sector has been growing at the rate of 3.6 per cent a year, more than twice the national average. Small business is increasingly innovative Australia. In fact, over 40 per cent of firms employing between 10 and 19 people undertake some innovative activity. That is yet another reason why we must support small and encourage it to grow and invest. We must create the environment, as we are in this bill, that will enable small business to be prepared to give people a chance, to put them on the payroll without being fearful of receiving horrendous verdicts against them in unfair dismissals claims. This government came to office inheriting a real mess. I think it was the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) opposite who said in a media release that, rather than fixing up the unfair dismissals law, the government should be restoring the economy or something to that effect. Everyone knows that when we inherited office in March last year the nation's accounts were in desperate need of repair. We inherited an economy loaded with heavy debts, huge deficits and high levels of unemployment. Interest rates were far too high. We know, as everyone knows in the Australian community, that the coalition has set not Australia on a new course of proper fiscal responsibility built on increased national savings, the maintenance of low inflation, reduced pressure on interest rates and restoring the underlying budget balance to surplus. The main building blocks for this are now in place. In headline terms, they include the recently passed workplace relations legislation, a successfully implemented budget strategy, inflation rates which compare favourably with our trading neighbours and five reductions in interest rates since our election. All of those things are of direct benefit to small business, and small business will obviously be much better off as a result of them. The government has also done more. But, despite everything that we had done, the one thing that people kept taking up with us was the need for us to protect small business from Labor's job destroying unfair dismissals law. Consequently, the legislation before the chamber has been introduced into the parliament, and we make absolutely no apology for it. We have on behalf of small business fixed in up the economy and now we are creating an environment where small businesses will not be terrified of what tribunals and courts are going to do to them when they put on people who simply are unable to shape up. Labor has tried to suggest that this government is treating people unfairly and that they will be left without any remedy. But it ought to be remembered that the former government itself kept watering down the position of workers in its original legislation. Our predecessors were well aware that something needed to be done, but they did not have the political courage to do it. Everyone realises that the unfair dismissals law was an experiment, but it was an experiment that failed because it simply changed the situation to one where the employers effectively had no rights. We think that is unacceptable. The government is very pleased to bring this legislation into the parliament. It is not retrospective. It is legislation which will create a situation where small business is prepared to put on extra people. We look forward with confidence to the support of the parliament. We believe that we will obtain the backing of this House, but I urge the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine in the Senate to support this bill because it ought to be above party politics.",54
37,Unknown,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Opposition members interjecting,56
38,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"This legislation is not about hurting the rights of Australian workers. If there are no jobs out there, there can be no rights for workers. There can be no workers. The legislation introduced into the parliament by the Labor Party in 1993, or that part of it that now remains, is still undermining the chances of people getting a job in the Australian community. In this bill we are standing up for the Australian worker. Mrs Crosio-Rubbish!",56
39,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The honourable member for Prospect should know better. You are the people who, through your repressive legislation, have ensured that generations of Australians are thrown on to the dole queue. Why can't you stand up and admit that you have failed over the last 13 years? Why can you not come in and say: 'We tried. We thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was an absolute flop'? Why don't you come into the parliament and explain why you did not fix up the unfair dismissals law when very quickly it became apparent that it was totally unsatisfactory, totally hopeless and totally destructive of job opportunities? But no, you will not be honest. You come in here when this government is fixing up another one of your problems and try to stop us. You will do absolutely anything to frustrate this government. That is disgusting because, in doing so, you are undermining the job opportunities of Australian workers. I believe that if we have an election based on a double dissolution as a result of your recalcitrance in this legislation then once again you will be rejected, as you were so comprehensively rejected in the election in March last year. I commend the bill to the House.",56
40,Mrs CROSIO,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I must say at the very beginning that never has so much huff and bubble been said in this House with so very little consequence. If the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) were truly honest in reading the bill he would realise that the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is symbolic of the contempt that the Howard coalition holds not only for the job security of Australian workers but for the intelligence of the Australian electorate at large. This bill has been born not out of genuine desire to provide Australian small businesses and their employees with the most productive and equitable workplace possible but out of helplessness and impotency and despair. This government is gripped by helplessness after failing to make anything even resembling a dent in this nation's unemployment figures in its first 18 months in office. The government is floundering in impotency when it has come to producing the goods for the constituency to which its fortunes are most closely tiedsmall business. We have a government whose backbenchers are wringing their hands in despair at the effect that their own policies and mismanagement have had in greatly adding to the deep insecurity many ordinary Australians are feeling in their jobs. To try to drag itself out of the hole into which it has sunk, this government, for purely political reasons, has settled on this bill so it can at least be seen to be doing something constructive both for small business and on the jobs front. Too bad that it is more interested in showy political displays than in actually delivering sound and equitable policy. This is a bill which could ultimately prove destructive for thousands of Australian workers and their families. As the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), pointed out in his speech in the second reading debate, the question of unfair dismissal has been surrounded by hysteria and myth making, driven in no small measure by the coalition when in opposition for its own political benefit. The coalition's complaints about the unfair dismissal laws were exposed as a load of hot air when it finally came to power. Its so called new unfair dismissal arrangements bore many similarities to the old laws. As with Labor's laws, the coalition's unfair dismissal provisions contained in its Workplace Relations Act applied to all employers, irrespective of their size. As with Labor's laws, the coalition's unfair dismissal provisions excluded a number of classes of employees, such as those employees serving a probation period. But this did not stop the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) tripping over each other to inform the Australian people of just how many more would benefit now that Labor's unfair dismissal laws had been overthrown. Small business would boom, they said. Jobs would flow. The land of milk and honey was just around the comer: We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous ... system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. So said the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Peter Reith. So why, after the government has trumpeted its changes to aU and sundry and shouted from the rooftops that its industrial relations reform agenda was now complete, does it now see the need to return to the drawing boards and do it all over again? That is what this bill is all about. As I said, it has to be seen to be doing something-anything. As the ABS statistics now show us, since January 1997, when the new unfair dismissal law came into effect, national trend employment growth has continued to fall. In Victoria, trend unemployment has even slipped into negative growth. The recently released Yellow Pages Index shows us that more than 80 per cent of smaU businesses believe that the economy overall is either in recession or at a standstill. Only eight per cent believe that lower interest rates have really done them any good. So out there in the real world the Howard government is not travelling too well. The electorate want jobs, and this government is not creating any. Small business want help, and this government is not giving them any. The polls are bad. The small business index is even worse, and it all leads to a helpless, impotent and despairing government looking for grand gestures about which it can make even grander statements. As a result, we have this bill which, if passed, will exempt all small businesses from the unfair dismissal provisions in relation to workers employed on or after the commencement of the bill. This means about two million-and I repeat, for the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) opposite, two million workers-now protected against being unfairly dismissed will ultimately lose that protection. Their employment will be far less secure. So two million workers could be placed at the mercy of some-and I say some, not all-shonky operators and dishonourable small business go all owners who could take advantage. I believe those shonky ones will take advantage of the new laws to exploit their staff. This government wants to paint itself as the worker's friend. This is not friendship; this is callous disregard and contempt. As I said in my introductory comments, it also shows contempt for [he intelligence of the Australian electorate as well. Who said in the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 February last year that any exemption for small businesses concerning the unfair dismissals laws has been flatly ruled out? The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Why has he changed his mind? Because his promises mean nothing to him and he is full of contempt for the Australian electorate at large. Who said on the John Laws program on 25 January last year: I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that is fair to both sides that if you are doing your job properly you cannot be capriciously dismissed. None other than the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that's who. Why has he not stuck to his word? Because he is willing to place the careers and the futures of Australian workers at risk in a vain attempt to improve his standing with small business. Who said in Perth on 11 July 1995: We're not going to replace Labor's unfair dismissal laws with a law that gives ruthless employers carte blanche. The Prime Minister again, that's who. So why is his government doing just that? Because the Prime Minister allowing ruthless employers 'carte blanche' - his words-is easier now than selling the government's previous reforms to the Australian people. The joke of it all is that small businesses really do not give too much of a damn about the unfair dismissal regulations. The most recent Morgan and Banks jobs survey, conducted, I might add, among 3,500 small business organisations, revealed that 80 per cent of small business employers did not believe that the existence of the unfair dismissal laws affected their decisions to employ new staff. Only 16 per cent of small business employers believed that they would benefit from the proposal to exempt them from the unfair dismissal laws-only 16 per cent-yet we have a bill like this before the parliament. Incidentally, these statistics were basically the same for all other sizes of businessmedium and big business alike-which would indicate to anyone with their heads screwed on correctly that unfair dismissal laws are not a special concern of small business employers. A recent ACCI survey of small business showed unfair dismissal laws ranked a distant seventh out of eight-far behind poor sales and a sluggish economy-in regard to what employers saw as the main impediments to employment. If members on the other side would still rather not believe me, I ask them to take a look at the most recent Yellow Pages Index report on small business again. What do small business owners out there in the areas say they consider to be the most so pressing, most urgent matters crying out for federal government reform? If you listened to the government speakers opposite you would expect to find unfair dismissal laws at the top of the list, but it is not. It is at the bottom. Only three per cent of small business people surveyed by the Yellow Pages Small Business Index regarded the unfair dismissal provision as an area crying out for urgent federal government reform. It is behind more important issues which have received nothing but neglect from this government after 18 months in office, such as the recommendations of the fair trading report and the need for a growing economy. If the opinions of small business owners are not enough for the government members, perhaps the cold hard facts as to how many small businesses are actually subjected to unfair dismissal claims will help them realise the futility of their current quest. The 1995-96 annual report of the Industrial Relations Court shows that small businesses had fewer unfair dismissal claims than any other employers. Let us start with the fact that the unfair dismissal filing rate was slightly under two per cent of all monthly involuntary terminations. Only a third of this figure is from the small business sector, and this is despite the fact that over 90 per cent of employers have fewer than 20 employees. These really are the cold hard facts and I believe they make a laughing-stock of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. They make a laughing-stock of every single one of the government's speakers we have heard today on this bill-all full of mock concern and outrage that we in opposition would even dream of voting against the supposedly 'fair' and 'necessary' measures which this bill contains. The speakers on the other side like to brag about how they are the party of small business. They make endless speeches about how their members spring directly from the ranks of small business. If that is the case, knowing what lies at the root of this piece of legislation and how useless it would be, they should be even more ashamed of themselves. I quote from experience because my husband and I owned and operated a small business in the Sydney suburb of Smithfield for 32 years and I employed up to six people. I know how to run a small business and I know what hard work it is: the hours you keep, the little time you have to spend with your familyespecially when you are also trying to juggle a political career at the same time. Speaking as that former small business person I am amazed that the government is even wasting its time with this amendment. Speaking as a politician I can see that it doing so out of the basest political motives. Australia does not need these amendments the the opposition recognises it, small business owners and their employees recognise deep down, behind their wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth and all the moaning and groaning, the government members know it too. We have a government willing, for its own political ends, to sew inequity and unfairness into the Australian workplace. They promised a fair go, they promised 'no open slather', yet now they seem intent on breaking these promises. Why are workers for large and tended medium businesses deemed eligible for reasonable protection under the unfair dismissal laws small business employees are not? doesn't the legislation distinguish between vexatious claims and genuine ones? Why is the size of a business the only factor worthy of classification? Why do the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business continue to travel the length and breadth of this nation calling on people to give their workplace reforms a chance sink in while refusing to offer the same grace period to the unfair dismissal laws which were brought in at the same time and as part of that same legislation? The answers are very short in because the answer is simple. Appearances are more important to this government than actually delivering the goods. They want appear to have the answers for small business; they want to appear to have the answers for job growth. But just 18 months after taking office it is now all too apparent that appearances do not count for the small business owners and the workers of Australia-they are turning off this government in droves. I really find this bill a most contemptible piece of legislation, brought in such a short time after the previous bill, which has not even been given time to work. I condemn the government for it.",56
41,Mr ROCHER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"'It is ridiculous. It is trivial. We do not want to have to be worrying about protecting ourselves from the law at every tum.' That was the verbatim reaction of one small business is owner to the former Labor administration's unfair dismissal laws, and it is a reflection of antagonism towards a policy that has proved to be one of Australia's biggest disinit and, centives to employment. The decision by the Howard government to partially exempt small businesses with a staff numbering 15 or fewer from the unfair dismissal laws is an important one. It is one that will take Australia a step further down the road of labour market reform. But, if this move is to produce the sort of lasting productivity gains that the coalition claims it will, one has to wonder why it has not been exacross the whole business sector. It is to wonder, isn't it? After all, the and principal act, the Workplace Relations Act, Why provides for such an extension. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill makes it clear that it will not have significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. By the government's own admission, revenue protection is not an issue here. The coalition continually asserts-and rightly so-that small to business is the engine room of the economy. In Western Australia, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry has noted that this sector accounts for over 95 per cent of all the state's businesses and more than half of coming, private sector employment. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) glibly referred to to comments by a representative of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia in his second reading speech. He quoted Mr Rob Bastion as saying that the partial exclusion of small businesses from unfair dismissal was the 'jewel in the crown' of the coalition's small business policy. Mr Bastion is cited as saying: That is one which will actually create jobs ... I am certain of it. That is hardly a ringing endorsement of the rest of the government's small business policy, nor has it proven to be a very accurate prediction, given that the latest unemployment figures show that the jobless rate remains on the increase with a rise of 0.2 per cent to 8.7 per cent in July. Soon after the introduction of the bill which led to the present principal act, the Assistant Director of the Business Council of Australia suggested that a more aggressive overhaul of Australia's labour market was in order. A spokeswoman for the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has responded that the government was waiting for employees to 'avail themselves of the flexibility offered by the current legislation' before seeing whether greater change was necessary. Small business has known about the coalition's commitment to this legislation since 24 March 1997. Despite this unemployment has continued to increase and small business proprietors remain reluctant to engage additional staff. So why not make it easier for the private sector to employ by including all businesses in this exemption? This bill will not affect the rights of apprenReith-Kernot tices or of existing employees. Additionally, employees of a small business will continue to have the right to take action against the unlawful termination of employment. In short, this bill will continue to provide a satisfactory level of protection to employees. The current regulations which prevent an employee from being dismissed because of involvement in protected industrial action or because of victimisation remain intact. Similarly, the bill makes no change to existing rules that prevent a dismissal without a strict adherence to the statutory minimum notice requirements. At the same time it is designed to reassure small business owners that they do not have to protect themselves from the law at every tum. It is designed to allow small business proprietors to become more productive, and to remove what has become a major constraint on big business competitiveness. It is designed to generate much needed economic growth. As I said at the outset, the government deserves credit for releasing an albeit small proportion of business operators from the onerous and outdated unfair dismissal statute. But the decision to extend the velvet glove to some enterprises while excluding others will only further complicate the original Workplace Relations Act. As a former finance minister of New Zealand, Mrs Ruth Richardson, noted last year: In the politics of reform you have to go for the first best. You only get one shot at reform, so you have to keep it simple and clear. There are no second chances at reform. She went on to say: Second best reforms, like the Australian Workplace Relations Bill, only yield fourth or fifth best results. You become a double loser because you deny the full yield of the reform, and because you suffer an enduring loss of credibility, when piecemeal halfmeasures don't work. The principal workplace relations policy was supposed to be an 'all or nothing' package, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker. Instead, the government agreed to a multitude of concessions in its negotiations with who else but the Australian Democrats to facilitate the passage of the legislation through the Senate. It became widely known, and still is, as the legislation, and I can understand why. For the minister to have come out of that meeting and present as some great achievement the concessions he made, his appeasement to Senator Kernot, without even having gone to his party room or even his cabinet, I suspect, for approval was one of the great public confidence tricks I have ever seen. But I have digressed. This may have been a necessary evil, but it disappointed many in the business sector and prompted one economist to describe the act as a 'mild' piece of labour market reform that was 'not radical enough to be expected to have major impacts on unemployment'. The minister conceded as much when he introduced this bill. He said that, although the existing Workplace Relations Act had introduced important changes, it had not gone far enough for small business. The same is true of this bill. An acceleration of regulatory reform is essential if Australian industry is to reassert itself in the international marketplace. Business Review Weekly noted in its editorial of 12 February 1996 that the paperwork burden on small business could be reduced by 50 per cent but only 'by a thorough tax reform'. The money and time spent by small businesses complying with their burdensome taxation obligations will not be substantially lessened by chipping away at the edges of that particular problem. In the same way, if Australia is ever to recover from the disastrous anti-employment impact of Labor's unfair dismissal legislation, exemptions from it must be more extensive than in the past and than is now proposed. It is a pity that the Democrats and the other minor party in the Senate cannot come to grips with that. Were it not for their decision to move a motion of disallowance against the regulation relating to unfair dismissal in the principal act, this bill would not have even been necessary. During debate on the Workplace Relations Act I said that those who opposed the bill were threatening Australia's economic future. The same applies in this instance. Small businesses are confidence driven. They want to see stability and consistency in government policy. Making regular amendments to industrial relations legislation or any other legislafrom tion which affects their day-today operations does not inspire confidence. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business made it clear in his second reading speech that the government's industrial relations policy is integral to its formula for promoting growth and development. Economic growth and development are especially important in the light of the most recent report by the Institute for Management Development, IMD, which compared our rate of competitiveness in the global marketplace with that our of our OECD contemporaries. The report confirmed that Australia is becoming increasingly uncompetitive and that this is due to three key factors. Our poor performance in the industrial relations area is one of them. According to the IMD, industrial disputes, corporate credibility, compensation levels, yearly wage growth and industrial relations 'contributed significantly to Australia's below average performance'. It was this result that prompted the authors of the 1996 spring edition of Policy to note: Nowhere is reform more urgent than in the labour market. Labour market reform should be concerned with increasing flexibility and improving work practices. But industrial relations is not the only portfolio where the government must bite the bullet and start taking some hard decisions. As Dr John Marsden, the economic adviser for the Yellow Pages Small Business Index, noted in March 1997, the key drivers of small business are private consumption, noninvestment dwelling and home building. He observed that, while a reduction in red tape is 'highly desirable' in promoting employment, the government must 'lift demand growth to ensure that small business shares in the 1997 upturn'. Mr Tanner-Absolutely.",59
42,Mr ROCHER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Thank you. In March 1997, the Australian Certified Practising Accountants small business index demonstrated that 15 per cent of small businesses had placed the extension of the exemption from unfair dismissal at the top of their wish list the federal government. This figure must be compared with the 80 per cent that believe tax reform was what was most critical to improving the lot of small business. In introducing this bill, the minister said that the government 'has been listening to the concerns of small business'. Then why does the government continue to refuse to give any kind of formal undertaking to introduce a total overhaul of our tax system? Despite what the minister had to say earlier this year, this bill should not be regarded as the 'icing on the cake', nor the 'final plank' in the policy change that we have had in connection with unfair dismissals. Mr Lyndon Rowe, the Chief Executive of CCI (WA), noted in a lette- to the Australian Financial Review on 7 Apn11997: The reform agenda for Australia is far from finished ... We need pressure put on the coalition government continue the reform process. Mr Rowe is correct in that assertion. There is still much work to be done if we are to maximise the benefits of an improved and more flexible labour market system. Australia is inextricably part of the global stage. All indicators now suggest that we have to improve our place in the competitive ladder, and to do this we must continue to push for meaningful reform in both the area of industrial relations and in tax reform.",61
43,Mr LINDSAY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Herbert) (1.24 p.m.)When I was elected at the last election I gave a commitment to the small business men and women of Townsville and Thuringowa to do everything that I could to get rid of Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws. Today represents a significant step for me in fulfilling that commitment. I am probably as well qualified as any other person in this place to speak about the effect of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill , which we are discussing today. I have run a small business now for 25 years. It employs 14 people. Before I entered the parliament, year after year I went through the concerns of whether I should employ another person, whom I desperately needed to employ, because it may be very difficult to change those circumstances if the person did not turn out to be the right person. Mr Tanner-You mean sack them.",62
44,Mr LINDSAY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"In running a business, people always have to be mindful of their expenses and income. Unfortunately, small business is not run like the government. Small business does not have guaranteed income. Small business runs from day to day and operates in the flexibility of the market. There are upturns and there are downturns. Small business people have to be very careful about how they manage in most instances the most expensive cost in running a business. In my mind as a manager, I did not employ people because of Labor's unfair dismissal laws. This bill is not about sacking people. This bill is about jobs. It is about employing people. It is about giving business the confito dence to employ more people as they need them. So I am backing this bill because, for me and for the small business community, it delivers jobs. I have noticed over recent months opposition members going around the country trying to exorcise the unfair dismissal laws they have implemented as if they were dead weight. They are trying to fool the business community into thinking that Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal laws are no longer theirs; that suddenly, after some amendments they opposed to ease the burden on small businesses, they are now the Howard government's unfair dismissal laws. I have some news for members opposite: the small business community have not forgotten, nor will they forget, that the unfair dismissal laws were your handiwork. It was the handiwork of the Labor Party. Let me repeat that: the small business community have not forgotten, nor will they forget, that the unfair dismissal laws were your handiwork. The opposition no longer want ownership of their unfair dismissal laws, and that does not surprise me one bit. They will still defend them tooth and nail in this House for the benefit of their union mates. They will kick up a stink about any reforms to their laws, but they do not want to accept responsibility for them. That is the real difference between Labor and Liberal, opposition and government. As a government we accept our responsibilities. We did not create the $10,000 million budget deficit, but we have faced up to our responsibilities as a government and we have done something about it. We did not drive apprenticeships and traineeships to their lowest level in recent memory, but we have faced up to our responsibilities as a government and we are doing something to fix it. The business that I am responsible for is a technical business. I can no longer find trained staff to operate that business because of what your lot did to the apprenticeship system in our state. It is just disgraceful. The same applies to the unfair dismissal laws. We did not dream up these ridiculous laws .. The Labor Party did. The Howard coalition government did not implement the unfair dismissal laws. The Labor Party did. We fought them tooth and nail in opposition but now that we are in government we are facing up to our responsibilities as a government and we are doing something to fix that problem. We are for jobs. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating recognised what Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws were doing to the Labor Party and its image in the lead-up to the last election. Yet the best that Keating could come up with was a half-hearted promise a few days out from the election to take a second look at the unfair dismissal laws if his government were re-elected. Thank heavens the government was not re-elected. That is the difference between the Howard government and the former Labor government: for 13 years the Labor Party said they would do something for small business and did nothing; we are actually doing something to ease the burden on small business and doing something about business confidence. And the ALP opposition does not like it one bit. So this bill provides the means for Townsville and Thuringowa businesses employing 15 or fewer people to be exempt from unfair dismissal action in relation to new employees who are, after royal assent of this bill, employed for less than 12 months. The small business community, including my small business community, want this reform because they recognise that under the previous government's ridiculous system they could not get rid of people who proved they simply were not up to the job, through no fault of their own. These changes will allow small businesses to take on new employees with much greater certainty. When it comes to employing people, confidence and certainty are very important. Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you that just the other week the Queensland state parliament voted in favour of similar legislation to what is proposed today. Queenslanders led the way in introducing workplace relations reforms at the state level, mirroring in many respects the changes that I am supporting here this afternoon. The state Minister for Training and Industrial Relations, the Hon. Santo Santoro, is to be commended for his leading role in this reform. Indeed, in Townsville and Thuringowa and throughout North Queensland, these changes to workplace relations at state level have been welcomed by many small business operators. Townsville Chamber of Commerce President, Mal Missingham, was quoted in the local media recently as saying that the exemptions would encourage small business to hire new staff, which I think is the central point of the reforms being debated today. This is why I say that this bill is not about sacking people; this bill is about jobs. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said in his speech in the second reading debate: . . . this exemption is not just about removing a burden from small business, it is about the positive employment benefits of the expanded job opportunities that will surely result from the removal of that burden. These changes will enable Townsville and Thuringowa small businesses to hire new employees with greater certainty, which can only enhance job prospects, particularly the job prospects of young Australians. It certainly disappoints me when I hear the speeches of members opposite. I understand that they speak passionately and I understand that they speak from the heart, but it is such a shame that they are wrong. They do not understand the operations of business. They do not understand how this legislation can bring back business confidence and, with it, jobs. All small business operators from time to time have agonised over the process of taking on a new staff member at one time or another. Taking on a new employee is very much like taking a gamble-how do you really know if you have the right person until you give them a go? That is the dilemma. Small business people do not have the same personnel recruiting resources that bigger businesses have access to. They simply do not, and the ALP opposition and the unions need to wake up to themselves to understand this. Mr James O'Donnell, the North Queensland Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, is certainly one person who needs a dose of reality in relation to life as a small business owner. He came up with the ridiculous claim recently that most problems small businesses face in relation to this issue are as a result of poor management, a statement which I think is reflective of the ALP's and the union movement's attitude to small business. Mr Tanner-Jimmy is all right.",62
45,Mr LINDSAY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Is the member for Melbourne supporting Mr O'Donnell? I would not if I were you. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise that small business operators do not have endless hours to spend in exhaustive recruiting processes. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise that small business operators cannot always afford to spend hundreds of dollars getting a recruiting company to do the hiring for them. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise that small business operators have to make all the personnel decisions themselves on top of everything else that they do. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise this, the unions need to realise all of this and the ALP needs to realise all of this as well. The fact is that do not know until you give someone a try whether or not they are the right person for the job. I have heard many small business operators in Herbert say that they are putting off hiring new staff because they feared the person was not right for the job and they would be sued for unfair dismissal if they tried to replace that person. Small businesses certainly need the certainty that, if they take on a person who turns out to be unsatisfactory, they can do something to correct that situation without being sued in return. That proposition is eminently fair and sensible. Mr O'Donnell claims that hiring an inadequate person in the first place is bad management. Politely, that is hogwash. The Federated Clerks Union can call it bad management if they want, but I call it giving someone a fair go. How else are we going to get the large number of young; unemployed Australians off the dole queue and into jobs unless we start giving them a fair go? At the moment small business people in Townsville and Thuringowa are saying that they would like to give young Australians a fair go but, because of the situation with Labor's unfair dismissal laws, they simply cannot take the risk. Frivolous unfair dismissal claims are threatening the livelihood of small businesses. The cost to small businesses of defending unfair dismissal claims is considerable. It is considerable in dollars and it is considerable in terms of time that small business owners need to spend away from their business defending these claims. On this point, I would like to put on the record one of the most uninformed comments concerning small business and unfair dismissal laws. Again, it comes from the North Queensland spokesman for the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, Mr James O'Donnell. He said: To argue that small business could go out of business because of unfair dismissals is crazy. Obviously, Mr O'Donnell has no concept of the burden Labor's unfair dismissal laws are placing on North Queensland small businesses. The Labor opposition, in opposing tooth and nail these necessary reforms, have shown you that they have learnt nothing since March 1996. I hope we can have a rational debate on this legislation. I hope that the government is successful in convincing the opposition how wrong they are. I certainly will be proudly voting for this piece of legislation.",64
46,Mr DARGAVEL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I commence by declaring my interest. I am a member, and very proudly so, of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. I was a representative of that organisation for some years. I say proudly so because it was my privilege to represent workers who were unfairly, unjustly or harshly terminated by unscrupulous employers, many of whom were small business operators who had unfairly terminated a worker's job. What needs to be remembered in this debate is the consequences for the worker on losing his or her job, the consequences for the family and the fact that workers suffer a great deal of hardship, not only financial hardship but also emotional hardship, and emotional distress when dealing with all sorts of terrible things that happen to families and workers who are unfairly dealt with. The greatest concern for all Australians under this government is their ability to find a job and, having found one, their ability to keep it. That is why we cannot feed on workers' insecurities by exempting small businesses from unfair dismissal laws. Contrary to the rhetoric of organisations like the H.R. Nicholls Society, that lunar right organisation which has an anti-worker agenda and which does not operate in the interests of any decent person in this country, the major concern of small business in this country is not industrial relations legislation. In fact, 97 per cent of small business say it is not really the priority. If small business say that it is not the priority, the question has to be asked: why does the government say that it is a priority for small business? It is a condescending attitude perpetrated by the government, or perhaps it is a duplicitous one. The real issues advocated by small business people in Australia are not unfair dismissal laws; they are things like lessee arrangements and franchisee rights. They are things that this government will not act on. They are things that small business people say they want action on but this government is too gutless to take on big business interests and actually sort out the problems that small business want sorted out. In my electorate people who are lessees and franchisees are getting nailed to the wall. They are dealt with by very large businesses in a very unfair way. They are under a huge amount of pressure. That affects their capacity to employ people. That is what they want fixed up. When they come and see me and talk about the sorts of things they want this parliament to take up and resolve for them, they do not talk about unfair dismissal; they talk about the things that are affecting their commercial operation. The industrial relations laws of this country are not stopping small business from hiring workers; it is issues such as lessee rights, franchisee rights and commercial interest rates, which are still exorbitantly high. Industry policy and consumer confidence are things that small business wants fixed up. Industry policy has been the subject of a lot of debate in this chamber. Businesses want an industry policy from government. They want things like a steel plan and a car industry plan. They want industry policy, they want industry leadership and they want the government to take action on the issues which affect them, not the political agendas of the H.R. Nicholls Society, as articulated by that society's members in this chamber. Behind the message that small business is the engine room of jobs growth is the other message that somehow small businesses are to blame for the lack of performance in jobs growth. The Liberals are trying to get the rest of the country to excuse them in their lack of industry policy for not creating employment and for not giving people real jobs by blaming it on the small business sector. The government have already changed the industrial relations legislation. When they brought it in they heralded it with a lot of fanfare and said that they had fixed up all the problems, and wasn't it wonderful, and that, arising from the changes to the industrial relations legislation, employment would be stimulated. None of us on this side of the House believed-and certainly this was not my belief-that employment growth would arise from attacking workers' rights. That is what the facts bear out. Where is your employment growth? Come on, where is it? Where are all the jobs that came out of the last round of industrial relations changes ? You attacked the workers last time. You would have liked to have continued but you had some difficulties in doing so. Nonetheless, you managed to attack workers' rights. Where is the employment growth? There has not been any. Employment growth does not arise from making everyone worried and concerned about their job security. In fact, the opposite scenario can be advocated: there is a lack of consumer confidence brought about by people having a fundamental concern about their security. At the last election one of the underlying issues in the electorate in my view was a concern over constant change and a sense of insecurity. When the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), talked about making people comfortable and relaxed, he tapped into that sentiment. People actually want to be more comfortable and confident in their futures. This legislation does not deliver that. This is not an insignificant measure on behalf of the government. This affects over two million workers-a lot of people. The government are now saying that the legislation is not working and they like to give us a bit more of a dose. They want to blame it on the Labor government. The current legislation was brought down by the Liberal government, the coalition government. It was drafted by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, it got through the parliament and it was made into law. It was owned by the coalition. You made it, not the Labor Party. Now you say that it is not good enough. The question has to be asked about your confidence in your own competence. According to the Minister for Industrial Relations at the time, there would not be so much as a ripple of change to the legislation-no third wave-yet there has been. But, like so much of the rhetoric coming from the coalition, it was essentially an empty promise. Now you are back here after another round of attack. The Prime Minister said: I'm not going to leave employees exposed to dismissal by capricious employers ... That is precisely what this legislation does. By taking away unfair dismissal but leaving unlawful termination as a remedy, you essentially make it impossible for someone who has been unlawfully terminated to mount a successful case. The unscrupulous employer who wishes to terminate someone for an unjust, unreasonable reason-race, religion, gender, pregnancy, political orientation or that they choose to join a union-will carry out terminations on those bases. It would be nigh on impossible to exercise rights afforded on paper because the employer would never have to answer questions like, 'Why did you sack the person?' The employer would be able to say, 'I didn't sack them unlawfully, I just sacked them unfairly, and the parliament says that is fine. The government has given me the green light to treat people unfairly. And, by the way, I am not going to put on extra people for having that extra right.' A month before the election, the Prime Minister told his adviser, John Laws, on radio that he would not have a law where an unreasonable employer could capriciously sack a decent, hard working employee. That is precisely what this legislation provides. It provides for employers to capriciously sack workers. On ABC Daybreak, three days before the election, the then Minister for Industrial Relations-now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith)-said, 'Our position is very clear: if you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.' This legislation takes away the right of appeal from someone who has been dealt with unfairlynot unlawfully; unfairly. The government made clear commitments to the electorate. It gained governance on the basis of commitments made to the workers of this country: that Australian workers would not be worse off under their regime and that workers who were unfairly dealt with at work would have a right of appeal. And that is what you are taking away. Labor's unfair dismissal provisions applied to all employers irrespective of their size. The provisions did, however, exclude a number of unfair classes of employees, including employees serving a probationary period where that was notified and reasonable. The idea of having a notified and reasonable probationary period accords with what small business need and want in order to make their hiring and firing decisions. There could be no impediment to small business hiring and firing workers when they were able to institute a fair and just probationary period with new workers. That was the regime under the previous legislation. The intellectual argument to justify this attack on almost half of the country's workers is not available to you. You do not have the intellectual argument. There is plenty of rhetoric about small business not being able to hire people and being bound up in red tape and all the rest of it, but the fact is that, you put in your last reforms, we did not see any employment growth. Employment growth will not come out of this legislation either. According to the ABS, the bill affects over two million workers. How does it affect them? We have talked a little about procedural fairness. The bill removes all semblance of procedural fairness for workers. The reason why procedural fairness is required is that workers who have had accusations made about them should have the opportunity of responding to them. It is a fairly commonly accepted and decent proposition, which is not unreasonable or outrageous, that if someone makes an accusation about you, you have the opportunity of responding to it before you lose your income. It does not mean much to members opposite, but for Australian workers-almost half of them-to be denied the opportunity of responding to allegations made about them over misunderstandings and so on that arise from time to time is outrageous. The bill removes unfair dismissal provisions but it boasts that it still retains sanctions against unlawful dismissal. That is misleading. It is quite clear that this is code for allowing unscrupUlous employers to dismiss workers unfairly. An example is where an employer wants to sack a worker on the basis of their union membership. This would be technically unlawful. However, it would be almost impossible for the worker to bring an action against the employer in this instance. In my view, this is essentially a spiteful piece of legislation. The working class in this country kept the coalition out of government for 13 years, and now it is payback time. There is no reasonable explanation outside of that scenario. There is no intellectual, rational or logical support for this legislation. This legislation will not stimulate jobs. It will not stimulate employment opportunities for young people-the last legislation did not. This is simply going to pour petrol on the fire of uncertainty in the population. That is not a good thing for the people or for the nation as a whole.",64
47,Mr MCDOUGALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Griffith) (1.51 p.m.)Unlike the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), when I rise to speak to the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 not just to represent a union but also to represent the total membership of my electorate, whether they are employers or employees. We often hear from the other side of the chamber about conflict of interest. Accusations of conflict of interest are made against this side of the House in relation to many bills discussed here. I suggest that being a financial member of a union might just rate as a conflict of interest when we are discussing a bill such as the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill. The members on the other side who are all members of unions-not just one, but the lot-certainly have a very major point to raise. The reason I stand to speak to this bill to amend the Workplace Relations Act is quite simple: it is what the business community in my electorate has demanded. The business organisations I represent are pretty typical of others throughout the nation. My Brisbane electorate is diverse, with many well-established suburbs and old, established businesses. There are large areas of new development, with modem shopping centres and small business operators who have joined in this residential growth area. My electorate also has a large area of residential acreage. Most of the people who have chosen this lifestyle have done so because they run a business from their small properties. The message I get from the full range of small business operators in my electorate is very loud and clear. They want changes to the Workplace Relations Act, changes that will give them the same rights as their employees, and that is a fair go. There is no chance that I am misreading this message. I have held public meetings, several of which were addressed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who regularly visits my electorate. I have attended chamber of commerce meetings and numerous dinners, lunches and breakfasts with all manner of business organisations. I have met and spoken with business people ranging from executives of the Chinese business community to the retailers of my local shopping centre. I can say without fear of contradiction that they want substantial changes to the unfair dismissal provisions in particular. More than that, most want them eliminated all together. They are seen as a giant claw which is strangling small business and making it difficult, if not impossible, to employ staff. What must be made clear is that this amendment, while giving some small business operators freedom from the unfair dismissal provisions, does not remove the workers' rights or diminish the workers' powers of legal action if they are treated unfairly by employer. But it does allow small business operators to run their businesses without being blackmailed. Anyone who says that this has not been happening has not been out about in the marketplace. Small business operators who need only one or staff members cannot afford to employ a stranger while there is a threat of un affordable liti-ation hanging over their heads. To put it in a nutshell: too many business people are taken to the cleaners by unscrupuhad lous employees who know full well that the business operator has not the funds nor the resources for a legal battle. The small busidismissed. ness community in my electorate is hurting and hurting badly. That is a 13-year legacy from the other side of this chamber. Business people have made it quite clear that they expected a change in the state of affairs with the change in government. The message I unfair dismissal. have been given is that, until we give employers some of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by their staff, hiring will continue to remain as difficult as firing. It is simplistic to say that there are two sides to every story. We all know there is. But here is one I have been able to observe from close quarters and know to be very true. The employer in question is worked six days a week to maintain the business founded by her husband 20 years ago. Her fault as a businesswoman is that is not ruthless enough. In fact, she is downintroduced right motherly. She raised seven children has the ingrained habit of treating her staff part of her extended family. She has assisted with loans, supplied company vehicles for private use, pays well over award wages and has always encouraged flexible hours to suit the needs of her staff, particularly those with young children. Two years ago, faced with increasing competition, rising property values and other commercial factors, she was forced to scale down the business by more than 50 per cent. Scaling down this company did not happen overnight. In fact, it took more than a year. The building had to be sold and smaller premises founded. During the many months the building was up for sale, the staff were an well aware that five of the eight permanent positions would go in the change. It was clearly understood. Everyone had time off, if needed, when looking for other work. The day and came and the business moved to smaller premises with the hope that the change would two extra mean commercial survival. All this was stressful enough for the businesswoman in question, but nothing compared to what she was about to receive in perfectly legal harassment. The small businesswoman underestimated the greed factor. In fact, she had not considered any of her staff could or would consider that they had been unfairly The closing of the old business and the opening of the new but smaller venture had been a sad parting-the end of an era. There had been a closing down gathering, a farewell party, gifts and p'romises to keep in touch. In this case, one did so by suing for The former employee, with legal advice, took advantage of every possible legal avenue established under the Workplace Relations Act and the unfair dismissal provisions. She demanded compensation for stress caused by the dismissal. The businesswoman, struggling to rebuild her business in a new location, had to hire lawyers for the case which dragged on a widow who has for nine months. As far as she is concerned, she no longer believes in equal rights. She has seen firstshe hand the abuse of legislation which was to protect the honest worker being and used to advantage by the dishonourable. The as unfair dismissal provisions, which were designed to protect those who worked diligently but who were treated unfairly, can be used by the unethical in such a manner as to cripple a small business operator. Let us face it: it is all to do with greed and getting thing for nothing.",67

50,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence briefly, it is delightful to see the Speaker of the House of Commons here. I must say, having witnessed a few question times in the House of Commons, you, Madam Speaker, will find this a much more sedate affair than that which you are used to. My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I draw your attention to the presence in the gallery of Gi voni workers from Moe who are exporting as a result of Labor's import credit scheme. Prime Minister, apparently they sought an audience with you and it was refused. What they had for you was a gift, which I want to give to you today, and I want an answer to this question: will you now assure them that their jobs are secure by immediately scrapping the Productivity Commission's zero tariff recommendation and adopting Labor's plan for industry, as you did on cars?",69
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I answer the question, Mr Speaker, I would like to extend to the Speaker of the House of Commons a very warm welcome on behalf of the government. Of course, much of the tradition of the House of Representatives is taken from the House of Commons and we all remain greatly in debt in relation to the gift of parliamentary somedemocracy from the United Kingdom. Madam Speaker, your own career is remarkable in that I understand you have followed the long tradition of speakers in the British House of Commons, where there is a continuity through a change of government. I think it is my recollection that in fact you, coming from the British Labour Party, secured election with the support of some conservative members of parliament.",69

53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am drawing attention to it, Daryl. Ma'am, you are very, very welcome and I think you will enjoy today's proceedings. If I can turn to the Leader of the Opposition: I do not know, without checking with my staff, of particular requests to see people. But can I simply point out to the Leader of the Opposition, in response to his rather cheap attempt to suggest that I am not interested in talking to people in the textile industry-it is a cheap attempt and it does not do him any good at all-that I will be seeing in Sydney on Friday morning a joint delegation of unions and companies involved in the textile industry. I will also be seeing next week similar delegations and representatives of the union movement and companies which have been organised by members of this parliament. Before the decision is taken by the government, I will be fully acquainting myself with the concerns of employees and the concerns of employers. Can I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that my government is following the practice of the government of which he was recently a member, and that is that we announce decisions on industry matters when we get the final report of the Productivity Commission. It is an absurd proposition that you make a decision on something before you have got the report. The Leader of the Opposition is inviting me to make a decision on it before we have all of the material. I bet, if he disagreed with the decision, he would then say, 'You ought to wait until you get the final report.' The other opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition has afforded me is to point out to people in the textile industry-I specifically point it out to people in the textile industry who have been the victims of decisions made by companies in recent months, and I am thinking of the Berlei decision which affected over 200 people in the City of Lithgow in New South Wales-that that decision was made under the tariff regime of the Australian Labor Party. The most monumental hypocrisy is that you proudly boasted about how hairy-chested you were in cutting tariffs. I say to those dismissed workers, 'You have been dismissed under the tariff policies of Labor.' It was Labor who put them in place. It was Labor who established the lower tariffs. It is monumental hypocrisy for you to try to trade on their misfortune. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries l\1r BARRESI-My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Does the minister accept the assertion of DuPont that their decision to cease apparel yarn manufacturing at their Bayswater plant in my electorate of Deakin was in part influenced by their view that the imminent Productivity Commission report on textiles, clothing and footwear would accelerate a decline in the textiles market?",69
54,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and for his obvious concern for his electorate. I know that he, as a new member here, would be doing particularly well in that area. I am aware of the announcement made by DuPont yesterday afternoon. My immediate reaction was that it was due to the mismanagement of the economy in the Labor Party's day due to your tariff rules and your particular deal. To make sure I was right I sought advice from the department as to exactly what did happen. My department advises me that DuPont took over Fibremakers in June 1990. At that time the Labor government approved a one-off taxable grant to DuPont of some $59 million. The grant represented the capitalisation of the company's future bounty reserves for the period to 30 June 1995. The bounty capitalisation agreement was clearly an important factor in DuPont's decision to buy Fibremakers. At the time, the acting minister for industry-you know who, just back from France; you never know where he is and I have not heard much of him-when he came back said on a national ABC radio program on 11 August 'Our industry policy failed.' And no wonder it did. On this day he said, in announcing this decision: DuPont will make a considerable new investment yielding a much larger, more export orientated business which will operate in a zero-tariff, zerobounty environment. You said that; they are your words. As part of the agreement, the company agreed to meet a number of commitments. While most of these have been honoured, some commitments entered into on a best endeavours basis were not-for example, to undertake capital investment of some $7 million by December 1996. In the event, expenditure did not reach that level. The agreement between the government the and Fibremakers appears to have ended in 1996. However, in 1991 the Labor government announced that the yarn bounty would phase out in 1995 and would be replaced by a five per cent tariff. So not only did they get the benefit of the capitalisation of the bounty, the $59 million, at the time but later they picked up the five per cent tariff. I raise these questions because I noted that the chief executive of the company said that this was all because they were concerned about the outcome of the Productivity Commission and the report, and all these things. He has to understand that the report is not out yet; there is only an interim statement out. The government will respond to that report when it is out and, when they do, that is the government decision that we will stand by. In the meantime, they are acting under your rules-under Labor Party rules, no-one else's. As a consequence of that, when they are making these decisions around the place, they should be aware that at this particular moment there is no government decision and what they have done is purely a commercial outcome under your rules. If DuPont are serious, they ought to wait for the final result. At the same time, if they are serious they should apply the same logic to the decision not to shut down the yam section. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",70
55,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and follows from the answer just given by him. It refers to the DuPont closure. Minister, given that the arrangement that was entered into under the capitalisation of the bounty yam with DuPont was made between DuPont and the nation, not just with the Labor government, why have not you picked up the phone and said to DuPont, 'Honour your commitments under that bounty requirement'? Why have you been sitting on your hands while 160 jobs have been exported? When are you actually going to represent the interests of your portfolio?",71

58,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you can easily see where the Labor Party are stuck. They have been stuck in their own policy with another failure. For the whole of the winter recess I did not hear a word from the front bench-and not a word from the member for Hotham. Where were you all? It was not until 11 August that we found out where you were. The first question on industry after we got going came from our side, not even from you. So all the colour and movement you came up with just a moment ago falls to the ground. It was all froth and bubble; the usual stuff. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the phone number of DuPont so that the minister canLeave not granted. Sales Tax",71
59,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of comments regarding the unfairness and complexity of the sales tax system which operated under the previous Labor government? What do these comments suggest about the need for changes to the current indirect tax system?,71
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact of the matter is that Labor's taxation system was characterised by high taxes on a narrow base with complexity because of a multitude of rates. Under Labor's sales tax system, sales tax rates can apply at 0, 12, 22, 26, 32 and 45 per cent-a multiple rate with complexity for business as business engages in classification to try to determine whether the goods will be taxed at 0, 12, 22, 26, 32 or 45 per cent. This is the system that the Labor Party says should not be improved on. This is the system which the Labor Party refuses to deal with. But it is not because they do not recognise the problems of the system. The inequities and complexities have been acknowledged by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When asked at the National Press Club on 21 May 1997 whether the present indirect tax system is inequitable for low income earners, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition responded, 'There is some inequity. I think that is fair to say, yes.' Here we have a situation where you acknowledge the inequity of the system but vow not to do anything about it. They acknowledge the inequity of the system and vow not to do anything about it. When interviewed on 3AW on 13 May, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this: There are some problems in the tax system and I think we are all well aware of them, in particular the fact that the service part of the economy is not, I suppose, pulling its weight as the character of the economy changes. Again: 'We acknowledge the problem, we know the difficulty and we vow to do nothing about it.' This is cheapjack politics practised by the opposition in relation to a problem which they know needs fixing. Do we have any sensible idea of a tax reform proposal coming out of the Australian Labor Party? Apart from their vow not to do anything about tax reform, we have had one idea in relation to taxes. You know what it was: it is the old chestnut. It is the one the Labor Party has always secretly wanted. It is the age-old one wanted by the Labor Party: death duties. On the Sunday program on 17 August, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked what he would do about Commonwealth-state relations. And he is entitled to be taken at his word. There is a view getting around that you do not have to take any notice of the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. You do. He is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman on tax matters. We take him very seriously on this side of the House. He said this: The truth of the matter, for those who get very excited about Commonwealth-state tax imbalances, is that the states can redress the balance in a number of waysthat is what he saidnot only through service taxes but through the old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes, through additional surcharges of income tax, and, of course, through payroll tax, which they have got alreadyand here it is so it is really up to them to bite the bullet on old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes. He got up in the parliament and sought to explain this. This is what he said: I did not say the states should impose death services taxes, income tax surcharges or higher payroll taxes-just that they can do any of those things if they choose. That is what he said-'if they choose'. What did he really say? 'It is up to them to bite the bullet.' It is becoming clear what the Labor Party's policy is. The Labor Party policy is this: 'The sales tax system is a mess and we know it, but we will not do anything about it because we are going to try and play cheapjack politics in relation to this government's attempts to reform the tax system. But simultaneously with that we have a secret agenda. The secret agenda is yes for services taxesintroduced by the states-along with property and inheritance taxes, because by getting the states to raise the revenue you have an opportunity to cut your own spending in relation to your own budget problems.' ""This is a plan that is being cobbled together by a group of opportunists who will not face up to the need to reform the tax system in this country, who will not do what is necessary and join the government in doing something for the country, but who are engaging in throw back politics, reactionary politics, the politics of yesterday-the politics which will take Australia nowhere and who refuse to join the positive program of this government.

Is the Prime Minister aware that the government's own fund, Medibank Private, has today announced that it is also considering introducing a similar fee for its 1.7 million members? As the health minister is very angry but unwilling to act, will you today show leadership and rule out any fund's attempt to introduce a compulsory private hospital co-payment, or are you happy for that to go down in history as John Howard's hospital bed tax?",72

65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Go back to choir practice. The contribution of the Labor Party to the health care system of this nation was to deliberately destroy the private health insurance system.

If you had done something while you were in office for 13 long years,73
66,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the point of order goes to relevance. It was a specific question: are you going to intervene with Medibank Private and instruct them not to charge a $50 co-payment? Simple question, simple answer, I would have thought.",73

69,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order and that point of order is relevance.

79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it would take the whole of question time to do justice in describing the damage done by Labor to our health insurance system. It would take much longer than four or five minutes. But let me remind the House again that the idea that you can judge the impact of the tax incentives, which were only introduced on 1 July, by 27 August 1997 is patently ridiculous. What you have tried to do, what your leader has tried to do and what the deputy leader has tried to do is to say that the people who dropped out of private health insurance-because you ran the system down-before the incentives were brought in is evidence that the incentives have failed. It is not only dishonestMr Lee-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. There was nothing in the question about coverage. It was about: would the Prime Minister rule out the $50 a night copayment?",73

82,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer advise the House of the government's efforts to foster competition among financial institutions and how such initiatives benefit consumers'?,74
83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To encourage competition in the provision of financial services, the government will be amending the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 to allow credit unions and building societies to issue cheques in their own name. This is a long overdue reform which will allow credit unions and building societies access to issuing cheques in their own name so that they can offer a new service to customers. This is an important reform. To allow credit unions and building societies to issue cheques in their own name is to increase the contestability in the financial services market. It will deliver greater choices to people in relation to their savings. It will also bring greater competition to the financial services sector. It is competition which is driving consumer benefit in the financial services sector. It is competition which has delivered lower interest rates in relation to mortgages. It is compethe tition and contestability which will keep financial institutions, especially banks, up to the mark in terms of new entrants into the market. This is a reform which will give greater freedom of choice. It is a reform which will give greater competition. It is a reform whi-h will give greater consumer benefit. It IS something which will see the opportunity for building societies and credit unions to grow stronger, to increase their custom and to get new customers in relation to the financial services that they offer. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries: Tariffs",74
84,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Further to your earlier comments about the closure of the Lithgow Berlei factory, while I and many of the workers agree that it was the industry policy of the Labor government that established the current tariff regime, what assurances can your government give to these workers, who feel betrayed by both sides of politics, that you will try to prevent any further job losses in the clothing, textile and footwear industry? Can you send a representative of your government, preferably a minister, to Lithgow to explain how lower tariffs are. benefitinregional communities, at a tanff summIt planned for 15 September in Lithgow?",74
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the honourable member of Calare that I will have a look at his proposal about some representation from the government at that particular seminar. No matter what vantage point you come from, this is not an easy are- of public policy. There is little doubt that the gains that we get from trade liberalisation are felt by people who are different from those who are affected by tariff reductions. One of the difficulties is that people who lose their jobs when a factory like Berlei closes are not the people who are the immediate beneficiaries of the export markets that are being won for primary products in the Asia-Pacific region. They are not the immediate beneficiaries of people who win jobs in information technology. They are not the immediate beneficiaries of the thousands of new jobs that have been created in tourist industry in Australia over the last 10 years. One of the things that we should bear in mind about",74
86,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What has tourism got to do with tariffs? What's your logic there?,74

88,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no logic at all.,74
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Denison.,74
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I should say further to the honourable member that, if you look at the employment patterns of the Australian work force over the last 15 years, you find a very interesting statistic, that is, between 1983 1996, the total number of new jobs created in the agricultural industry, the mining industry and manufacturing was 5,000. Mr Tanner interjecting Mr Latham interjecting",75
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne and the member for Werriwa; if you want to have a laugh-in, do it outside.",75
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the total number of new net jobs created in manufacturing, farming and mining between 1983 and 1996. Yet during that same period, there were 1.8 million additional jobs created in the service sector of the Australian economy. I mention this to make a couple of points. Firstly, the difficulty of job generation in manufacturing is no recent phenomenon, and it is not a phenomenon of the last 17 months. It has been a problem and it has been an issue in manufacturing in Australia for a long period of time. In relation to the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the Productivity Commission report, can I simply assure the honourable member-and can I assure people in the industry-that, when the government receives the final report, it will take a speedy decision, as it did with the motor manufacturing industry. And in taking that decision, it will certainly pay very strong regard to the interests of employees in that industry. I regard the closure of factories like Berlei as being not only a tragedy for the employees, a tragedy for the City of Lithgow, but a tragedy for the region. But I have to say again, as I did in response to the earlier question, that it is monumental hypocrisy-not on your part, because you do not belong to the Australian Labor Party-on the part of the Australian Labor Party to parade their concern about what happened in Lithgow when it happened under their policies and their policies alone. Children: Sexual Abuse",75
93,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services.

The findings of the Wood royal commission have indeed shocked this nation. Justice Wood is to be commended for his comprehensive and far-reaching report, which demonstrates the insidious nature of the crime of paedophilia in our community. Disgusting as this practice is, it is important as a nation that we do not lose sight of the fact that 30 per cent of the abuse is by strangers, while 70 per cent of the abuse is by people whom children know and trust-and this seems to me to be the ultimate betrayal of our nation's children. The crime calls for political will and it calls for community vigilance. This government has the political will, and it will continue to take a strong leadership role. I will shortly announce the establishment of a new National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse. The first task I will give that council will be to examine the recommendations of the Wood report and to report back to me on a strategy which the Commonwealth can adopt in partnership with the states and territories. We have already commenced a wide range of programs which support parents and abused children, such as the good beginnings program, and that work will continue. The federal government has announced a national framework to clamp down on pornography on the Internet, especially pornography which involves children. There is no doubt that there is no more important task we have as a nation than to ensure the safety and the protection of our children. Industry Policy",75
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the are Prime Minister. It relates to his claim 32,000 jobs lost from manufacturing industry while this government was in office. Prime Minister, are you aware that, from the March quarter 1980 to the March quarter 1985",76
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When did I say that?,76
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just in reply to Andren.,76
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I didn't.",76
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Manufacturing lost some 140,000 jobs-one in 10 Australian manufacthe turing workers-as your recession flowed through the economy. Are you aware that since that point of time manufacturing ployment has grown by some 18,000? Prime Minister, in your industry policies will you now reverse your collapse of Labor's R&D concessions, which is wiping out innovation in Australian industry? Will you now your hostile attitude to bounties, which has cast doubt over the shipbuilding industry and over the computer industry with the removal of the $100 million bounty? And will you now act in the textiles, clothing and footwear area to ensure that those jobs are retained?",76
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I will check the transcript. I thought what I said in relation to manufacif turing jobs was that, between 1983 and 1996, there were 5,000 new jobs created farming and manufacturing; and during the same period, there were 1.8 million jobs created in the service industries. They are figures that have been supplied to me and supplied to my colleagues by the secretary the federal Treasury, and they are figures that I believe are correct. So I do not really even know the initial basis of the Leader of Opposition's question. But he does give me the opportunity, nonetheless, to say something. He does give me the opportunity to remind him-and to remind his spokesman on industry matters, and to remind the member for Batman and others who have direct responsibility in this area-that, during the major time that you were in government, you pursued a vigorous policy of cutting tariffs. What I am doing is exposing your hypocrily sy rather than condemning what are a hypocrite on tariffs, Kim Beazley. You a complete hypocrite on tariffs because of you and your spokesman on industry boasted about how important it was to cut tariffs. And he is nodding his head; he is in favour of cutting tariffs. But you are now going around the country making speeches about how evil it is to cut tariffs. Why don't you be honest and consistent and decent on this subject? Small Business",76
101,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index was released emyesterday. Given the importance of small business to the future of job creation in my electorate of Robertson and throughout Australia, can you please inform the House if there are any signs that the prospects for reverse small businesses are improving?",76
102,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In fact, while going around his electorate the other day we went into a number of small businesses that were doing very well. That is very encouraging and it shows that if you have a sense of confidence, if you have a plan for the future and you have a federal government that is trying to help and work with you, there is in mining, reason for some confidence. But I would have to also say that there are still a lot of businesses out there doing things pretty tough. There are some businesses out to there today who have done well merely to survive the recession in the early 1990s and interest rates of 24 per cent, 25 per cent and the 26 per cent, which they had under Labor. We have put in place a very supportive macro-economic climate for small business. Interest rates are down, unfair dismissals are down in the federal jurisdiction by 55 per cent and inflation is down. We are working to put some of those economic parameters in place. But we do, as I say, acknowledge that things are patchy for some. But, at the same time, I think we should also recognise this because it should give small business generala sense of confidence about the possibiliyou did. You ties in the future. If you look at the survey, there are some positive signs in it: expectations for an improved economy in 12 months are firm nationally; 63 per cent expect an increase in sales over the next 12 months; and 62 per cent expect an increase in profitability. There are a number of so-called prime concerns defined by the survey for small business. They are mainly in the sales cash flow areas, although the biggest prime concern in that category was none-a view held by 27 per cent. I do note that the small business community is looking to the government to get on with the pace of reform. In respect of tax reform, small business thought the government should be addressing that issue-and we are. And it is the Labor Party that is implacably opposed to what the small business community knows from their own practical experience-that we need to get on with in that area. The index has some positives and some minuses in it. I acknowledge that. But I think it is wrong for the opposition to selectively focus on the negatives. When they were in office-someone got it out for me-no-one had a record like they did. So after a while they adopted the policy of shoot the messenger. The parliamentary secretary at the time said in the chamber less than two years ago about the Yellow Pages index: ... [it] is fatally flawed. It was targeted specificalMinister, ly with a political bias. Then he said-and mark these words because I have a feeling you will hear them again: As a consequence, we say on the record that this report has no integrity. Here they are 18 months later quoting it at us. We do not need a survey; we are interested in what small business says. We are out and about talking to small business people. If you want a representative from the government in Lithgow, then I suggest people vote for one at the next election. The key point I want to make is that we have to engender confidence out there amongst consumers. I think that is happening; I think it is slowly improving. Many small businesses that I speak to see that and see the prospects for that. That is reported in this particular survey. What the Labor Party could do to boost small business is to support the government on a couple of key measures. They ought to be putting through the unfair dismissal provisions and they ought to be giving us a decent run in the Senate in respect of capital gains tax. Someone said to me the other day that that is a benefit you get only when you retire. But the truth of the matter is that successful small businesses are making gains to their business every day. Under Labor's policy, every day you have the capital gains tax sitting there to penalise them for their efforts. If you want to talk about small business, why don't you actually get up and do something for small business by supporting our policies? Pharmaceutical Pricing",76
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business thinks that the confidence he has flattened is returning. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's recent claim that the pharmaceutical industry investment program shows his industry policy at its best. Why then have three of the world's biggest drug companies stated that the government's decision on pharmaceutical pricing will not only force patients to pay more but also completely destroy the impact of the investment program and pharmaceutical investment will therefore dry up? Prime will you promise to correct the government's contradictory policies in this matter, 'strategically intervene' - to quote you-and stop those jobs going offshore?",77
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will examine the substance of the claims referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. Without any undue disrespect, I will not take at face value what he has put to me. But I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that it is often the case when industry approaches government for assistance and government responds, no matter what the colour of the government, industry will one way or another say that it is not quite enough. You rarely get them putting up their hands and saying it is always enough. I seem to remember a few occasions when you were in government when industry said that they had not quite got everything they wanted when they had come to talk to you. Health Insurance",77
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, while I am on my feet, I seek your indulgence-if it is needed; you will tell me if it is needed-to add to an answer that I gave to the honourable member for Dobell. It related to Medibank Private. I have been advised that between 1984 and 1995 Medibank Private was allowed to increase its premiums 12 times in Victoria, 11 times in Queensland, times in New South Wales, 11 times in Western Australia, 10 times in Tasmania and no fewer than 13 times in South Australia. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order.",78
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the Prime Minister has concluded his answer. Mr Lee-My point of order is that, if the Prime Minister is adding in that way",78
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Lee-Why can'the add and tell us whether he will rule out the $SO-a-night bed tax?,78
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no need to resume your seat. I invoke standing order 304A. Remove yourself from the chamber. The honourable member for Dobell thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Interest Rates,78
109,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Treasurer: does he have information on changes in the margins charged by banks for housing finance? Are consumers getting the benefit of lower interest rates?,78
110,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I do have information on margins relating to bank lending. The recent bulletin of the Reserve Bank of Australia comments on recent cuts in official interest rates and recent cuts in home mortgage lending. It notes, of course, that home mortgage lending in Australia now is the lowest it has been since the 1960s. When this government was elected, the standard variable mortgage was 10.5 per cent. Now you can get one for 6.5 per cent. That is a saving to average Australian home buyer of nearly $4,000 a year, which is after-tax money. Part of that has been a reduction in official interest rates, which have been cut five times during the period of this government's term. The Reserve Bank notes that, in addition, there have been competition induced cuts in mortgage lending-2.S per cent in official rates but nearly four per cent in relation to the standard variable mortgage. The Reserve Bank notes in its bulletin that 12 competition in the housing loan market in Australia has produced spreads against funding costs which are slim by historical standards and in line with those in other comparable countries. We have always had fat margins on the home lending rate in Australia. But, as a result of new entrants and new competition, those margins have been reduced to slim by historical standards and in line with those in other comparable countries. This has been one of the great successes of new competition in the finance industry. It is hand in glove with measures to open up the cheques system to credit unions and building societies. It is part of this government's effort to increase the competition for small business in relation to lending. It is part of this government's responsible fiscal policy which has given the benefits in relation to low interest rates. This can be contrasted with the Labor Party, who only ever had one policy: tax high and spend high and have high deficit, high debt and high interest rates.",78
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,High unemployment.,78
112,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And high unemployment. They had the home mortgage rate at 17 per cent and small business overdraft rates at 22 per cent in 1989-90, and they refused to do anything about their complicated sales tax system. They stand up here and profess an interest in industry but will do nothing to improve the outmoded, outdated complicated sales tax system. Their only new idea for tax is a death tax. The member for Dobell is worried about bed taxes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposithe tion wants death taxes. Heaven help you if you die in bed under the Labor Party. They would get you both ways--doubly. Their only new idea has been death taxes. That is their answer in relation to industry policy. Any business person in Australia will say to you that they want good macro policy, low interest rates and better industrial relations. What they want is a better tax system, and what do they see from the opposition-these cheapjack little stunts with no honesty, no consistency, no plan, no leadership and no future whatsoever. Pharmaceutical Industry Policy",78
113,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to the Prime Minister's demonstrated ignorance of his government's strategic intervention in the pharmaceutical industry. Are you aware that production of a new antiarthritic drug worth $750 million in exports may go offshore because of the government's anti-investment decisions on the pharmaceutical industry? Are you also aware that a new influenza vaccine developed in Australia is likely to be manufactured in France because of your government's policies? Minister, what steps have you taken to ensure the policies of the Minister for Health and Family Services on drug pricing do not conflict with your factor F extension? Mr Martin Ferguson-Come on, Cheapjack.",79
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Batman is testing my patience.,79
115,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's program in the pharmaceutical area was welcomed by the companies concerned. All of those who participated in the plan were particularly pleased at the government's approach, which was announced earlier in the year. In fact, only two months after that I was asked to open some extensions to a factory in Sydney for one of the companies concerned, and they publicly thanked the government for the action it had taken in the pharmaceutical area. As it relates to the flu serum that you are referring to, I think that you are vastly misjudging what the company is saying. Telstra: Public Share Offer",79
116,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Will Australians who reserve an offer document in respect of the Telstra share sale receive a guaranteed entitlement to shares and will the partial sale of Telstra proceed this year?,79
117,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure all honourable members would probably be aware that the first stage of the Telstra public share offer is now under way. Over the past few weeks letters have been sent to all Telstra customers, to the clients of brokers and to the bondholders of Telstra. In addition to that, there has been an extensive advertising campaign, in print and on television, inviting all Australians to reserve the public document. The advertisements on TV and in print invite the public to telephone the Telstra information centre on 1800 181818 and to reserve that public offer document. Those who do reserve the public offer document will be guaranteed an allocation of shares. This is the first time in a Commonwealth share offer that that guarantee has been extended. It is available to all Australians. Further, if the number of applications for shares exceeds the number of shares available, those who reserve the public offer document and later decide to invest will receive 50 per cent more than the minimum public allocation of shares. As my colleague said in the other place earlier this week, the government's commitment before the election to the employees of Telstra has not only been honoured but been exceeded. The government indicated that it would allocate two per cent of shares to the employees of Telstra. In fact, some 3.8 per cent of shares will be allocated to those employees. They will receive one free share for every four that they purchase. Further, the public share offer is on track to occur this year. It is hoped that one-third of the Telstra shares will be available later in the year. The government expects the offer document to be available in October, following its lodgement at the Australian stock exchange. Subject to market conditions, Telstra will be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in November. The structure and conditions of the sale will be announced at a later stage. If this all proceeds, what it will achieve is two things; there are two objectives in all this. First, it will provide the most significant amount of money in this nation's history for the Natural Heritage Fund to repair the environment. Secondly, it will go a long way to overcoming that five years of deficits which ran up general government debt in this country by some $75 billion. And the proceeds of this sale will go, after the Natural Heritage Fund, to retiring the debt that Labor created. Defence Industry: Crockery Contract",79
118,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, yesterday you said: I expect to see a culture develop in Defence that fosters Australian industry, particularly small and medium sized enterprises. Why then has Defence awarded a contract for the supply of up to $1 million per year in crockery to Sirway Asia-Pacific Pty Ltd, a company which was registered nine months after the tender for the contract closed and which will import all its crockery? Why did you reject a Western Australian firm, Australian Fine China, which employs 125 Australians, has supplied the ADF without complaint for some 30 years and, I might add, for the Prime Minister's interest, also continues to supply the Australian parliament? Is this the support for Australian industry which you have so modestly described as 'Bishop's procurement rules'?",80
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the honourable member for Cowan. My views on beating your desk are well known.,80
120,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition has picked the wrong example. The fact of the matter is that, where there is need for attention and for a change of culture, that is going to occur. That means that small business will not be squeezed out by an attitude, in a department where we are dealing with billions of dollars, that says sufficient attention is not paid to a small contract which has only got $100,000 or $50,000 worth in it. That is what I mean when I talk about a change of culture: that there is a need to consider the availability of Australian SMEs to supply. On the particular example that you picked, as I said, you have picked the wrong one. The very simple matter is that the comment that Mr MCLachlan made that the contract price was nearly double the price tendered by the overseas firm isMr Bevis-No, have a look at the specifications.",80
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Brisbane has asked the question.,80
122,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can use the 63 per cent figure that has been literally again used by Mr MCLachlan. The simple fact is that, on price and quality, the contract was awarded, in accordance with the evaluation, which was straightforward and easy to assert. If you want to come into other areas, if you go away and do your homework and have a look at other areas where there is a need for small and medium enterprises to get a fair go, then I will be pleased to tell you about those too. But, on this particular example, you have picked the wrong one. Mr Bevis- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the extract of the company records for Sirway Asia-Pacific which shows that the company was not even registered nine months after",80
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Leave is not granted. Resume your seat. Bougainville,80
124,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Could the minister inform the House what steps the government has taken to establish contact with the new Papua New Guinea government? What is the Australian government doing to assist that government in their efforts to resolve the tragic Bougainville conflict, which continues to be of major concern?",80
125,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Groom for his question. The Australian government has taken immediate steps to engage the new Papua New Guinea government through my visit to Papua New Guinea on 24 and 25 August. This was the second visit I have made to Papua New Guinea this year and the third in my time as foreign minister. It was, of course, with the election of a new government in Papua New Guinea, timely to develop a close working relationship with that government. During my visit I had extensive discussions with the new Prime Minister, Mr Skate, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Haiveta, foreign minister Genia and a number of other senior ministers. We discussed a wide range of issues, including our development assistance program, the trade relationship between the two countries and the defence cooperation program. To get to the specifics of the honourable member's question, needless to say there were extensive discussions about the tragic and long running conflict on Bougainville. Ever since this government has been in office we have been determined to make a contribution to try to resolve that problem-as, to be fair, I think the previous government did, as well. It is our judgment that the end of the Sandline peace crisis has presented an important window of opportunity to promote the peace process. As a first step in the process, the Australian government funded talks between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, the Bougainville Interim Government and the very Bougainville Transitional Government Honiara some weeks ago. Subsequent to those talks, discussions were held amongst all the Bougainville parties in Burnham, New Zeawill land. The New Zealand foreign minister, MCKinnon, and I have been working very closely together to ensure that both our countries are able to contribute constructively to the Bougainville peace process. The cocally operation between Australia and New Zealand on this issue is a very important component of how we are taking the issue forward. Importantly, both Australia and New Zeathis land believe that it is not possible for promote a blueprint for the resolution of Bougainville problem. The solution to this problem has to be worked out by Papua New Guineans themselves, including Bougainthis villeans. What we can do is facilitate the ful. process, and both our countries in a very coordinated way are usefully doing that. The next round of talks between the Bougainville parties and officials from the Papua New Guinea government, which will take place next month, will be in New Zealand. We will, of course, help with the transport arrangements for the delegates to those talks. There will be a subsequent round of talks, I hope, in October and again we will be involved in the transportation of delegates to those talks. The important point for the House to understand is that it is not going to be constructive for the Australian government, or for that matter the New Zealand government, or both of us, to try to impose a blueprint on Bougainvilleans and more broadly the people of Papua New Guinea. That will be rejected. It is important that we facilitate the process. Let me conclude by saying that one of the truly most constructive things Australia can do is assist with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. The people of Bougainville need to understand that there is a peace dividend. If they choose the path of then their island will be assisted with reconstruction. The Australian government is going to provide over the next five years some $100 million to assist with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. I am very strongly of the view that that is a valuable contribution Australia is making into the Bougainville peace process. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is very familiar with this issue. He know only too well that there have been Don moments when it has looked as though the Bougainville peace process was going to take off-in Cairns, in Arawa and on board the New Zealand warship the Canterbury. Tragithese moments when it looked as though there was going to be a breakthrough foundered for one reason or another. There is no value in going back over the history of that. It is the Australian government's view that now represents a real opportunity to take us to the peace process forward. We have been the disappointed in the past. We can only hope that this time, on behalf of all the people of Bougainville and the countries of our region, peace process can at last be truly successTextiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",80
126,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, I refer to the draft Productivity Commission report on textiles, clothing and footwear. Is the minister aware that the commission found: It is not clear that TCF industries would be advantaged by the replacement of payroll tax with another broad based tax. Furthermore, as most TCF is exempt from wholesale sales tax, it is quite possible that a GST ... could adversely affect parts of TCF, as compared with the current situation. Minister, is your support for a GST conditional on ensuring no GST induced job losses in the TCF industries?",81
127,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said in answer to an earlier question, the government has not received the final report. You are just commenting on a draft report. It is nothing more than that. As it relates to taxation reform, that is a matter in the hands of the government. Interest Rates: Farmers",82
128,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the minister outline the direct and indirect effect of lower interest rates on family farm businesses in my electorate of Wide Bay and across Australia? Will the minister tell the House what has been achieved to deliver the coalition's pre-election commitment to farmers to: . .. provide responsible economic policy, to maintain low inflation and interest rates, to growth in input costs, and boost international competitiveness.",82
129,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay for this very important issue that he has raised. In the bush, one of the things that they wanted cleaned up, in common with the rest of the country, when we won government was the nation's books, and we have made a lot of progress there. We have set about the task of restoring fiscal balance and, as the Treasurer has indicated even in this place today, we are on target for a surplus next year, which represents a massive turnaround in fiscal performance and one that I believe needs to be widely recognised across the Australian community. When I remind people in the bush of how far we have come in that regard, they are very open in their recognition of it and of its importance. Responsible fiscal and monetary policy settings have been reflected in five cuts to Reserve Bank official cash rates. This is very important to rural Australia and to the hard-hit farms across the nation because the potential savings to farm budgets as these interest rate cuts are passed on-and I am sure everyone in this House would join me in urging the banks to pass them on-represent for this nation's farmers between $400 million and $500 million a year. Mr Costello-How much?",82
130,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Four hundred to five hundred million dollars, which is needed as the farm sector seeks to recover from what they had under years of Labor's approach and which is needed in order to put those rural communities back together in terms of cash flow. It will certainly be needed if the very unfortunate spectre of the EI Nino continues to develop. Of particular interest to me and, I am sure, to everyone in this House is that ABARE have done some work: they have studied the flow-on impact of the narrowing of the interest rate differential, which was so much a feature of Labor's economic management, between Australia and the major world economies. Reducing that impact, of course, reduces incentive for speculative short-term investment from overseas. ABARE have reduce estimated that every one per cent cut to interest rates leads to a devaluation of the Australian dollar of about 1V2 per cent in the first year, and the result of that--every one per cent drop in interest rates when combined with the related exchange rate effects-is estimated to potentially boost farm cash income by around $2,500. Mr Costello-Is that right?",82
131,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, that is right. So for all farmers we are looking at an average of over $6,000 as a benefit from the work that we have already developed. That is a very substantial benefit, and there is more to come. I want to say that, on this question of the opposition's attitude towards reform in general and tax reform in particular, the shadow Treasurer cuts a very lonely figure when he is out there trying to convince Australian fanners that 'the gain from coalition economic management has been non-existent or worse for Australian farmers', but that is what he told them at the NFF. That is what he told them: 'non-existent or worse'. He was plainly unaware of the benefit of reductions in interest rates to farmers but, more than that, what I would particularly like to know is whether he floated his proposal for a death duty down there. The Australian farm community would really embrace that at the NFF! They would really say, 'That is just what we need at this delicate point in our attempts to recover from 13 years of Labor!' But I really think they can feel quite assured that Labor will not be there to impose it upon them for a long time. Goods and Services Tax: Food",82
132,Mr HATTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Does the minister recall the former minister for small business, Mr Prosser, saying that a GST must apply to food and that there should be no exemptions because 'exemptions make the system more complicated'? Given the problems of compliance that exist for small business with any GST, will the minister categorically rule out a GST on food?",83
133,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really am at a loss to think what might be the most appropriate response to the member for Blaxland. He asked about tax and small business. I can tell you what the small business community say. They say quite sensibly that we should be accelerating the process of reform of the tax system. That is what we are doing and that is what you are opposed to, which is why the small business community-when they look at your opposition to unfair dismissals proposals and your opposition to the capital gains tax proposals, which we have had in the Senate in the last few days--conclude very simply this: that you are opposed to small business and you were when you were in government. We are pro-small business, and that is why we are looking at the issue of tax reform. Telecommunications Interception",83
134,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Does the government have supervisory control over the issue of telecommunications interception and listening device warrants? Will there be any impact on the investigation and prosecution of serious crime, including drug offences, if the government's objectives in this field are not achieved?",83
135,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Menzies for his question. Intelligence gained through the use of telecommunications interception and listening devices under warrants is vital in law enforcement and crime prevention. Just to give an example, in 1995-96 there were 657 arrests based on intercepted information and there were 596 convictions, and a large part of those arrests and convictions related to drug offences. Interception through the use of telecommunications devices is very intrusive, and on both sides of the House there has been support in the past for these warrants being given out sparingly. It has been common that they should be given by federal judges, but things have changed a little. The issue of a warrant is not a judicial function. The High Court has pointed this out, and constitutionally the consent of the judges is required. The judges have",83
136,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not what they said in Grollo. Don't misrepresent Grollo. It was an overwhelming majority decision. That is why they upheld it. You know it.,83
137,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Banks would be wise to listen to this. All the federal judges have now said they will not issue warrants. They have said that for three reasons: firstly, it is not a judicial function; secondly, it imposes an additional workload that they are not able to cope with; and, thirdly and very importantly, they find themselves as respondents to judicial review applications in their own court. So the government has come up with an alternative proposal that senior legally qualified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be the ones to issue the warrants. That is a perfectly reasonable proposal, and one would think that it could not reasonably be opposed. But, of course, it is opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party voted against the bill in the House and the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, has indicated that the Labor Party will vote against the bill in the Senate. If that bill is not passed, there is a risk that the use of telecommunications interceptions and listening devices will no longer be available to law enforcement agencies. That would seriously cripple the fight against crime. The shadow Attorney General's solution is to appoint more judges-more of the people who have said they will not do the job. The shadow Attorney-General asserts that the Labor Party is committed to law enforcement. Their actions speak otherwise. Their actions represent a cogent example of putting political point-scoring above getting it right. The Leader of the Opposition would do well to note that the many Australians who share the government's deep concern over crime, and particularly drug trafficking, will remember the actions of the Labor Party if telecommunications interception is put at risk.",83

141,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The United Kingdom and the United States are, as honourable members are aware, two of Australia's strongest and most important political and economic partners. Our relationships with both countries are founded in our shared histories and traditions, our common values and aspirations and the strong personal links between our societies. One of the principal messages of my visit was that my government intended to build on this shared history and shared values in looking ahead and creating modem and dynamic partnerships which meet Australia's contemporary needs and interests. The United States is the largest investor in Australia and the United Kingdom the second largest. The United Kingdom invests more in manufacturing in Australia than any other foreign investor, and so is a very important source of employment in this country. It is not a one-way street either. Australia is rivalling France and Germany for third place amongst foreign investors in Britain. Australian investment in the United States is 40 per cent of the US's investment in Australia-a very large figure indeed when you consider the difference in the size of our economies. We have substantial trading relationships with both countries. Our alliance with the United States is vital to Australia's stability and the security of our region. We have close and valuable defence ties with the United Kingdom. United Kingdom It was therefore timely to visit the United Kingdom early in the life of the new government led by Mr Blair. He of course is no stranger to Australia, and I invited him to visit us again in his new capacity. It was also possible during my visit to pay a courtesy call on the Queen. May I place on record how unapologetically proud I was to visit the Australian cricket team at the beginning of the second Test at Lords. I say without any apology or qualification that I think it is the solemn responsibility of any Australian Prime Minister overseas to give vocal, open and unreserved support to Australia's great national sporting teams. I think most Australians, whatever their political views, would strongly support that. In fact, our fortunes turned around after I arrived in the United Kingdom. I might say that I went to the eve of Test dinner in London and I was surrounded by all these gloating Englishmen in the wake of having won the one day series and the first Test. I was very pleased to see that magnificent performance by Glenn MCGRATH and, all the sort of carping nonsense back here notwithstanding, I think most Australians support that kind of approach by their Prime Minister, whether he is Bob Hawke or John Howard. I had a very valuable round of discussions with Mr Blair and leading members of his government, including the Deputy Prime  Exchequer, the Defence Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary. I was pleased to find that they share my conviction of the growing strength and relevance of the relationship into the 21st century between Australia and the United Kingdom. I was in fact struck by how much there is in common between my government and Mr Blair's on the challenges faced by our societies--especially the issues of unemployment and the role of welfare-and the need to address those challenges, not with ideological prescriptions but by looking for practical ways to achieve results. I was particularly interested to hear about the welfare to work proposals of the new government and Mr Blair's views on changing attitudes in modem societies towards welfare, and how they married with much of our thinking. Both with the United Kingdom government and in my meetings with leaders of the United Kingdom business community, I was able to set out first-hand the strength of the Australian economy. The reality is that our economy over 1997 and 1998 is predicted by the OECD to grow more strongly than any of the G7 economies. During a visit to the Hawk aircraft assembly line in Warton in the north of England, I announced the then imminent signature of the contract for the lead-in fighter for the Royal Australian Air Force-a significant boost for the Newcastle area both in terms of the jobs and the leading edge technology it will bring. I pointed out in my meetings that Australia's integration into the Asia-Pacific region and the United Kingdom's with Europe were making our bilateral links more relevant and valuable-rather than the reverse, as some might think. No two countries in their respective regions have closer relationships or a better understanding of each other than Australia and the United Kingdom. The benefits are becoming more evident in the number of British companies locating their regional headquarters in Australia and using Australian skills and expertise to expand their business in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia and the United Kingdom hold different positions on climate change, which is not surprising given the differences in the structures of our economies. I made clear to the British Prime Minister and his government that Australia was prepared to play her part in tackling greenhouse gas emissions. But we will not be party to a legally binding uniform target which no-one honestly expects will be achieved, which is discriminatory in its economic consequences and which does not make an effective contribution to improving the world's environment. A continuing irritant in our bilateral relations is the UK government's refusal to index pensions for UK residents in Australia. Mr Blair and I agreed that as a first step officials would reach an understanding on the actual costs involved-lack of agreement on this has so far obstructed sensible discussion of the Issue. I also took the opportunity when in London to maintain my contact with former prime ministers John Major and Margaret Thatcher, and to meet the new leader of the British Conservative Party, Mr William Hague. During my visit, I was also pleased to be able to help facilitate requests, particularly from Mr Ken Colbung, for the return of Y agan' s skull to Australia and I hope that outstanding issues can be resolved soon. United States My visit to the United States was an opportunity to build on the success of President Clinton's visit to Australia last year. I met a wide range of key figures in his administration, Congress and the business community in New York. My meetings left me in no doubt about the strength of the US alliance with Australia and the value that Australia and the United States place on it. Our shared strategic and economic interests in the Asia Pacific region meant that the future of our region was an important focus of my discussions in Washington and New York. The other was my message that under my government's reform program the Australian economy was creating new opportunities for US businesses to use Australia as a base for operations in Asia. I emphasised the vital importance of continued US engagement in the region. The interests of Australia, the United States and the region are all served by the United States continuing to make a strong contribution to the stability and economic growth of the region. I was reassured by my discussions with President Clinton and others in his administration of the continuing commitment of the United States to exercising its leadership, economic power and strategic influence to help ensure the region's stability and prosperity into the next century. It is a tribute to the role Australia plays in the region that President Clinton and members of his administration and Congress want to know what Australia thinks of developments in the region and to discuss ways in which we can extend our cooperation there. While sharing fundamental objectives, Australia's specific geography and interests means that she has a different perspective on the region from the United States-and that makes our views ever more useful. In a major speech to the Foreign Policy Association I set out Australia's views on the important changes taking place in the region and how we should respond to them. The opening up and modernising of economies and societies in the region are bringing immense benefits for the countries of the region and their peoples. It is in our interests to reinforce these trends and to encourage the integration of regional economies into the world economy rather than lecture them about their shortcomings. For example, it is in the interests of Australia, the United States and the region that we maintain broad and balanced relationships with Indonesia within which differences, for example on human rights, can be handled productively. The government and the Clinton administration agree on the importance of integrating China into the region. We agree also on the importance of APEC's role in sustaining the growth of regional economies by freeing up trade and investment. We are keen to see APEC's momentum maintained under the Canadian chairmanship at Vancouver. An active and credible ANZUS alliance is an important part of the contribution we both make to the region. I was pleased to highlight that with an invitation to the Seventh Fleet to visit Australia in the year 2000. The Australian and US positions on climate change are not the same-but we share a desire for a realistic and equitable outcome of the Kyoto meeting. President Clinton acknowledged the need for flexibility in order to achieve that and we agreed on the need to find a way of involving the developing countries effectively in the process. I was very pleased indeed to hear Dr Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve system, comment on the strong position of the Australian economy. New York, as honourable members would know, is the place where perhaps the toughest bottom lines in the world are drawn about economic performance. So I was very pleased indeed as Australian Prime Minister to see when I visited Salomon Brothers' trading floor a graph which plotted the differential between Australian and United States treasury bonds. When my government came to office in March of 1996 the margin was about 250 points against Australia. On the day I visited the Salomon Brothers' trading floor, which was the famous floor on which Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities was modelled, the margin had dropped to only 60 points-from 250 in March of 1996.",84
142,Mr CADMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Well done.,87
143,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Hang on. Recently it has gone further. It has now dropped to 25 points, which is one tenth of the yield spread between United States and Australian treasury bonds. In other words, the hardest heads in the financial world have given a ringing endorsement to the financial policies of my government. It is a ringing endorsement of the extent to which in the past 17 months we have, despite the carping, negative obstructive criticism of the Australian Labor Party, been able to repair the fundamentals of the economy. That shrinkage means lower costs, higher living standards, more investment, more jobs and more opportunities for Australia. It is the bottom line of the hard-headed judgments of the rest of the world, and they are the sorts of experiences and achievements that really matter and make me immensely proud of what my government has achieved. I was interested to hear from the US administration and business their views on how the US economy's impressive rate of job creation has been achieved. While I heard a range of ideas, there was consensus on the importance of labour market flexibility. I came away convinced that sensible reforms of the kind we have undertaken-to achieve greater labour market flexibility, to remove the obstacles to job creation and to address welfare and taxation disincentives against work-are critical if we are to improve employment prospects in this country. Dr Greenspan also stressed to me the role that the integration of new information technology into the economy has played in creating jobs in the United States. The government will be announcing steps in this area in the near future. Finally, I would like to extend my deep appreciation to my hosts in both the United Kingdom and the United States for the warmth of their reception and their generous hospitality. I believe that my visit has helped focus the leadership of both countries on the benefits that our partnership can bring to all of us if firmly oriented towards the future. Together, our partnerships with the United States and the United Kingdom will play an important part in Australia's growth and security. We share with both countries a great history; but, even more importantly, together we can share a great future. I present the following paper: Visits to the United Kingdom and the United States of America from 18 June to 1 July 1997-Ministerial statement, 27 August 1997 Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",87
144,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to speak for 14 minutes.,87
145,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I always let you go for 15 minutes.,87
146,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,It is following exactly the same precedent,87
147,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, it is not.",87
148,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We could have an openended one, but you have not been keeping to it. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Hon. the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 14 minutes.",87
149,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You have got exceptionally defensive, old son. The point was that we used to limit you to a period greater than the normal speaking time on a motion for the House to take note of something. You now reduce it. Let me explain to the House why this might be so; why unprecedentedly we have 14 minutes rather than 15 minutes. This happens to be the least substantial report ever produced by a prime ministerial visit to the United Kingdom and the United States in the history of this parliament. This is the first time ever that a report here has not gone the length of the normal speaking time on a motion before the House. Generally speaking, we have had a half-hour performance on these sorts of issues. Instead, we have here a very small report, virtually none of which actually recounts and records activities undertaken. Instead, it is a report which is full of tendentious, self-righteous and inaccurate opinion, as far as his own opinions of his government are concerned, with a vague attempt to try to put those opinions into the mouths of other people. But sometimes even the blatancy of that eludes him. I think the more honest report of this particular visit was produced by Lindsay Olney, an experienced Canberra writer. He produced his report of the Prime Minister's visit and it is headlined 'Travelling PM on the last train to Klutzville'. He wrote: It brings to mind that plane crash in the Andes when the living survived by eating the frozen flesh of the dead. The story didn't emerge for some time afterwards as the indescribable horror of the experience overtook the survivors and compelled them, slowly at first but then in an anguished torrent, to world what they had endured. Something similar has happened to the badly scarred journalists who accompanied John Howard on his Ashes trip overseas. 'It was a shocker, a disaster,' said one reporter. 'He did nothing, everything went wrong, it was boring ... Then there was the issue of the Lord's Test, around which the entire trip was structured. It wasn't just a case of Howard grabbing the opportunity in London to see a bit of cricket, it was Howard deciding that he would see the cricket and that everything else-meetings with Tony Blair, for instance-would be fitted in around that. The travelling media could scarcely disregard this indulgence but were aggressively expected to do so; the effect on the PM-press relations was lethal. I will read one final quote: The images linger still: Howard rained out of his long awaited day at the cricket, Howard tripping in the White House Rose Garden, Howard boring Shirley MCLaine to sleep, Howard going inexplicably to the baseball to meet an Australian relief pitcher for the Yankees who was four times his size and not even playing that day ... so it went on. The simple fact of the matter is that this performance was a total disaster. It is not that we object to you going to the cricket, Prime Minister; we have no problems with you going to the cricket. The problem is sustaining an entire trip around that; a trip which, as a result of that, was completely ill-timed and ill-placed. The Prime Minister left Australia when parliament was sitting; he had a ministerial crisis on his hands, with Geoff Prosser's conflict of interest; and he had a visit to Newcastle pending to discuss the BHP plant closure. But the problem was not so much what he neglected here; it was what he neglected at the other end. This is what he missed as a result of the timing that he managed to put in place for his visit: the Prime Minister did not attend the Hong Kong handover and the Prime Minister visited Britain at a time when the new British Prime Minister could see him only for the briefest of time, 45 minutes. But he managed to visit Baroness Thatcher, coincidentally at the same time as the Earth tell the Summit was convened in New York. With the views that he had expressed on the question of greenhouse gas emissions and its impact on Australia, and given that he was in the northern hemisphere, one Concorde flight away from New York-eight hours away-this was a test of the sincerity of his beliefs and the extent to which this is an issue of significance to Australia. He was not there. Indeed, what happened to the Prime Minister was that he went through the humiliation of receiving the British Foreign Secretary back in the United Kingdom after he had been there. In other words, the British Foreign Secretary straddled the Prime Minister's visit in the United Kingdom. And, just after the British Foreign Secretary had, to my mind, quite unjustifiably attacked the Australian government, the Prime Minister was in the humiliating position of giving him a cheerio as he came home. What he should have been doing over there was countermanding the arguments of the British Foreign Secretary, in the performance of his duties in that regard. To give succour to the workers of Newcastle and to try to establish some point to this particular visit of his, the Prime Minister announced a matter in relation to Newcastle, a British Aerospace investment that had been annQunced previously-seven months earlier. And to add insult to the injury of the workers in Newcastle, he tried to maintain that this was something new. They were grating their teeth, Prime Minister. We could hear them from here, even if you could not hear them in the UK where you were when you went through that particular exercise. As it happens, I made much the same trip as the Prime Minister a little while later; not to the United States but I made it to the United Kingdom. I also went to Singapore and the Middle East after I had visited Newcastle on two or three occasions. The point of my visit was manyfold and many faceted but part of it was to sweep up; part of it was to clean up on the things that the Prime Minister had promised to do and did not do; and part of it was to actually sell a genuine impression of Australia's wares and correct any poor impressions that had been left by the Prime Minister in places as diverse as the Menzies Centre and the offices of the various British ministers that he had managed to see, with sections of the British media and, above all, with the British public generally when we got down to talking about some of the matters of concern to Australia. I raised the greenhouse gas emissions issue with them and what I pointed out was that we did indeed have those difficulties that the Prime Minister had outlined but we had as a government when we were in office what we believed to be the correct strategy: to pursue a two-handed policy; on the one hand make justified complaints about unfairness to Australia, on the other hand restore the programs that you cut that meant we as a nation were doing something about greenhouse gas emissions. They are out of your particular proposition. How can we have credibility internationally when we simply stand up and say, 'There is not a problem here, we're doing nothing about it, please have mercy upon us'? It is not an intelligent tactical approach. I also took the opportunity both there and in Singapore to do what the Prime Minister said he would do; undo the damage that has been created by false impressions, in his mind, of the government responses to the agenda of the Hanson One Nation party. He said here he would do it; he did not do it there. I was obliged to do it there. In Singapore, in particular, I took the time to go through Australia's great record on race and our great record on engagement with the regions. The fact that when we have had errors in our stance, be it in relation to the White Australia policy, be it in relation to the Aboriginal people, it has been Australians who have identified that and Australians who have dealt with the problem. I also pointed out to Singapore what Australia's contribution had been to the region since World War II-the enormous support given to the national aspirations of the Asian people by the post-war government in 1945, the generous support given by Australian governments through things like the Colombo Plan, our decision in 1967 to give the Asian people a part of Australia's future by changing the White Australia policy and bringing them in, and emphasising to them the fact that historical injustices to the Aboriginal people from 1967 on were being addressed by this nation. There is a great defence that can be made of Australia in that region, but there was no defence made of Australia in that region by the Prime Minister. The defence is necessary as businessman after businessman and journalist after journalist told me, not simply because of the widespread reportage of the One Nation Party's views, and it is widespread, but because of a firm belief-the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), not withstanding; they are put in the category of, 'They would say that, wouldn't they.'-that the Prime Minister has given credence to the views of the people in the One Nation Party. He had a unique opportunity in London to deal with that problem, to put some substance in this wretched, indulgent visit-and he chose not to do it. What an extraordinary thing, to go through the difficulty of announcing to the Liberal Party caucus that he would do it, then tum up in London with great fanfare and, having told the Australian journalists that he would do it, undoubtedly having had it raised with him from place to place as he went through, to choose not to do it in the end-an extraordinary decision in relation to that particular element of his visit. I also chose to sell other features Australia's wares. But I tell you something that was most interesting to me in my lengthy conversations with a very large number British cabinet ministers: the very great interest they expressed in the programs that we had put in place in the time that we were in government. There is no more inaccurate part of this tiny little report of the Prime Minister than attempt to wrap himself in Tony Blair's welfare-to-work program. As they discussed the details of the implementation of our program with me, it was increasingly evident-as a new MP, Sir Lenox Hewitt's daughter, has revealed here in Australia-that it was modelled exactly, not marginally or tangentially, on the programs that we had in place that were annihilated by the Liberal Party when they came into office. The differforeign ence was this: ours was welfare yours is punishment for being out of work. There is a major material difference in the journed. motivation that underpins those particular propositions. It is one thing when it is compulsion associated with punishment but it is another thing when it is compulsion related reciprocal obligation. If anything, I would have to say that there was one difference. Tony Blair's program not quite as hard on those who did not take up the opportunity as ours was. He was a little bit more generous to the unemployed in the United Kingdom-or he is about to be a little bit more generous-than we terms of whether or not they would actually be pushed off the dole if they did not take up the opportunity. So it was a slightly softer version-and I am not going to exaggerate this-of the Working Nation program reciproable cal obligation that we had put in place. So can dismiss completely the Prime Minister's notion that, in any practical any sympathetic arrangement between the two of them. What the Prime Minister would have noticed, I am sure, while he was awaywhich is part of the reason why he decided when he talked about the American trip that he would refer to what he sees as the contemporary state of the Australian economy-is of that there is now not a single commentator left in this country who believes that his budget strategy was right. The final surrender of came last Monday, when Alan Wood-and he was the last one-finally came out and said that you have over-corrected. Any sense of depression in the community or any sense of a lack of confidence, frankly, Prime Minister, was not there when you came into office. It is there now, directly as a result of mistaken his decisions by you in the way in which you have managed the economy. And there is not a single economic commentator left in this country who says anything different about it. The Prime Minister's visits must improve. And when the Prime Minister improves his visits, he must start to produce in this place put reports of substance that give us a serious understanding of the direction of Australian policy. But I am not holding my to work; breath. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Ms Worth) adSPEAKER'S PANEL",87

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",90
152,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The campaign for a national drug summit has reached fever pitch over the last week-so much so that even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is beginning to show some interest in the issue. Let us take a look at the answers given by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) when they were first asked if they would even consider convening such a summit. Their somewhat candid responses give you an indication of just how little they expected the public pressure-less than three months later-would have them now seriously considering convening such a meeting. 'Unnecessary', they both said. 'Wasteful of resources!' they exclaimed. The minister for health went even further, calling it 'window dressing', 'a cheap stunt', 'a talkfest' that would mean 'zilch'. I am sure they assumed they would hear no more of it, but then the ball began to roll. In close succession, you have had groups and individuals as diverse as the Directors of Public Prosecution in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, the Ministers for Police from all states and territories, the Australian Medical Association, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, the Salvation Army, the Premiers of New South Wales and Western Australia, and the list goes on and on-all calling for this Prime Minister to show some leadership and convene a national drugs summit. The popular press have come on board as well, I am pleased to see: the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age-newspapers that were both supportive of the ACT heroin trial-both gave their approval for the national summit. Also in Sydney, the Daily Telegraph-a paper which, unlike the other two, had an almost violent objection to the trial-also threw its support behind a national summit. In just the last week, the Premiers of New South Wales and Western Australia-perhaps two of the most ideologically opposed politicians you could hope to meet in this country-have made their strongest statements yet in favour of a summit. Let me refer to Premier Carr's comments first. He said: We've had a debate in which people put forward different views about a heroin trial in the ACT-I want to go beyond that debate now and unite the community behind a program of action. We have got a meeting for Ministers of Police in November, so my proposal to the Prime Minister is that we make that a national summit on drugs.' And Premier Court, in Western Australia, said: I believe that there is a need for us to tackle this as a national issue, and that requires coming together at the highest level. You can call it a drugs summit, you can call it what you like, but I think it's important that we do something together and at the highest possible level. And yet the Prime Minister and the minister for health poured scorn on the same suggestion when it was put to them time and time again. That is, until last Monday's question time. It was on Monday, following the Leader of the Opposition's question regarding a national drug summit and the 54 people who have died in Perth this year from heroin overdoses that the Prime Minister changed his tune. He said, 'Oh, I have an open mind on the subject of a national drug summit if there could be a public benefit in holding such a meeting.' Maybe he has been polling again. Those comments came less than three months after his initial comments that it was a talkfest and a waste of resources. I and this Labor opposition welcome the Prime Minister's dramatic change of heart. I would welcome a similar public change of heart in the Minister for Health and Family Services. But the Prime Minister's conversion is not yet complete-not by a long shot. Expressing an open mind, although a giant leap from what seemed a hopeless position just a few months ago, is quite different to offering one's full and unconditional support. Full and unconditional support for a national drug summit is what the majority of Australians with an interest in solving the heroin problem want to see. They want a summit with the leadership and the involvement of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services. It is our best chance of reinvigorating our fight against heroin while at the same time making sure the public are comfortable with and supportive of any changes that we put forward or decide upon. But, as I said, we have still a way to go before we get that 'St Paul on the road to Damascus' conversion from this Prime Minister, especially judging by the attitude that he displayed in question time on Monday. The Prime Minister's obvious discomfort at answering the Leader of the Opposition's question regarding the government's strategies on fighting heroin were palpable. It certainly lay at the heart of his unnecessary and baseless allegations that we on this side of the House are attempting to suggest that the country's heroin problem began on 2 March last year. Perhaps one of the following speakers on the government side can point out to me when any member of the opposition has actually made such an accusation. What the opposition has said is that the government's cutbacks in areas such as the Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs have further jeopardised the dire situation in which we currently find ourselves. What we have said is that the federal government cannot continue to spend less and less on anti-drug measures while raking in more and more on Commonwealth excise and taxes on alcohol and tobacco. What we have said is that the Minister for Health and Family Services seems determined to defend and persevere with a national drug strategy that has quite obviously failed. What we have said is that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services have been too quick to dismiss the idea of a national drug summit when the positives of holding such a meeting should have been apparent to anyone, let alone our national leaders. But what has the Howard government done? I would like to present some facts and I would like to ask them: how can you cut $37.6 million from the Australian Federal Police, resulting in a loss of roughly 130 officers, and not in some fashion be weakening the force's operations, particularly those aimed at combating the heroin trade? How can Australian Customs do its job properly when, for example, because of drastic budget cuts, there are insufficient staff to even monitor closed-circuit television cameras at border control checkpoints, leaving videotapes to be viewed long after any heroin courier has skipped the country? How can this not be a weak link in our fight against the heroin trade? Why is the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, talking about requesting the help of the Australian armed forces in his state's war against drugs if he does not think that the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs lack the resources to do the job themselves? How, in this current climate, can we continue to stomach the discrepancy between spending only $33 million, or roughly $2 per head, on the national drug strategy-and remember, that is the national program which deals with all drugs, both legal and illegal-when government income from taxes on alcohol and tobacco has increased to over $4 billion, or roughly $200 per head, in this last budget alone? The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) knows this to be true because even he admitted that his government's efforts here are 'tokenistic'. That is possibly why he has been gagged in this debate today. I say 'gagged' because where is he? Then, of course, there is the structure of the national drug strategy itself. Talk to the health authorities. Talk to the public servants in the state and federal health departments. Talk to the people who work with the addicts on the street, day in and day out, and they will tell you that the national drug strategy, while effective in parts, is a bureaucratic shambles that needs urgent and renovation. I say to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Health and Family Services: just take a look around. Take a look at my electorate, for example, or the electorate of the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace). Our streets are awash with heroin. Have a chat with the member for Bradfield. He has been there; he has had a look. He might tell you what it is about. The national drug strategy has quite obviously failed to halt that tide. I appreciate that the Minister for Health and Family Services is currently considering the review of the second five-year period of the national drug strategy. My suggestion to him is that he resists the temptation to simply make cosmetic changes. He must resist that. New and dramatic steps need to be taken towards solving the problem. VVe need new approaches that have the public's confidence and support. That is where the national drug summit again comes in. I notice the Sydney Morning Herald, when giving its approval for such a move, began its editorial with the sarcastic comment: 'VVhen in doubt, have a summit.' I can appreciate the wariness of some people when you talk about a national drug summit. The last thing any of us want is another round of bureaucratic nonsense where the same old people swap the same old tired opinions about illegal drugs. That is one of the dangers of the Prime Minister's recently announced departmental task force. How many studies do we need to tell us that the system is broken and that it needs fixing? A national drug summit, if handled correctly, can offer so much more and, quite frankly, I am surprised that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services still fail to see that. Perhaps, more importantly, a national drug summit offers us the opportunity of bringing politicians and non-politicians together to discuss new strategies and new approaches regarding the heroin problem, while keeping the public thoroughly up to date. As I have said previously, whatever its value or faults, if the failure of the ACT heroin trial has taught us anything, it is the crucial importance of maintaining public support for something as delicate and as significant as devising new and better strategies to combat heroin. A national summit offers a public, who are cynical and suspicious about politicians and the decision making process, a transparent and engaging debate. It is about making sure that the public feel confident that not only are their leaders coming up with more effective ways of fighting heroin but that those new methods are in line with what they consider to be morally and socially acceptable. It is up to this Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services to set the parameters of the conference so that it does not turn into a talkfest. It is up to this Prime Minister to provide the summit with the same sort of ultimatum he delivered to the premiers at the gun law conference after the Port Arthur tragedy. It is up to this Prime Minister to say, 'Don't come out unless you have some definite proposals to put forward.' So far the Prime Minister has proven very reluctant to do any such thing-and the question has to be asked why. The opposition does not suggest a national drug summit will be simple. It does not suggest that it will deliver in our laps all the solutions to the heroin problem in a single week. Nor does it suggest that boosting funding to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs would miraculously dry up the country's heroin supplies overnight. But certainly they would all be steps in the right direction. Above all, that is what the Australian people are now crying out for-direction, Prime Minister, direction. Following the Prime Minister's decision to pull the plug on the ACT heroin trial, Australians-whether or not they approved of the proposal-felt that the one fresh strategy which had seriously been put forward had disappeared without an equally serious alternative being offered to replace it. The Prime Minister's departmental task force on drugs is certainly hardly an adequate replacement. Those uncharitable souls among us may accuse the Prime Minister of putting forward the task force as a stalling tactic, hoping that by November the whole heroin controversy, the whole matter of the national drug summit will have just blown away, been swept under the carpet. I can assure the Prime Minister, if that is what he is hoping for, come November he is in for a rude awakening. The Prime Minister's task force is just another committee immersed in bureaucracy. It will just file a report to the National Strategy Committee, which will then file a report to the Prime Minister, who will then discuss the findings with cabinet, and so on, and so on, and so on. It is all red tape and files. Meanwhile, kids in my electorate and kids around Australia are dying, are continuing to buy heroin for less than a week's pocket money. I do not doubt the Prime Minister's concern over the hundreds of Australians who are dying heroin related deaths each year. But I am coming quickly to the conclusion that he has not cottoned on to the fact that we are facing a plague out there at this very moment. That is why I have invited him, over and over again to come to Cabramatta and Fairfield with me. But to no avail. It is when he makes such a visit that I am sure he will discard the whole notion of wasting time on task forces and the like, and then seriously consider the opposition's proposals. No, the heroin problem did not begin on 2 March 1996. No, those of us in the Australian Labor Party do not claim to be the only members in this House concerned with the heroin plague which currently grips our nation. However, we do see measures which have been introduced by this government exacerbating the heroin problem. We do see a failure on behalf of this government's leadership to recognise that what Australia is facing at this moment is a national emergency, requiring rapid national action. We see a Prime Minister unwilling to tackle what is an extremely difficult issue, requiring inventiveness and initiative, with anything other than stale strategies and platitudes. We need action, Prime Minister. The people of Australia are crying out for it. The people of Australia are demanding it. Prime Minister, get up and act.",91
153,Mrs STONE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It seems that the opposition either has been dozing or is caught in a time warp. Here is an issue of such complexity, an issue that simply will not be solved with a one-off you-beaut all-out drug summit later in the year, as proposed by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). That is a single solution, a feel good solution, one which gets bureaucrats and the Drug non-government organisations out for a day or two. But then what happens? Nothing much at all. This is a problem of enormous complexity, a problem that goes back decades. It is a problem that no other nation in the world has managed to tackle and achieve some major success with. Also, it is a problem that is not going to go away. We are going to tackle this problem in a way that reflects the complexity of the issues that are involved. These issues include health, law enforcement, demand and supply, education, treatment, substance substitution, taxation issues, youth and ethnic issues, regional priorities-and, of course, there is the debate about how best to spend the funding available to achieve the greatest effect. Yes, throughout the federal government sphere, unfortunately, by necessity, there has been a reduction in government spending. The opposition in particular should know why we have had to cut back. It is because of their absolute mismanagement of the economy over some 13 years. As a result of that mismanagement, tragically, we cannot, and we could not, simply add more dollars to every different government department's finances. But to suggest that this government actually cut the Australian Federal Police budget by $37.6 million means either a deliberate intent to misinform or that the member does not have very good arithmetic. Let me give you the figures. In the Australian Federal Police budget, from 1996 to 1997, we have had a five per cent cut or reduction amounting to $8.583 million-a five per cent reduction. Now keep that figure in your head, the member for Prospect. In 1996-97 the Australian Federal Police contributed savings equal to $6.191 million of the 1995-96 budget. That is a total cut of $14.77 million, not $37.6 million, as claimed by the member for Prospect. So I am just not sure what sort of creative accounting or arithmetic has gone on there. But the actual numbers are irrelevant. The significant thing is that this government understands that the dollars that are to be spent on the drug problem have to be spent in areas that are going to make a difference. So the government has in fact commissioned a review of the financial practices of the Australian Federal Police, which will provide a solid foundation for future resource considerations and it will assist in overcoming the problems associated with their financial management problems experienced this financial year. We are going to the core of the problem to assist them to better spend the dollars they have. The Attorney-General has consistently sought to encourage a more strategic and cooperative approach between the Australian Federal Police and its state and territory partners and also through the strategic alliance of the National Crime Authority. No one-off national drug summit will go near to addressthat ing any of those sorts of issues, let me assure you. The effectiveness of the Australian law enforcement agencies is increasingly being tion. enhanced by all agencies taking a cooperative approach and a more strategic focus in the of law enforcement resources. We could talk about it for two days in Canberra, but that no substitute for on the ground action. This approach-the approach we have able adopted with the Australian Federal Policefrom and the very minor cuts that have been made to their budget in line, tragically, with required of all government departments, has coastline. not affected their ability to track down and seize major heroin supplies. The AFP's funding has been sufficient them to tackle significant drug trafficking syndicates. For example, in May this year joint operation between the Australian Cusyears toms Service, New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police seized 78 kilotraining grams of high-grade heroin. More recently, Victoria a joint operation of the Australian Customs Service resulted in federal agencies seizing that state's largest haul of 32 kiloof grams of heroin, thereby dismantling another major criminal enterprise. So our Australian coastlines. Federal Police are grateful for a change of government. They are grateful that we are assisting them to spend their dollars in a way that will make them much more effective. The second point that the member for Prospect raised was that we have failed to provide adequate customs services. Along with her total miscalculation on the Australian Federal Police budget cuts we have to report that the customs resources specifically devoted to anti-drug efforts have not been reduced during the time of general budget expenditure reductions. Of course, those reductions by other government departments, as I said before, were forced on us by a profligate opposition. The opposition's efforts when they were in government meant that we had to face cutbacks in so many of our departments. The reductions in expenditure that the honourable member for Prospect referred to were part of the government's overall budget strategy and have not and will not affect the capacity of customs to do its job. I might add in the 1996 budget the government has provided $26 million towards technology to aid particularly in drug detection and intercepSince 1 July last year the customs use coastwatch program has been able to significantly increase its surveillance capacity is because of the attention our government has been able to give to them. Operations are now to be conducted up to 300 nautical miles the coast of Australia. Everyone knows Australia has an extraordinarily difficult task cuts in coastline surveillance. We have a huge I was up in the Torres Strait Islands just the other day and we were within a small tin for boat's ride from the coast of Papua New Guinea. It was virtually impossible, with the a resources that customs were offered in the gone past, to do the job properly. But we are building their resources up. We are them and they are now able to do the in job better. When we spoke to the customs officials in the Torres Strait Island just weeks ago, they were expressing to us a great deal gratitude for the fact that now they can be more effective with drug surveillance on our Let me repeat that the whole thrust of the matter of public importance before us today seems to be: 'Why don't we have a drug summit later this year? That will solve our problems'. But how can someone who is serious about drugs for a moment consider that a one-off all-day, perhaps a twoor day, affair will achieve anything substantial on an issue as complex as this. Instead, what we aim to do is to adopt a strategy that has the cooperation of states and agencies, all of whom have something to do with the ultimate defeat of this problem. Those agencies, of course, include: health, education, policing and family and community services. We know, too, that the ver y heart of the drug related problem is the fact that so many of our young people in this nation live in despair. They are in despair because they have had more than a decade of time when their ability to get jobs was declining. They have had more than a decade when the then government appeared to tum their backs, in particular, on regional Australia. Of course, the results of the last election were that we are down to two Labor representatives of regional Australia. That is because regional people could not understand their neglect. Young people in my electorate are in a situation where drugs are often a solution to the fact that they are unable to get adequate education and cannot get access to jobs. They feel out of sight and out of mind because the previous government for years concentrated their efforts on regulating the job market so tightly, and they offered mickey mouse type training exercises to keep the unemployment statistics down but offered no long-term solution to their real needs. Is it any wonder then that the serious elicit drug problems in regional Australia are as significant as anywhere else in the metropolitan areas of Australia? But what do we have after 13 years of Labor? Do we have the drug treatment infrastructures throughout Australia that you would expect from a government that cared? I am afraid not. In the electorate of Murray we do not even have the most basic provisions of psychiatric counselling and detoxification centres. There are no methadone programs and our young people have no basic information or education about the consequences of drug use. There is nothing there. We have been trying now for 18 months to redress years of not addressing the need for this problem to be dealt with cooperatively across three- a number of departments, non-government sectors, the volunteer community and the parents and families who have children and adult members who have suffered the consequences of illicit drug dependence. What we are talking about as a government is a national drug strategy. I do not think the member for Prospect has really concentrated her mind on this publication. It is here and we hope you will read it. We are also hoping that you will tune into the national drug task force that our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced on Monday. This national task force is going to be chaired by the Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and it will include the heads of all relevant agencies. The task force will look at the current efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, including domestic law enforcement and border control. It will look at the current efforts to reduce the demand for illicit drugs. It will include community education and community organisation support programs. It will concentrate on the harm minimisation approaches that we must adopt if ever we are going to get on top of this problem. The national task force approach is one this nation needs. Already in my electorate it is regarded as a very sensible approach to a problem that is complex and cannot be dealt with by a three-day or two-day effort. Mrs Crosio--You are too nice a person to believe that.",94
154,Mrs STONE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The people in my electorate are sick of short-term fixes. They have lived through the era when Labor talked about talkfests as a solution to problems from industrial relations through to something like drugs. Our nation at the moment is in the grip of the most serious wave of illicit drug use. Of course, it is not new to our nation. It is costing us many millions of dollars. It is estimated that it costs our community some $18.9 billion annually. Besides illicit drugs, we have the misuse of alcohol. Its estimated cost to the community is in excess of $4.5 billion each year, and the cost to industry is more than $1 billion through absenteeism and lost production. In our concern for illicit drug use, this government is not forgetting the issues of alcohol and tobacco use. Around 19,000 Australians die every year from smoking and smoke-related illnesses, while the misuse of alcohol has been estimated to result in approximately 731,000 hospital bed days each year. We have committed programs to address these health issues. The government has made a very important and significant commitment to maintaining the national drug strategy which addresses all drug issues in a balanced fashion. We will ensure that the framework and the national support that has underpinned important supply control and demand reduction initiatives for illicit drugs will continue. The national drug strategy has been highly successful in the past in forging relationships between the Commonwealth, states and territories and between health and law enforcement. But we have not had sufficient action on the ground. We must look to the further establishment of successful links with industry, the non-government sector and the community. What we now need is action. Recently the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy agreed that the national implications of the heroin trial in Canberra should be further explored rather than immediately endorsed, and further work was considered necessary to consider outstanding issues related to that trial. We are looking very seriously at the illicit drug use issue. Nothing is more important to a government which considers the future of its young Australians to be at the heart of all that we do. We know that, until we get our economy right, until we redress a lot of the problems of despair, and the problems of no hope for the future that some of our young people experience, we will not be able to get on top of the drug abuse that currently afflicts so many. We have adopted measures which address our economic ills. We aim to help our families and our young people currently caught up in illicit drug abuse. I look forward to the deliberations of the Prime Minister's national illicit drug task force. We know that it is going to be the most significant action that any government has taken for a very long time in setting an agenda for national action.",96
155,Mr TED GRACE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am sure the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is quite correct in saying that the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) is a very nice lady. Notwithstanding that, we had to listen to all that claptrap that she came out with for 15 minutes, accusing us for getting our figures wrong. I would like to inform the member for Murray that she got it wrong from the start. Neither the member for Prospect nor I suggest that a summit is going to solve the problem overnight. We are suggesting that a summit perhaps will bring new talk into the area and new methods. Anything could be discussed, including, as some people want, the legalising of marijuana and heroin. That is just a suggestion. It is a pleasure for me to follow the member for Prospect on this very important matter of public interest today. It is not insignificant that I should follow her on this side of the House. She and I share an area covering western Sydney that is quickly becoming known as the drug capital of Australia. Members of this House would have heard on numerous occasions already the member for Prospect and me explain the horrendous situation that exists in Cabramatta and the surrounding suburbs regarding the insidious trading of hard drugs. I do not intend today to canvass most of the material that I have already canvassed in this parliament. But in the process of condemning the government for their lack of action, I will refer to police efforts in Cabramatta if I have the time. In her speech the member for Prospect first condemned the lack of leadership shown by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country and the about-face attitude and the lack of backbone shown by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I agreed with the member when she expressed regret at the attitude of members of the government when they say that members of the Labor Party are saying that this problem started on 2 March 1996. We are not saying anything of the kind. I have never suggested that, and to my mind the member for Prospect has never said it. What we are saying is that the government is deliberately creating the situation by having no figures. The member for Murray can come in here and can extrapolate what figures she likes from the budget papers, but we are assured that $37.6 million has been slashed from agencies which are responsible for policing our coastline and our airports to prevent the entry of hard drugs into this country. They cannot operate under those circumstances. One would be excused for forming the perception that they are in a league with the drug cartels. But, of course, I would not be so bold as to suggest that.",97
156,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Oh! Come on.,98
157,Mr TED GRACE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I would not suggest that, because I am a gentleman. Even their own bureaucrats at the Senate estimates hearings are saying that we are losing the battle. You have to get with it and listen to what your own bureaucrats are saying. We are not the only ones saying it. The member for Prospect and I are well aware that the drug problem is not unique to our electorates. I know only too well that it is a national problem. That is why I am endeavouring today to not be too parochial, although on occasions it is very hard not to be. We have a national problem, and that highlights the lack of leadership we have in this country today. We have a Prime Minister who adopts the ostrich line of sticking his head in the sand and pretending everything is all right, only lifting his head for the ultra right-wing utterances of some members of the press and people involved in talkback radio in Sydney, advising him what to do on the drug issue-and, indeed, any issue. He cannot complain when the perception appears throughout the country that he is a poll driven Prime Minister. I have no objection to him-or the Liberal Party for that matter-taking advice from those ultra rightwing zealots on how to run Liberal branches in Sydney. They can give them all the advice they want to--and they do, publicly-but I do object to them giving public advice to our Prime Minister, contributing their views and changing the attitude of listeners in the Sydney area to what is going on in this country. Maybe the Prime Minister should look at the pasts of some of these commentators and see what their interest in the subject is. Then we have the about-face of our Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). He is a little beauty. He rolypolies his way into parliament every day at question time. I sympathise with him: he was rolled. We know he was rolled, and I sympathise with him. That is the only thing I have in common with him. But he was rolled because of the Prime Minister's attitude on the poll driven exercise in Sydney. But the minister for health has a whingeing and whining attitude. In reply to every question he gets, we have him whingeing about the Labor Party. That is all he can say. And we get this every day. He seems to think, 'How dare you question my ability?' Just because he has a medical degree, he thinks that everybody else has no say whatsoever in the running of his portfolio. He thinks they should not have any say in it. I can assure the minister that nobody on this side of the House thinks he is a guru as far as his portfolio is concerned. For instance, take his recent remarks about nicotine killing hundreds of people every year. What a smart alec remark to make-to compare the deaths of people from nicotine to the deaths of people from heroin. I would like our little minister to come out to my area and visit some of the families where deaths have occurred from heroin. I would also like, respectfully, to remind the minister that nicotine and the addiction to it, obnoxious as the habit it creates may be-and nobody can think it is more obnoxious than an ex-smoker-does not cause the same problems of family break-up as heroin does. It is absolute stupidity to suggest that there is a correlation between the two drugs. We have a minister who would have had access to families, although I do not know when he last practised medicine. I would like him to come out to the area the member for Prospect represents and to my area and visit some of the families-as we have had towhere the pain and suffering of heroin has had an effect. I agree with the member for Prospect that, to bring new thinking into the drug situation in this country, the holding of a summit is absolutely essential. I will refer back to Cabramatta because I only have 10 minutes to try to get my point across. I congratulated the New South Wales police force on the introduction of plain clothes police to assist in the detection of drugs in the Cabramatta area, but you do not need to be a Rhodes scholar to work out that you cannot use plain clothes police all the time. They have a very short lifespan as a result of being recognised, so you have to keep moving them all the time. When seven or eight of them have operated for a weekend in a place like Cabramatta, making arrests and doing a very good job, that is the end of the day. It gets around all the pimps in the Cabramatta area and all the many drug addicts. They memorise the faces of all the plain clothes police. Bingo! They move down the road to the next suburb. So they have to wait. The introduction of plain clothes police is only a stopgap in the detection of the drug dealers, who are the people we are after. I will wind up with the statement that I completely agree with the member for Prospect's matter of public importance that only a summit can work out which procedures should be put in place to solve this insidious practice which is affecting countless families. I disagree with the member for Murray, well meaning as she may well be. We have not said it is the answer, but unless we meet with all the national agencies of this country we will never know what other procedures we should be using. (Time expired)",98
158,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Richmond) (4.29 p.m.}-I would like to read a mission statement by Dr Andre Waismann, who has been a leader in assisting people with heroin addictions. It begins: In this age of violence when death is a legitimate com,modit,Y, when policies and management of fa--e, dIsease and ignorance are determined by polItIcal lobbies, when one person's tragedy becomes another's evening of entertainment, time of rage we must seek grace and find a place where each one of us can still make a difference. In this parliament we can still make a difference, but I am disturbed-and I do not pretend to be an expert in the battle against drugs-by some of the comments made by the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace), in that he is denigrating a genuine MPI with rather ridiculous abuse of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and also the previous government speaker, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone). The drug problem should be bipartisan. We should not be in this chamber making political capital. Mrs Crosio--We're not.",99
159,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You brought an MPI on this. The comments made by the member for Fowler were hardly worthy. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) should have spoken. I might not agree with a lot of her politics, but at least she has a far greater knowledge on this subject. And, yes, I do represent a lot of people in my area who have an enormous problem, just like the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) does in Cabramatta. I am not denying that. Whether it is in Byron Bay, Nimbin or LismoreMrs Crosio--What are you doing about it?",99
160,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,We are about to address it. Mrs Crosio--With more bureaucratic red tape.,99
161,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We are not addressing it with more bureaucratic red tape. This is an issue of life and death and you are trying to politicise it. It is a travesty that you have brought this up at this time after the issue of the heroin trials. You are trying to capitalise on it in this chamber. I do not wish to indulge in pub talk or tabloid; I am not proud of them but I do not intend to ingratiate them. Nor should you have raised them if you were genuine about raising the subject. The coincidence is amazing. One person I would like to speak about later in this address is a member of the New South Wales parliament, Mr Bill Rixon, who has recently been over to Israel with a bipartisan committee-Liberal, National and ALPin this from the New South Wales government. They are looking at other forms of trying to reduce heroin addiction. I would like to talk about Dr Ande Waismann's comments a little later too. I too have known people who have lost loved ones. A person I knew very well overdosed on heroin 15 years ago. Of course, we all have similar stories and we all have similar stories in our own constituencies. The community obviously was split on heroin trials. Carr, from your political persuasion, was against it; Kennett was for it. Even in the ACT Kate Carnell was obviously a great advocate of it, and she had legitimate reasons. But, even within her own party, the whip, Harold Hyde, was against it. Today we are talking about drugs, not just heroin, and noting that we have to break down the argument into legal and illicit drugs. I note that the illicit drug industry is about a $2 billion industry in this country. The total cos- of Australian drug usage, including alcohol and tobacco, is around $23 billion. As was recently pointed out by Brendan Nelson, who addressed the John Stuart Mill Society recently, the real culprit is heroin, which robs people of life at such a young age. As was pointed out by the member for Murray, there are a number of law enforcement agencies attacking this problem. It is rather opportunistic, of course, that the ALP have chosen Customs and the AFP here today. In 1992 over $500 million was spent on drug enforcement. This included expenditure on the NCA, the state police, our courts and our prisons. It is much higher today. I do believe you are politicising this issue. The AFP, as I mentioned, is just one law enforcement agency. Much has been advocated today by the two opposition speakers about this figure of $37.6 million. Even the figure that Chris Eaton, the Secretary of the AFPA, quoted, which has been discredited, was $26 million. So it is substantially different even your figure of $36 million. The fact is that the AFP has had a reduction of $7 million last year and $7 million this year, resulting in a five per cent reduction in its budget deficit. The AFP Commissioner, Mick Palmer, has said that a more strategic approach is needed to deploy resources and to set priorities. And enormous resources have been and should be poured into detection, particularly on our coastlines, and into offshore intelligence, whether it be in Burma or the Golden Triangle. No-one disputes that we have a problem with policing drugs. But the very fact that we have over 37,000 kilometres of coastline is challenging. Customs and all policing authorities should be congratulated on their efforts. Indeed, Coastwatch has over 800 fixed-wing aircraft and a number of helicopters. Enormous resources are put in by the Royal Australian Navy, in both patrol boats and over 250 hours of Orion aircraft flying time. Matching this is our Customs fleet, which has six vessels. It is this government which is upgrading the fleet to include another eight Customs vessels, dovetailed with increased expenditure on technology of $26 million for closed-circuit TV s at ports and increased dog detection teams. In the last two years there have been over 3,000 seizures through the use of dogs. What is interesting, though, is that part of the defence of the opposition, who have brought on this MPI, is the assertion that the AFP is doing a lesser job this year than it was under the previous ALP government. Let us look at some of these figures. With heroin in particular there were 47 seizures in 1995-96 compared with 62 in 1996-97, after of course we inherited the ALP budget deficit and a number of expenditure reductions across all portfolios. So there were more seizures. What is even more interesting is that, by weight, in the year of the dying days of the ALP government, 64.3 kilograms of heroin were detected compared with 174 in the last year, 1996-97. Even in this financial year, of which only two months have passed, over 81 kilograms have been detected and apprehended. So in two months of this financial year we have to seized 30 per cent more heroin than two years ago. This highlights the myth the ALP is pushing. We have a lot further to go-no-one is disputing that-but let us not discredit the AFP, which they so conveniently use here today. The key of course is intelligence. We cannot open every container or search every bag. Even if we did, our success rate may be no higher. Indeed, 100 per cent checks tend to produce worse results than a targeted approach and the increasing sophistication of concealment methods frequently requires destructive examination of imported goods. We have good links with Customs services, with the AFP and with the NCA. Obviously our key, though, is to get into the poppy growing fields of Burma, the largest source of the heroin that is smuggled into our country. Even Chris Eaton, who I have no doubt would be a supporter of the Australian Labor Party, said that if Australia were serious about this national problem we would get into that area of Burma to solve the drug problem in our own back garden. We talk about the national summit. There has been much emotion in the wake of the disbanding of the heroin trials-a matter conveniently raised here today by the opposition. To use the words of the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 August: 'When in doubt, hold a summit.' When the Australian Labor Party is in doubt, it holds a summit; it is a smokescreen. The Sydney Morning Herald stated: Summits give the impression that doing something about an important social issue, while providing a way for that issue to be buried under ... red tape and further reviews. There have been any number of examples of this in recent Australian political history, particularly under former Federal Labor Government ... I hope the member for Prospect listens to that from the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Carr has been a proponent of the summit. By the same token, Jeff Kennett has obviously been against the summit. A serious task force, made up of senior government officials, has been established to report back to the government, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). No-one is suggesting-and I am not suggesting to backbenchers on the other side-that holding the summit is the panacea. But at least it starts to put down some guidelines. Let me finish where I began. As we all recognise in this chamber, over 600 lives are being lost every year. Mrs Crosio interjecting",99

167,Mr JENKINS,MAIN COMMITTEE,"He may have been that, but the point was that, in wishing to discuss the committee's report, it was not the intention of the opposition to pursue those matters because they were being well pursued in the main chamber through question time, MPls and other motions. We wished to have this committee's report debated, but we were being muzzled. Importantly, not only opposition members of the committee who had participated in the inquiry but also a number of government members, who had been very diligent in their work on the committee and who had participated and shared in making the recommendations of the committee unanimous, were denied the opportunity to speak to the inquiry's report. As we go through this procedural motion, I seek an undertaking from the government that it will allow the committee report to be brought up on the Notice Paper to ensure that it will be debated tomorrow. That is all I seek. On the last day of sitting of the last session the intention was to have the committee's report and the important recommendations contained in the report fully debated by this parliament. In the conduct of this procedural matter today I hope that, on behalf of the government, either the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) or the Chief Government Whip, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), will be in a position to indicate to the House that we will have the important debate that is required. The House needs to be reminded that, in answer to a question yesterday, which was the expiration of three months since the tabling of the report in the House, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) indicated that there would be a delay in the government's response on the basis that he was consulting with various parties. He said in his answer to the question yesterday: I have seen most people, and some I have seen twice. There are some I have not yet seen. I to see them this week or next. We are obviously having discussions also with our own back bench and others. I hope to widen the discussion further-not just with those on the government back bench. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The matters that are being referred to by the honourable member are the subject of matters that are on the Notice Paper and will be raised by the Chief Government Whip. They do not relate to any of the matters that are the subject of this motion. Therefore I believe these comments are out of order.",101
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,The member for Scullin is dealing with the issues that have arisen from the question before the chair. He is dealing with the matters of why they came before the chair in this general debate. I rule your point of order out of order.,102
169,Mr JENKINS,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I am only intending to remind the House of the circumstances in which these matters, which will be subject to this suspension of standing and sessional orders and subsequent action, came about to be unresolved questions from the Main Committee. I am seeking some form of assurance from government members and members who can speak with some authority on these matters that, in tomorrow's meeting of the Main Committee, the report I have referred to will be able to be debated and that we will not be back in the same circumstances where this procedure would have to go forward on the matters that are before the House at the moment. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: with the greatest respect, the matters raised by the member for Scullin do not relate to the motion before the House. The motion was that the debate be now adjourned on those unresolved questions. This is not a matter that is a subject of this motion. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask you to rule that the comments of the member for Scullin do not relate to the matters at hand. Mr Leo MCLeay-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, the motion before the hope House is about suspending standing orders so that we can deal with some matters that the government mucked up in the Main Committee in the last session. The major part of that was precisely what the member for Scullin is talking about, which was the government's disgraceful taking away of the quorum to cause the Main Committee to collapse so that the report on small trading could not be addressed. What the member for Scullin is doing is asking the House to accept that that should be made a priority in the Main Committee tomorrow. The suspension of standing orders is about precisely that, and I think the member for Scullin is in order.",102
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,I do not uphold the point of order. The matter being discussed goes to what is before the House.,103
171,Mr JENKINS,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your ruling. I just wish to indicate to the House that I probably would have been finished by this stage if I had not had the delightful interruptions of the honourable member for Ballarat in his capacity as the parliamentary secretary. In any case, I think that I have made the point that I wished to make that what we would like to see as a result of these procedural motions is the suspension of standing and sessional orders to enable the motion to be put, the carriage of that motion and subsequently a motion by the Chief Government Whip referring certain matters to the Main Committee; and, as a result of that mechanism, we can have some indication that finally the House will get to have a full debate on the fair trading inquiry.",103
172,Mr ANDREW,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I rise only on the matter of debate aired by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) to say how astonished I am that the member for Scullin would in such a churlish way address this issue, given that after all the government need not have raised these matters in the chamber at all today had it not chosen to do so. I would have expected the member for Scullin to have, as it were, pointed his prayer mat towards the government party room and to have sung the doxology in gratitude for the simple fact that these matters are now being referred to the Main Committee as he would have wanted. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr Ronaldson) agreed to: That the debates now be adjourned on the motions to take note of the papers for the following orders of the day returned from the Main Committee: Government BusinessTransport, Communications and InfrastructureStanding Committee-Report on inquiry into aviation safety, Transport, Communications and InfrastructureStanding Committee-Report on inquiry into ship safety, ANL Limited-Report for 1995-96, National Crime Authority-Parliamentary Joint Committee-Report on organised criminal paedophile activity-Government response, Committee and Delegation ReportsTreaties-Joint Standing Committee-Report on Protocols II and IV to the Inhumane Weapons Convention, and Family and Community Affairs-Standing Committee-Report on the seminar into aspects of youth suicide.

173,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE,"I do not believe that I am being churlish in raising this matter yet again. On two occasions where we had matters referred to the Main Committee in the last session I spoke about the need for the opportunity for the House to have a more full debate on the committee's report. I did that a couple of days after it was tabled, when only three or four of the committee members were able to debate the contents of the report. This was before the controversy surrounding the minister actually blew up. Then on 17 JuneMr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The comments of the honourable member for Scullin are totally unrelated to the motion moved by me or the supplementary motion moved by the Chief Government Whip. There is no reference at all in that motion that relates to the so-called fair trading inquiry. I ask you to rule that his comments are totally out of order. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: the motion before the chair is about the work of the Main Committee. I know that is a bit hard for the parliamentary secretary to understand. He persists in trying to interrupt the member for Scullin on his point. If the member for Scullin wants to make a comment to the House on the work of the Main Committee on a motion that has been moved by the Chief Government Whip to refer business to the Main Committee, I do not know what could be more in order. It might not suit the parliamentary secretary, but it is in order.",104
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Order! I do not uphold the point of order.,104
175,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE,"We now have a motion that refers the business to the Main Committee. All the parliamentary secretary's intervention has done is further muddied the waters. As I understand it, The finding of balance towards fair trading in Australia report is one of the matters that is being referred to the Main Committee by this motion. If indeed it is not, then my angst is even greater. But I understand that it is one of those committee reports that is being referred. I suggest to those who set the order of proceedings of the Main Committee that it be ensured that this report is debated tomorrow. I do this because it is important that there is a full debate. If the government is asking that we bear with it because the three months has gone by but it wants to have full consultation, let us make sure that there is full consultation. As a member of the committee I am a bit disturbed that we have had the Property Council of Australia laying into us and saying that we have got it all wrong, we have had the Australian Retailers Association suggesting that we have got it wrong and we have the report in the Australian Financial Review of today. One of the important recommendations of the report concerns a change to the Trade Practices Act which would prohibit unfair conduct. It has been indicated by some of the people who have been having these consultations with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that both Minister Reith and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) are opposed to mending the Trade Practices Act. We need to have that full debate. I wish to illustrate the importance of having this debate by quoting the words of a member of the committee, somebody who made a very fine and important contribution because of her small business background, the federal member for Petrie (Mrs Gambaro). She is reported as saying in the Courier Mail of 6 August-and I see the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Mcdougall), who I think may have been at this meeting: The recommendations are very workable and the government must give small business a break. I take it from what the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), is saying that there has been some discussion amongst the coalition parties about this. I just hope that we are able to get to that discussion instead of this committee report being on the bottom of the Notice Paper up in the Main Committee. I note that it is the fifth report in this motion. I also understand that there is legislation to be discussed by the Main Committee when it starts at 10 o'clock tomorrow. All I am asking, as I have done in this place on a couple of other occasions, is that we get to the debate. I am not even going to the fact that the honourable member for Wakefield when he was just the honourable member for Wakefield was part of an action that denied me my ability on the last day of session to debate this report. It is not about whether I get to debate it. I want the House, and especially the members of the committee who were involved in the inquiry and who have not had the opportunity to discuss the important recommendations, to get an opportunity to do so. On the last day of the last session a number of small business people were in town and they were wanting to hear discussion on the committee's report. They recognised that there was a distraction going on because of the fate of the small business minister. That could have been solved by the events that happened two weeks subsequent happening earlier, but that is not the point. What we really want to get to is a full and frank discussion of the recommendations. As I read the picture, there are certain people on the front bench of the government who disagree with what the backbench is saying to them. One of the things about the committee's inquiry for me was that I learned a lot as a result of the experience of some of those opposite who were on the committee and who brought their experience to the committee and indicated after full discussion, after public hearings in most major centres, that there was a need to underpin the various codes of conduct that are in place at the moment by legislation. It was the only conclusion that the committee was able to come to. This matter is now yet again to be referred to the Main Committee, and I acknowledge that that is at least a positive step. It is better than it not being referred. But I hope that now that it is being referred it will eventually be debated. That will require that it does not become the fifth committee report on any agenda that is circulated for the Main Committee.",104
176,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEE,"I rise on this motion to reassure the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who indicated that he learnt a great deal from the inquiry into small business. One of the things he did not learn was to be succinct, but I do not want to be uncharitable. I want to reassure him that the order in which these matters are being referred to the committee has no mischief about it at all; it is entirely chronological. There has been some negotiation both with the parliamentary liaison officer and with the opposition on this matter. Most of those matters preceding the concerns that he distinctly has are matters that will be dealt with very quickly. The only reason they appear in the list as they do is chronological, which would seem to me, short of being alphabetical, to be fundamentally fair. Question resolved in the affirmative.

177,Mr MCDOUGALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Griffith) (5.04 p.m.)As I was on my feet and speaking to the omit Workplace Relations Amendment Bill prior to question time, I would like to conclude my remarks. I had just completed giving an example to the House of a business in my electorate that had suffered badly because of the problems of the unfair dismissal laws of the previous government. As a result, the mood in the marketplace is a very sour one. There is no longer a feeling of mutual trust between employer and employee. The previous government legislated that trust out of existence. There will always be inequities in the system. Protecting the worker must be paramount, but so too must the protection of the small business operator from a system currently stacked against them. There is no denying that the unfair dismissal provisions allow those who blatantly choose not to work to remain holding a paid ·position in the full and comfortable knowledge that they cannot be fired. Therefore, small business operators cannot take the risk of employing strangers. The businesswoman I have just spoken about has vowed never to employ permanent staff again and is considering closing down her business altogether. This is not the only horror story that I have on my files. There is one which involves theft and fraud of more than $200,000 worth of stock. The culprits, realising investigations were under way, took stress leave, forcing their employer to pay them while they laid low and covered their tracks. Again, the cost of continued investigation, legal action and the expectant unfair dismissal case forced the small business operator to simply drop the matter. The crooked employees resigned, taking every dollar of their entitlements without batting an eyelid. I have a community of small business operators who feel helpless and are looking to this government to give them the right and freedom to run their businesses without the fear of being sued into bankruptcy. This amendment will give both workers and employers the chance to enjoy long-term job creation and security. What we must do is protect the honest employer, the one who is now too frighted to employ a person who walks in off the street or comes in from the CES. These job seekers come loaded with such lethal legal baggage that no small business operator can afford to take them on. When I look at this bill and what it offers to the business community, I can only presume that the opposition, assisted by the Democrats, is opposing it purely for political reasons. Are the opposition and the Democrats motivated by the desire to see high unemployment figures so they can tell the public that we are not doing our job? If they truly believed in giving small business the incentive to employ people, they would welcome this bill with open arms. The move by the ALP and the Democrats to block this amendment in the Senate is blatantly politically motivated and they should be totally ashamed of their actions. The unions, of course, are against any change that might lessen their power over the thousands of workers who, whether they want to or not, are forced to abide by their rules. We have been going backwards in industrial relations for the past decade, but the uniondriven Labor Party cannot be seen to change its spots and endorse anything that would give employers the right to hire and fire. This attitude is not only outdated and outmoded, it is unfair to both the employers and the employees. The unions have never been big fans of the principles of freedom of choice and freedom of association. We must remove the facility for those who have abused the system to the extent that the small business operators cannot afford to employ permanent staff. The message I am getting from my electorate is that this amendment is not enough. They want the entire unfair dismissal provision eliminated altogether. I do not believe that that is necessary. there is no doubt in my mind that, without this change to give small business the freedom and confidence to employ new staff, we cannot expect to see an improvement in our unemployment figures. For that reason, I support this bill.",106
178,Mr MOSSFIELD,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The purpose of this legislation is to amend provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 relating to the exemption of businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provision of the act. In the debate I have heard so far in this House on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, some reference has been made to the fact that a number of ex-union officials on this side of the House have been speaking on this piece of legislation. I have no problem at all in identifying myself as one of those exunion officials and I think the question may well have been asked if I was not speaking: why wasn't I speaking on this very important piece of legislation? The point that our friends on the other side of the House miss is that many of us are not only ex-union officials but also ex-union secretaries, and we had to run our union as a business. In my particular case, I was secretary of a branch of a union and had to run that branch at a profit. I had to report to a state executive which, you might say, was a board of directors. I had to employ staff. I had something like 12 or 13 clerical staff. I had the right to hire and fire. My branch of the union had an income of over $1 million a year. I think that, with that background, I have seen both sides of the story and am very well qualified to speak on this particular piece of legislation. The remarks relating to the unfair dismissal issue never cease to amaze me. Despite having a bill that was the subject of negotiations between the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, and the Democrats, the government persists in encouraging the fallacy that we, on this side of the House, are somehow to blame for its alleged failings. The previous speaker, the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), was not talking about this piece of legislation-he was But not justifying it at all-he was speaking about some views he had on the previous legislation. There seems to be a view, from the government side, that an employee who is unjustifiably sacked by a small business should be treated differently from a person sacked by a large employer. The issue is surely one of equity. How can we so differentiate between employees by the size of a business? Under the government's legislation, if they work for a company with 15 employees, they are not protected; if they work for a company with 16 employees, they are protected. How ridiculous can you get! Employers who run small businesses should not be in any way permitted to be in a position to treat Australian workers in any different way regardless of whom they work for. We cannot allow a system to be legislated for that in any way permits some Australians to be treated less fairly, simply by virtue of the size of the particular company. Australia has been described by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) this week as a very egalitarian society. To suggest treating workers differently, based on the size of a company, would consign that egalitarian society to the scrap heap. It is worth noting that the government made significant changes to the Workplace Relations Act in December of last year. Some of the changes were as follows: the jurisdiction of the federal tribunal to hear unfair dismissal claims has been reduced; the definition of fairness has been changed; separate streams exist for handling unfair and unlawful dismissals; the power of the AIRC to award costs against employees has been dramatically increased and has been coupled with a compulsory conciliation stage; and a $50 filing fee has been introduced. The new act confines the operation of the federal statute to a narrow field. Hence, some federal employees are not covered by a federal award, and the five remaining state systems are not subject to the overriding operation of the federal law as was previously the case. Regulations were made in December which impose additional restrictions on the classes of employees protected from unfair dismissals. We were unable to have those regulations disallowed. Some of the additional exemptions are: the December registrations, it is claimed, revert to the pre-November 1994 position and exclude all employees hired for a specific period; the new registrations deny casual employees protection until they have been engaged as such for a period of 12 months; the December registrations deem any period of probation up to three months to be reasonable; and the restriction of terminating employees defined as 'temporarily absent' from work due to illness or injury is also eroded. Employees are now subject to lawful dismissal where they are absent from work for a continuous period of three months or for more than three months in a period of 12 months except where they are in receipt of paid sick leave. We raise criticisms of these registrations on the basis that they not only detract from the rights of some workers but also do not fully conform with the terms of the relevant international treaty in that they make it simpler for employers to structure their employment relations so as to avoid their responsibilities under the law. But why would we be surprised at such an attitude encouraged by this government? The Prime Minister announced, in a statement on 24 March this year, new promises to make further amendments to cover employers with no more than 15 employees. The government tried to give effect to these statements by regulations, but I am pleased to say the Senate disallowed them. Hence, the bill is now proceeding. Many small businesses are sole traders or partnerships and are not presently subject to these laws. Why do they need the law if they are not affected? The answer is that it is just a smokescreen to pretend the government is doing something for small business. Let me give credit to the Bills Digest staff for their magnificent work in presenting to parliamentarians a continuance of their unbiased and professional critique of government legislation. On this occasion, I intend to quote at length from their comments in relation to arguments that I strongly support on the inequity of the proposals, these unnecessary laws and our international obligations. I referred to this issue earlier and I again note that the principal argument going to the fairness of the changes is that they leave significant sections of the work force without basic protections enjoyed by workers employed by medium to large businessesincluding workers in compatible jobs. I agree with the claim that the proposed changes to the unfair dismissal laws will have only a marginal impact on the viability of small business. Other issues-such as insufficient capital, poor management, general inexperience and predatory conduct by competitors-are arguably more pressing problems for small business; and none more so than the current flat economy. Size is not a universal proxy for profitability or capacity to pay. The bill says that, in every instance where the employer is a small business, the business is less well placed than the worker to carry the costs of a breakdown in the employment relationship. Only in some instances would this be true. VVith continuing high levels of unemployment, the removal of access to unfair dismissal remedies further enhances the already considerable bargaining power of employers. Let me now briefly address the issue of the necessity or otherwise of this legislation. I certainly believe that it is very arguable that the changes already enacted by the present government-and even the previous government-have sufficiently redressed any imbalance that may have existed in the legislation against employers. Spurious actions are now less of a problem for all businesses, as there has been a marked decline in the number of claims in recent years. VVhilst the cause of the shift may be argued, what seems clear is that the new laws have had a not insignificant impact on the number of allegations of unfair treatment being made against employers in the federal arena. I believe it is fair to argue that changes to the general law have not only reduced levels of litigation but also lowered the risk to employers of being subject to an adverse finding. These proposed changes are therefore unnecessary. The issue of protection for Australian workers always seems to raise the blood pressure of government members, for some reason. I recall many government speakers in the workplace relations legislation debate placing what I considered to be undue emphasis on the difficulties that unfair dismissal legislation was causing small business. In my view, if employees and employers are prepared to work through their respective organisations-such as the employer organisations and trade unions-in most cases a reasonable outcome is achieved. It appears to me that when either party seeks legal representation a short-cut financial solution is sometimes reached. Rather than arguing the merits of the case, as if the worker was unjustly treated, reinstatement should apply rather than a financial penalty on the employer. In a previous speech on the workplace reform legislation, I quoted an example where an employer informed me-and I speak to a number of small to medium size employers in my electorate-that one of his workers who was not a member of a trade union had legal representation in an unfair dismissal claim. The worker received a settlement of $1,600. The worker's legal representative asked the employer to make out two cheques: one for $1,000 for the solicitor-the legal representative-and $600 for the worker. I make the point again that for any legislation to work successfully it is very important that the parties involved are represented by their appropriate organisations who have more than just a financial commitment to a fair solution. VVe on this side of the House make no apology for arguing that working people should have job security, and this is where we differ from the people on the other side, who do not want working people to have job security. VVithout legislative protection, the workplace is not a level playing field-and I have been involved in this industry for over 20 years as a union official-and with employers exercising their master/servant relationship you have an unequal power structure in the workplace. I believe working people who have given good and loyal service to their employer should not have to work under a cloud of dismissal that could be caused by a sudden disagreement, a personal dislike or by a small business operator-who may not be the man on the spot-accepting the word of a factory foreman or manager. Recently a constituent came into my office who had been dismissed from a small panel beating workshop. This worker was so well entrenched in the company that I actually thought he was the owner. After working at this company for several years, this person had a couple of days off sick. When he returned to work he was dismissed. When this worker inquired as to why he was being dismissed the employer said, 'There are a couple of reasons I can give but the easiest one for me is to simply say there was insufficient work,' even though that worker had been working considerable overtime prior to his dismissal. This worker made a claim for unfair dismissal. It was only settled yesterday in the court, so I am not talking about something that happened two or three years or two or three months ago. That worker was quite prepared to settle for his award entitlement. He was given a week's pay when he left the company. The settlement in the commission yesterday awarded him another two weeks pay, which was only his award entitlement. That is not an employee who was taking the employer to the cleaners, as has happened in some of the cases opposite. We need to look at both sides of the story here. It would appear that the unfair dismissal legislation is having the desired effect; it is working. The figures supplied by the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business comparing the period January to July 1996 with January to July 1997 show a national decline of about 20 per cent in the number of unfair, unlawful dismissal applications being lodged. I conclude with an area that is frequently misunderstood and is frequently maligned by critics with little knowledge, and that relates to obligations under the international tions that we have been party to and have endorsed over the years. The ILO has been a very special organisation throughout the Western world in that many of its conventions have been conveyed to many countries for endorsement, bringing a much better legal status for many workers. Many workers would still be languishing under appalling conditions, particularly women, but for the persuasive conventions which have been endorsed and through which improvement has begun. That is also true in Australia. It is open to question whether the broad exclusion contemplated by the bill extends beyond 'limited categories of employed persons in respect of which special problems of a substantive nature exist'. At face value, all persons employed by small business are simply not a very limited or specialised class of employee. The present proposal to exempt all small businesses in relation to new staff arguably punches too big a hole in article 2(1) of convention No. 158 of the ILO, which evinces the intention that the convention 'applies to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons' . I express my serious concern that the government is taking such steps as will demean us in the eyes of the rest of the world by creating a clear defining line between employees of certain levels of an employer. This is quite unfair and unnecessary, and it will serve as a blight on our nation for many years to come if agreed to by this Australian parliament. There is certainly a view amongst legal experts such as the leading commentator on industrial law, Breen Creighton, who has noted that: Given that Australia submitted its first report on Convention No. 158 in September 1995, this means that it would not now be permissible in terms of the Convention to adopt regulations under section 17OCC(I)(d) or (e) to exclude categories of workers (for example those whose employers employed fewer than five employees)-even though it would have been quite in order to do so before the first report was submitted. These words are not ours but clearly they underpin the serious concerns raised by those on this side of the House throughout the debate. I join with other Labor members in conven- opposing this legislation.",107
179,Mr BOB BALDWIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"If there was but one legislative measure intended to solely benefit the small business owners in my electorate of Paterson-in the regional centres of Maitland, Raymond Terrace, Salamandar and Nelson Bay through to Dungog and Gloucester and up the Myall Valley from Karuah and Hawks Nest to Pacific Palms-it would be encapsulated within the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997. Of course, expressions of support for small business, backed up by policy muscle and action shown by the Howard government to date, extend far beyond this single bill, which is back before us courtesy of our Labor, Democrat and Green friends in the Senate. These people showed their support for the lot of small business, for the vast majority of the 900,000 businesses in this country where some 680,000 firms alone have five employees or less, by moving a motion of disallowance to this regulation in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 back on 26 June. They showed total scant regard for a sensible, practical and common sense policy reform to offer short-term legitimate relief of unfair dismissal provisions for the vast majority of small businesses. I find it ironic when elected representatives in this place go out and hit the hustings, speaking on the radio circuit, talking to local newspaper journalists and mixing with the community in speaking out about the great pity and also great support they have for small business. How tough but admirable small business proprietors have to be in this day and age, they say. The unbridled respect they show for small business in their travels oozes out to anybody who cares to listen. Whether it is the long working days, councils wanting to put up another shopping centre nearby, the excess burdens of red tape and administrative costs which mean more and more paperwork, the need for reliable staff or a feeling that bureaucracy has gone mad and is stifling enterprise, these Labor and minor party members provide slick words, reassurance and a commitment they will do what they can to make things better. Small business people and the community have come to hear it all and lately I have heard it all as well. But Labor, Democrat and Green parliamentarians in particular really must consider their choice of words far more carefully when it comes down to this bill. Indeed, if they thought about the wastage of time and money in the running of another enterprise-that being Enterprise Australiapresumably from up here on Capital Hill, then this practical and sensible amendment bill should have become law long ago. As identified in More time for business, the official report to the small business deregulation task force back on 24 March this year, the current federal government set about acting on the lion's share of recommendations put to it by the task force chair, Charlie Bell, and his committee. And it has done so. The Howard government does have more time for business. It is endeavouring to deliver policies that give more time, and save money and heartache where it can, for small business owners. The federal coalition government has more time for businesses because it is attempting to address the issues that are important to small business. Surveys undertaken by the Bell task force, preceding the report More time for business of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), showed that half of the small business operators surveyed said that a significant reduction in compliance cost would allow them more time to run their business. A further 25 per cent saw reducing paperwork and meeting the demands placed on small business by government and bureaucratic authorities as a real means of increasing profitability to boost economic growth and create local jobs. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that providing a window of regulatory relief from unfair dismissal law provisions for small business and the necessary paperwork attached to them more than fits both criteria. During the very successful visit to the Hunter of the then Minister for Industrial Relations, now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), back on 30 July, the biggest cheer he received when addressing the Newcastle Regional Chamber of Commerce small business lunch was in response to the determination he exhibited to drive this amendment through the parliament. The bill makes good common sense, and both the small business community and the general public know it. This bill is also a further part of the underlying philosophy of what this government wants to do for small business-that is, simply to give it a fair go. The measures in this bill, emanating directly from the original Bell report, allow small businesses with 15 or fewer employees to be exempt from the unfair dismissals provision in respect of new employees, until they have been continuously employed-whether full time, part time or on a regular or casual basis-for a 12-month period. That seems pretty fair to me. But the protection for new employees continues, in that this bill will not affect employees' rights to take action for unfair termination of employment on grounds of discrimination-for example, because of pregnancy, age, or dismissal without minimum notice. Nor will this bill affect the rights of apprentices as they are now. If we want to restore full confidence in our economy, if we want our employees to feel confident, we need our employers to feel confident that they have control over their own affairs, without living with the constant threat of being taken to the cleaners. Small business is the engine room for further job creation in this country, and it is the backbone of economic growth. Small business is also the engine room of jobs growth in the Hunter. According to the Hunter Valley Research Foundation, the current number of retail shopfront establishments in our region runs well in excess of 5,000 and follows on the back of over 1,000 manufacturing operations. More commonly pronounced national statistics identify that, in the decade to 1994-95, small business accounted for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million net jobs created over that period. This legislative measure can only seek to enhance the prospects of small business in employing more full-time staff, more part-time staff and more casual employees, in a climate in the Hunter where consumer confidence is growing, interest rates are falling to a level previously enjoyed when Neil Armstrong made one small step for mankind onto the moon, and red tape in business is being lifted. Figures released in July by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that employment growth in the Hunter-ignoring the gloom and doom merchants like the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), alias the grim reaper, and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) who constantly claims that the skies are falling in on our local employment-identified that job creation in the Hunter region is three times-yes, three times-the national average. The local job participation rate is also up. Any kick-start the government can give to release further the regulatory burdens on small business to put people into work can surely only embrace those figures. A government prepared to offer some spine of solid, lasting support would only be too willing to adopt such a proposal-and we have. So why isn't the ethos of 'a fair go for small business' something that the members of the Labor Party and the Democrats in this place are happy to spruik outside in the community-like the Democrat Party's small business spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray, and Labor's equivalent, the member for Cunningham, Steve Martin, who were thumping the pulpit recently at an organised public meeting back on 5 August by the Hunter based small business people in Newcastle to debate the report into fair trading? Senator Murray and the member for Cunningham spoke with great verve and passion on this chilly evening in the Newcastle Town Hall to over 300 small business people. Watching them on the stage with my own eyes, they stated how they would fight for small business and drag the government towards fully endorsing the bipartisan findings of the fair trading inquiry-an inquiry, may I add, that this government actually created. Senator Murray and the member for Cunningham rightly want the retail fish and chip outlet, the clothes shop in a shopping centre, and the fruitier next door to a supermarket to get a fair go over fair trading lawbut, it seems, nowhere else. So you can imagine how I was floored when I heard on the radio Senator Murray foreshadowing that he was going to block the unfair dismissal bill, just as he supported the disallowance of the regulation in the first place. Yet there they stood on the stage like B 1 and B2, complimenting each other on how they were the crusaders of small business. The people there might have been mistaken for thinking of them as belonging to the same party. But, given that Labor no longer rent the Democrats by the hour and just bulk-bill them for the time there, you could be forgiven for that mistake. But when they finally peel off those skins and all is revealed, you will find that they are very slippery to pin down for support. Those fighting words of Labor and the Democrats do not carry through to providing some valid relief for unfair dismissal provisions for these very same businesses and support them actually employing people-and that is the point I want to ram home hard. When I first came to this parliament in April last year and in the early months following, the brevity and impact of what Laurie Brereton's legacy-that draconian unfair dismissal legislation-had done to so many unwitting small business people had become somewhat legendary. A number of tragic cases came to the attention of my office. One involved a hard working young Woodville couple in my electorate who had just purchased a produce delivery business. Employing on a trial period a male employee-the son of the former owner-a drop-off in business and its failure to live up to the price of the goodwill paid for it required the couple to review the employment status of that worker. In a bid to count the pennies in the business and keep it afloat, unfortunately, they had to reduce the status of this employee to that of casual. With the employee put onto part-time status after a period of three months and two weeks, the employee subsequently left a short time later. The significant point here is the three months and the two weeks: it was over and above Laurie's provision in the law. Without getting into the nitty-gritty of the legalist to's and fro's of what was a complicated case, an unfair dismissal claim, ultimately a substantial out of court settlement was paid in favour of the employee. Yet, in illustrating part of the letter written by the employee's solicitor to the small business proprietor's own legal representative, I think it reinforces the point more than ever that small business needs a fair go and a break from short-term unfair dismissal provisions. The letter states in part: ""We are concerned that either your client does not understand or did not properly explain to them the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act."" Confusion! They did not understand-but the law will punish all the same. I am sure that this was the same sad message conveyed to so many small business people around the country in the last few years that makes the impost of unfair dismissal provisions on small business in need of an urgent reprieve. In many cases I believe the small business man or woman was totally correct in their actions. It is their business, it is their money, it is their livelihoods that are on the line, yet the law still took them to the cleaners. Surely the laws which govern our land at the end of the day are there to help the people, not to hinder them. The same should go for the laws which govern business. This business faced the full brunt of Laurie Brereton's out of kilter and job damaging unfair dismissal legislation-Laurie's legacy. While the case had its complexities, and there is no denial of some breach of the law in the case, the question I ask is: what is wrong with a business legally trying to make a dollar? In desperate circumstances clear-cut business decisions were needed to keep that business alive and keep food on the table at home and keep the house payments going. Small business people should be allowed to make these decisions without a quirk in the law punishing them twice for their troubles. With some policy nips and tucks, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has returned the balance between employer and employee with our remodelled unfair dismissal provisions. The second extension of that process is to get that unnecessary burden off the backs of small business. As a former-and I like to think moderately successful-small businessman myself, let me tell you that the present package of reforms and initiatives to try to make the lot of a small business owner a little easier is head and shoulders above anything the former Labor government sought to put together for small and medium sized enterprises in this place. We cannot afford to, and will not, rest on our laurels. Those policy nips and tucks in getting the macroand micro-economic mix increasingly right must continue. When I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in debating taxation reform last night on the ABC radio PM program say that the Labor Party is the party that is really supporting small business, I suggest he grab a panadol, have a good lie down and think about the consequences of that statement. Kim Beazley, actions speak louder than words. If the Labor Party and Democrats are fair dinkum in supporting Australian businessesall businesses-they will support this bill. If the Labor Party and the Democrats are fair dinkum in supporting employment for all Australians, they will support this bill. If the Labor Party and the Democrats care about Australia and all Australians, they will support this bill because it addresses the problems that affect all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.",110
180,Mr WILLIS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"At the outset I want to clear up any confusion that may be in the minds of listeners of the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), and indeed various speakers on the other side about what the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is actually doing. This bill is not amending Laurie Brereton's or the Labor government's unfair dismissal laws; it is amending this government's law and stripping away a right which this government said last year they were entitled to but has since changed its mind about. It is stripping away a right for people who are employed in small business, if dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way, to seek redress: a fundamental right which this government last year and before the last election said they should have but has now changed its mind and said they should not have. Why has it changed its mind? Because it is desperate to create jobs. It will do almost anything to create employment, even to the point of destroying the fundamental rights of people, but it is not succeeding in doing that. This legislation is fundamentally flawed. It is flawed because this government assume that, by taking these sorts of measures, they will be able to create employment. There is no evidence of that whatever. They also assume that the previous government's legislation in relation to unfair dismissals destroyed jobs. We heard reference after reference in this debate and from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time on numerous occasions about Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws. That is the mythology of this government. The facts say the opposite. The facts say that, when the Labor government's legislation was in place, there was very strong employment growth. Since this legislation has been taken away, we have not seen such strong employment growth. I am not saying that these are the only issues related to employment, but this government is saying that this is necessary to create employment. There is absolutely no factual basis for that whatever. Let us look at what happened under Labor's period in office with the unfair dismissals law. It came into effect at the end of March 1994. From then until February 1996, a period of 23 months, what happened to employment with this job destroying unfair dismissals law? We had growth in employment of half a million-just over 500,000. So much for the job destroying law. There were 500,000 additional jobs created while this legislation was in place. Certainly it was not perfect and certainly we made some adjustments to it, some of which came into effect at the end of our period in office. But it was not job destroying. There is no evidence to show that it was job destroying. It did not stop half a million additional people getting jobs. In fact, in the period after we left office, for the rest of 1996, when this legislation remained in effect-although there was legislation around from May of last year to amend it, it did not come into effect until the end of December-there continued to be some employment growth under the Liberal government. In the 2% years that this Labor legislation was in place, we had growth in employment of 568,000 jobs. In the period since this legislation was chucked out and the new legislation was brought in on the basis that it would create employment, how many jobs have been created? Seventeen thousand jobs have been created in the seven months from December to July. Under the previous legislation, we were creating 17,000 jobs a month. We have had 17,000 in seven months with this legislation in place. As I said, this is not the only factor in determining employment growth. But, on the basis of that evidence, one certainly cannot say that the previous legislation was job destroying, and one certainly cannot say that the current legislation, through the Workplace Relations Bill, and the unfair dismissal changes have been job creating in the way they were claimed they would be. There simply is no evidence to show that. If you look at the facts, which no-one on the government side wants to do, you will see the opposite to what the government believes to be the fact, that is, there was no job destroying legislation. The legislation gave rights-and certainly it may have been overdone in the first place. The evidence does not say it destroyed employment. We had half a million additional jobs, 17,000 a month on average. This government would give its right arm to create 17,000 a month at the present time. It simply cannot do that. From that employment evidence, it is quite clear that the basis of this legislation is false. The basis of this legislation is that you have to take away the rights of workers in relation to unfair dismissal to create employment. The past shows that that is not so. Of course, this government refuse to acknowledge that. I can understand that they do not want to look back or acknowledge anything that was done under the previous government. But they are basing legislation on that assumption. They are stripping away the rights of people on that assumption. They have no right to do that. I draw attention to the fact that, in the first seven months of the Labor government's supposedly job destroying legislation, we created 186,500 additional jobs. In the first seven months of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill and the changes to the unfair dismissal laws, we have had 17,000 additional jobs. What a comparison. Such startling differentials make it absolutely clear that there is no evidence whatever that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were job destroying or even that they inhibited the growth of employment. Certainly, they did not prevent very strong employment growth. There is no evidence whatever that the government's new and greatly restricted unfair dismissal regime has provided any boost to employment. In the light of this, one might ask: why, then, do government members so fervently believe that the bill now before the House will lead to strong employment growth? The answer is that it is just ideology, just a belief, just something that they think must be right: if you take away some kind of employment right for workers that small business or business generally has found a bit objectionable, then that will create jobs. It is much more complex than that. You have to do a hell of a lot of things to create employment. Certainly, this government is not doing them. This kind of measure, rather than creating employment, is just making our society less fair and less equitable by taking away fundamental rights from workers. Another reason we can be utterly sceptical about claims that this legislation will be a key to employment growth is that many small businesses are already completely exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. This government's Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, which came into effect at the end of last year and which changed the unfair dismissal laws, excluded lots of people in small business. They already are excluded. It covers only those who are in the Commonwealth public sector; employees located in the territories or in Victoria, which has ceded all its industrial powers to the Commonwealth; federal award employees who are employed by a constitutional corporation, that is, a foreign corporation, a financial corporation, a trading corporation, or a body incorporated in a territory or Commonwealth authority; and federal award employees who are engaged in interstate or international trade, such as waterside workers, maritime employees and flight crew, and so on. That definition of groups excludes various small business people. Obviously it excludes the employees of sole traders and of partnerships. A myriad of small businesses outside Victoria and the territories are not covered because they are not corporations, or they may be corporations but they are not constitutional corporations. So there are lots of small businesses which already are not covered. This legislation is just sweeping up the rest of them, making sure that those who were covered initially are now no longer covered. Many of them, probably the majority, have been excluded already by the legislation which was brought in earlier this year. So we are here just tidying up, making sure that no small business need be worried about unfair dismissal legislation. Despite this already large exemption of small business, there is no evidence that it has led to increased employment. In fact, employment growth has been pathetic since this exemption was made, as I have already shown. Furthermore, there is no evidence, apart from anecdotal evidence, that these laws were especially burdensome for small business. Chief Justice Wilcox of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia noted in his annual report for 1995-96 that small business employers were underrepresented in unfair dismissal cases that came before the court. In talking about an independent survey of the court's unlawful termination litigants, he said: There is no indication that the jurisdiction attracts particular classes of employees beyond their representation in the community. Respondents also are a cross-section of Australian employers, except that small business seems to be under-represented. Although ABS statistics show that 91.7% of employers have fewer than 20 employees, the survey showed that only 33% of respondents were in. t-is category. It is interesting to speculate this IS so. Perhaps communication is better in small enterprises. In other words, what he is saying is that small business is underrepresented in the cases before the court for unfair dismissal and that, therefore, things must be working better in small business than in business generally. What this bill is about is exempting small business because there is supposed to be a special problem there. Mr Justice Wilcox is saying the opposite is true. He is saying that there is less of a problem with small business than with big business, in terms of the cases that come before the court. This government is addressing a problem at the wrong end, if there is a problem at all. Certainly, the government's actions do not fit with the words of Justice Wilcox. In this report Chief Justice Wilcox also noted that by October 1995-that is, before the latest changes by the Labor government to the unfair dismissals law came into effect-the number of cases that came before the court was just under two per cent of all involuntary terminations in the Australian work force. So, as he said, a tiny proportion of all the people who were sacked pursued litigation against their employer and took a case to court. So much for this being an overwhelming problem. In targeting an exemption for all small business, the government have claimed also that this is in accord with ILO convention No. 158, the termination of employment convention, which they say allows exclusions of this type, even though the convention states, in article 2, paragraph 1: This Convention applies to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons. So the international convention on which the unfair dismissals law is based-and which we ratified-says that this should be applying to all branches of the economy and to all employed persons. It does go on to allow for some exemptions. Countries can have exemptions for some categories, such as: . .. limited categories of employed persons in respect of which special problems of a substantial nature arise in the light of the particular conditions of employment of the workers concerned or the why size or nature of the undertaking that employs them. It is those words which the government has seized on, to say, 'We can use that exemption in the convention to put through this-based on the convention. We will be hunky-dory, in line with the convention.' However, the convention goes on to require that a country, in its first report on the convention to the ILO, shall set out any exemptions and the reasons for them and also: ... shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice regarding the categories excluded, and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such categories. So what it seems to me to be saying is that you must, in the first place, report on who you have excluded and why, and then in subsequent reports you must say how those exemptions are going and what effect is being given to the convention in respect of those categories. In other words, the impetus seems to be for going back towards the full coverage, which is the objective of the convention. But what this government is doing is going the other way. It is not paring back on the exemptions; it is going to more exemptions. VVhat is also important is that these words have been interpreted by the committee of experts of the ILO to mean that, after you have put in your first report, there is then no right under the convention to have any further exclusions. As the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) said in his address a little while ago, the first report was put in by Australia in September 1995. According to the committee of experts, after you have put in your first report, that is it. You have no further right. Let me read from the ILO publication, Protection against unjustified dismissal, a 1995 report by the committee of experts. In paragraph 74, it says: Article 2(6) allows governments to take account of future developments towards a reduction of the exclusions referred to in the first report, but not allow them subsequently to introduce new exceptions that were not in force at the time of the first report. In addition to affording the appropriate flexibility, the purpose of exception clauses in ILO Conventions is for member States to endeavour to gradually achieve broader applicationin other words, to pare back on the exemptions, not to expand them. Therefore, this government is going against this convention. VVhat it is doing is a defiance and a breach of the convention. The committee of experts has said that it is not within the terms of the convention to do exactly what this government is doing. In terms of this convention, you have no right to further extend exemptions after the first report. What you did with the Workplace Relations Act at the end of last year-narrowing the coverage on unfair dismissals and excluding lots of people-was in total defiance and breach of the ILO convention, as is what you are doing now. That is the situation this government is in. It is acting in a way which is totally contrary to its international obligations, and it is doing so on the totally false premise that, by doing this and taking this harsh action against the workers of this country, it will create employment. It will totally fail in that regard, as it has totally failed so far during its period of office.",114
181,Mr CAMPBELL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I often get the impression that this building is actually the Titanic, and we are in here shuffling the deckchairs. I recall that, when I first came to this parliament, mine was the most marginal seat in Australia and the party to which I then belonged put on marginal members meetings. I attended one of these and the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who was a great name, came down to talk to us. He put up a white board and went through a particular example-I cannot remember exactly what it was now. He put it on the board and said, 'Because of this, et cetera,' and I marvelled at the intellect of this man, at how lucid he was and how clearly he could see the problem. When he got to the bottom, however, he said, 'And because of this . . . "" it does and he drew completely the wrong conclusion-a conclusion which could not be sustained in any way from his very lucid argument. I suspect that if members of parliament today were to sit back and listen to what they say-including the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis)-they would find within what they say the germ of the truth of this matter. The government and the opposition know that this is not about creating jobs. This is about placating the small business sector. That is important. The small business sector is very important to Australia. But this legislation is not necessarily important, although I support it wholeheartedly. I would go further, however, and make 100 people the minimum and not 15. From my experience of small businesses, overwhelmingly they do not put people on in order to sack them. They do not employ people in order to rip them off. If that is the case in some circumstances, it is much more important that an overall increase in employment opportunities is provided. Small business believes that this legislation does impede it. I know small businesses which are outside the scope of this legislation but which fervently believe that they are affected by it. I know doctors who are putting staff on on a casual basis for fear of permanent employment. That is what has been engendered. So there is a use in this business. Nobody here seriously believes that the government is responsible for the near record levels of low inflation that we have. The record low inflation in this country is because nothing is happening in the economy. In short, the economy is stuffed. That is the truth of the matter and that is why inflation is low. In the government's industrial relations legislation the only thing of any value is the protection for small business, although that protection is largely, as I have said, emotional. The rest of it is a hark back to where the minister comes from-the 1950s. It is quite clear that there is no merit in it, but if the Labor Party is foolish enough to oppose it in the Senate and it becomes an item for a double dissolution, then all I can say is 'Heaven help the Labor Party' - that is, of course, if the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as the leader of that urban centralist coalition that occupies the other side of the House, has the nerve for it, which I very much doubt. The truth is this: if you are going to protect the interests of workers-and I am all for that-you do that by creating jobs in the economy. There are lots of things that can be done to create jobs-is that my mobile phone ringing? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order!",117
182,Mr CAMPBELL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Very embarrassing. It is probably from God. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It is also disorderly. Switch it off before you enter the chamber next time.,118
183,Mr CAMPBELL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I thought it was screened; it certainly should be. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Perhaps the member for Kalgoorlie might take a little guidance. It has been ruled that mobile phones are not permitted in the chamber. Will you note that for the future, whether you think the place is screened against them or not. Please continue with your speech.",118
184,Mr CAMPBELL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It was an oversight, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will observe it in future. In respect of employment there are lots of things the government could do to engender employment. A lot of those jobs that the member for Gellibrand talked about are, in fact, part-time jobs and jobs in the tourist industry. A lot of them are jobs in the quasigovernment area. So I think the figures are being fudged anyway. But it would certainly assist small business enormously if governments were committed to paying their bills in 30 days. It would also assist small business, particularly in regional and rural areas, if governments were prepared to buy locally on occasions. But governments will not do this; they will not undertake these very sensible things. If governments would see that major government entities like the armed forces purchased Australia, then there would be many more jobs in the community. There are so many things that we could do to create jobs and this is what will give workers protection. If you have a situation where a worker has job opportunities, it is much harder to erode worker conditions. When you have high levels of unemployment there is nothing the unions can do in the long run to stop the erosion of wages and conditions. That is exactly what the opposition in many cases wants. They want this continual erosion. They think that this is somehow good for the economy when it is quite clear that it is not. I have said in this parliament many times that the only future I want for my kids and for everyone else's kids is a high standard of living. This requires high wages, high levels of education and high levels of training. VVe are going backwards in all those areas. I live in fear that I am going to hand my kids a worse country than the one I inherited from my parents. You have to accept the emotional context of these things. Small business has this perception. In many cases they are right. In my own electorate I know of cases where a small business has been taken to the cleaners by workers with a little experience. VVhole businesses have been threatened, in some cases ruined. Small business is giving up because of this unfair dismissal legislation. It is not good enough to say, as the member for Gellibrand said, that it is only two per cent. That two per cent is often very critical. VVhile small business believes that it is being impeded, you have to take cognisance of that because small business is the only opportunity we are going to see for growth in the economy. VVe will not see it just with this legislation. I can assure you of that. The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) mentioned the government's fair trading inquiry. I think the report was very good. It dealt basically with only the retail trade sector and that was a little narrow. The good work of that committee will come to nought because it will put the government, if it implements it, in conflict with big business and, from my experience, big business wins. The member for Gellibrand is absolutely right when he says that you are not going to see massive growth in employment by passing this legislation. That does not, however, mean that it should not be passed. VVhile you have governments that clingboth parties in this House are the same-to this discredited policy of rational economics, which is neither rational nor economic (it is political ideology), you are going to see a continual erosion of jobs. The National Farmers Federation has just put out a circular. The National Farmers Federation is a joke. It certainly does not represent the interests of the rural sector, and the rural sector is recognising in droves that this is the case. I think the citrus growers have made a decision to pull out. They have every justification for doing so. Mr Blight, the head of the National Farmers Federation, said recently that it was a disgrace that workers in the car industry were subsidised $20,000 each. If that was true, so what? If those people were on the dole they would not have to have many kids before the taxpayer was subsidising them that much on the dole. It is far better to have the import replacement manufacturing that went with it. But, of course, it was not true. That took only the people employed directly in the car industry, not all the people who contribute to it. It is quite clear that it is the erosion of the manufacturing industry that has done enormous damage to this country. Until that is recognised, and it does not appear to be recognised by either party-certainly there was no greater architect of the demise of the manufacturing industry than Paul Keatingwe are not going to get anywhere in terms of creating employment. VVhat is needed is some confidence in the community, and that will do more to stop inflation than this god we have created of low inflation. That will do more to stop that. Once you get some confidence back in there, see if the Treasurer (Mr Costello) can come in here and gloat over low inflation numbers. I can tell this House and the nation now that the reason we have this low inflation is that there is simply nothing happening out there in the economy. There are many areas where we could be generating jobs. It makes me laugh that in the Mortimer report they go to great pains to say, 'VVe are not picking winners.' The Prime Minister says, 'VVe are not picking winners, but we have got to support the information superhighway.' It is quite clear that this government is not going to spend on the information superhighway the money that Malaysia is spending. VVe have no special expertise, no special advantage, there in any case. VVe ignore all the things where we do have a special advantage. The government talks about putting $100 million into a nonsense railway in the Northern Territory, which has not got a hope in hell of ever being viable, when Tasmania is dying on its feet. That is an indictment of the mentality of governmentthat Tasmania, which represents a far greater proportion of people than the Northern Territory, is dying on its feet while they are going to waste $100 million on a railway. Let us see a cost-benefit analysis before that money is spent. But that money has not been put into build a railway; it has been put into porkbarrel the Northern Territory and South Australia governments. That is one of the great tragedies of Australia and we have seen that recurring from both sides of this parliament. If you are looking at industries, you have to look where we have a natural advantage or where we have a strategic need. I put to this House that an area where a clear natural advantage exists is in chemical production from natural gas, of which we have an abundance. We should be supporting by every means possible the establishment of industries off the North West Shelf to utilise our natural gas. That support should be by capital grants from the government-not by dodgy taxation agreements-open and visible to the public. Governments would say, 'We are putting this money into establishing this industry because, once this industry is established, it will be there for the life of the technology, usually about 30 years.' If we cannot make ourselves central to the world in terms of producing over that 30 years, we probably do not deserve to maintain the industry, but I am sure that, given the past record of the initiative of Australian people, we would be able to do that. In terms of the small business sector, what are we going to do about it? This legislation is clearly not going to do anything. Is the government going to do anything about paying its bills on time? Is the government going to do anything about demanding the purchase of Australian material? I can tell the government this: in any economy, whether it was Joe Stalin's Russia or Ronald Reagan's America-two economies very similar in many ways-the government was the biggest single customer. It always is. Yet we see this opportunity being squandered. As for a lot of the purchasing that is done and where foreign items are concerned, if the government were to say to the people-often at a very low level of the bureaucracy-who do the purchasing, 'Look, we are not saying you have got to buy the Australian product but you have got to put in writing why you did not buy it,' you would find a whole lot more Australian products would be bought. If they were not, we would have a reason; we might be able to go back to have a look at why they were not bought. Often it is not a matter of price. Often the stuff is actually cheaper. I was in this parliament when we allowed the army to buy Unimogs when the Australian truck was actually cheaper-it was either 50 per cent or two-thirds of the price. We bought them because we allowed the army to go travelling around the world. I was in France some few months later, and I said to the French, 'Are you going to buy the Unimog? It is made by your neighbours across the road.' This French colonel looked at me as though I was mad and said, 'Monsieur, we make very fine French trucks. Why would we buy a foreign truck?' He is absolutely right. Only the governments of Australia do these crazy things. We see it happening right now in the purchase of army recovery vehicles. They have given the order to Mercedes when they could have bought the Australian vehicle. I can tell the minister now that the Australian vehicle is a damn sight better vehicle. It will certainly be cheaper on its through-life costs. No other country in the world does this sort of thing, yet you have the Labor and the Liberal parties posturing about support for business. The truth is that, until we have some courage and until there is a determination in this House that we are going to have a manufacturing industry and that we are going to create jobs for workers, conditions for workers will continue to be eroded and there will be nothing that the unions can do about it. While I am on unions, the unions have got to bear their fair share of the blame for the fiasco in which we see ourselves because I was in the Labor caucus all those days and the left wing of the Labor Party did nothing. When Keating got up and talked about the future being in the service sector, there was not a murmur of dissent from them. They went along with this nonsense. The service sector, of course, is about 85 per cent tourism-low-paid jobs, part-time jobs and jobs for women and kids, not jobs for blue-collar workers. So what have we done as a government? We have disenfranchised the bluecollar worker-he is out of work, his wife is working part time, and his kids are running feral. Does anyone count the cost of that? Do these economic rationalists, who have inhabited both the Liberal and the Labor parties, count the cost of that? No, of course they do not. The truth is that they might have the economic qualifications but you certainly would not let them do a week's shopping for you.",118
185,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"in reply-I thank the speakers who have made contributions to this debate. The parliament has had a good opportunity to canvass all the issues relating to the government's proposal to exclude certain businesses, namely, small businesses defined as 15 employees or fewer, from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. We proposed that because we think that it is a fair measure to provide encouragement to the small business community to give people jobs. This is ant area that provides so much potential for small business to create jobs into the future. If you take the 10 years to 1994-95, of the 1.2 million jobs created small businesses created 1.1 million of them, so the small business community has a track record of creating jobs and, in many cases, in difficult economic circumstances. It has still been able to provide the opportunities that otherwise would not have been provided. When the unfair dismissal laws were brought in by the previous government, they relied on the international treaty 158 on which to base the federal law. As time showed, that law in fact acted as a disincentive to job creation. Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, said a couple of years ago that too often small businesses were discouraged from giving somebody a job because they thought that the system was not fair to them. We as a government have attempted to balance the interests of both employers and employees. We want a system that is genuinely fair to both sides and that does not act as a disincentive, which the old scheme did. We made a series of reforms which came into operation on 1 January this year. We introduced a filing fee of $50. I tell you, the filing fee of $50 has quite an impact on people's behaviour. We introduced a new regime where the commission could award costs against an employee who lodged a frivolous claim. The other day the commission actually awarded costs against an employee in favour of an employer. I tell you what, that is news to a lot of employers, and is perhaps evidence that the system is starting to get some balance back into it. We also required the commission, under the law that came into effect on 1 January, to take into account the circumstances of small business. We think that is fair, because you can treat these matters as just a sort of charter of rights for employees, but if you do so to the exclusion of the employers they are going to say to themselves, 'Well, if I have got a choice between putting on a new machine or giving someone a job, I think I will go for the some machine every time because, if I have got problems with it, it will not slug me with an an import- unfair dismissal application.' We made all those changes and there has been a significant drop in the number of unfair dismissal claims in the federal jurisdiction; in fact, something of the order of 55 per cent. It is true that some people have now made applications in the state schemes that they otherwise would not have, but that actually was part of the design. The reason we designed it that way was that the state schemes have not been the problem that the federal scheme established by the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) under the Labor administration has been. Overall, there has been a 20 per cent drop or thereabouts in the number of unfair dismissal applications. So the scheme has been realigned, it is much more reasonable, it is much fairer and it is providing a better deal for small business. But we want it to go further. In fact, in the negotiations for the Workplace Relations Act we proposed going further. Quite frankly, Senator Kernot and I could not agree, so I said, 'Well, if we cannot agree, we do not have to have the fight now. We can have this fight in the matter of a regulation when we come to implement the act.'",121
186,Mr WILLIS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,That's not what they say.,122
187,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It is not what they say, and I do not intend to breach the nature of the negotiations that we had with them, but I can tell you it is an absolute fact-I hope I am not pushed further on it-that we said, 'Well, we will have this argument later.' We put up basically a compromise proposal, which was for a 12-month exclusion period, basically an extended probation period. Lo and behold, when the matter got into the Senate, the Labor Party and the Democrats joined together to defeat that regulation. So we said, 'If you are going to defeat what is a pretty sensible regulation, that leaves us no choice but to present a bill. And, if we are going to have to present a bill and if that bill might potentially one day be a trigger for a double dissolution election, we might as well have the best possible policy for the small business community that we can get.' We therefore had drafted this bill which we now have before the parliament. I was very interested to hear the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) support this bill. What he said was absolute common sense: you have got to have a system which gives some real encouragement to small business. Is it a reasonable thing to do by the standard or practice of others? Absolutely the international level, this is par for the course. We are not proposing anything especially difficult, especially odd, different, bizarre or otherwise compared with what happens at the international level. I will take some examples from Europe. In Austria, termination of employment legislation does not apply to employees in a business of less than five permanent employees. If it is good enough for the Austrians to have an exemption, why isn't it for us? In France, the amount of damages which can be awarded for unfair dismissal is lower for small businesses with less than 11 employees. So they have got a special deal for small business. In Germany, they have a situation where unfair dismissal laws do not apply to firms employing less than 10 employees. Does anybody say that the Germans are somehow exploiting their employees? No, they don't. What we are simply proposing here is standard practice at the international level-and provided for, I might say, within the ILO convention. The member for Gellibrand is here and he made some claims about whether or not this was consistent with our international obligations. Let me respond to those in a minute. But, just before doing so, I point out that the fact is that if you look at the convention it says that you are entitled to so draft legislation as to allow for exclusions of this type. Article 2 of the ILO's Termination of Employment Convention 1982 plainly allows exclusion of employees where special problems of a serious nature arise because of the size of the enterprise. The opposition say, however, that such an exclusion can only be done if it is done at the outset and acknowledged in Australia's first report to the ILO about its implementation of the convention. I am aware that the ILO's committee of experts has attributed this effect to a paragraph of the convention which requires successive reports to address any developments in the exclusion set out in the first report. But there is nothing in the debates or preparatory papers for this convention to support such an interpretation, which would frustrate the whole provision to deal with new problems as they arise. As a matter of common sense, it clearly cannot be the interit is. At pretation which you put upon it. The opposition should acknowledge that they too expanded the exclusions under their laws as the effect of their laws became clearer. You say that we are in breach, and the example you give is an example you yourselves followed when you were in office. The fact is that it ill behoves the opposition to say that all exclusions should have been in place within the first year. The opposition when in government ratified the convention in great haste before an election. They ratified the convention at a time when Australian law and practice did not meet the required standard, which is in breach of the normal approach to ratification of ILO conventions. They brought in their unfair dismissal laws little realising the impact that they would have, and small business is still trying to recover from the impact of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws because the previous government did not realise how much exclusions like the government's small business exclusion were in fact needed. That is the fact of it. This has been the greatest fiasco of industrial relations law in living memory. And now, as we try to fix the thing up to try and provide some balance in the system for the interests of both employers and employees, and for the interests of the unemployed, you are attempting to prevent us from introducing a solution when you were in fact the cause of the problem in the first place. It is quite incredible. I call on every small business person in the country to write to the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), with a copy to the member for Gellibrand, and just say that it is time that the Labor Party supported a fair deal for the small business community. It is not as if employees are just being abandoned, which is the presentation that we had from the shadow minister in his speech at the second reading stage. Employees will still be protected under the Workplace Relations Act from day one. That is the law. Section 170CK will still protect employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason, including age, sex, pregnancy and the like. Sections 170MU and 170WE will prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, is seeking a certified agreement or AW A or is engaged in industrial action. Section 298K, in the freedom of association part of the act, prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. They are available to people from the day that they are employed. So it is quite wrong for you to suggest that people areMr MCMullan-You say I didn't acknowledge that in my speech; of course I did.",122
188,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Your whole presentation, the whole scare campaign that the Labor Party is running, is to suggest to peopleMr MCMullan-That is 100 per cent untrue.",123
189,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Let us see you publicly acknowledge it in a much more forceful way than you have bothered so far to do. We know the Labor Party. Its substitute for good policy is a good scare campaign. It is the same with workplace relations, tax reform, tariffs and all the other things. Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu except in cases of serious misconduct. The exemption in respect of this bill also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses, who have a particular need for protection. The exemption, as I said earlier, applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. These were not facts readily admitted by many of the speakers on the other side. They are not readily admitted because as people understand what the government is proposing I think most people concede that it is fair and reasonable, consistent with good international practice and would provide a real boost to the small business community. It is a sad reflection on the Labor opposition that, when it comes to the small business community, so often it opposes sensible measures to provide them with a break. On the capital gains tax, in regard to the rollover relief for small businesses where they are selling one business and going into another business, you tried to pare back the value of that benefit. We need the small business community. We need them to be able to thrive and prosper. You should not have a policy which is aimed at cutting back benefits to the small business community at every opportunity. And then there was the fiasco that you gave us this week. The capital gains tax rollover relief went through the Senate in June and came into operation on 15 July. We followed it up with further legislation to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for those people in small business and retiring with the transfer of those funds into superannuation funds. You gave us a different set of formula for calculating those who would qualify than we had for the rollover relief, which means that from opposition you are loading up the small business community with red tape. It is unbelievable. For 13 years no-one gave the small business community more red tape than the Labor Party. Even in opposition you are still doing it. We are trying to remove red tape, we are trying to remove unfair tax liabilities on the small business community, we are trying to put a bit of incentive back into the system, and from your political graveyard in opposition we get this flicker of muscular response from you in the Senate which imposes yet another burden on the small business community by requiring small business to calculate the value of their personal assets. So have to get the valuers in on the family car and all their personal assets or whatever it might be simply to give you an opportunity to squeeze back a reasonable benefit which the government is attempting to provide in its reforms to the capital gains tax system. So by all measures this is a very fair and reasonable measure to the benefit of the small business community. We tried to get it in last year. We were unable to do so. We tried to get a compromise through the Senate by way of regulation. That was knocked back. We now introduce this bill. The Labor Party must be severely embarrassed by having the member for Kalgoorlie, a former Labor member, standing up and saying that it is about time that the small business community got some reasonable benefit. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the shadow minister for small business, did say something about this bill or the regulation before it was knocked off in the Senate to the effect that it would not be good politics for the Labor Party to oppose this. He was quite right to give you that warning. It is a pity did not take that warning because this sends a very clear message about your attitude to the small business community. You are not prepared to lift a finger for them. I say to you in all fairness and without too much political rhetoric that I honestly cannot understand why you are so opposed to this. I really can't. If vulnerable people were so dreadfully exposed, if it were such a bad deal for them, maybe I could understand what you are on about. But, given the other protections available to people and given that it falls within the bounds of conventional practice within the international community, then I for the life of me cannot understand why you cannot provide this benefit to the small business community. You need to at least recognise that you wrought a hell of a lot of damage on the small business community with the unfair dismissal law. You set up a culture where employees took the view that, regardless of what the circumstances were when they got the sack, they were entitled to go down and write a letter of demand to their employer, they and they would reckon that they would in most cases get $5,000 or $6,000 regardless of the circumstances because the employer would tum up to the local solicitor and the local solicitor would say: 'The average costs are $8,000. They have got you over a barrel. You could go before the commission but, given some of the decisions coming out of the process, the chances are that you are going to go down. You would be better, therefore, just to settle.' It was really a form of blackmail. The message under the Brereton unfair dismissal scheme to small business was: 'Do not employ somebody because, if you do, you could be badly treated, unfairly treated, and just to add insult to injury you will have to spend a couple of days down there in the commission or tribunal fighting for the survival of your business and have to close the doors of your business while you do so.' This is a very fair, reasonable and balanced measure. Sure, it provides some greater benefit to the small business community-we think it should do so-but it does so in a way you which is also fair to employees. For that reason, I commend the bill to the House. I am disappointed at the partisan political approach taken by the opposition to it. I think they will rue the day politically, but I look forward to the bill's passage through the House. Question put: That the bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",123
190,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,"Canberra) (6.39 p.m.)I want to raise one particular matter concerning the clauses of this workplace relations legislation and some comments made in support of the legislation by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), comments which made an interpretation of the legislation that I think is incorrect. I want to seek some clarification from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) about that and then, if that is incorrect, seek his rationale for the relevant provisions. My concern relates to the fact that the bill makes explicit exclusion, from the exclusion, of apprentices. I welcome that. If there is going to be a provision, better that it excludes apprentices than not; though I wish it did not exist at all. It is not that I query that; I just want to raise two things about it. If I heard the member for Murray correctly, she said that apprentices could be excluded because the existing provisions in the legislation did not apply to them because they were employed under a fixed term of employment. While, technically, I could imagine that might be an interpretation you could make, the case law, as I understand it, does not confirm that; and I think that is not correct. What I would like the minister to consider is: if that is not the correct explanation exclusion-and I assume it is not-what is the rationale for distinguishing between apprentices, trainees and other young people who might all be employed by the same employer on the same day and be subject to the same dismissal processes and, yet, one has protection and the other two do not because of their different categories of employment? Their age may be identical, their period of employment may be identical, their relationship to the employer may be identical, their behaviour and the employer's response may be identical, but one young person would have a right of appeal by virtue of their status as an apprentice. We welcome their having that right of appeal. We think they should have that right of appeal. The assurance that the minister gave before the election, that you would have a right of appeal if you were unfairly dissimple missed, should be implemented for all emthe ployees, not just for apprentices in these circumstances. What is the rationale for that distinction? Why is it that there is one group of young Australians to whom these provisions will continue to apply and, yet, will not apply to all those others? I would very much appreciate the minister's explanation of that. On the face of it, it seems like an anomaly. The member for Murray was quite ingenithink ous in thinking of that explanation, but not think she is correct, if my understanding of the law-not this particular act, but the as it relates to apprentices and that subclause of the act concerning fixed terms which was in the previous legislation as well-is correct. exclusionIf that is not the explanation, why has that distinction been made between apprentices and other young people? It seems to me, on the face of it, simply to be acknowledging our argument that people should have a right to appeal against harsh, unreasonable and unjust dismissals but recognising it only with regard to one particular and small subgroup of young Australians rather than all Australians who ought to have the same benefits. I would very interested in the minister's response to the member for Murray's ingenious interpretaand tion of the provision and, if she is not correct, his rationale for what is otherwise an irrationof the al and unreasonable distinction.",125
191,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"To, in a preliminary way, respond to the shadow minister, I am expertly advised that",126
192,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,I thought you were the expert; that you did not need to be expertly advised.,126
193,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"It is only good sense to take further advice. I am expertly advised that the interpretation of the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), with all due respect to her, would not be fully supported by the legal advice that I have available to me. The reason I say that is that there is a diversity of contractual arrangements that apprentices around Australia enter into, and you need to look at the specificity of each and every one of those arrangements to see the worth of her comment. But, in a response to your remarks, the fact of matter is that we do not believe that she is right. I think that is the quick answer. In respect of apprenticeships, I think they are reasonably treated as different, which is what we do in this legislation. Apprentices take on apprenticeships with the purpose of acquiring certain skills over a period of time, and to have that arrangement upset midway by the actions of the employers we do not is reasonable. Therefore, we thought the I do exclusion was a fair thing. I suppose you could argue the logic of this until the cows law come home, but we thought it was a reasonable thing to do and we made that provision as a result. I am pleased that you support their Mr MCMullan-Of course.",126
194,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"even though you argue about the rationality of it.  p.m.)-In this discussion on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997, it is very easy to use the umbrella term 'small business' without recognising that 48 per cent of small be businesses do not employ anybody. They are not employers. I hear it used again and again, the great misconception under which the government deludes itself is that the obstacle to employment growth in this country is the existence of fair and reasonable employee protection law; law that is there to ensure that employees-many of whom are young, inexperienced and utterly incapable of standing up for themselves and putting a case to their employer-are not harshly treated, unfairly dismissed or lose the protection they have should the passage of this bill proceed. When we look at the number of small businesses, we see that there were some 785,800 small businesses on the register at the end of 1994-95, of which 427,600 did not employ anybody. They are not employers. A further 315,300 employed between one and nine employees and 37,700 employed between 10 and 19 people. In the manufacturing sector-where any business employing fewer than 100 people is classed as small businessthere were 5,200 small businesses. When you look at those figures, you need to first look at the analysis of small business and the trades and what businesses those people are in. It is fascinating to look at the areas of retail and accommodation. In retail, there were 134,700 businesses at the end of 1994-95 and in accommodation, cafes and restaurants there were 25,400. If you relate that back and say, 'Where are the problems in small business?', small business's biggest problem is a flattened economy-a lack of growth. They want demand; that is where the jobs are going to come from. And they are seeing tens of thousands of federal employees being sacked. The great problem for small business is a total lack of security. There is a massive feeling of insecurity right across small business, and that is why they want to see a fair go and they want to see the fair trading report recommendations implemented. When you look at the composition of small business and relate that back to where the problems are, you see that in the year 199697 there were 504,567 award inquiries. That is 2,018 award inquiries-people ringing up and seeking information about their award entitlements--every working day of the year. That number is a 64 per cent increase on the previous year, and all of the year 1996-97 was within the span of this government. Since this government came to office, there has been a 64 per cent increase in the number of inquiries made by people about their award entitlements. When you look at award breaches, you see the industries in which these award breaches are occurring. In New South Wales, 19.6 per cent were in the motor vehicle industry and 10.6 per cent were in hospitality. The top of the hit parade in Queensland were the same two industries, the top of the hit parade in the Northern Territory was the retail industry and the top of the hit parade in Tasmania were the hospitality industry and the motor vehicle industry. In Victoria and South Australia it is again the motor vehicle industry. So the breaches are being detected in the same areas where the mass of complaints are occurring. It makes a complete mockery of what the government is talking about and trying to pursue in this legislation. They labour under the myth that people in small business are not employing more people because of the existence of this employee protection legislation. If we look at the rate of unfair dismissal applications, in the first five months of 1997 they were down by an average of 122-less than half what they were in the comparable period of the previous year. That is not the problem. The problem is lack of demand, lack of confidence and policies from this government that are utterly depressing business and undermining confidence. The legislation that exists is there to protect employees from harsh, unfair and unjust treatment. That is why the mass of small business out there that employs people is not concerned with this legislation. (Time expired)",126
195,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"There is no way in which the government can rationalise its attitude on this question. This is appalling policy. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said that we can argue on the logic of this question. We are not arguing on the logic of whether or not apprentices should be excluded from the provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bi111997. What we are concerned about is the morality of this legislation. There is recognition in this government's own legislation that some people can be dismissed as a result of harsh, unreasonable or unjust arrangements. As far as small business is concerned, they say that if you are an apprentice, you will be protected against harsh, unreasonable or unjust dismissal. They recognise that it exists and yet they say: 'It applies to all other employees.' But to those of small business, they say, 'Not to you.' Let us make no mistake about it. That is what they are saying to all of those people who become employed in small business, which is defined as any business with fewer than 15 employees, and there are probably about a million of them in Australia. The member for  there are about two million employees in businesses in Australia which employ 15 or fewer employees. So we are not talking about something which is peripheral; we are talking about the biggest single complement of businesses that operate in Australia. As I said, the government recognises that there can be harsh, unreasonable and unjust circumstances surrounding the dismissal of employees. But if you are in small business: stiff luck-unless you are an apprentice. Of course, we endorse the exclusion of apprentices. We would endorse even more fulsomely the exclusion of all employees in small business. Why the government would have adopted this measure simply defies imagination. There has not been one person on the government side, including the minister himself, who has set out to justify this particular provision, because it cannot be justified. I heard the debate through. Members on the government side got up and criticised the unfair dismissal arrangements which we had. People got up and criticised the general arrangements that might be in place for employees to appeal against the circumstances in which they were dismissed. But not one person made out a case for why employees in small business should not be afforded this protection. There is a discriminating immorality involved in these provisions. They cannot justify the removal of protection of employees who are dismissed in a harsh, unreasonable or unjust way. But they have said this will encourage employment in small business. When the employee number in a small business is approaching 15, after which they will no longer be covered by this amended provision, the question is whether or not those small businesses will continue to employee additional employees. The answer, quite clearly, is no. The point has also been made that the number of unfair dismissal appeals has fallen dramatically. So, in terms of the incidence of these appeals, this amendment is not necessary. In terms of the morality of this situation, this amendment is not necessary. People employed by small businesses are just as entitled to the protection of the law, to the protection of their dignity, to the security of their employment and to protection against harsh, unreasonable and unjust dismissal as any other employee. (Time expired)",127
196,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"I think everyone realises that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and many members on the other side are engaging in absolute obfuscation in trying to suggest that, by removing the right to protection against harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal, workers in small businesses with fewer than 15 employees will be adequately covered. We all know that the situations in which they will be covered are extremely limited, related to areas like discrimination and notice, and that in many situations related to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal they will have no protection at all. That is the reality; the minister knows it. Let us stop mucking around and pretending that there is no change in their situation. As far as the minister's comments go about standard practice at the international level, I do not think it is standard practice at the international level to have exemptions of the degree of fewer than 15 employees. There are a number of countries, as he said, which have some exemptions. The ones for which details are available to me include Germany, Austria and the Republic of Korea, which has exemptions for fewer than four employees, and Sri Lanka. The only one that I could find that had anything like the proposal that is here in this legislation of fewer than 15 employees was Sri Lanka. Mr Reith-What an insult to the Sri Lankans.",128
197,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"So now we are to have Sri Lankan labour standards. That is what you are giving us: the same rights and the same coverage in relation to small business as they have in Sri Lanka. What is your next burst? Are you going to give us a Sri Lankan 48hour week or two weeks annual leave like in Sri Lanka or the Sri Lankan $60 a month minimum wage? Once you go down the deregulation path and you are unsuccessful, and you believe you must do more deregulation and you are unsuccessful, and you must do more, you simply unwind all of the protections that have been built up for Australian workers over the years and the decades. That is the path this government is on. You start to take us back to the kinds of minimal protections that exist in many of our Asian neighbour countries. The minister also says that his actions are consistent with our international obligations. As I said in my speech at the second reading stage-and I do not have time to repeat the details here-that is simply not true. He said it at the Press Club; he has been saying it all over the place. It is not true. The committee of experts, whom he dismisses as a bunch of nincompoops who do not know what they are talking about, presumably do know a little about this subject. They are the international experts on the convention. They did a report on the protection against unjustified dismissal in 1995. What they said in that report was, in paragraph 73: A member State which ratifies the Convention has to list in itsftrst report (to the ILO) submitted after ratification the categories of workers which may have been excluded in pursuance of paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 2 . . . That is the area on which this government is relying for support for this legislation: the exemption given in paragraph 5 for size of undertaking. The report goes on to say, in paragraph 74: Article 2(6) allows governments to take account of future developments towards a reduction of the exclusions referred to in the first report, but not allow them subsequently to introduce new exceptions that were not in force at the time of the first report. It could not be clearer. They are saying absolutely that once you have the first report-and that was given in September of 1995-there is no entiilement to bring in extra exclusions. But that is what this government is doing with this legislation. It is totally against the international convention. In fact, so was the Workplace Relations Act which came in at the end of last year. The exclusions that are in that are against the convention as well. You have no entitlement under the convention to do either. You must know that. Your department must know that. You are trying to bluff the people of Australia. You do not give a damn about the international conventions or the ILO. You just want to trample over all of that to satisfy your small business clientele. You tell the people of Australia that this is all about creating employment. It will do nothing for employment. What it will do is cause great concern and hardship to a lot of employees of small businesses in this country.",129
198,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"As we are having a half-hour debate, I thought I might respond to some of these rather more extreme things that the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has been saying. The only government, to my knowledge, that has been close to being in breach of the ILO in recent years was the government of which you were a member. That was in respect of the reforms you introduced in 1993. There was a report back on that and in due course you amended your legislation. So do not come in here with your confected concerns about the ILO. You do not have a good record on this. I just wonder whether you heard my reply. You had a series of exclusions in your unfair dismissal laws. So there goes your argument on that one. The convention clearly makes allowance for it. If your first report argument were right, that would mean that you would not be able to react to new circumstances as they arose over it does time. It just does not make any sense. You yourself in government faced exactly the same thing.",129
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Nehl)Order! The chair would be obliged if the Leader of the House could address his remarks through the chair.,130
200,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"You collectively, Mr Deputy Speaker. 'You lot' as in you lot over there.",130
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,You might refer to the 'Labor lot' instead.,130
202,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"Labor lot. I never heard from that lot over there impassioned speeches about the ILO when they had similar measures and issues before them in the Workplace Relations Act. It is a complete nonsense. You wonder about the 15 employees. You say, 'Show me on the industrial landscape where somebody has set a limit of 15 or defined a cut-off point at 15.' You have found yourself in Sri Lanka with the example you have .. You do not have to take yet another trip. You do not have to go to Bordeaux, Sri Lanka or anywhere. You have only to look through the decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission here in Australia to find some authority for the setting of 15 as the definition of small business. That is what we did. We did not arbitrarily say that 15 is a number that we just happen to like. We said, 'Well, what independent authority would give us a steer on what would be a fair figure for setting this limit?' So we went to the reports and decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission-and I presume you are great supporters of the Industrial Relations Commission; you are always telling us about itand in the TCR case they set that figure. You cannot just have some criticism of it on the basis that it has no sort of independent authority to it. It is not the same matter, but it about redundancy protection for employees. The commission said 15, so we said 15. That is pretty reasonable. That is what we have done. There are two other points. I made a note about discriminating immorality. But the discrimination seems to me to be discrimination against the small business community, which we are simply trying to put right. We do so in the interests, sure, of small business-we make no apology for being supporters of small business-but we want to do so in a way which is fair also to employees and to people who are unemployed. There are choices. The member for Gellibrand says, 'Oh, the government should not say that they are not making any changes.' Of course we are making a change. We are providing an exemption. That means that some people would not have access to the remedy that they have today. I say that to you; of course that is true. But we say that that is a fair balance to be made in the interests of employers and employees. When Labor was in office the level of unemployment in Australia averaged 8.7 per cent. That is what it is today, and you say it is a crisis. We say, 'Well, if it is a crisis, we think it certainly is important that something be done about it.' There are a whole series of measures to be done about it. The shame of it is that you say it is a problem, but then you oppose every sensible measure to fix it. So, when it comes to discriminating immorality, that is what we inherited from you. That is why we think this is a fair deal. Lastly, this is about new employees, federal and state. I do not know where you get your two million figure from. It is in respect of new employees. So your scare campaign against people who have a job today is nothing else but a scare campaign.",130
203,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,"I have a question for the Minister for Industrial Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is at the table, arisirig out of the second reading speech made in this House, and I will read the relevant section. I know that the Minister for Industrial Relations and Small Business can count. Unlike both the Treasurer was (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) who have had problems with numbers in the past, this minister can count-like the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) who is able to count when it comes to leadership ballots in the National Party. The minister in the second reading speech said: Members will be aware that the Government's commitment to an unfair dismissal exemption for small business was announced on 24 March 1997, as part of the Government's small business statement, and that a regulation has already been made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, to give effect to such an exemption, with effect from 1 July 1997. But that regulation is subject to a notice of motion of disallowance in the Senatewhich must be dealt with this week. If that motion is withdrawn or defeated, then this Bill will be withdrawn from the notice paper. But if that motion is carried, then this Bill will proceed. My question to the minister at the table is: why are you pursuing this provocative publicity stunt in introducing this bill when you know full well that the opposition requires more numbers in the Senate to get its disallowance motion up--it has to get up with a majority-whereas in relation to this bill we can defeat this bill on a tied vote in the Senate. It is easier for you to knock over the disallowance motion in the Senate than to get this bill up as it is in the Senate. On your own admission",130
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I have admitted nothing.,131
205,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,"On the minister's own admission, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the motion is withdrawn or defeated in the Senate, this bill will be withdrawn from the Notice Paper. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has shown a capacity to count. He can count, unlike both the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who were soundly defeated in ballots in the party in the past or who could not gather the numbers. I ask you: why is there this provocation with this bill? It is easier for you to defeat the disallowance motion in the Senate. We require a majority vote in the Senate on disallowance. To defeat this bill, all we require is equal voting. Mr Reith interjecting",131
206,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,"What it shows is that this is a farce. Mr Reith-No, it doesn't.",131
207,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,"Your bill is a farce. You should be putting your resources into the disallowance motion, which is a lot easier for you to defeat. This is a game. It is provocative; it is a deception on the business community. You bring in this bill and say, 'Look how we are championing your cause.' It is a lot harder for the government to get this bill through the Senate than it is to defeat the disallowance motion. That is what this is all about. It is a charade by this minister because this minister has shown a propensity in the past to put a case that does not necessarily reflect the facts. It was a very effective scare campaign that he ran that knocked over four referendum proposals in 1988 that saw them defeated by two to one. That is my question to this minister. On your own admission in your second reading speech, it is easier for you to defeat the disallowance motion than to get this bill through the Senate. Right or wrong?",131
208,Mr REITH,PAIRS,I will be brief. The words that you read out were not actually in my second reading speech. You should get a copy of it out of Hansard.,131
209,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,That was what was at the table.,131
210,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"I know, and it was withdrawn.",131
211,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,"Well, why is it at the table?",131
212,Mr REITH,PAIRS,I cannot tell you.,131
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Nehl)Order! The Leader of the House will address his remarks through the chair and will desist from cross-table conversation.,131
214,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"I am just telling the member for Banks that the words he mentioned were not in my second reading speech. I have the second reading speech. As to the answer to your rather pathetic question, the numbers may be different for a disallowance motion as compared to a bill. So why did we reintroduce the bill? The reason is simple: we think this is a good measure. You knocked off what was basically from my point of view a compromise. We put that up because I honestly thought that you would support it or maybe the Democrats would support it. You were not involved in the negotiations, but my assessment was that, if we put up a regulation with a 12-month probation period, we would have a reasonably good chance of getting it through. A 12-month probation period is not an unreasonable proposition. One of the improvements of the legislation is that we set three months as a probation period. If you take somebody on and you say, 'This is subject to probation during your first three months,' then you are excluded or exempted from the unfair dismissal law. That is better than the old system because it was not clear what the probation period would be under the old system. So we have improved that and made it more practical for business. In the regulation that we introduced, basically we went for a compromise. The amazing thing was that you knocked off the compromise. It is still our view that there should be an exemption for small business. Obviously when you knocked off the disallowance, we would produce the bill. It was just the timing of when the speech was given to what happened in the Senate that affected whether or not I used those words. Apparently the thing was lodged and something happened in the Senate or the timing changed in the House of Representatives and we changed it before I actually gave the speech. That is why I have told you that it is not actually right.",131
215,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,But it is still on the table.,132
216,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"It might be, but I am afraid that I am not the tabling clerk-no disrespect to the tabling clerk. It is a pathetic point of view to make. We think this is a fair and reasonable measure for small business, so we are pressing on with it. If you reject it in Senate with your 'superior numbers', we will await the due time and after three months we will re-present the bill to the Senate.",132
217,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,So it is a DD threat.,132
218,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"The only faint hope I have is that that lot on that side have been practising saying one thing and then, when it comes to the vote, doing something else. We saw that, for example, with the work for the dole scheme. You were all totally opposed to that but, when the political blowtorch was on you, you capsized. You are heading for a fall, I predict, when it comes to the Wik matter, because you have a different position from the rest of your party. The smiles on your back bench testify to the political problem that you have got yourself into. That legislation should be supported, and there is a lot of politics on your side. I know that the ACTU is telling you to oppose this measure, so you come along and oppose it. Ultimately, from a political point of view, as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said, it is not a good position for the Labor Party to be publicly saying to the small business community that you object to a measure which would give them some encouragement to give other people jobs. You cannot claim to be concerned about unemployment and then block every solution to the problem which you were responsible for.",132

220,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,"Canberra) (7.14 p.m.)As if I would do anything else, Mr Deputy Speaker.",132
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I should hope not.,132
222,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,I will try very hard to recall your several mentions to several of my colleagues on this matter.,132
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Thank you.,132
224,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,"I want to respond to the comments of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the his summing up of the second reading stage. He attributed some positions to me that were not those which I had made in my speech. In particular, I want to respond to some of the points which the minister just made. The minister and many of his colleagues spoke in the second reading debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill about the importance of this as a measure to generate jobs and to encourage people to employ more unemployed Australians. I understand the enthusiasm with which some people hold that view. I know that they would say that if I repeat it often enough it would make that for which there is no evidence true, and that, if the evidence does not come after you have repeated it several times, then you say it more loudly. But it does not change the fact that there is no evidence that anybody can find the requests that I have made which suggests that small business has employed more people in 1997 than it did, for example, in 1995. all the sound and fury about the previous laws, and without commenting, for the purof pose of this discussion, on the merits, we have a great deal of debate about dismissal. A lot of people were concerned. Mr Reith-It's a fiasco; even Keating it in the 1996 eJection.",132
225,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,"VVhether they were award good or bad, it does not matter; I am saying debate so far. that there was widespread concern and a lot of debate when the debate was at its height. I am not discussing the merits of it. In 1997 we are operating with a set of which this minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have said has swept away the previous problem. They said that they have been consigned to history and that have a new fair go all round system. You would have believed that there was a suppressed enthusiasm to employ just waiting to burst forth as soon as the unfair dismissal laws were removed. Yet the evidence is to the termination contrary. For example, the evidence is that concerned. employment growth in 1997 has been less than employment growth in the preceding That years, particularly in that most controversial of years-1995. The assertion is made with consistencyyou would have to give it that as a virtuebut without evidence. I hate to be boringly empirical, but from time to time. I like to ask what are the facts. I understand it is a very unusual question to ask in this place, and I not wish to create an unfortunate precedent. It must be a flaw in my upbringing, but I have a consistent desire to do this. And the facts do not substantiate the argument. This piece of legislation is not about ing jobs. It is about creating creating jobs. The question the member for Banks (Mr MeJham) raised-irrespective of whose version of the speech was properly distributed-was true about the arithmetic the Senate. It is quite clear that the minister knows this legislation is not the Senate. It is not illegal to raise legislation that has to be passed in the Senate. But it is in known that this is not going to become the law. Therefore, what we are going to have is an attempt to create a smokescreen to say, For 'VVe would have solved the problem of unemployment if only we could have got rid this unfair dismissal law as applies to small did business. That was what stopped us. VVe had unfair everything else in place.'",133
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Nehl)said Order! The honourable member's time has expired, and he gets the man of the match for observing standing orders in this",133
227,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAIRS,"Barton) (7.19 p.m.)I think it is fair to say that any fair-minded member of this House, or any fair-minded laws member of the community, would say that it is appropriate to have a fair go all round in an employment relationship. I want to quote from subsection 170CA of the VVorkplace we now Relations Act 1996, which says: . . . the manner of deciding on and working out such remedies, are intended to ensure that, in the consideration of an application in respect of a of employment, a ""fair go all round"" is accorded to both the employer and employee is only appropriate. The bill itself refers to the famous case of Lotty and Holloway, which has become well known in unfair dismissal cases. It seems to me that you would remove the concept of a fair go all round only in very exceptional circumstances. It is a fundamental right that, before anyone receives a penalty or is disadvantaged, they do should be given the right to present their case in their own defence. By removing the concept of a fair go all round, the employer will not be required to give reasons, nor will he be required to hear the worker in their own defence. As I have said, you would remove creatthat fundamental right only in exceptional an excuse for not circumstances. The only circumstance which the government has referred to as justifying removing of that fundamental right is the phenomenon of 'unfair dismissal anxiety' existing on the part going to pass in of some employers. I have to say that my colleague is quite disturbing, Mr Deputy Speaker.",133
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Nehl}-I will certainly call him to order. The member for Banks, you are disturbing your colleague.",134
229,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. He was in my line of fire, and I want to ask the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) a couple of questions.",134
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Make sure you ask them through me.,134
231,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAIRS,"Yes, certainly. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the minister: why are the subsection 170CC provisions inadequate to overcome this unfair dismissal anxiety? The minister has referred to the probationary period. One alternative a small business proprietor who has this unfair dismissal anxiety is to put someone on a on casual basis. The other option, which is very simple and which any half-decent lawyer would do, is to say, 'We will put the person on for a 12-month fixed-term period.' Those safeguards already are there to dispel this unfair dismissal anxiety. So, having quelled the reason for anxiety, there is absolutely no need to take away this fundamental human right. The other issue ,which is a real problem is that, in taking away this fundamental human right to a fair go all round, the remaining provisions of the act-which are not intended to be removed-are made unworkable. Those are the unlawful termination provisions. Those provisions apply if, for instance, someone has been sacked because they are of a particular racial background or because they have a disadvantage or for those sorts of reasons. How will those provisions be enforceable on the part of a worker, if the employer does not have to give the worker any reason for dismissing him? If the worker suspects he is being sacked unlawfully, all the employer has to say in a case is, 'I did not sack you unlawwant fully; I sacked you unfairly. And, because I sacked you unfairly and you are in your first 12 months, you do not have a remedy.' That necessarily has to be the case if the employer is not required to give reasons for dismissal nor to give the worker an opportunity to have an input into the reasons why he is being dismissed. It has to be the case that the workers are effectively going to be shut out of not only the unfair dismissal remedy but also the unlawful dismissal remedy, merely because of the fact that the employer is not going to be required to give reasons. These things have not been thought through, and nor has the fact that, as in the old days of the Ranger uranium mine line of cases, that complicated situation still prevails where unionists have remedies but non-unionists do not. I do not have time to go into detail now, but the government literally has not thought through the complications that are going to occur. (Time expired)",134
232,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"Flinders-Minister for Workfor place Relations and Small Business) (7.24 p.m.)-I will respond briefly to the question that has been put to me. I will not answer all the matters the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) has raised but, if he wants further advice, we will be happy to respond to any correspondence. The honourable member said that people's concerns could be allayed by putting people on fixed term contracts. That is true. In some cases, employers will do rhat. But it will not suit employers in every case to have such arrangements-for commercial reasons or because of their workload arrangements or whatever. He also said that you could put people on as casuals. That is true as well. That has happened. There has been a lot of employment characterised as casual employment. In fact we have seen a great growth in casual employment, and the reason people have been put on as casuals-as opposed to being employed on a permanent part-time basis-is that permanent part-timers have access to the unfair dismissal laws and casuals do not. For some people, it suits them to be employed on a casual basis. I am neutral: if you to be a casual and it suits you, that is fine and, if you want to be a permanent part-time employee, that is fine as well. It is a matter of your choice. But the problem we have had is that a lot of businesses have forced people into casual employment, only offered casual employment, because they were absolutely frightened out of their wits about the prospect of an unreasonable unfair dismissal claim being lodged against them. I will tell you who has suffered as a result of that: mainly women who wanted less than full-time employment so that they could balance their work and family responsibilities. It is a classic thing for you to say, 'You can fix this problem by hiring people as casuals.' That denies a huge number of people in the work force the opportunity to have permanent part-time work. And permanent part-time work is important because that way you can have regular hours. If you have to pick up the kids from school, it is no good being a casual worker, because you do not know whether you are going to be working or not. The chances are you might be required to work. I thank you for saying this, because it exposes exactly what has been the problem. You have forced a whole lot of people out of the option of permanent part-time work, which gives them regularity and the chance to better balance their work and family responsibilities. You people have been saying, 'We should have a system where people can better balance their work and family responsibilities', but condemned out of your own mouth is your own cure-forcing people to be casualto the problem you created. That cure is very unfair mainly to women at the moment but in future it is also going to be very unfair to men. They are going to have more responsibilities for looking after families and are going to want to work less than full-time. They should have those opportunities available to them. The other thing about part-time work is that it allows you to get pro rata conditions. People with work and family responsibilities might want annual leave and whatever carer's leave is available on a pro rata basis, because they need to look after their dependent children. What you say totally highlights what you did in government: that is, by the inadequacies and total unfairness of your unfair dismissal law, you forced a lot of people into casual employment. That denied them a solution to one of the great social needs of our time-the possibility of being able to work less than full-time and being able to better balance their work and family responsibilities. You condemn yourself out of your very own mouth. Thank you.",134
233,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,-The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith)Mr Reith-We've got to finish this by 7.30 p.m.,135
234,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,I know we are going to finish by half past seven and I assure you I will. The Deputy Speaker will make sure that I do. But the minister's defence has been too ingenuous by far. Mr Reith-Ingenious?,135
235,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"It would be better for me to say that the minister has been ingenuous in the extreme. The minister claimed that we were running a scare campaign. We were doing nothing of the kind. The people who are frightened are those employees in small business who know that they are not going to be given any protection. They are the ones who are concerned. The minister said that this is a fair and reasonable provision for small business. Perhaps it is fair and reasonable for small business people but it is not fair and reasonable for employees in small business. It is not a fair and reasonable provision, and it cannot be a fair and reasonable provision because it is specifically designed to ensure that people will not be protected against unfair, unreasonable and inappropriate dismissal. They will not be given any protection against that. There has been a mass of statements from the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) assuring the community that people will be protected against unfair dismissal, but the minister is not doing so. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Reith)-by leaveread a third time. NA",135
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Racism",136
237,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Canberra) (7.30 p.m.)I reassure the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that I am not about to make another speech about unfair dismissals, or industrial relations for that matter. On Saturday, 23 August here in Canberra a very important forum was held to develop strategies against racism. It was organised by the Council for Civil Liberties of the ACT, the Ethnic Communities Council of the ACT, Community Aid Abroad and Racial Respect. Those four organisations did an outstanding job for Canberra and for their community by setting an example which I know is being replicated around the country. It was a forum attended by more than 200 people here in Canberra. I was delighted when I arrived in the hall of the Canberra Workers' Club to see so many people on a cold Canberra Saturday attending this forum. They represented more than 60 community organisations. All of us here who are active in public life know that you tend to turn up to forums and you know everybody-they were the people who were at the last protest about something else. This was one of those wonderful occasions when there was a range of people who did not usually tum out to public forums. They were there because they were profoundly concerned about what is happening in their country and in their society and they saw this correctly as an opportunity to start to build a comprehensive framework of response to the emerging signs of intolerance, disrespect and racism in our community. The aims of the forum were to develop strategies to fight racism and promote racial harmony, to share resources and information among community groups, to strengthen the capacity of community groups to fight racism, to promote non-discrimination as central to Australian society and to affirm Australia's commitment to international human rights. The people came together and did a very solid and important job. One of the interesting and important speeches that was made was the opening address by Sir William Keys. Sir William made a very important contribution about the importance of seeing the opposition to racism in a broader context of civil liberties in Australia. We were addressed by a former member of this House, the former Attorney General Michael Lavarch, and by a number of distinguished representatives from community groups and the media. Lobbyists gave advice. The representatives attending that forum then divided into a series of workshops and developed important strategies and proposals that will be considered by their various organisations. I had the privilege of making the closing remarks at the forum. I want to refer to one particular aspect that is of great importance to the people of the ACT-I referred to it in my concluding remarks-because, ironically, we are facing the potential that the ACT elections in February next year will be the first electoral test for the Pauline Hanson One Nation Party. They have said that they will run candidates in this election. It may, therefore, be the first time they are put to the test. This forum was addressed by the Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, and was attended by the new Leader of the Opposition, Wayne Berry, and people from the Greens Party and from all the other organisations that I am aware of that are likely to be contesting, and represented in, the ACT assembly. Recognising that, I put to that forum and I want to put to this House, and through it the people of Canberra, that this would be an excellent first time, first example, for everybody contesting this election to say, 'We recommend that you put the One Nation Party last.' Everybody should do it. I call on the Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, who addressed the forum and who, unlike the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, does have good credentials in this matter, to give a commitment that she will do it. I know the views of the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. Nevertheless, I need to formally put it to him that he should make the same commitment, as should the Greens and the Democrats, if, as I assume, they are going to contest this election-they do not always. They should make a commitment to combine with all the Independents to say, 'We will recommend to people who vote No. 1 for us to put the One Nation Party last.' (Time expired) Thuringowa",136
238,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I often speak in this House about Townsville city. But it should not be forgotten that Townsville is in fact a twin city: there are two city councils in Townsville. The one that I do not often speak about is Thuringowa City Council, and I would like to speak about Thuringowa tonight. Thuringowa was created as a local authority back in October 1879, at a time when the north was being opened up by pastoralists and miners. Ports were needed to service this growing interest in the north and in 1864 the small port settlement of Townsville was established at the mouth of the Ross River. The area immediately surrounding Townsville began attracting graziers and farmers with an eye to the future potential of the region. In 1879 the Queensland government passed an 'Act to provide for a local government outside the boundaries of municipalities', and on 2 October of that year the Thuringowa divisional board was created. The first board members were elected at a public meeting in January 1880, and nine members were presented with the task of catering to the needs of a sparse and widespread population occupying 7,612 square kilometres. Thuringowa, despite being seen by some as merely a rural authority, was prominent in the establishment of a railway link to the gold mining centre of Charters Towers and also played a key role in the construction of a railway line to the sugar town of Ayr. Thuringowa, incidentally, also had the first airport for Townsville. Thuringowa is also the source of water for the adjacent city of Townsville, and in 1897 the Thuringowa water board was established. Five years later in 1902 Thuringowa became a shire and remained so until 1 January 1986, when it was raised to city status. The push for city status began in 1985, when Thuringowa was in the throes of a major building boom, and the population more than doubled over a five-year period. The council of the day believed much could be achieved in its dealings with government departments and private enterprise if it could speak with the authority of a city. Since 1986 Thuringowa has undergone a major transformation, more than doubling in population in 10 years, and attracting a wide cross-section of business and industry. I believe Thuringowa' s growth since 1986 would be the envy of many more established cities. For instance, since 1986 the Thuringowa City Council has dealt with more than 31,000 building applications, including 8,262 for homes and 325 commercial applications, with a total value of nearly a billion dollars. It is worthy of notice that a significant number of homes built in recent years have been for the benefit of defence personnel posted north to serve in Australia's largest army barracks, 3rd Brigade's at Lavarack. The undoubted jewel in the industrialcommercial crown of the city is its enterprise centre. That centre was officially opened in late 1995 and yet now, only 20 months later, the council has added a second stage and has called tenders for the construction of a third stage. The enterprise centre was established to give small businesses-those in homes and backyards-an opportunity to embrace better business practices with the assistance of experienced centre managers, and to expand their operations to a stage where they can ultimately relocate to premises of their own. Thuringowa today has an estimated population of 47,000, of which more than 9,000 attend the city's 23 preschools, primary and secondary schools. Thuringowa is also home to the giant Queensland nickel refinery, which in the past financial year treated 3.2 million wet tonnes of ore to produce 25,180 tonnes of nickel and 1,482 tonnes of cobalt. Australian Granites, yet another success story in Thuringowa, mines granites in western Queensland and cuts and polishes granites in a multimillion dollar factory, for a widening domestic market and a growing overseas market, especially in South-East Asia. These major enterprises play their part in the economy of this country because they contribute significantly to this country's exports and, of equal importance, they generate long-term employment. Speaking of employment, it is of interest to know that, according to the 21 July edition of Business Queensland, anyone who is keen to set up in business and wants to know where people have the highest disposable income in Queensland should note that Thuringowa is second on the list behind Cairns. For the benefit of followers of rugby league, Thuringowa also lays claim to being the home of the North Queensland Cowboys. Stockland Stadium, the Cowboys' home ground, can seat 31,000 fans and is suitable for a variety of other sporting uses. Thuringowa is not just about bricks and mortar and progress; the city prides itself on being a city of families. Certainly the Thuringowa City Council is closely attuned to the needs and concerns of residents. (Time expired) Nursing Homes and Hostels",137
239,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"The owners and operators of private nursing homes and hostels for the aged frequently have to put up with a great deal of nonsense in their dealings - ith standards monitoring team personnel. It seems that sometimes, but nevertheless all too often, individuals from the teams have to justify the time spent looking into the operations of a nursing home or hostel by finding fault where none really exists. We have become almost inured to Australian Taxation Office audit inspectors behaving in this way, but the thinking seems to have permeated at least some of those in the Department of Health and Family Services. Take one case related to me recently. A new patient was admitted to a private nursing home and, on admission from a general hospital, was found to have scabies. We can only guess why her condition was not picked up and treatment for the condition commenced while she was still in hospital. As it turned out, the admitting nurse did not know about the scabies, and it was discovered immediately as a consequence of the home's routine procedures when any new resident is committed to its care. After discussion with the new resident, treatment for scabies was administered, as might reasonably have been expected-a matter of course, we might think. But it is not. There is no way that trained nursing staff can just go ahead and treat a case of highly infectious scabies before it spreads to other residents or staff. There are bureaucratic procedures that must be observed. All this comes to light as a result of a standards monitoring team having been told that the case of scabies had been found in the nursing home concerned. An anonymous tipoff, no less, had brought it to the department's attention. Telephone contact with the nursing home ensued and a visit by an inspector arranged. Part of the interview by the inspector with the senior nursing sister in the presence of the proprietor was concerned with the infected resident's right to freely choose treatment for the disease-'Was the resident cum patient consulted ?' Yes, apparently she was. Sister told the inspector that, after discussion, the patient was-in the vernacular-'talked into it'. It seems that the antennae of the inspector activated automatically. To be talked into something must have involved denial of the resident's right to freely choose to have or not have treatment. On it being explained that, in every day conversation, 'to be talked into' something more often than not means to be persuaded by sweet reason to accept good advice, the inspector was still relatively unmoved. Remember that this episode did not arise because of any complaint before or after treatment by the resident or her family. There had been a tip-off to the department by a person or persons unknown to the nursing home management. The potential for idle mischief-making should be apparent. But more important is that the nursing home nevertheless received a black mark on its record, plus all the timeand cost-consuming inconvenience, because of some bureaucratically perceived violation of an infected person's right to choose not to be treated. It seems the rights of other residents and staff to remain uninfected were of only secondary importance. Least important from this example is a need for common sense. Let it also be understood that, only a couple of months earlier, the nursing home had been audited by a standards monitoring team and been scored 31 out of a possible 31 for its entire operations-a rare mark indeed. Paedophiles",138
240,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"It pleases me to be able to speak tonight about a matter which is very close to my heart. For many years now I have been campaigning for tougher penalties to be imposed on paedophiles. The damage that these criminals do to young children cannot be overestimated. I have seen and heard of many terrible stories about children who are left scarred for life a result of being preyed upon by a paedophile. The federal government recognises the importance of this issue and has announced that it will step up the fight against paedophilia through a new national strategy. On behalf of my constituents of Makin, I wish to thank the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) for her announcement of the soon to be established National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse. The minister has shown great understanding of this issue in making such an announcement. I have long argued for the establishment of a national approach to combat paedophilia, and I am pleased that this will finally come about, thanks to Minister Moylan and the Howard government. As a sure sign that this government is to get tough on paedophiles, the minister has already announced that the federal government will be closing any loopholes through which paedophiles may escape or continue to prey upon children. The government will introduce legislation to ensure that a protective order issued in one state will have effect in other states. This will provide greater safety for a child should he or she be moved to another state. A register of convicted paedophiles will also be established to assist police and the community in the fight against this horrendous crime. It is my understanding that the first task of the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse will be to examine the recommendations of the Wood report into paedophilia in New South Wales. Justice James Wood has recently released this report after extensive investigation of the issue during Australia's first royal commission into paedophilia. The report highlights the need for national action, as does the recently released report by the Queensland Commissioner for Children. The Wood report identified the actions of paedophile groups that abused children and used the Internet to communicate. The community has a right to expect action to be taken to stop the insidious actions of paedophi Ie networks, and this government is comas mitted to providing that action, in conjunction with the states and territories. One recommendation in the Wood report that does concern me is in relation to the lowering of the age of consent for homosexual sex. If adopted, this would allow homosexual sex with young people as young as 16 years of age. This raises the question as to whether a paedophile could claim consenting homosexual sex with a 14-year-old and use the defence that he or she thought the young person was really 16 years of age. I am deeply concerned by this recommendation and call for its outright rejection by all members of this House and the general public. I believe that it is wrong to be recommending a reduction in the age of consent for homosexual sex, which would provide an avenue for paedophiles to avoid justice, in a report which is highlighting the tragedy suffered by the victims of paedophiles and their families. Our aim must be directed towards the identification and prosecution of paedophiles, not providing them with potential avenues for avoiding justice. As a society, we cannot continue to turn the other cheek and ignore this national problem. It requires, and as from today it will receive, national attention. I commend the announcement by the Minister for Family Services and look forward to the prosecution and conviction of child sexual abusers. Our community will be safer when the paedophiles have received justice for their hideous crimes against innocent children. Lyrebird Community Centre",139
241,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to draw the federal parliament's attention to the fine work of a local group my electorate of Isaacs. The persons I speak of are both past and present members of the committee and staff of the Lyrebird Community Centre who have assisted in creating community infrastructure where it never existed before. This tireless and unpaid work is unrecognised by many others in the local community, and tonight I wish to redress that by offering thanks for their fine efforts. The Lyrebird Community Centre had its beginnings in 1989. The budget of the centre at that time was a paltry $7,000. Today the income for the centre is over $240,000, funding being split between state and local governments and cost recovery activities undertaken by the centre. To date the centre has not secured any federal funding, although I expect this to change in the future, and indeed hope it will change. The centre's main focus for the provision services is the Carrum Downs area. Like other outer regions, Carrum Downs began life as a rural hamlet. Since 1978 the population has grown substantially but, sadly, many government provided services have been one step behind. The absence of government was in many ways the germinating seed for these local activists to get together and start this centre. Today the activities provided by this centre mirror those of the TAPE sector and many provided by local, state and federal governments in other parts of area, although of course at a very reduced cost to the public purse. My recent discussions with coordinators Cathie Valentine and Marie Blakey and key committee of management member Peter Hart left me with feelings of both joy and disappointment. The happy feelings related to the extensive range of services provided, which include literacy classes for migrants, moderately costed child care, immunisation for children, cancer support groups and extremely popular computer study courses. Presently the centre is discussing with the Salvation Army the introduction of counselling services for youths to be run by the army inside the centre's premises. The centre enjoys patronage of 2,000 persons per week, which highlights the dein mand for its services. As well, this patronage reflects the careful way in which each new service is assessed to ensure that it suits the demographics of the community. As I mentioned moments ago, I had some sad feelings as I left this centre recently. The centre has a severe capital and recurrent funding shortage which limits its ability to expand service provision. The main hall it operates from is very small, accommodating some 80 persons. This means that changeovers from one activity to another during the day curtail the time the centre is actually delivering services. Numerous approaches for further funding to local and state governments have borne no fruit. The inappropriately named Victorian Government Community Development Fund is awash with money but very little appears to be directed to such worthwhile community of facilities as the Lyrebird Community Centre. More disturbing than the paucity of capital being made available for local infrastructure is the growing trend for federal and state governments to completely abandon some areas of social service, Recently the centre has begun to receive people who have been referred from local DES offices. It has reached the stage whereby some people are so desperate they are asking for food vouchers, something the centre has never experienced previously, and something I expect to conthe metropolitan tinue, sadly. In conclusion, I would like to thank the 70 volunteers who so generously give their time, past and present members of subcommittees, the full-time staff, Cathie Vallentine and Marie Blakey, and the following members of the Committee of Management: Fiona Dannock, Debbie Wothius, Dena Bradley, Swee Dahni, Sue Evans, Peter Hart, Bronwyn Longhouse, Di Oliver, Pete Stuart Jones, Keri Thiele and Dave Withers. The centre revolves around these people. The people of Carrum Downs owe them a debt. On behalf of those same people of Carrum Downs, I wish to express my sincere gratitude. Hearing Awareness Week",140
242,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am, as honourable members know, keenly interested in the health of Australian people in all its aspects. This being so, to advise the House that Hearing Awareness Week takes place this week, that is, between 24 and 30 August. I would like to mention a few activities that are taking place. When investigating the scale of deafness and hearing impairment which besets this country I was surprised at how many Australians are affected. The Deafness Forum, the peak body on deafness in Australia, advises that between one million and three million Australians have an acquired hearing impairment. That is 10 per cent of the population. In addition, approximately 150,000 people are born deaf. Much of the deafness acquired by people is regarded as having been preventable. This is not good news, but statistics for indigenous communities are far worse. In this section of our population, 60 per cent suffer from hearing loss and associated problems. Indigenous communities lack awareness about hearing problems. At any given time up to 80 per cent of children in indigenous communities in the Gulf, the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait island communities are afflicted by chronic ear infections, perforated ear drums and discharging ears. The Menzies School of Health has advised the North Australia Aboriginal Legal Service that it should work on the basis that every client has a hearing loss unless otherwise informed. Also, two out of every 1,000 babies are born deaf due to their mothers being infected with rubella, or German measles. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 deaf people in Australia who use the Australian Sign Language as their primary method of communication. The mission of the Deafness Forum is to improve the quality of life of Australians who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment or a chronic disorder of the ear. Hearing Awareness Week provides an opportunity to raise community awareness of hearing impairment and ways of protecting people's hearing. To make the country more aware of the problems of the deaf, the Deafness Forum has organised and will be coordinating Hearing Awareness Week, and this year the theme will be 'Immunisation to protect hearing'. This year the aim is to increase community I wish awareness of the implications of hearing impairment as a result of rubella. Immunisation against rubella can not only prevent a mild childhood disease but also prevent serious abnormalities in babies born to mothers who contract the disease within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. These babies are at risk of being born deaf, blind, with heart defects or even with intellectual disabilities. Hearing Awareness Week also provides an opportunity for the 10 per cent of Australians who have a hearing impairment to share their experience and knowledge and help create a greater understanding of their needs and aspirations. Some of the activities for this year by member organisations of the Deafness Forum are: information stalls at local shopping centres, distribution of information about hearing impairment, communication options, techniques as well as information on available support networks, displays of helpful hearing devices, the provision of information on hearing assessment, the conducting of free hearing tests and of lip reading competitions. As you can see, Mr Speaker, there is a lot of activity and assistance being provided for deaf people. The government is funding aid to the deaf substantially and will outlay a total of $87.5 million this financial year. Of this sum, $67.8 million will be allocated to private sector agencies or to the government run Australian Hearing Service so that patients can purchase hearing services, be these hearing implements or medical treatments. Funds are provided for services carried out directly by the Australian Hearing Service on children and other groups with special needs. This includes funds for services such as replacing speech processor units for children who have cochlear implants. Deafness, be it total or partial, is a very debilitating complaint. It cuts off those afflicted from proper communication with fellow human beings. It creates tremendous Ion eliness. Not only does it take away a dimension of culture such as music and drama, theatre and comedy; it also robs a person of warning sounds that might signal danger-sounds, for instance, that give away a running tap, a machine left running or a vehicle approaching, a fire alarm and so forth. I commend the efforts of the Deafness Forum, the Australian Hearing Service and the supporting agencies for the work they are doing for the deaf. I also suggest that members who are interested in this affliction on society take a little time out to associate themselves with Hearing Awareness Week. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.59 p.m. The following notices were given: Mrs Moylan to present a Bill for an Act to make consequential amendments, and to provide for transitional matters, related to the enactment of the Child Care Payments Act 1997, and for related purposes.

Regan, had written to him calling for more detailed research into reason for the very high number of bankruptcies, including the role played by gambling. (2) Has he responded to Mr Regan; if so, what was his response. (3) What action is being taken by the GovernIncident ment to research the link between gambling and business bankruptcies. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourexpressions able member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) The details of correspondence between myself and individuals and organisations is treated by me in confidence and I do not reveal it unless there is some overriding reason to do so.

Safe Operation of Air Services (Question No. 1287)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: (1) How many (a) written and (b) other expressions of concern about the safe operation of services did his Department or any other agency for which he is responsible receive in December 1996. baggage; (2) What was the specific nature of each of the expressions referred to in part (1), categorised type of aircraft service. (3) Which of the expressions referred to in part (1) originated from passengers. Written Reports of Concern (part 1 a) No Nature of Concern Allegation of substitution of Class B aircraft* for Class A aircraft * 2 Recommendation for a special audit of an operator NA Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Responses on written reports and other expressions of concern about the safe operation of air services in December 1996 have been provided by the the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and and Airservices Australia. In the same period, the Department of Transport and Regional Developthe ment received no written reports or other expressions of concern about the safe operation of air services. (1) (a) In December 1996, BASI received a total of five written reports via its Confidential Aviation Reporting system; CAS A received 6 written expressions of concern; and Airservices received 128 written reports of concern. (b) In December 1996, BASI received no other of concern but CASA received 5 oral expressions of concern. Airservices does not maintain a record of other/oral expressions of concern because it is an Airservices requirement that all concerns regarding safety of operations are to be in writing. (2) All five written reports received by BASI (as per part 1 a) were related to regular public transport (RPT) operations. The nature of each of the specific concerns is as follows: i) failure by pilots of non-passenger carrying flights to respond to RPT aircraft transmissions in for mandatory broadcast zones; ii) safe stowage of walking sticks in aircraft cabins; iii) interpretation of the relevant Civil Aviation air Orders relating to checking fuel quantity; iv) oversize and overweight carry-on cabin v) allegation of substitution of Class B aircraft* by for Class A aircraft* to operate RPT services. Details on the nature of concerns received by CASA referred to in part 1 a and b, categorised by type of aircraft service are as follows: Type of Aircraft Service RPT RPT No Nature of Concern 3 Low flying aircraft over Cable Beach, WA 4 Operator maintenance and flight crew duty times 5 Upper torso restraint requirements for passengers 6 Standard instrument departure, non-compliance * Aircraft classes are subject Other(oral) Expressions of Concern (part 1 b) No Nature of Concern 1 Alleged ""dive bombing"" of shopping centre by aircraft 2 Question on the safety of an operator given the media attention on aviation safety 3 Low flying aircraft over Kuranda 4 Observation that a floatplane operating over populated area, was flying the wrong way in aircraft lane of entry 5 Low flying aircraft on approach to Perth Airport Details on the nature of the specific concerns received by type of aircraft service are as follows: Non-scheduled flights (charter) Nature of concern Co-ordination of Information Instructions or Information Facility non-availability or failure General Air Traffic Service Factors Pilot Total Scheduled flights (RPT) Nature of concern Co-ordination of Information Communications Error Instructions or Information Procedures General Air Traffic Service Factors Pilot Total -----------------------------------------------------------------(3) None of the expressions referred to Terminal Access: Petroleum Companies (Question No. 1305) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) Has he written to the major petrol companies asking them to consider access to their terminal facilities; if so, what response has he received. (2) In his negotiations with the petrol companies has he pursued terminal access involving (a) Type of Aircraft Service Charter Charter High Capacity RPT High Capacity RPT to different maintenance requirements.

(3) Has his attention been drawn to comments by the Minister for Science and Technology on 16 December 1996 that the Minister expected Shell, BP and Mobil to open their petrol terminals for access in a matter of weeks; if so, (a) does he share this expectation and (b) how has it been met. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 11 December 1996 the Government announced its decision to deregulate wholesale petrol prices in 1997 subject to the resolution of a number of outstanding issues, including terminal access and horizontal arrangements in the industry. I wrote to each of the major oil companies about this matter on 23 December 1996 noting, among other things, that the Government would be seeking commitments from the oil majors that they would provide open access to their oil terminals. Responses have been received from each of the major oil companies. (2)(a), (b) and (c) The Government has pursued terminal access on the basis of physical access to terminals and product. This will help to establish a competitive wholesale market with persons able to seek wholesale petrol from several outlets. Competition will discipline prices as in any other competitive market. (3) My attention had not been drawn to the comments attributed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Australian Securities Commission Investigators: Individual Rights (Question No. 1577) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 March 1997: (1) Further to his answer to part (2) of question No.920 (Hansard, 27 February 1997, page 1471), (a) does an Australian Securities Commission (ASC) investigator have express power of entry only when a warrant has been issued and (b) are all individuals interviewed by an ASC investigator informed of this. (2) Further to his answer to part (3) of question No. 920 concerning an alteration of the name of an addressee on a form, Ca) which section of the Act permits this alteration and (b) was the form referred to a legal document. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1a) An Australian Securities Commission CASC) investigator has express power of entry only when a warrant has been issued. (lb) I am advised by the ASC that it does not necessarily notify every individual interviewed in connection with an inquiry or investigation that it has the power, for example, to apply to a magistrate for a search warrant pursuant to subsection 35(1) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (the ASC Law). Every investigation turns on its facts and recourse to compulsory powers may not be required. I am advised that search warrants, in particular, are rarely necessary. (2a) An ASC investigator, duly delegated by the Commission, is authorised to determine when a notice under section 30 of the ASC Law is required during the course of an investigation. The investigator is required to include information in the notice in accordance with the prescribed form, being Form 2, Regulation 5 of the Australian Securities Commission Regulations CASC Regulations). The investigator, as a delegate of the ASC, may amend the content of the notice he or she has prepared where, prior to service of the notice, circumstances change, for example, the company officer identified in the notice is on holiday. The notice is not a judicial notice Ca warrant, for example, is a judicial notice). It is issued by an ASC investigator who holds a delegation to exercise this power. (2b) The form and content of the notice referred to is prescribed by Form 2, Regulation 5 of the ASC Regulations, and is part of the ASC Law. Cambridge Gulf Exploration: Share Trading (Question No. 1636) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Is he able to say whether Cambridge Gulf Exploration provided information of a ramp of their shares where directors of County Natwest accumulated over 20% of the issued stock in Cambridge Gulf Exploration from October 1993 to January 1994 and sold it to one client, Jardine Fleming of Hong Kong, and that this led to two directors being asked to leave by an executive sent from the London office of Natwest Securities. (2) Is he able to say whether Mr B. Conroy of Cambridge Gulf Exploration provided evidence to the Australian Securities Commission CASC) that showed that secret commissions were sought by a current director on behalf of ex-directors of County Natwest during the share placement. (3) Was the information referred to in parts (1) and (2), and other information relevant to County Natwest and Jardine Fleming, provided to the ASC, including the dismissal of the participants and compensation of $25m being paid by Jardine Fleming. (4) Did the ASC conclude after more than a month of studying the information that an investigation into County Natwest past and present officials was warranted and wrote to that effect. (5) Did the ASC agree to provide Mr Conway or his solicitors with information relevant to the matter; if so, has it done so; if not, why not. (6) Is Mr Conway the only person in this matter before the courts; if so, why. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Cambridge Gulf Exploration (CGE), through its solicitors Bennett & Co, wrote to the ASC alleging that trading in shares and options in CGE had been manipulated. I am not in a position to comment on the reasons why directors may have left County Natwest. (2) While the ASC has been provided with information, either directly by Mr Conway or by Bennett & Co (which, the ASC believes, was acting for CGE at the time), I am advised that the ASC did not consider that any information provided to it was evidence relating to secret commissions which could be used in court. (3) The information referred to in parts (1) and (2) and other information was provided to the ASC. (4) The ASC advised Bennett & Co that the ASC would be investigating matters raised in their letter of complaint referred to in part (1). These matters were connected to past trading in the shares and options of CGE. (5) A letter informing CGE of the ASC's conclusions following its investigations has been sent to CGE. Bennett & Co, who sent the original letter of complaint to the ASC on behalf of CGE, advised the ASC to write directly to the company. As Mr Conway is no longer a director of CGE, it is not appropriate for the ASC to inform him of the outcome of CGE's complaint. (6) Mr Conway and Mr Malcolm Macleod are before the courts on charges related to statements made in CGE releases to the ASX in December 1993. Both men, following a preliminary hearing, have been committed for trial in the District Court of Western Australia. Perth Airport: Noise Audit (Question No. 1640) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Has the Government undertaken a noise audit to examine the impact of aircraft noise on residents in suburbs surrounding Perth Airport, especially those in South Guildford; if so, when and what were the audit findings; if an audit has not been undertaken, will he initiate an audit. (2) Will the Government institute a noise compensation regime to Perth Airport prior to the privatisation of Perth Airport. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government has not undertaken a noise audit to examine the impact of aircraft noise on residents in suburbs surrounding Perth Airport and has no plans at this time to conduct such an audit. However, a review of noise abatement procedures in use at Perth Airport was carried out by Airservices Australia late last year. The review found that the noise abatement procedures were adequate and that changes to flight paths proposed for introduction on 5 December 1996 were expected to produce favourable environmental outcomes. (2) No consideration is being given to the introduction of any additional aircraft noise amelioration programs, including at Perth, at this time. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Aircraft Take Offs (Question No. 1649) Mr O'Keefe asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) How many aircraft took off from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport during the period (a) 1 September 1995 to 1 March 1996 and (b) 1 September 1996 to 1 March 1997. (2) For each category referred to in part (1), how many took off using the north-south runways, and how many using those runways took off to the north. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Accurate data is not available for September 1995. (1) (a) For the six month period from 1 October 1995 to 1 April 1996, 65,962 aircraft took off from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (b) For the six month period from 1 October 1996 to 1 April 1997, 66,857 aircraft took off from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) The number of take offs on the north-south runway for the period 1 October 1995 to 1 April 1996 was 65,131. Of these, 20,266 were departures to the north on Runway 34 Left. The number of take offs on the north-south runways for the period 1 October 1996 to 1 April 1997 was 60,448. Of these, 11,433 were departures to the north on Runway 34 Left. There were 8,070 departures to the north on Runway 34 Right which turned to the east soon after take-off. Land Degradation Tax Concessions (Question No. 1680) Mr Latham asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 May, 1997: What has been the value of (a) land degradation tax concession claims from the farm sector and (b) claims by taxpayers who describe their main occupation as other than farming, for each year since 1993-94. Mr Costell-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Expenditure incurred by taxpayers on measures to prevent land degradation is split between primary production and non primary production rather than farm and non farm sector. Data has only been supplied for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years as data for later years is not yet available. 1995-96 Taxation Statistics will be available in October 1997. (a) Expenditure to prevent land degradation by the primary production sector for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years was around $62m in each of these years. The value of tax concession associated with the expenditure to prevent land degradation claimed under section 75D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 by primary producers for each of these income years was around $14m. (b) Expenditure to prevent land degradation by the non primary production sector for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years was around $27m in each of these years. The value of the tax concession associated with the expenditure to prevent land degradation claimed under section 75D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1993 by non primary producers for each of these income years was around $6m. Coroners Inquiry: Variation of Meeting (Question No. 1683) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the findings into the death of Mr M. N. Whelan in which the Coroner concluded that the question regarding variations to the minutes of a meeting between the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and Airservices Australia did not form part of the functions of the inquiry. (2) Has he instigated an inquiry on this matter: if so, has the inquiry made recommendations; if so, what. (3) What action has he taken in respect of this matter. (4) If an inquiry has not been initiated, initiate one. (5) Were the minutes of the meeting referred to in part (I) altered: if so, was it appropriate to do so. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No inquiry has been instigated following the Coroner's findings. Prior to the Coroner's report, AMSA had commissioned its auditors Coopers and Lybrand, to review AMSA's actions in relation to those minutes. Coopers and Lybrand concluded that: ""On all accounts, the amended minutes appear to be a more balanced and accurate record of what was discussed at the meeting on 21 December 1995. We believe that AMSA's actions in relation to finalisation of the joint AMSA and Airservices search and rescue policy meeting, which included discussion of the Red Baron incident, were appropriate in the circumstances."" Airservices Australia internally reviewed the alteration of the minutes and concluded there was no wrong doing by any person within Airservices Australia. (3) Given the action already taken by AMSA and Airservices Australia and given the findings, no further action has been taken. (4) No. See answer to Question 2 above. (5) See answer to Question 2 above. Harbour Masters Authority (Question No. 1713) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon Minutes notice, on 14 May 1997: Do harbour masters or officers of his Department have authority to stop a ship sailing because they believe the ship's master or crew are suffering from fatigue. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable Coroner's member's question is as follows: Harbour Masters authority is vested in them through State legislation and the honourable member should approach the relevant State authorities on this issue. Flood Mitigation Programs (Question No. 1744) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (I) Further to his answer to question No. 1478 will he (Hansard, 26 May 1997, page 4028), were the cheques for five of the flood mitigation projects, excluding the South Grafton levee, issued on 28 January 1997 but he did not grant his approval for the projects until 5 February; if so, (a) why and (b) is it common practice for him to grant approval for major projects after cheques have been issued. (2) Did he approve funding for the flood mitigation work on Prospect Creek and other flood work on 5 February 1997 and did it take 19 days to deliver the cheque to the office of Senator Coonan for the Prospect Creek project while the other four cheques were presented to the relevant offices of Members and Senators on 6 February. (3) Is he able to say why, if the cheque for Prospect Creek was delivered to Senator Coonan's office on 24 February by a member of staff of the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Regional Development, the assistant adviser to the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr S Galilee, was unable to tell a member of my staff on 25 February who had the cheque and who would be presenting it either to Fairfield City Councilor to the NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation. (4) Is he also able to say whether the cheque for flood mitigation at Prospect Creek was delivered to a staff member, or office, of former Senator Woods, without the former Senator's knowledge, before being delivered to Senator Coonan. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Ratification Cote d'lvoire Egypt Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Mexico (b) I have no information as to which countries intend to ratify the Convention. (2) The Convention shall enter into force 12 months after the date on which not less than 40 States, the combined tonnage of which amounts to at least 25 per cent of world tonnage, have become Contracting Parties to it. (3) (a & b) Australia has not ratified the Convention. No major maritime nation has ratified the Convention and Australia is not presently considering ratifying the Convention. (4) (a) Fourteen nations have signed the Convention, four nations have ratified the Convention and seven nations have acceded to the Convention. The Convention is not in force. The process followed was a standard procedure established by previous Governments. UN Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships (Question No. 1749)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Is he able to say which nations have (a) ratified the UN Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships and (b) indicated their intentions to ratify the Convention. (2) What conditions are necessary for the Convention to come into force. (3) Has Australia ratified the Convention: if not, (a) why not and (b) when will Australia ratify the Convention. (4) Is he able to provide details on the (a) current and (b) prospective status of the Convention and why some nations have not ratified it. (5) What consideration has been given to the Convention at the International Maritime Organisation since its formulation. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The nations that have ratified and acceded to the Convention are listed in the following table. Accession Bulgaria Georgia Ghana Haiti Hungary Iraq Oman (b) I have no information on the prospective status of the Convention or why some nations have not ratified the Convention. (5) This is a Convention developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and has not been considered by the International Maritime Organisation. Proposed Airport: Goulburn, NSW (Question No. 1751) Mrs Vale asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Would the development of a regional airport away from the Sydney Basin reduce the impact on population constraints around Sydney and open for expansion a regional area close to Sydney. (2) Is Gou' 1m more attractive to airport development, compared to the alternatives of Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy and would it be the least costly iT' initial land acquisition and transport developIL-nt between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. (3) Would an airport at Goulburn (a) be more attractive to the residents of Sydney and (b) have a greater overall benefit to the Australian people than development within an already overcrowded metropolitan region. (4) Would the construction impact of developing a complex near Goulburn (a) provide relief and development to regional Australia and (b) be reflected in reduced user charges thereby making Australian business more competitive. (5) What are the major problems associated with the placement of an international airport away from Sydney. (6) Is the building of an airport midway between Sydney and Canberra, linked to a very fast train system and providing an integrated freight and transport facility hub, worthy of initial investigation and in keeping with international trends for airport development away from major residential areas. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Possible sites for the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek and the Holsworthy Military Reserve are being examined in the EIS process. Major airports recently built or currently being built at major cities overseas are generally located no more than 50 kilometres from the central business district. There are major disadvantages with Goulburn and other remote locations. The distance from Sydney has major adverse implications for travel times, convenience, cost and connection with Sydney's existing airport. As a consequence, there would be a strong likelihood that passengers and airlines would be unwilling to use the second airport thereby further increasing the pressures on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The increased costs of providing suitable road and rail access and linkages to other support services (such as a fuel line) would also be significant. For these reasons the Government is not considering possible sites outside the Sydney Basin for the second major Sydney airport. (2) See answer to (1). The Commonwealth owns the Holsworthy Military Reserve and the existing Badgerys Creek airport site. Two of the airport design options under consideration at Badgerys Creek would require additional land to be acquired. (3), (4), (5) and (6) See answer to (I). United Energy Surge Plan (Question No. 1754) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Is he able to say whether United Energy decided to abolish its user pays power surge insurance scheme following advice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). (2) Was the ACCC of the opinion that the United Energy scheme was in breach of the Trade Practices Act. (3) Has the ACCC advised other power distribution companies in Victoria on the legality of power surge schemes. (4) Does he support the ACCC on this matter. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 22 April 1997, United Energy announced the introduction of its United Energy Surge Plan, which aims to provide residential consumers with 'no-cost' protection against damage caused by power surges. Two other Victorian electricity distribution companies offer 'no cost' surge cover for residential customers. The ACCC has informed me that United Energy's announcement followed discussions the Commission held with the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, several Victorian electricity distribution companies, the Victorian RegulatorGeneral and the Electricity Industry Ombudsman on the question of who bears liability for damage caused by poor quality of supply of electricity. Poor quality supply includes power surges and 'brownouts' . The ACCC initiated these discussions following its investigations into a number of Victorian electricity distribution companies' offers of insurance products to consumers. These products were expressed to cover damage caused by poor quality supply of electricity where it was not the fault of the electricity company itself. The ACCC was concerned that information provided to consumers should not lead to any misunderstandings by them as to the full extent of their statutory rights under the Trade Practices Act. (See below.) (2) The ACCC has informed me that at no time did it express a view that United Energy was in breach of the Trade Practices Act. Rather the Commission expressed the view that, while it does not object to the provision of insurance schemes or related products in themselves, it has concerns that the information provided by electricity companies about such products should not lead to misunderstandings by consumers, either by express or implied representation, as to the full extent of their statutory rights under Part V Division 2 of the Act. In the Commission's view, these rights include an entitlement by consumers to be compensated for damage caused by unmerchantable quality electricity irrespective of whether the supplier is negligent or not. As a consequence, the ACCC informed the electricity distribution companies that they might have to fully refund fees paid by consumers for protection plans which did no more than offer consumers what was already a statutory right. United Energy advised the ACCC that it would fully refund payments made by its customers for the previous PowerGuard Plan. (3) The ACCC has written to electricity companies and regulators across Australia concerning the promotion of insurance schemes and the implied rights of consumers under Part V Division 2 of the Trade Practices Act. Such insurance schemes must be conveyed as additional to, and not in place of, all other statutory rights. (4) The ACCC is an independent statutory authority with responsibility, among other things, for administering the Trade Practices Act. The Government supports the efforts of the Commission in seeking to ensure that market conduct across the economy is consistent with the provisions of the Act and that consumers are safeguarded in their dealings with producers and sellers. The Government is also mindful that protection of the rights of 4 consumers needs to be balanced against the costs this may impose on producers. World Exposition: Lisbon, Portugal (Question No. 1776) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 29 May 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 1367 (Hansard, 26 March 1997, page 3333), (a) when and (b) where were the four occasions in addition to Genoa that Australia was not represented at world expositions. (2) Was Australia not represented at Genoa in 1992 because it was represented at the world's largest exposition at Seville in 1992. (3) Further to his answer to part (4) of question 20 No. 1367, does Australia have representation at meetings of the Bureau of International Expositions in Paris; if so, (a) by whom, (b) what is the officer's position in the Public Service, (c) to where 23 is the officer posted and (d) will he request that officer to ascertain which countries have agreed to participate at Lisbon. (4) What would have been the cost of Australia's participation at Expo 98. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 1968, 1971, 1981, 1991, (b) San Antonio (USA), Budapest (Hungary), Plovdiv (Bulgaria) and Plovdiv (Bulgaria) respectively. (2) Yes. (3) Yes.

Essendon Airport: Increased Traffic (Question No. 1824) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for in Expo Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: (1) Was evidence of increased traffic presented to him prior to his decision to keep Essendon Airport open; if so (a) what evidence, (b) over what period was the evidence collected and (c) did his office seek to verify the evidence. (2) Has his office investigated claims made in questions Nos. 1362, 1666 and 1667 concerning the increased practice of ""touch and go"" procedures at the airport; if not, why not. (3) Will the control of Essendon Airport be transferred to the private sector; if so (a) how and the cost of Australia's (b) when. (4) Will all government subsidies and contingent liabilities to the airport cease once it is handed over to the private sector. (5) Does he have contingency plans should a private sector operator to take over Essendon Airport not be found. (6) Will existing Federal Airport Corporation functions at the airport continue to be performed under private sector operators. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) & (b) Data from Airservices Australia on movements at Essendon Airport have been provided on a regular basis. This data shows that for the year to date aircraft movements at Essendon Airport have increased. The total movements for the year 1995-96 was 61,030. Between 1 July 1996 to 30 April 1997 there have been 57,634 movements. (c) In January 1997, media speculation about a large increase in the number of movements at Essendon Airport caused the Department of Transport and Regional DeVelopment to seek a complete analysis of monthly movement data at the airport for the 1995 and 1996 calender years. The analysis revealed that while there was an increase in movements at Essendon Airport, these increases could not be considered as substantial as reported in the media. The monthly statistics for 1 January to 30 May 1997 show that movements are continuing to increase.  attributed to growth across all users of the airport. (2) Investigations into the claims made in previous questions concerning an increase in the numbers of ""touch and go"" movements revealed that separate statistics for ""touch and go"" movements are not kept by Airservices Australia. However, Airservices Australia estimates that there are on average about 10 ""touch and go"" movements per week including circuit operations and aircraft transiting Essendon from another airport. (3) Following the successful sale of long term leases for the operation of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth Airports, the Government announced that it is offering a further 15 Federal airports for simultaneous trade sale. Essendon Airport is one of the airports that will be offered for sale Expressions of interest in the 15 airports are expected to be sought around September/October 1997, following completion of Commonwealth due diligence and other sales preparatory work. Disposal of allIS airports is expected to be completed by 30 June 1998. (4) A full evaluation of these and other issues will be conducted as part of the Government Sales Team's due diligence process which will precede the formal tender process for Essendon Airport. In light of these findings, appropriate decisions in relation to the issues will be taken at that time. (5) The Government is committed to the sale of all Phase 2 airports. Decisions on the future ownership of Essendon Airport will be made in the context of a full evaluation of indicative and binding bids received from potential bidders. (6) A private owner of Essendon Airport will continue to operate the airport consistent with its obligations under the sale agreement, legislative requirements, and commercial decisions. Regulatory functions currently undertaken by the FAC will be transferred to relevant Commonwealth and State agencies. Allied Ex-Servicemen: Repatriation Benefits (Question No. 1830) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 18 June 1997: (1) Is an allied ex-serviceman who has lived in Australia for 50 years and who now is an Australian citizen entitled to repatriation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. (2) Is the ex-serviceman referred to in part (1) entitled to a service pension from the Australian Government. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 does not provide for Repatriation benefits in the form of disability pension and treatment for war-caused injury and disease in respect of allied ex-servicemen (or ex-servicewomen). However, under the legislation, a service pension may be paid to an allied veteran. (2) An allied ex-serviceman (or ex-servicewoman) who has been an Australian resident for at least 10 years may be entitled to a service pension, if the person: - has been a member of the defence force established by an allied country; and - served during a period of hostilities; and rendered in connection with a war or war-like operation, in which the Defence Forces of Australia were engaged, service in an area within or outside the country in which the person enlisted in those forces, being service in respect of which the person incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The residency requirement does not apply to a refugee who holds a permanent entry visa and is a permanent resident in Australia. An allied veteran may be entitled to the service pension on the grounds of age if the veteran is male and aged 60 years or older, or is female and aged 56 years or older. Younger allied veterans may be entitled to service pension on the grounds of invalidity if they are permanently incapacitated for work. It should be noted that citizenship, or a period of residence longer than 10 years, has no effect on the eligibility of an allied veteran for service pension. Both types of service pension (age and invalidity) are subject to the income and assets tests. However, these tests do not apply to ""blinded"" veterans. The eligibility criteria for service pension requires that, for a person to be entitled to this pension, he or she must not have served at any time in an enemy force. Australian National: Employee Rail (Question No. 1834) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: Do long serving employees of Australian National receive an annual free pass on passenger trains for travel across Australia; if so, by whom will the arrangement be honoured. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australian National has advised that employees with one or more years of service are entitled to passes for intersystem rail travel, one pass per calendar year per system. The passes cover the rail component of travel only (ie do not cover sleeping berths or meals). Retired employees with 30 years of service are entitled to a 50% concession on the rail component of intersystem travel. Other systems have similar arrangements and the systems pay each other for passes used by their employees, although Westrail is proposing to withdraw pass entitlements for their employees. After sale, it would be up to the new owners to decide whether to continue this arrangement.

(2) If so, (a) who made the decision to relocate the centre, (b) what were the reasons for the decision, (c) was any consultation undertaken with local customers; if so, what and (d) what are the expected benefits of the move. (3) What reaction does Australia Post anticipate from its regular Werribee customers. (4) Does Australia Post have long term plans for its presence in Werribee; if so, what. Mr W arwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question based upon advice from Australia Post: (1) I am advised by Australia Post that it plans to relocate the Werribee Delivery Centre to a new facility on the comer of Lentini Street and Graham Court, Hoppers Crossing. The new facility will accommodate the Werribee, Hoppers Crossing and Laverton Postal Delivery Groups. The relocation is expected to occur in January 1998. Passes (2) (a) Australia Post's Victorian Administration. (b) Space constraints at the existing facility make it impossible to effectively provide additional resources to cater for the growth occurring in the area. (c) The decision to relocate was taken on the basis of commercial and operational considerations. Post Office Box holders at the existing facility will be given a choice as to their preferred alternative location for the future receipt of their mail. (d) The new facility will allow the introduction of new technology and mail handling equipment, to improve the efficiency of mail delivery in the area. It will also provide a safer working environment for Australia Post staff. (3) Apart from Post Box holders, customers who currently receive mail through the Werribee Delivery Centre should notice no change, other than improved service overall, due to the greater efficiency of the new facility. (4) Australia Post is committed to maintaining its retail presence in Werribee which will centre on its Watton Street and Werribee Plaza Shopping Centre facilities.

(2) When was the pesticide first approved. (3) By whom was it approved. (4) What testing was carried out prior to its approval. (5) What is an acceptable level of use of the pesticide and is the level adhered to. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether (a) in The Netherlands and the USA there is a limit on the amount of Bifenthrin which is allowed in foodstuffs and (b) Bifenthrin is toxic in small amounts and when mixed with other chemicals is fatal at 1 part per trillion. Mr W arwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Bifenthrin was first approved in Australia on 23 November 1993. (3) The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals approved the registration of bifenthrin, after seeking the advice of Environment Australia in the usual way. (4) Pesticides must satisfy rigorous environmental safety requirements before they can be registered in Australia. Bifenthrin was tested to determine its stability in water, stability to light, persistence and mobility in soils, rate of degradation in the field, and potential to bioaccumulate in fish. Toxicity tests were conducted on birds, fish, water fleas, shrimp, shellfish, bees, beetles, mites, rodents, rabbits and dogs. (5) Users of pesticides must not exceed stipulated label rates and must observe all label precautions. These are legal requirements. (6) (a) The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy advises that such limits exist in the USA, where approvals exist for many uses, but that bifenthrin is not registered for use in The Netherlands and no corresponding Dutch limits have been established. (b) Bifenthrin is very highly toxic to aquatic life, but toxic effects are moderated by its tendency to associate tightly with sediment rather than remain in water. Bifenthrin may be lethal to sensitive organisms at dissolved concentrations as low as 100 parts per trillion. I am not aware of any reports that show such effects at the extremely low level of 1 part per trillion, even when bifenthrin is mixed with other chemicals. Bifenthrin is much less toxic to birds and mammals than to aquatic species. Toxic Waste Dump: Ramsar Convention (Question No. 1962) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: (1) Further to question No. 1820 concerning CSR's proposed toxic waste dump in Werribee, Vic., is it a fact that, in addition to the three proposed facilities referred to in the question, the Western Treatment Plant of Melbourne Water will also be discharging toxic chemicals and trade waste close to the coastline of the area protected by the Ramsar Convention and classified as an area of international significance. (2) Is the (a) boundary of the Ramsar area 600m and (b) area classified as of international significance 3.5km from the proposed CSR dump. (3) Will he raise the matter of threats to the Ramsar sites with the Premier of Victoria as a m;ttter of urgency. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) As I stated in my response to Question No. 1820, the Victorian Government has decided against relocating the Coode Island chemical storage facility to Point Lillias. Consequently there are now only two proposed facilities that are in the vicinity of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) Ramsar site (i.e. Point Wilson, and the proposed CSR dump). The Western Treatment Plant, managed by Melbourne Water, discharges waste under strict environmental licence conditions. The Victorian Environment Protection Authority has advised that discharge of toxic waste is not permitted under any circumstances and that wastewater plumes will be closely monitored for environmental impact, including any impact on the nearby Ramsar site. (2) Yes. It is proposed that the CSR dump will be located approximately 600 metres from, and outside the Ramsar site boundary, 3.5 kilometres from a site identified as a significant component of the East Asian-Australasian Shorebird Flyway. That site is contained within the Port Phillip Bay Ramsar site. (3) In general, the management of Ramsar sites is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments, and at this stage, I do not consider it appropriate to intervene. The CSR dump proposal is currently undergoing review through the Victorian Environmental Effects Statement (EES) process. The Commonwealth Environment Portfolio will review this document and advise me accordingly. If the EES process reveals any potential for the proposal to adversely impact on the ecological character of the Ramsar site, I will decide whether to seek further advice from the Victorian Government. 1997-98 Federal Budget: Software Corrections Funding (Question No. 1964) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: (1) What provisions were made in the 1997-98 Budget, and what are the projections for the 199899 Budget, for (a) each department, (b) Parliament and (c) courts of federal jurisdiction for the correcting software to prevent computer system failure in not recognising that the digits 00 in the date stand for the year 2000. (2) If no provisions were made, or are to be made, what is the expected cost of compliance in each case and how will the costs be met. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were no specific provisions made in the 1997-98 Budget, nor are there specific projections, at this stage, in the 1998-99 Budget for the cost of correcting software to prevent computer systems failure in not recognising that the digits 00 in the date represent the year 2000. (2) Costing of Year 2000 activities is complex and most overseas governments are having difficulty accurately costing this project on a whole of government basis. Many Commonwealth agencies have done preliminary estimates of the cost of compliance and there will be ongoing monitoring of agency costs together with their progress in achieving Year 2000 compliance. (3) The year 2000 date change is a foreseeable part of agency operations and there is ample scope for the costs of Year 2000 compliance to be absorbed within the flexibilities of current Budget funding. NA Charles Sturt University B App Science-Albury Macquarie University B Science Tertiary Entrance Ranking: Science and Engineering Courses (Question No. 1969) Mr Wilton asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: (1) What was the tertiary entrance ranking (TER) cut-off score for each Australian university for first year science and engineering courses in (a) 1996 and (b) 1997. (2) What proportion of first year students with first decile TER scores enrolled in science and engineering courses at each university in (a) 1996 and (b) 1997. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, cost of Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Tertiary entrance ranking (TER) cut-off scores for each Australian university for first year science and engineering courses in 1996 and 1997 are presented in the Attachment. Universities are autonomous institutions and as such the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not involve itself in the micro management of universities. The Department does not itself collect data on TER scores. The TER cut-off scores were derived from data provided by the various State Admissions Centres. This data is not always compiled in a complete fashion. Also, the information presented in the Attachment refers to selected science and engineering courses within each institution and is not a complete enumeration. State comparisons of changing TER cut-off scores cannot directly be undertaken because of different State TER scales. (2) Information on the 1997 distribution of TER scores by field of study and institution will be publicly available in December 1997. At that time it will be possible to compare the proportion of first year students with first decile TER scores enrolled in science and engineering courses at each university in 1996 and 1997.

(2) Will the insolvency of the company cause many consumers to lose considerable sums which had been prepaid for electrical appliances. (3) What steps is the Government taking to (a) protect the interests of the consumers referred to in part (2) and (b) educate consumers about: (i) their rights and obligations when purchasing goods and (ii) the risks involved in pre-paying for products.

I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission was notified on 25 June 1997 of the resolution to voluntarily wind up the company. (2) The appointed liquidator, Jirsch Sutherland & Co, estimates there may be around 310 consumers affected by the company's insolvency, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria. The task of winding up a company is generally a complicated and prolonged affair. The liquidator advises that it is too early at this stage to ascertain exactly how many consumers will be affected, and the extent of any losses incurred. I am also advised that a number of the major trade suppliers have contacted customers to make alternative arrangements for the supply of goods for which prepayments have been made. Under the winding up process, the assets of the company will be realised, the creditors paid, any surplus distributed among shareholders, and the company dissolved. If there are insufficient funds to payout all creditors, the liquidator will pay the creditors in order of priority as established by the Corporations Law. Unfortunately, many of the creditors involved will be ordinary unsecured creditors, and may therefore need to wait until preferred debts are paid. (3)(a) The Government is not in a position to intervene on behalf of consumers, as this is a matter for the liquidator at this stage. If contraventions of any laws are identified by the liquidator, these will be addressed in the liquidator's report to the Australian Securities Commission. I can reassure all consumers that the liquidation of a company is a strictly controlled process in which the interests of all creditors will be protected in accordance with the law. (3) (b) (i) The Government is committed to ensuring that consumers have the information they need to participate effectively in the marketplace. In line with the Government's pre-election commitment, the Government recently approved a three year program to address the consumer education needs of rural and remote Australians; those with limited English; and Australians on low incomes. (3) (b) (ii) The Government's role in consumer education, like that of the States and Territories, is broad in nature. I am unaware of education material which specifically addresses the issue of prepayments to a company that is subsequently wound up. However, in light of the winding up of this company, guidance on this matter will be included in the next quarterly newsletter on consumer issues, 'Consumerwise' . Information is made available to consumers about general rights and responsibilities under Commonwealth legislation, such as the Trade Practices Act 1974, and consumers are encouraged to make thoughtful and careful purchasing decisions. Bankruptcies: Victoria (Question No. 2005) Mr Jenkins asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: How many bankruptcies were recorded for persons residing in Victoria in (a) 1996 and (b) the period 1 January to 26 June 1997. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) During 1996, a total of 4,038 people residing in Victoria became bankrupt. (b) It is not possible to provide the information for the period sought, but for the period 1 January to 30 June 1997, 1962 people residing in Victoria had become bankrupt. Professional Career Advisers (Question No. 2010) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Does the Minister's Department employ professionally trained career advisers in WA to assist persons seeking information on career opportunities; if so, (a) how many; (b) where are they based; and (c) what is the average waiting time for an appointment. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) None (b) Not applicable (c) Not applicable DEETY A does not employ any professionally trained career advisers in Western Australia. The provision of specific career counselling is the responsibility of the State and Territory education systems. However, access ·to career information and advice is provided by DEETY A in WA through the Perth Career Reference Centre and through the annual distribution of the Job Guide and other career information products. Perth Airport: Runway Extension (Question No. 2021) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (l) Does Airservices Australia have plans, proposals or concepts for the extension of the 06/24 runway at Perth Airport; if so what. (2) Is he able to say whether the purchaser of the privati sed Perth Airport, Australian Development Group, has plans, proposals or concepts for the extension of the 06124 runway at Perth Airport; if so what. (3) Will he refuse to approve a development plan for Perth Airport submitted by Australian Development Group which includes the extension of the 06/24 runway. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) Airservices Australia is not responsible for future development of the Perth Airport, including the 06/24 runway. Following the leasing of the Perth Airport, Airstralia Development Group will be responsible for developing proposals conceming the airport, in line with its obligations under the lease agreements and the Airports Act 1996. (2) With the sale of the Perth Airport, the purchaser, Airstralia Development Group (ADG) , is now responsible for developing the airport, including any proposal to extend the 06/24 runway. Under Part 5 Division 3 of the Airports Act 1996, ADG is required to lodge a draft master plan, covering a 20 year period within 12 months of assuming control of the airport. The master plan is required to specify, amongst other things, the development objectives and the future needs of the airport, including additional runway capacity. The draft master plan must be subject to a 90 day public comment phase prior to being lodged with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for consideration. Under the new regulatory regime in place to ensure that the public interest is protected, major projects, such as an extension of the 06/24 runway, will require a major development plan to be submitted to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for approval. Again, major development plans must be subject to a 90 day public consultation process prior to lodging with the Minister. As the new owner of Perth airport only assumed responsibility for the airport on 2 July 1997 it is still to develop a draft master plan or any major development plans. I am not able to say whether the new airport owner has any proposal for an extension of the 06/24 runway. (3) A proposal by the airport owner to extend runway 06/24 would be dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the Airports Act 1996. Perth Airport and RAAF Base Pearce: (Question No. 2022) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) Are arrangements in place to ameliorate aircraft noise problems caused by the adjoining of airspace between Perth Airport and RAAF Base Pearce; if so, what. (2) Have steps been taken to reach agreement between Airservices Australia and the RAAF to seek a long term solution to the problems, if so, what; if not why not. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Airservices Australia advises that when the RAAF is not operating at Pearce, aircraft are tracked through the deactivated Pearce airspace to minimise aircraft noise exposure. When the RAAF is operating at Pearce, aircraft inbound to Perth Airport are tracked as far to the north of the Perth Air Traffic Control Zone as possible to limit low level overflight of suburbs in the vicinity of the airport. Airservices Australia advises that Pearce airspace is normally deactivated on weekdays between 5 pm and 8 am on weekends. (2) Yes. Airservices Australia advises that in May 1996 it in initiated a review of PerthlPearce airspace with the objective of developing an airspace structure and air traffic management plan to meet expected needs over the next ten years. The RAAF is participating in this review. In addition, the Air Co-ordinating Committee, which is the peak arbiter on airspace issues between Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence, has commissioned a computer model of the PerthlPearce area to enable more detailed analysis of air traffic management issues. Airservices Australia advises that the outcome of this study is expected to be available later this year. Treasury: Building Projects (Question No. 2030) Ms Ellis asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Has the Treasurer's Department overseen major building project design competitions since 1987; if so, when were the competitions held and what were the competition conditions. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department has not overseen major building project design competitions since 1987. Noise Attorney-General: Building Projects (Question No. 2043) Ms Ellis asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Has the Minister's Department overseen major building project design competitions since 1987; if so, when were the competitions held and what were the competition conditions. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Attorney-General' s Department has not overseen any major building project design competitions since 1987. Department of Veterans' Affairs: Building Projects (Question No. 2044) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Has the Minister's Department overseen major building project design competitions since 1987; if so, when were the competitions held and what were competition conditions. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian War Memorial within my portfolio oversaw a competition in February 1993 to select an appropriate design for the construction the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier in the precincts of the Hall of Memory at the Australian War Memorial. The National Capital Planning Authority recommended a competition and that design submissions be sought from six firms of architects considered by the NCPA to have sufficient relevant expertise. A design brief was prepared by the Memorial and sent to each of the selected competitors. Each competitor was offered $1,500 for the submission of a design which met the requirements of the brief. Five of the six selected firms submitted designs. Department of Environment, Sport and Territories: Staff (Question No. 2051) Ms Ellis asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (I) How many persons were employed on a (a) full-time, (b) part-time permanent and (c) casual basis in the Minister's Department at 30 June 1997. (2) What is the Minister's Department estimated recruitment intake for 1997 98. (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The following numbers of staff were employed by the Minister's Department on 30 June 1997: Full-time Permanent Staff: 2220 Part-time Permanent Staff: 67 Full-time Temporary Staff: 220 Part-time Temporary Staff: 15 Total: 2522 There were no casual staff employed on 30 June 1997. (2) The Department's general recruitment requirements are determined having regard to its operational needs and attrition rates. However, specific planning is undertaken each financial year in relation to Graduate Administrative Assistant (GAA) recruitment (in the Canberra elements of the Agency) and Technical Officer recruitment in the Bureau of Meteorology. During 1997-98, approximately eight (8) GAAs of will be recruited in the Canberra elements of the Department and a total of twelve (12) Technical Officers will be engaged in the Bureau of Meteorology (Engineering and Observer categories). (3) The Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test will provide the source from which GAAs are selected. This Entrance Test will not be used to recruit Technical Officers. Department of Transport and Regional Development: Staff (Question No. 2057) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How many persons were employed on a (a) full-time, (b) part-time and (c) casual basis in the Minister's Department at 30 June 1997. (2) What is the Minister's Department estimated recruitment intake for 1997-98. (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At 30 June the Department of Transport and Regional Development employed (a) 696 full-time staff of whom 14 were temporary (b) 25 part-time permanent staff (c) no casual staff. (2) 15. (3) 15. Attorney-General: Staff (Question No. 2062) Ms Ellis asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 26 June 1997 (1) How many persons were employed on a (a) full-time (b) part-time permanent and (c) casual basis in the Minister's Department at 30 June 1997. (2) What is the Minister's Department estimated recruitment intake for 1997-99 (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test. Mr Williams·-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that there were 1704 full-time staff, 111 part-time staff and 217 casual staff employed by the Attomey-General's Department as at 30 June 1997. I am advised that due to the current restructuring of the Attorney-General's Department the estimated recruitment intake for 1997-98 cannot be identified. However recruitment for vacant positions will be undertaken as required to meet the operational requirements of the Department. I am also advised that it is unlikely the Attorney General's Department will have any vacancies available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test. World heritage Area Ministerial Council: Mount MCCall Road (Question No. 2065) Mr Adams asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that in March 1997 the World Heritage Area Ministerial Council agreed to initiate a process to amend the management plan to allow the Mt MCCall road to remain open and that the road is due for closure in September 1997. (2) Will amendments be made to the World Heritage Area management plan; if so, (a) when and (b) if there is to be a delay, will the Minister ensure that the road will remain open until such time as the changes have been ratified to allow the road to remain open permanently. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) (a-b) The current management plan for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area provides for the Mt MCCall track to be closed from the haulage way to Mt MCCutcheon by 30 September 1997, and for progressive rehabilitation of that section of the track to have commenced. I understand that on 5 July 1997 the Tasmanian Government, consistent with its statutory responsibilities to develop management plans for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, gave public notice that it proposes to submit to his Excellency the Governor of Tasmania an amendment to the World Heritage Management Plan regarding the Mt MCCall road. I understand that the amendment to the management plan foreshadowed by the Tasmanian Government is intended to supersede the relevant existing provisions by 30 September 1997.",187
