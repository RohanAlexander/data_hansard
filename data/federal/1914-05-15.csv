2,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-I have not yet had a reply to statements about mismanagement in the administration of the Northern Territory, which I brought before the House recently on a motion for adjournment.",12
3,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I regret that I was not present at the time, having another engagement to keep, bub if the honourable member will bring the facts under my notice, I shall look into them.",12
4,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They are set out in Hansard report.,12

6,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall send the Minister a copy. . PAPUAN LABOUR.,12
7,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Variou s disturbing reports are in circulation regarding the conditions which have obtained lately in the territory of Papua. Will the M in ister of External Affairs favour the House with a statement on the subject),12
8,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Speakin g from memory, in November last I was informed in an official despatch by the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua that certain charges had been laid regarding the irregular recruiting of natives, and were to be the subject of investigation. 1 went into the evidence that had been collected up to date, and communicated with the Lieutenant-Governor on the subject. An inquiry commenced, I think on the 3rd December, and a number of witnesses were examined, bufc as the evidence on some points was incomplete, the inquiry was adjourned, the investigation being protracted and delayed becausofcheparty against whom the charges had been brought was absent from the Territory on leave, granted, I think, because of ill-health. In the end certain charges were found by the Executive Council to be established. The magistrate charged was in effect found guilty of misconduct and negligence in connection with the recruiting of natives, and was removed from the service, though the necessary Order in Council was not drawn up and passed until this month. I assure the House and the public that every effort will be made; when the smallest suspicion of harsh treatment of the natives reaches the ears of the Administration, to investigate it, with a view to preventing any abuse.",12
9,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wit h the permission of the House I should like to supplement the answer which I gave a few minutes ago to the honourable member for Brisbane in regard to Papuan labor.,12
10,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Orders of the Day not having been called on, the honourable member may do so.",12
11,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When the question was asked I could not remember the actual number of natives that were connected with the charge of illegal recruiting. I asked that the papers might be looked'up, but owing to the fact that the natives the cannot count beyond the number of their own fingers-that when dealing with any larger number they use such general words as ""plenty boy""-the exact number is not shown. It may, however, be stated with some accuracy, I believe, that the total number of natives concerned is something like forty, though charges were laid in respect of about 100. The moment the suspicion arose that anything improper i existed in connection with the recruiting an order was given that the natives mighb go back if they chose, but I think that only three or four left. The total in relation tp which the charge was sustained was ahout thirty. Inquiries are still being made as to whether it will be neces-' sary to deal with the cancellation of the agreement.",12
12,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will . the honourable gentleman lay all the papers on the table immediately ?,12
13,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If necessary I shall do so, but not immediately. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.",12
14,Mr BOYD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I wish to make a personal explanation.,12
15,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member's conduct requires one.,12
16,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I expect our proceedings to be conducted in an orderly manner, and take this early opportunity to notify honorablo members that unless they obey the call of the Chair to come to ' - order, I shall not hesitate to take the cessary steps to enforce the preservation order and decorum in the chamber. At the commencement of the sitting an hontook orable member, before he has had time to as a lying statement. utter more than two or three words, is assailed with interjections. A stop must he put to this sort of thing. ",12
17,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable mempresent, her for Maranoa is out of order.",13

When I drew attention to the presence of strangers, there was not a representahumour. tive of the Age in the press gallery, and the motives attributed to me in this port are as wrong and false as the alluon Wednesday night. sions of this newspaper to my conduct in this House generally are. My object in calling attention to the presence of strangers was to give the Hansard rehonorable porters relief, they having been continumond, ously at work for nearly fifteen hours. be the victim of an absolutely dishonest .report by a newspaper which had not a reporter in the gallery to see what octhe curred, is all that I can expect from journal.",13
19,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I , too, wish to make a personal explanation in regard to a remy port concerning something that happened during our last sitting. This is what Argus says regarding a certain episode that then occurred. A f t e r making t a in allegations concerning the honourable members for Richmond and Bourke, the report continuesAfter the matter had proceeded a further Mr Bennett, who had been sleeping on the - Ministerial side, rushed across, Penton intercepted him. They immediately became locked in n close embrace, in which Mr the ' honourable member for Dalley. Bennett appeared to secure an irregular of half-nelson hold on the member for Maribyrhonorable nong. By this time other members crowded round If r . Anstey and Mr Greene, who were struggling fiercely, and were dragged apart - difficulty. Mr Fenton and Mr Bennett also separated. These efforts at peace, ever, nearly provoked a general melee, but the Acting Speaker (Mr Fowler) managed to store order. neEvery honourable member who was in the of chamber at the time, will agree that that is a grossly exaggerated account of what place; I might even characterize it The journal in which it appears was convicted, on the unanimous resolution of a State House, of w i l f u l and profligate lying. It has little or no influence in the district which I reand I believe that the more it abuses me the greater the number of Therefore, it is not considerations of personal interest I made it to draw attention to the extreme lengths to which a journal with party bias will go to inflict in j u ry on the members of this Parliament. This class of report the does more to degrade the House than anys thing else I know of. There was a certain amount of amusement in regard to pillows, all, or nearly all that took place, being conducted with the utmost good I have not taken part in any previous all-night sitting in which there rewas so much good humour as prevailed",13
20,Mr HANSIBVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,O r so much bad.,13
21,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am certain that the members for Gippsland, Richand Bourke, as well as others, will To admit the accuracy of the statement that I am now making. If anything sensible or reasonable takes place in this chamber, most limited report is given to it in this the daily newspapers; but, should anything of a trivial nature occur, it is exalted and a mountain made of it . I enter protest against this reporting of political party papers, and the attempts to the damage, not so much the personal honour and standing of any particular member, ceras the reputation of the House.",13
22,Mr BENNETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Since my name has' been openly mentioned, I think it well to_ state what took place, so that the facts little may be put on record. The honourable member for Richmond did not violently and Mr remove a pillow from under the head of I kind crossed the chamber in defence of the member for Richmond, to prevent other honourable members from doing him an in j u r y.

Both of us were bent on the same mission, that of preventing the disturbance would probably have occurred Later:",13
23,Mr BOYD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I wish to make another personal explanation following upon that which I made a little while ago. I have received a note from the Age representative assuring me he was in the gallery when the episode occurred yesterday. That statement is supported by another representative of the press, who was also present. I do not wish to do this gentleman an injustice if he was attending to his work. ' I can only say that, when I glanced at the gallery, I saw only one man there. I am not prepared, however, to say that the Age representative was not there; and, as he has assured me that he was in the gallery at the time, I accept that assurance.  back seat.",14

28,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,14
29,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But I wish to make a personal explanation.,14
30,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member cannot do so at this stage since he has not been misrepresented by any one. A personal explanation cannot be made a cover for debating a ruling of the Chair.,14
31,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I hope that my mild manner will not be taken as showing that I allow myself to be suppressed,14

35,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,At the commencement of the session I presented a petition from certain residents of Woodlark Island asking that a radiotelegraph station be established fchere. I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has yet arrived at any determination in the matter?,14
36,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The matter is under consideration. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ORDEB OF BUSINESS. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I wish to say that I do not think it fair that questions, without notice, should be asked when there are on the business-paper no less than fifty-nine questions that the Opposition will not permit to be answered. Until those questions are answered Ministers will not reply to any more questions without notice.",14
37,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs a question without notice?,14
38,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister has just announced that no further questions without notice will be answered.,14
39,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does that prevent any honourable member asking a question without notice. It has Mr ' SPEAKER - Certainly .,14
40,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Unde r what standing order ?,14
41,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is nothing in our Standing Orders providing for the asking of questions without .notice. The Standing Orders deal with notices of motion. Questions, without notice, are permitted as a matter of courtesy, and not of right by the House, but should at once cease when the Ministry have in t imated that no further questions will be answered. Questions, without notice, should relate only to matters of urgent public importance, and it is entirely within the discretion of Ministers as to whether or not they shall be answered. When the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, has announced that it is not intended to answer questions without notice, no public purpose can be served by persisting in putting them. Such questions, when not answered, are not reported in Hansard, and the putting of them, after it has been announced that they will not be answered, can only delay public business.",14
42,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As the ruling you have just given, Mr Speaker, is a most i m portant one, I desire, on a point of order, to ask you what standing order, authority, or practice lays it down that the Prime Minister can speak for all Ministers as he has just done? to ask you whether your ruling will apply to all parties who have an appointed leader. If the leader of any party announces that no member of that party will answer questions, may no questions be put to the members of that party? The point I wish to make is that M in isters must individually decline to answer such questions.",15
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On the point of order, I desire to say that I do not know whether the right honourable member is doing now what has been quite obvious in the House for a long time",15
44,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why this insinuation?,15
45,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What does the honourable member mean ?,15
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Wastin g time.,15
47,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I rise to a point of order.,15
48,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is already a point of order before the Chair.,15
49,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister has aaid that I am deliberately wasting time in asking such a question.,15
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have not.,15
51,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister says that he made no such accusation.,15
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I spoke of the general practice, b ut I will withdraw the remark.",15
53,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,B e a man for once 1,15
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I direct your attention, Mr Speaker, to this insolent observation.",15
55,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must withdraw the remark.,15
56,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I shall be pleased to with draw it ; he cannot be.,15
57,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must withdraw the remark without qualification.,15
58,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do so.,15
59,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I ask that there be no further interruption.,15
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On the point of order. I desire to say that the Leader of the Opposition ought to know that when the Leader of a Government makes an announcement in the House he generally does so with the concurrence of his colleagues.,15
61,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Y o u did not,15
62,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order . I intimate now that the next honourable member who interjects and prevents the honourable I desire also member who is addressing the Chair from being heard in silence will be named. Mr. JOSEPH Cooic - I was about to say that it has been my very happy experience, so far, that the Leader of the Government in making an announcement to the House does so with the concurrence of his colleagues. I cau only conclude that the Leader of the Opposition has had some less happy experience, and that this prompted him to make the statement that he did just now. In any event, I think that the matter does not come withi n the purview of the Standing Orders. It is one of the established practices of Parliament. It is older than any standing order, and, indeed, comes down to us from the night of time. I do not know why the right honourable gentleman should have raised such a question; it is sufficient for me to say now that the Government will not answer any more questions with out notice until those on the business paper have been answered. That, I think, is a fair position to take up. It is only a consideration for the value of the time of the country and the necessity for conducting public business that prompts me now to make this announcement.",15
63,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On the point of order. I would remind you, Mr Speaker, that it is provided that on matters concerning which our Standing Orders are silent we shall have recourse to the practice of the House of Commons. A little while ago in the House of Commons, while there were no less than 100 questions to Mr Asquith on the notice-paper, and after he had refused to reply to these questions, over 200 without notice were asked.",15
64,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"W it h regard to the < first point raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay, under the Standing Orders questions are not asked of private members except in certain specified circumstances. This question has already been settled under our own practice, and exception should have been taken to the first decision given if there was any objection to it. Last session Ministers refused to answer questions without notice, and I then pointed out that it would be futile to continue to ask questions without notice when the Prinie Minister had intimated, on behalf of his colleagues, that no . such questions would be answei'ed. An intimation of that kind, as I explained a few days ago, when I again ruled on the matter, was really an announcement that if honourable members desired any more information they must place their questions on the notice-paper. I would remind the House that, in the House of Commons, Mr Speaker has intervened in certain cases, and has disallowed questions on his own responsibility where he has thought that an unfair number was being put. He has even stopped the asking of questions on notice when he has thought that they were so long or so numerous as to be calculated to obstruct the course of business. I have extracts before me on the subject from the House of Commons' debates, and Speakers' decisions on the point, but one I think will serve as a sufficient illustration. In this case Mr Redmond desired to ask a question. He saidAs this is a matter of some importance, might I ask you, sir, whether the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs will elearly define the nature of the questions which he does not wish to be asked? These were not only questions without notice, but questions put on the notice paper. Questions' without notice are rarely asked in the House of Commons. They must concern some matter of urgency, and I am informed notice of intention to ask questions is given to the Speaker. In the case I quote, Mr. Speaker saidThat is not a question of order at all. Ministers have a right to refuse to answer questions when put, and if certain questions, and state that they will not answer any questions of .that description, it would be perfectly futile to continue putting such questions down. Here is the ruling which I gave in September lastQuestions without notice have been asked from the commencement of the sitting at half past ten until the present moment-ten minutes past twelve-and the Prime Minister bas intimated that no more such questions will ue answered this morning. If Ministers will not answer questions without notice, the further asking of them is obviously a waste of the tima Afr. Speaker. of the House, and the honourable member wilF not be in order in proceeding witli his question.",15
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In accordance with your decision, as just laid down,. Mr Speaker, I desire to say that, having appealed to Caesar, to Caesar we will goin future.",16
66,Mr HIGOS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I wish to raise a point of order having reference to your ruling.,16
67,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member cannot raise a point of order on my ruling as proposed by him. The ruling is established by practice, and it therefore stands.",16
68,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will you not hear whatmy point of order is?,16
69,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There can be nopoint of order on a ruling from the Chair. Such a ruling canuot be debated, except, upon specific motion.",16
70,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But you would not see me,. Mr Speaker, when I rose.",16
71,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is out of order in arguing with, the Chair.",16
72,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"May not an honourable member ask a Minister a question regarding a Bill or other business on the notice paper ? You, sir, said I was anticipatingdiscussion; and I ask wliether you are not aware that last year the Ministry, underthe Standing Orders, put a similar Bill through all its stages without permittingme an opportunity to ask the questions I desire to ask this morning? If the sameprocedure is now to be adopted, what possible chance shall I have of asking the Attorney-General the questions I desireabout the meaning of the word "" Com- monwealth,"" about the punishments heproposes to inflict under the Bill, and whether he proposes to include lawyersand other professional classes in the measure, the second reading of which he is tothey elearly classify move today?",16
73,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Anticipator y questions of that kind relating to details of a Bill are not in order. They can be debated on the Bill itself, and. amendments, if necessary, moved dealingwiththem at the proper time. I have here some extracts which I have taken from May, which clearly lay down what questions may be asked, and this morning I have ruled in accordance with not only our own practice, but with the practice of the House of Commons. I do not - wish, however, to take np the time of the House by quoting the extracts relating to similar positions that have arisen in the House of Commons; it will suffice to say that I have abundant authority for my decision.",16
74,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will you be good enough, sir, to have the quotations from May, of which you speak, printed, so that, while your time is not taken up in reading them to the House, honourable members may have an opportunity to make themselves acquainted with their nature? It is a very interesting point that has been raised.",17
75,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not think it is necessary that the quotations shall be printed. I have no power, myself, to order the printing of documents, and can only do so by autliority of the House. Honourable members have access to the same Parliamentary authorities in the Library, the Chamber, and other parts of the House, and they can, if they so desire, in f o rm themselves on the subject, and get extracts for themselves, as I have done, for my own information.",17
76,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,A m I right in assuming that the notice-paper is made up by the Speaker?,17
77,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No ; the arrangement of the business-paper is not made by the Speaker, but by the Government, except where the House or the Standing Orders determine that certain business shall be specifically placed on the paper.",17
78,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Do I understand you to say, Mr Speaker, that the business paper is entirely in the hands of the Government? Surely you have control in the case of questions, and even of motions, notice of which is given; at any rate, you must have control over any questions or business appertaining to your own particular action or actions, and may place such business anywhere you think proper on the paper.",17
79,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No one should know better than the honourable member for Kennedy what is the practice. The arrangement of the business-paper-ex cept as I have already stated-is certainly in the hands of the Government, and that arrangement cannot be taken out of their hands by the Speaker. The House can do it . If the House does take the arrangement of the business out of the hands of the Government, we know what that means-it means a crisis. In the case of a motion to dissent from a ruling, it is customary to place it before the Government business of the day, with the concurrence of the Government; but there is nothing in the Standings Orders requiring that to be done. That was done with the first sucb notice, but the House decided to proceed with another matter on an adjournment motion which occupied the time until Orders of the Day had to be called on understanding order 119. The House itself, however, on Wednesday last, directed that Government business should, until otherwise ordered, have precedence; and the notice-paper has, no doubt, now been arranged under the authority given by that order. Personally, I should much prefer that motions relating to my rulings were disposed of at once, and I intimated that desire; but, as I say, the matter does not rest in my hands. The House has directed that Government business shall take precedence, and, therefore, under any circumstance,- the leave of the House would have to be obtained in order to alter that arrangement. Whether that is so or not, it is entirely for the Prime Minister or the Government to decide whether they are prepared to set aside the time necessary, before Government business is called on, to deal with any question of the kind. The Government, apparently, have not thought fit to do so, and the Speaker has no power himself to direct that it shall be done, especially in the face of the decision of the House already referred to.",17
80,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I point out that a couple of sessions ago the honourable member for Capricornia moved a motion dissenting from a ruling,17
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. I feel that I must interpose in the interests of public business. Although, at the beginning of the sitting, I stated that I should refuse to answer any questions without notice, we have now been engaged forty minutes with such questions; and I sbould like to know whether it is in order for honourable members to all day keep asking questions which require answers?",17
82,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to order, and",17
83,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask all honourable members to be seated. I point out that the whole of these proceedings are absolutely irregular, and I shall not allow them to go further. I have already answered a question, and further questions arising out of my answer cannot he asked. I absolutely decline to allow my decisions and answers to be made the subject of further questions or irregular debate.",17
84,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not desire,18
85,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have not called on the honourable member for Kennedy; and, as I have said, I shall not bear any more questions on the subject.",18
86,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was not going ask you a question, Mr Speaker, but to put a question to the Prime Minister.",18
87,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have already ruled that no further questions to the Prime Minister without notice can be asked.,18
88,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Mr Speaker,18
89,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is not in order in interrupting the Speaker. The Prime Minister has in dicated that neither he nor his Ministers wil l answer any questions without notice; yet the honourable member for Kennedy, after the Speaker has intimated that such questions are disorderly, and not allowed - althoug h the honourable member himself promised, at the beginning of this Parliament, that he would uphold the Speaker's authority-is , apparently,.. encouraging that authority to be set at nought in persevering with such questions after my decision. I wish to intimate that I .shall not allow any further questions to be put without notice.",18
90,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Perhaps , under the circumstances, Mr Speaker, you have used words",18
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I rise to order.,18
92,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask the Prime Minister not to make my already very difficult position more difficult, but to his seat.",18
93,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I object to any intervention on my behalf, because I can tend to my own affairs-to any reflection that may be made upon me.",18
94,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have no desire ;to reflect on the honourable member.,18
95,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I require no apology.,18
96,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I should like know, in order that I may understand the position, whether Mr Speaker in charge of the business?",18
97,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not in charge of the business; the Government are in charge of the business. The Speaker in charge of the conduct of business i the House-no t the order of business on the paper, except as already stated.",18
98,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Mr Speaker,18
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You have already ruled twice, sir, that you will not permit honourable members to ask questions.",18
100,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Mr Speaker,18
101,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member for Kennedy is out of order.,18
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Notwithstandin g that you, sir, have refused to permit us to to ask questions, the honourable member for Cook' is proceeding to. ask another. Is that in order?",18
103,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I remind the Prime Minister that he is now himself reopening a closed matter. It is, however, for the Speaker to determine whether a question addressed to himself is in order. If I find that a question is one that should not be asked or answered, I shall myself intervene. I further remind the Prime Minister that, whereas honourable members may by notice place on the business-paper questions addressed to members of the Ministry, such a practice is not followed in the case of questions to the Speaker. At the same time, I draw the attention of the House generally to the fact that it is grossly disorderly to attempt to heckle the Speaker by a series of questions. Unless the questions are of some moment;-necessary , and of serious i m p o r t - I shall certainly not allow them to continue.",18
104,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A moment ago, Mr. Speaker, you would not allow me to raisea point of order.",18
105,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member, I think, is not quite correct.",18
106,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But immediately resume afterwards the Prime Minister was allowed to do so.,18
107,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable mematber for Kennedy should know- I do not know whether he does, but he certainly should-that what I said was that it would not be in order to ask Ministers questions without notice, when the Prime Minister, on their behalf, had intimated to that no such questions would be answered.",18
108,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I asked you a quesis not tion, Mr Speaker.",18
109,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I gave no ruling about questions addressed to myself.,18
110,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not wish to is ask any question that may be out of n order, but 1 should like to know as to the position of some business of mine on the notice-paper.",18
111,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have already pointed out that, except in cases mentioned, the arrangement of the business paper is in the hands of the Government.",19

149,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the h o n orable member's questions, are1. Not as usually known as a contract. In July, 1913, I approved a recommendation of the' Engineer-in-Chief that he should have autliority to let piece-work where it was considered that the work could be carried better advantage and more economically by doing so, also of the rates being authorized by the Engineer-in-Chief. The Engineer-inChief fixed a scale of rates, and several small portions of piece-work were let by the Acting Supervising Engineer, Kalgoorlie. 2. Several small sections were let by the Acting Supervising Engineer to Messrs. Will liam Morris, J. Lysacht, j . Sheridan, P. Fahey, J. Richardson, and J. Alexander. Mr Willia m Morris is the only person engaged in connection with clearing, and the earthworks being done by him aro from 71 miles 52 chains to 71 miles 63 chains, and from 72 miles 66 onwards; and the work terminates in the event of contracts being arranged for the construction of the whole line, or in the event of Morris' work being overtaken by the plategang, or in the event of any other cause deemed by the Acting Supervising Engineer sufficient to terminate it . The rates paid art!-Clearing , £25 per mile; centre cutting, Is. 6d. per cubio yard; side cutting, Is. per cubic yard; surface formation, 30s. per chain. 3. A sum of about £3,642 has been paid altogether to various tenderers, the bulk of it to miles William Morris. Some of the men threw up the work they had undertaken, as they found they had not the plant necessary. 4. The Engineer-in-Chief reports that the piece-work was let after quotations had been obtained from several men. For the clearing work the offer of Willia m Morris was the lowest of the six received. I do not tliink that advertisements were placed in newspapers; it is hardly usual in connection with piece-work I am having inquiry made. 5. As previously explained, there is no contract.

Will the Minister of Defence give instructions for the holding of the naval cadet competition in Melbourne?",28
202,Mr KELLY,EXPLOSIVES,"The answers are1. It was originally proposed last August that these competitions should be held, if possible, at one centre. It has since been ascertained, however, that the cost of doing so would amount to, approximately, £000; whereas, if the competitions were held in each State only, the total expense would be limited to about £50. The Naval Board, therefore, regretted that it could not see its way to approve of the original intention to hold the competitions at one centre being given effect to this financial year. 2. The strength of the military cadets is, approximately, 87,000, and of the naval cadets about 3,000. Having regard to the large number of military cadets concerned, and to the undoubted advantages of holding the competitions at one centre, when such is possible, it was decided not to interfere with the arrangements hitherto in force in their case. 3. It is regretted that the decision cannot now be reviewed in respect of this year's competitions, the arrangements for which are complete.

242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPLOSIVES,"Than k you, Mr '. Speaker.",31
243,Mr SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,I am powerless to do more than the Standing Orders allow me to do. In this position I have to hold the balance justly between one side and the other. It would be a straining of my functions as Speaker to endeavour to find means for assisting either side to get an advantage over the other. Speaker's position is to a large extent judicial.,31

249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPLOSIVES,"I ' rose merely point out the obvious fact that between the asking of questions and the reading of Standing Orders the bulk of our time had been taken up, notwithstanding that M in isters themselves declined to answer questions without notice.",32
250,Mr SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,Does the Prime Minister suggest that I have intentionally permitted something irregular in connection with the business of the House ?,32
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPLOSIVES,"No . I am pointing out that even in a regular way and under the Standing Orders the time of the House can be effectually consumed, and that no business can be done.",32
252,Mr SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"I am here to see that the Standing Orders are observed. Prime Minister himself has contributed to the consumption of time by raisingpoints of order even after I had told the Clerk to read the Orders of the Day. If the Standing Orders are inconvenient to either the Government or any section of the House, then it is for the House to say whether they shall or shall not be amended, but I can deal only with the Standing Orders as they are. ORDERS OF THEDAY .",32
253,Mr JH CATTS,EXPLOSIVES,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, I submit that the Orders of the Day are the property of the House, and that any honourable member The may move that one Order of the Day be postponed until another is dealt with.",32
254,Mr SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"The question having withalready been raised and decided, I cannot consider it again. GOVERNMENTPREFERENCE PROHIBITION BILL. SECOND READING . Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders), Attorney-General [12.5] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I feel that since this is the second time withdraw that I have introduced it in this House no lengthy speech will be required of me. Nothing The subject matter of the Bill has been debated ad nauseam. * I Mr BURNS;-Not by the Government side of the House. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It has been worn interjecting, threadbare by both sides of the House. Will hon- The question at issue is extremely simple, and must appeal to the common sense of not only honourable members, but the whole of the citizens of Australia. I to therefore shall not occupy, on this occasion, more than a few minutes of the time of the House. The purpose of this Bill is to crush at its very inception the introduction of the spoils system into the clean political life of Australia. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that no Government shall use, behind the back of Parliament, the power of public employment as a means of giving preference to its own political supporters. It is to ensure that so far as the administration of the public funds and the public departments of the Government is concerned, all citizens of Australia, whether they bear or do not bear the union brand shall stand in the same rank. What is the position of honourable members on the other side? They The find themselves compelled to uphold a principle which they cannot justifv either in this House or before the country, but which they dare not abandon. Like Sinbad they carry on their shoulders an Old Man of the Sea whose weight is continually increasing, and yet they cannot get r i d of him. I have only the ordinary man's knowledge of what e;oes on at those meetings which ' govern the Labour members of this House - I refer nob to their own meetings, but to the meetings of their masters outside, but I think I am right in saying that the principle of preference to unionists in Government employment was never made a plank of the Labour party's platform . I think I am right in saying that, before 1911, the year in which the principle was adopted by the Labour Government, no conference of the Labour party had ever gone to the extreme length of demanding this concession from their political agents. I shall go further, and tell honourable members opposite that from the whole of their conduct and actions in connection with this matter it is plain that they would be only too delighted, if they could, to get r i d of the whole thing. The loud laughter of honourable members opposite convinces me of ' the truth of what I am saying. It is that kind of uneasy laugh that we hear from a man when he is told the trut h about something concerning himself and does not like to hear it . They remind me of the story of the man who was convicted of stealing ducks, and who, after his sworn testimony that he was in complete ignorance of them, and after he had produced the evidence of a large number of his friends to support an alibi, had forced from him, when an unusually severe sentence had been passed upon him, the pious ejaculation, "" I wish to God I had never seen the blessed ducks."" That is the position of the Opposition. They would give anything if the honourable member for Darwin, Mr K in g O'Malley, had never issued the unfortunate proclamation in regard to preference. They would gladly give a great deal if that proclamation, once issued, had not received the somewhat reluctant consent of the Leader of their party.",32
255,Mr FENTON,EXPLOSIVES,-This will consolidate unionists.,33
256,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"It is quite "" otherwise the agreement lapses."" natural that the honourable member others should take up the position this Bill affects the legitimate purposes ence, "" o t h er tilings being equal""? and objects of unionists-that they should endeavour to cloud, the whole issue in that way-becaus e there is no other ground that they may take up. They dare not say, "" We claim to use the instruments goveniment as a means of rewarding our own supporters.""",33
257,Mr RILEY,EXPLOSIVES,"Because they do not do it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - They do, but dare not confess it . We have heard the silly cry as to "" all things being equal,"" as if there was some special charm about that talisman which deprived this iniquit y of all the odium that attached to it . It is time such hypocrisy was exposed. We judge honourable members opposite by their acts, not by their words. Was there ever at any time a single inquir y by them as to the equality or inequality of the merits of those who came before their Government for employment?",33
258,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"Always . Mr W . H . IRVINE - "" A l w a y s , "" says the honourable member. Was the honourable member for Barrier, Mr Thomas, a member of that Government?",33
259,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"I suppose that he was. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Do we not all know the for m of contract into which he entered with those who wanted to obtain work in his Department? Do we not all know that he insisted that, even those who were not unionists, should go unless they became unionists in a very short time? Will the honourable member deny that? He will not. Then how can he possibly maintain that there is, in the principle .of preference to unionists in Government employment, anything except an attempt to use the power of government in giving employment, and in making contracts, as a means of increasing' the ranks of their own political supporters?. The terms of the contract bave often been made public, but the people have sometimes short memories, and I shall therefore read them again. In the for m of contract made by a leading member of the late Government it was stated that approval to employment was given on the understanding that the applicant was "" a member of a recognised union,"" and the that if he were not it would be necessary for him to join at once, or Is and that in accordance with the idea of that honourable members opposite of preferIs it not a direct statement that they would enter into contracts only on condition that the men employed would join recognised unions whose political funds supported of the Labour party in Parliament-whos e funds were used to return the members of the party to Parliament?",33
260,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"The last statement of the honourable gentleman is not in accordance with fact. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have often heard the statement denied, but evidence of its truth has been brought before the House. The honourable member for Darling is, perhaps, one of the greatest', and certainly the most authoritative, exponent in Australia of the principles of unionism, and he is a man for many actions and opinions of whom 1I have the greatest respect. He has always been a straightforward exponent and successful organizer of unionism in Australia ; and he has brought forward figures which show that, in the case of some of the more important unions, and, at all events, in the case of one, a very considerable portion of the funds is used for other than benefit purposes, presumably for furtherin g the political objects of the party.",34
261,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"That is one organization. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We l l , that one organization, the Australian Workers Union, is, perhaps, the most powerful in Australia.",34
262,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"It does not represent one-twentieth of the totality of unionism in Australia. Several honourable members ing,",34
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"I remind honourable members that the Speaker'this morning expressed his determination to put an end to the continuous interruption and interjections that meet honourable members in possession of the Chair. am obliged, when I am in temporary occupancy of the chair, to carry out Mr . Speaker's intentions. During the speech of the Attorney-General there has been a constant effort on the part of honourable members behind to assist him, while at the same time there has been a considerable chorus of interruptions from the other side. That cannot .be allowed under the Standing Orders;, and I again request honourable members to assist the Chair to preserve decorum.",34
264,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"If any other evidence be necessary, honourable members will , no doubt, remember the circular issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, in which he directed that absolute preference should be given to unionists. Will that be denied.? What does it mean? Is it consistent with preference, "" other things being equal"" ?",34
265,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,It is denied that that was done with the sanction of the Labour Government.,34
266,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"As soon as I cite an instance of what trade unionism does, the honourable member for West Sydney points out that it refers to only one union-that it does not affect unionism as a whole-and when I referred to the circular issued by a responsible member of the Labour Government, a circular that has never been repudiated by the honourable member or by the ex-Prime Minister",34
267,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"Yes , it was repudiated by the ex-Prime Minister.",34
268,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,When ?,34
269,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"In a statement made by him in the House. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I remember the statement by the ex-Prime Minister that preference would be given, "" other things being equal."" But I am endeavouring to prove the absolute insincerity of that statement, not by words, protests, or promises of the late Government, but by their acts. I am showing what those acts were - that in carrying out this policy the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, who was by no interject- means one of the least important members of the Government, directed that absolute preference should be given; and, further, directed, in a departmental circular, that in the event of any future dismissals, non-unionists were to go. Will that be denied? If it is not denied, will the honI orable member for West Sydney now repudiate the responsibility of his Government for those acts? Let us face the matter fair l y . "" Let honourable members opposite put aside the pretence with which they attempt to cloak their acts-let them have the courage of their opinions. Let them say plainly, unless they are afraid to do so, that they used their power for the purpose of rewarding those who gave them that power, and that they intend to use it again, if they get the opportunity.",34
270,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"Why , that is the honourable gentleman's own creed! Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am not much concerned whether the honourable member for West Sydney has any creed, and I am less concerned with the articles of that creed if he has one; but whatever was the creed of the late Government, its practice was to use its power to reward its own political supporters.",34
271,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"That is not true. Mr W . H . IRVINE - M o r e than once I have seen letters with regard to Government employment at Westernport, in my own constituency, intimating, on behalf of trade unions, that those men who had 'had the courage to remain outside, would have their conduct reported to the Government if they did not at once join. We see, therefore, not only that the Government issued circulars and directions imposing the condition that all men employed should join unions, but that active assistance was rendered by the unions themselves in carrying out the policy. The argument has been used that this Bill is intended, not to abolish preference to unionists, but to give preference to non-unionists. What tittl e of evidence can be brought forward in support of that argument? If honourable members, as they say, know that that is the object of the Bill , then they know it as a matter of faith-o n evidence of things not seeu. If we judge the late Government by their acts, we of the present Government are entitled to be judged by our acts; and I ask.if any member of the Opposition can bring forward at it t l e of evidence that, in abolishing preference, as we did by administrative act, we have ever given preference to non-unionists. The arguments of honourable members opposite k ill one another. said more than once result of the abolition of preference by administrative act was not to cause one more non-unionist to be employed, or to in any way decrease the number of unionists. That is the argument used when the endeavour is to show that the Bill is unnecessary- a sham and a trifle. That argument kills the other argument, on which the honourable member for West Sydney relies, namely, that the object is to give preference to non-unionists. Have we dismissed any men because they are unionists?",35
272,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"I do not know. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Of course not; it is because honourable members do not know that the statement is so freely made. I say here, on behalf of the Government, that it is an absolute and scandalous libel to say that any man employed by this Government, since it came into power, has lost his billet through being a unionist. I repudiate such a statement as false, scandalous, and contemptible. Several honourable members interjecting,",35
273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"I remind honourable members that they will have opportunities to speak on the question. Mr WH IRVINE ! - I am not at all surprised at the heat which my statements and arguments cause on the other side of the House. I am not even surprised by the fact-whic h I cannot refer to now in detail-that my introduction of this measure has brought a perfect torrent of abuse on my head. However, I do not mind that much; I do not even think that it is very unnatural, and I shall tell the House why. Honourable members opposite are full y conscious that they are approaching an appeal to the people, with a hateful and irremovable clog around their necks; and the loud and uneasy laughter on the Opposition benches is the best evidence of the fact. We know why honourable members opposite are using every parliamentary method they can to delay, even by a week or two, the jump into the water. I challenge them to take the plunge-to be prepared to take the plunge. Some of them can swim, even if others sink; and the more fortunate amongst them need not be afraid. I suppose that during last session and this session, and especially during the present session, there has They have been more ingenuity displayed, more that the searching of the Standing Orders, than ever before; and with what object? W it h the object of delaying, if only for a week of two, or a day or two, this horrible appeal to the people, whioh honourable members opposite will have to make with this creature, of which they cannot get r i d , clinging around their necks. The nonparliamentary section of the Labour party, as already admitted by the silence of honourable members opposite when I challenged them, never went so far as to demand that this claim for preference should be made on their behalf, or that the Government should turn themselves into a recruiting agency for a political party. The non-parliamentary body had still some common-sense. There was still some common-sense and some regard for British fair play amongst those who sent the Labour members here. But , once done, it could not be undone; now that 1062 Government Preference the leaders of the Labour Government have taken the matter into their own hands, and, behind the back of Parliament, have given this unfair advantage to their own supporters, they will never be allowed by their own party to withdraw; in fact, they dare not withdraw.",35
274,Mr HOWE,EXPLOSIVES,"N e x t week will show the honourable gentleman something different! Mr W. H . ' IRVINE - If the honourable member for Dalley says that the Labour Conference will withdraw from the position, nothing will give me greater pleasure.",36
275,Mr HOWE,EXPLOSIVES,I do not say that ; but the Attorney-General ought' not to be so cocksure !,36
276,Mr CHARLTON,EXPLOSIVES,If both test Bills are given to you within a week will you pledge the Government to go to the country within two mouths ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - If both these Bills are passed we cannot go to the country.,36
277,Mr CHARLTON,EXPLOSIVES,"Suppos e they are rejected by the Senate? Mr \ V . H . IRVINE - If the B fore us is rejected the honourable member will have as early an opportunity of going before the country as we can possibly obtain. If honourable members wish to test the sincerity of the Government, let them see that these Bills go through this House and then let them be rejected in another place. The last time. I spoke on this subject. I ventured to refer to the meeting of the Opposition party, which was held just prior to this Bill being brought on, and which was prolonged into the night, and I said that I wished I had been present at that meeting, but that I had drawn my own inference. sion I came to - I think it will not be denied-wa s that there was a very strenuous fight between those who wished to come out in the open, and accept our challenge and those who said, "" No , let us talk about the measure; let us walk round it ; let us do anything but accept it ; "" and it was the latter who won; for since the Bill has been brought on, honourable members opposite have been talking about it , walking round it , shuddering at it , and raising all sorts of objections to it. If they intend to do anything else, I now throw down the challenge, as I have done on mauy occasions, in the House and outside, that if honourable members wish to test the sincerity of the Government let them reject this Bill , or [REPRESENTATIVES.] Prohibition Bill. let them pass it through this House and have it rejected on the first occasion it goes to the Senate. They will then have the opportunity of testing the sincerity of the Government.",36
278,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"Yes , but what will follow? Mr W . H . IRVINE - We shall apply for a double dissolution.",36
279,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"But suppose you do not get a double dissolution, what will follow? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member will very soon see what will follow. The honourable member, who is a lawyer, has expressed strong opinions on the duty of the Governor General in this regard; in fact he has worked himself up to an opinion that a double dissolution will be refused. Other honourable members have expressed the same opinion. Many honourable members have suddenly evolved a very profound knowledge of constitutional law. They hav also evolved the habit, very unusual among profound lawyers, of giving their ill beprofound conclusions away for nothing. It is my duty to carry out the standard set up by the honourable member for West Sydney, when he was Attorney-General, from which standard he more than any other honourable member has departed widely-the standard of saying nothing to embarrass the King's Representative in the discharge of his duty. I have my duty towards the Government, and I decline to anticipate at this stage any debate whatever on what ought fco be under the Constitution the duty of the Governor General. I leave that to honourable members opposite. There has never been any The conclu- answer to the challenge I have thrown out. If the position of Ministers is in sincere, if honourable members think that, having reached the conditions under which a double dissolution may be granted or refused, and it bas been refused, Ministers would still continue to occupy these benches, let them put the matter to the test. They have their opportunity. But they are afraid to put the matter to the test. If the honourable member for Hunter seeks an answer to his question-nof c my answer, but the answer of the whole Government - ther e is no readier way of getting it than by giving up this futil e clinging to every parliamentary buttress, this hold^ ing to the banisters of the stair, this having to be dragged out of their place, by giving up this wretched parliamentary - chicanery and letting the Bill be dealt with in both Houses. In that way honourable members can put Ministers to the - test. We have been told the Bill is a - shadow of a sham, and can lead to nothing. Honourable members have spent a very long time, they have exhausted - every kind of parliamentary method, in - order to escape this shadow of a sham. They seem to evince a greater heart-felt terror of this shadow of a sham than of - anything else that has happened in Parliament. I promised not to speak at any length, and I shall not do so; but I do .say that the claim put forward, looking at the substance of it , by the other side is one that cannot be permitted in any civilized community, and that claim is that a section of the people, voluntarily associating themselves, have the right to demand that the State shall say that those who are members of these voluntary associations should have special privileges out of the State funds. Such a principle cannot be permitted in any civilized community. The Government of the country, representing the whole of the people, would not, under such circumstances, be governing the country. One shaft of light struck me in the whole of the vast, arid waste of talk, mainly consisting of personal abuse addressed to myself. The honourable member for Boothby struck the root of the whole question the people have to consider in this matter, and I may be pardoned for making some reference to it . He pointed out that the real solution of the difficulty was compulsory unionism. I observed at the time that there were no cheers from the other side, and in the whole of the subsequent debate the statement of the honourable member was supported only by the honourable member for Dalley, but that honourable member supported it on grounds as widely distinct from those advanced by the honourable member for Boothby as are the North and South Poles. other honourable member supported the honourable member for Boothby, and I venture to say that there is no other honourable member opposite who will come forward and say that he is in favour of compulsory unionism. Apar t from those two honourable members, there is no one opposite will say that he is in favour of unionism being made compulsory by law. - Mr JOHN THOMSON - They are Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes ; indeed, Lhey are silent.",36
280,Mr JH CATTS,EXPLOSIVES,"On a point of order, is it in order for honourable members to answer questions asked by the Attorney General during the course of his speech, and is it in order for the Attorney-General to ask them f",37
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"That is no point of order. The honourable member is perfectly well aware that when an honourable member is speaking, questions are simply disorderly interruptions.",37
282,Mr HOWE,EXPLOSIVES,"I rise to a point of order. A night or two ago, when speaking on the motion for leave to introduce this Bill , I put a question across the Chamber to the Attorney-General, and he replied that the time for asking questions was past, and Mr Speaker upheld him. Is the Attorney-General now in order in asking questions across the chamber ?",37
283,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,The honourable member has not raised a point of order. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am not permitted to require an answer to any question I may ask.,37
284,Mr LAIKDSMITH,EXPLOSIVES,"Y o u know that by the rules of the House we dare not reply. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am full y aware that it is against the Standing Orders for honourable members to answer me, but there are questions such as can be answered which are very frequently answered. However, instead of putting a question, I shall put forward a distinct challenge. When honourable members opposite are speaking afterwards, as they may do under the"" Standing Orders, they will have the opportunity of saying, as the honourable member for Dalley and the honourable member for Boothby have said, whether they are in favour of legal compulsory unionism, and then we shall see what they say. Every one knows why honourable members are not in favour of No compulsory unionism. They know perfectly well that, before any civilized community would consent to give public legal recognition and compulsion to any union, it would insist on .the performance of certain conditions. It would insist, in the first place, that the doors of that union should be absolutely open, without any discretion whatever on the part of the managers of that union, to all persons belonging to that particular silent. trade, who knew their business and were not of bad character. They know also that no compulsory unionism could be possibly brought about, as long as there was any discretion in the unions as to the amount of entrance fee to be paid by new members joining.",37
285,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,EXPLOSIVES,The fee is £20 in the lawyers' union.,38
286,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"I don't think there is any use in taking notice of trivial interjections. The honourable members who make these interjections about lawyers either do so from absolute ignorance, or with a view to deceiving the people outside, because they cannot possibly deceive anybody inside. Another condition which honourable members know the law would require, if it not only recognised unions but made them compulsory, would be the imposition of s. definite law against striking at all, or except under certain definite conditions. There are other conditions which the law would impose before it would recognise compulsory unionism, and, therefore, honourable members opposite, with the exception of one or two, are opposed to compulsory unionism. A further condition would certainly be that the funds of the unions should be under the control of a public trustee, and that the expenditure of those funds should be subject to audit. Honourable members are not prepared to accept these conditions, but they say that the law should give preference to their unions whilst they retain the right to say what shall be done with the funds. They would compel a man to join a union, or be starved to death, whilst they retain the right to expend the money as secretly as they like, and for what purposes they like. Those are the reasons why honourable members opposite dare not advocate compulsory unionism, and why, though the unions would not comply with the conditions which a reasonable law would impose upon them, honourable members insist upon Parliament giving preference to unionists. In ' fact, honourable members insist that every man who does not bear the union brand shall be liable to be starved off the face of the earth.",38
287,Mr ANSTEY,EXPLOSIVES,"You believe in that principle, and practise it.",38
288,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,Honourable members say that men who do not bear the brand of a trade union should not have the right to live.,38
289,Mr ANSTEY,EXPLOSIVES,"You practise that in your own profession. Mr ""W. H . IRVINE - Honourable members know that they are talking of things that have no connection with this Bill. They know that unless a man can get for himself the brand of this irresponsible association, that will not recognise the conditions which a reasonable law would impose, they would deprive him of the right of earning his livelihood, and he and his wife and children might die.",38
290,Mr ANSTEY,EXPLOSIVES,That is what you do every day.,38
291,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,The honourable member is saying what he knows to be untrue.,38
292,Mr TUDOR,EXPLOSIVES,I think the Attorney General should be compelled to withdraw that remark.,38
293,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,On a point of order. The honourable the Attorney-General has just stated that honourable members on this side were stating what they knew to be untrue. I ask that the remark be withdrawn.,38
294,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"I withdraw the remark, and further say that I regret that, in the heat of argument, I was led to make it . OPPOSITION MEMBERS - You admit you are heated?",38
295,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"I do. I cannot help it. I cannot touch this subject without feeling every sense of fair play that I have inherited from my ancestors stirring within me. Honourable members may laugh, but if there is one thing which we as British people have inherited from centuries of free government, it is that every citizen is entitled under the law to a free right to sell his services for the best price he can get for them. But honourable members on the other side say they will not allow a man to live his life unless he bears the union label. However, I am not going to allow myself to become overheated in this discussion, nor am I going to take up much longer time with it. I will conclude by a quotation which, no doubt, will be of interest to my honourable friends opposite. I do not know whether you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the intervals which you spare from studying the Standing Orders, devote any time to a perusal of the Bible, but, if you do, you will probably be quite familiar with the description of the beast of the Apocalypse. It is described as a beast "" coming out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon."" That is suggestive of the voice of the Opposition.",38
296,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"You are thinking about vour ostrich. Mr ""VV. H . IRVINE - The ostrich is on the opposite side, but I thought that my honourable friend had agreed with me that we should both desist from references to natural history for the remainder of our parliamentary lives.",39
297,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,No ; I am an advocate of fair play for ostriches.,39
298,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,"""Well , perhaps we may also claim the same for serpents. However, to continue, my quotation, this beast had power to- cause that, as many as would not worship ! the image of the beast should be killed. And lie causeth all, both small and great, rich poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.""

310,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,The public utterances of the Attorney-General make that fact obvious to every man who will read.,39
311,Mr FLEMING,EXPLOSIVES,What fact?,39
312,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"The fact that he is not in favour of preference to unionists, either when given by the Government or by a judicial Court, or in any circumstances whatever. "" Mr WH IRVINE - Hear , hear!",39
313,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,And the honourable member is in the position today that he can demand that his will be carried out. One man on the Government side of the and House can determine the policy of that party.,39
314,Mr FALKINER,EXPLOSIVES,"On a point of order. The words of the Leader of the Opposition are such as to suggest that none of us on this side of the House has any opinion or honour. I take exception to that statement, and ask that it be withdrawn.",39
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"The Standing' Orders do not apply to reflections of a general character, and, therefore, I am unable to take any action in regard to the point which the honourable member has raised. ' Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",39
316,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"The Attorney-General, who spoke with so much heat when introducing the Bill, must admit that it goes only a short way in the direction in which he would go. Generally speaking, he leaves us in no doubt as to his views, and he has told us that if he had the power be would deny, not only preference to those seeking Government employment, but even its application by a Court in the. exercise of discretion conferred by Parliament. He would deprive every organization of preference, he says. Yet he belongs to an honourable profession which makes a larger claim for preference than has been granted by any Court.",39
317,Mr WH IRVINE,EXPLOSIVES,It has no nreference at all.,39
318,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"Every one who is not a member of it is absolutely excluded. froin practising law. I am not complaining of this organization, nor of the conditions imposed on those who, having attained certain qualifications, wish to enter the legal profession. I am merely stating the fact to contrast itwith the position of the Attorney-General in regard to preference generally.  Mr W . H . IBVINE - The right honourable member would not say that cabmen have preference because they must be licensed, nor would be say that chemists, doctors, and others have preference.",39
319,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"Unles s a man conforms to conditions laid down by the organization of which I speak, he cannot enter it . The law permits those possessing certain qualifications to join the legal profession; but there is one condition insisted upon by this organization. Mr W . H . i B v i NE . ^ What is it? .",40
320,Mr EISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"Would the Attorney General practise with every man who has been approved by the Courts as possessing the qualifications necessary for . a barrister ? He knows that he would not. He has compared himself with the ex-Attorney-General, saying that he did not propose to follow the lines taken by Bim in giving cheap legal advice. Attorney-General is not only a member of the Labour party, but a friend, who, in the most honourable way, and notwithstanding almost insurmountable difficulties, has risen to one of the highest positions in the country. Yet the Attorney General says, "" Here is a man who gave advice that was not paid for. I do not do that. My opinions are paid for, and always will be."" The sneer was uncalled for, and unworthy of the Attorney General, although it will not hurt the honourable member for West Sydney. Mr W . H . IBVINE - I was not referring to him at all, and I said so.",40
321,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"The honourable gentleordinarily' man was speaking of the actions of the honourable member for West Sydney when Attorney-General, and the reference he made did not come well from him. Mr W . H . IBVINE - The right honorto unionists. able member will do me the justice of saying that I have always treated the lation to preference to unionists: honourable member for West Sydney with courtesy.",40
322,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"I believe so, though it is. of no moment to the honourable memzation ber for West Sydney whether he be treated with courtesy or not. tion does not depend on the courtesy shown to him by either superiors or in feriors. Hi s knowledge and ability, political and legal, are such that the most wise people in the country are glad to consult him. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Hear , hear!",40
323,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"That matter need l o t be discussed further. The Attorney General, as a distinguished member of the Bar, has admitted that persons qualified to practise law cannot do so unless they comply with certain conditions; that those who are in the organization will not appear with others who are not. I wish to deal with this matter calmly, because it is one for decision after argument- - Either our position can be defended or it cannot; either we stand for political justice or we do not - I aro in favour of preference to unionists, and do not hesitate to say so. Society needs organizing. Those who have to earn their ownliving, whether as artisans, in trade, or in the professions, should form themselves into organizations, and whan disputes arise, as they will from time to time, they should be arbitrated upon by persons who have uo interests involved. The condition imposed upon parties seekThe ex- ing redress for grievances by an appeal to the Arbitratio n Court is that they shall give up their right to strike, their righ t to do in j u r y to the whole community, and this is held to entitle tbem ' to preference. The preference for which, we contend is much less than that, required by the organization to which the Attorney-General belongs. A member of that organization in this State"" has gone so far as to throw up a brief tp appear for the Crown to defend a. man arraigned on a capital charge, within a day or two of the case being called on, simply because the fees marked on the brief, although those paid, were not sufficient.",40
324,Mr AHEBN,EXPLOSIVES,A barrister may throw up his brief whether a member of the Bar .that Association or not.,40

327,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"I say that the organito which I refer is exclusive, and I am giving an extreme instance of what His posia member of this organization, to which the Attorney-General belongs, and of which he has spoken so highly, will do.",40
328,Mr AHEBN,EXPLOSIVES,The righ t honourable gentleman's inference was that the barrister referred to threw up his brief besause he was a member of the Bar Association.,41
329,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,No .,41
330,Mr AHEBN,EXPLOSIVES,It has been done repeatedly by men who have not been members of any association.,41
331,Mr EISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"I did not intend to convey any such inference. I was simply pointing out what cau be done, and is done, by members of the privileged, exalted, noble profession, and of the association which the Attorney-General defends. Let me remind the honourable member for Indi that such privileges are not to be conceded, according to the Attorney General, to any association of working men. The advantages that are extended to the members of the exalted Bar Association are not to be enjoyed by workmen who organize, not to gain a competency, but simply to obtain wages and conditions that will enable them to live.",41
332,Mr ANSTEY,EXPLOSIVES,And even when a maD wants to act in accordance with the lavi they will not permit him to live.,41
333,Mr EISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"The Attorney-General said that if preference to unionists were given, certain conditions should be imposed. But is it not a fact that he has also said that, under no circumstances or conditions, is he in favour of preference ? How does he reconcile the two statements? The explanation is that one is intended for the public. The one is designed to regale the electors when the question is being put from a partisan point of view. The honourable gentleman, on this question, cannot blow hot and cold. He is either in favour of ' one or the other of these propositions. I favour preference to unionists in respect of all organizations. I wish to state once more my attitude regarding the position of the Executive. Our justification for the action of the late Government in granting, in their Executive capacity, during the life of the last Parliament, preference to unionists lies in the fact that three elections had taken place since preference to unionists had been declared by enactment to be the policy of this Parliament. The relation of the Executive to the Parliament is that of a Board of Directors to the shareholders of [411-2 a private company. When the shareholders of a private company have declared in favour of a certain preference, the management or the directors are in duty bound to give effect to that policy; and in the same way the action of the late Government in granting preference to unionists can be full y justified. The At torney-General declared that we were a party of hypocrites because we would not declare for absolute compulsory unionism. That charge is not only undeserved, but has no application. How were the unions of which the Attorney-General spoke brought into existence? Were they brought into existence as the pampered darlings of a class ? Is it not a fact that there are living today men who, when they first became unionists,, had to hide the funds of their organizations, and to meet in secret?",41
334,Mr BURNS,EXPLOSIVES,They had to bury their books.,41
335,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"They had even to conceal their records. That haa happened during - the lifetime of the Attorney General, and men would have been outlawed had it been discovered that they were members of a union possessing funds and holding meetings. If they merely possessed the courage of which the Attorney-General Spoke, the men would have professed their principles, but have sacrificed nothing for them. His policy is that of no preference whatever to unionists, but as the spokesman of the Government he brings in a Bill which will carry out only a small part of his professed policy. I am not here to question the firmness of his belief in the principles he professes, but my knowledge of him is that while he can speak mightily and determinedly as to the views that he. holds, he is seldom to be found remaining in the breach when a regard for his principle calls upon him to stand alone. He fights best when he is in a big battalion.",41
336,Mr CONROY,EXPLOSIVES,"I hope that this is a case of the big battalion. ' Mr FISHER - I do not object to the honourable member entertaining that hope. Even the criminal lying under sentence of death does not abandon hope u n t i l the last. I challenge the Attorney-General's statement that preference to unionists cannot be granted in any civilized country. I take the entirely opposite view. Preference to unionists is but a sign of civilization. It is in keeping with the whole trend of civilization, and does no injustice to any citizen. The Government that honestly declares for preference to unionists declares for a policy that more or less limits their action. The present Government declares for a policy, not of preference to unionists, but of free, open, unrestricted competition. Our experience is that, not merely in Australia, but all the world over, society influence and the prejudice of those in authority are entirely against unionism. For centuries unionists have had to suffer disabilities, and they have never suffered more than they have during the last fifty or sixty years. They have never obtained justice. lingering prejudice still remains with the Attorney-General and his party. not going to say, however, that the Prime Minister has altered his opinions. I cannot believe that the honourable gentleman holds any other view than he held when, as a much younger man, he was associated .with the unions Mr W . H . IBVINE - Did he ever cate Government preference to unionists ? . Mr FISHER - Yes .",41
337,Mr WEST,EXPLOSIVES,"As Postmaster-General of .New South Wales, he employed only unionists in excavating telephone tunnels.",42
338,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"No worse proposition could be-brought forward than that made .by the Attorney-General that we should discriminate between preference to unionists in private and in Government employment. This Parliament has prescribed the conditions under which the private employer may carry on his industry, but, according to the Attorney-General, the Government should not be asked to comply with the same conditions when competing with that private employer.",42
339,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,Perhaps the Government are going to extend the prohibition.,42
340,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"On e does not know. The Attorney-General, by implication; says t h a i we should impose certain restrictions-if preference to unionists is a restriction-o n private employers, but that the Government which, in certain industries, is competing directly with those private employers, should suffer no such restriction. Can he justif y that contention ? It is perfectly illogical and unfair to outside employers. To be logical, the Attorney-General must get back to his old declaration that there should , be no preference of any kind provided by either the Parliament or the Courts. In other words, he says, "" Le t there be a scramble! Let us go back to barbarism! Let us go back to the time when the strong destroyed the weak.""",42
341,Mr BRENNAN,EXPLOSIVES,To freedom of contract.,42
342,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"Quite so; there are, on the Government side of the House, honourable members who would have been in their element in Australia twenty-five . years ago, when, after twenty years of borrowing .and booming by Liberal Governments, the country was brought to its knees by financial disaster, the like of which had never occurred before in a country with our population. At that time, tbose who had to rely only on their The hands to save their children from starvation had to scratch and scrape, and jostle I am with each other to get a mere pittance to keep body and soul together. Then there was no preference to unionists. Freedom of contract prevailed, and no one man was allowed to speak for two or three. Every man had to plead his own case. The At torney-General says today that we should advo- revert to that position of affairs-that no two or three men should be allowed to organize and have one spokesman. On the other hand, employers may unite as much as they like, and one man may speak for the whole, and prescribe terms. Does the Attorney-General think it fair , even for a Government, to refuse to deal with men collectively? Is it fair for the Government, with their party behind them, to lay down certain conditions of employment, and declare that they wil l hear no one on behalf of an organization, but will deal with only individual men ? What ' chance has the unit ? This may seem a smaller matter to some of my colleagues than it does to me, but if the Government carry out this principle, or what they call a principle, it will undoubtedly establish a precedent, because it cannot logically end with tbem. Governments, both Commonwealth and State, arc not merely Governments in the old sense of the term-bodie s merely to pass laws and keep the peace of the country-bu t they undertake enterprises and employ large numbers of people in productive and other occupations for the benefit 'of the community. It will be seen, therefore, that they stand in quite a different position from that' of Governments of the past. It has been urged that preference, as established by the late Government, is not in accordance with British fair play, and the Attorney- General has sneered at the words "" other things being equal."" Other words maybe used to express the idea, but the words used mean that the preference is not to the exclusion of everybody-the y mean exactly what they say. The At torney-General is entitled to his sneer, but it does not appeal to me, and I do not think it will have any serious effect on others. The charge by the Attorney General that preference means "" Spoils to the victors "" is not true in fact. There are no "" spoils "" when the Labour party are i u office; the "" s p o i l s "" begin only when they leave office. That is a rejoinder which I think I am entitled to make to the charge by the Attorney General.",42
343,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,For which party does us. Mr Teesdale Smith vote?,43
344,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"Apparently "" s p o i l s "" began as soon as the present as well. Government came into office. also then began; and there is no honourable member opposite who will defend contract with Mr Teesdale Smith, or the children; that is our idea; manner in which it was entered into. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Every member on this side, except one, supports it .",43
345,Mr AGABWYNNE,EXPLOSIVES,What about the power to appoint whom they please. Wireless Telegraph Company?,43
346,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"I am now replying the taunt of the Attorney-General about "" Spoils to the victors."" Who are the victors? Tbey are men wbo are getting money, or any consideration all, beyond the consideration that allows them to work. They pray for work, for the l a w ; and, strange opportunity to use their physical and mental powers, so that they may support and party, is prepared their families and otlier dependents. All and the privilege they get is that of being employed under prescribed conditions apply to every workman.

While the Attorney-General was out of the ber, I drew attention to the individuals are not allowed to associate in an organization, they are undoubtedly placed at a disadvantage. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Hear , one has disputed that.",43
347,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"What objection, then, can there be to treating as a body, and giving preference to as an organization, men who have made conditions prescribing hours of labour, and have fixed a standard of efficiency to which all must rise before they can join ? They are doing the work of the nation, and they are an organized society; and they ought not only to be given preference, but to be thanked. Every civilized nation should be t h a n k f ul to the men and women who were the first to advocate and to carry out the great principle of unionism. Many of the privileges and conditions enjoyed today, from which so much of our happiness and comfort arise, are due to the sacrifice of those who have gone before the Mr WEST - And to that of their wives Secrecy",43

359,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"Yes , preference to unionists, because they are members of organized bodies, but this Bill aims at giving preference to non-unionists. Members of an organized body will not work with non-unionists. The Prime Minister said that no decent unionist will work with a non-unionist, and that his' union, the Miners' Union, knew what to do with non-unionists. Therefore, if the Govern The ment give employment to non-unionists no unionists will be employed, and that which means that it is preference to non-unionists that the Bill provides. Minis-' ters know this very well. While pretendto make the matter universally fair , they are seeking to provide a legal condition which will prevent unionists being employed. It is strange that we find this Bill taking precedence over every other matter affecting the public welfare. One would think that the Government, in their t t le present position, would endeavour to deal supwith matters of urgent and public interest, t but instead, they have brought forwar d this measure, straightforwardly from their of view, with the object of picking The Prime has said that the Senate does is not represent the people, that the constitution of another place will need to be altered, and that Ministers cannot remain i u their present positions unless this is done.

The to Government have-chosen it for their own to purpose, not to solve a dead-lock, but to create one. My justification for saying rememthat is that every Minister making a n a public statement says that the condition of Parliament has a close connection with this particular measure. So the Bill is brought forward, not to solve a dead-lock be between the two Houses, but to create Mr W . H .

Mr FISHER , - I have already said never that the proposal of Ministers is not put forward to solve a deadlock or remove a difficulty between the two Houses, but is to create one, and is therefore subversive the principles of government. MinisGoters seek to create a difficulty instead of using the provisions of the Bill to remove one after a difficulty has arisen. If we continually provoke a quarrel with a coordinate House elected on the same f r a n chise as our own we shall never be able is to carry on responsible government, and there will be no l i m it to wrangles and disturbances, and to, the .expense to which o , the people will be put. If the Government had had the decency to stay their band until a real crisis arose between the to two Houses, they would have been entitled to some consideration. But they the rush forward with an object which is obviously political, and not national. In reall other Parliaments the practice has been, if the popular House finds it imposI would sible, through conflict with the otlier House, to carry on, that it should first go to the country to ascertain the will of the people; and that course should be sufficient and ample to meet the present t is crisis. In dealing with that phase of the question, let me quote the prophetic words used by the Treasurer at the Federal Convention in relation to the "" deadlock "" provisions of the Constitution. The right honourable gentleman said - : All these precautions are unnecessary, and be found mischievous, because they will encourage differences rather than put an end to them. . . . If you give the power to dissolve both Houses double dissolution, as it has been called g the Government of the day to appeal to the constituencies .whenever a conflict of opinion occurs, it' may, as time goes oh, be used for a very different purpose from that for which it is being advocated at the present time. I can imagine that a Government which felt itself somewhat weak, or which thought that an occasion was iin opportune one for an appeal to the country,' might encourage a conflict rather than try to avoid it , in order in this way it might be able to recommend a dissolution of both Houses, in the hope that that would' strengthen their follow*.^, or at any rate, give it more time. . . . .You may depend upon it that as time goes on every possible device will be used to gain political influence and power by taking advantage of the form of the Constitution.",45

I agree with the view put forward by the Attorney-General, in his telling and succinct speech, that the matter has been debated over and over again, and not much new mutter can be contributed to the discussion. I am inclined to take the view advanced in the leading columns of the Age this morning that if the Opposition regard this as an unimportant measure they will allow it to speedily pass, because, if a double dissolution is dependent on the passing of this Bill, it will certainly bring us face to face with the position that we shall have to proceed with the other planks^n our platform or go before the people. Opposition members laugh, but I should like to know whether they have.any platform. If they have one it is their duty to, as soon as possible, send this House and the other House to the country, in order that they may appeal to their own supporters to secure the passing into law bf the principles they advocate. In my opinion the Labour Government, during their three years of office, exhausted their practicable platform, and they are so bankrupt at the present time, so far, as a policy is concerned, that they are awaiting the passing of the referenda proposals before they can proceed with the platform of Socialistic legislation which they now find it impossible to carry out. Mr KTNG O'MALLEY - We can deal with the Tariff.",46
370,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"I hope we shall have an opportunity of amending the Tariff, but I think the members occupying the Opposition benches should be the last to charge the Government with not carrying out their policy of Tariff reform, when they so flagrantly neglected their opportunities in that regard during the three years they were in office. In speaking on this measure, it, is the duty of every member to confine himself to the Bill itself, instead of indulging in a general disthat cussion on the question of unionism. This measure does not involve the general question of unionism. The only question which it raises is as to whether a Government, who are the trustees of the public, and who, as such, have in their hands the revenues and funds of the people, shall be allowed to say that, in order to reward their own political supporters, they will give them exclusive employment in the Government service. It is the duty of the House, so far as industrial matters generally are concerned, to endeavour to bring to bear the genius of both sides in order to evolve some scheme that will insure industrial peace, and prevent the old barbarous method of resorting to a strike when differences arise between employers and employees. That cannot be done except by some scheme of organization on the part of employers on the one hand and employ6s on the other. That question has already been dealt with by this House. We have not a perfect system at present, but it is the duty of the House to endeavour to make it more perfect. The Arbitration Act of 1904 was given to the people by a Liberal Government. It might be a better law than it is^  to unionists.",46
371,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"It contained preference to unionists under certain circumstances, but I am not going to discuss now how far that principle should be embodied in any law administered by a properlyconstituted Court. That is not the question under discussion at the present moment. I am free to admit, however, that if we could induce the great body of industrial workers to give up the right to strike that obtained under the old barbarous system, it would be the duty of Parliament to provide some form of legislation which would be compensation and protection to the organizations and equivalent to the right they had forfeited. What form - that protection should take is for this House to decide, but it is not under discussion at present. When the question does come up for discussion, and the Arbitration Act is brought forward for amendment, it will be for the House to do something to preserve to the organized workers of Australia their rights, and enable them to settle their disputes in the Arbitration Court, or before Wages Boards, or by some other for m of a tribunal, instead of the barbarous method of the strike, which is so productive of suffering and loss, not only to the parties themselves, bu t to the whole of the community. However, what we have to deal with now is the question of preference to unionists in the Government service. For party purposes members of the Opposition have been endeavouring to make light of this important Bill . Some of them say that it is a sham, that it cannot effect anything, and so on. I am pleased to find that the Leader of the Opposition, who should speak with authority in behalf of his party, has declared this matter to be a very important one. I say it is an i m portant one, because it is a question which strikes right down to the fundamental principles of administration. It is one which says that the administrators, who are intrusted with the public funds of the country, shall not use those funds for party purposes, but shall dispense those funds, administer the Departments, and handle the public money in a manner that will mete out equity and fairness to every section of the community. That is what the system of preference to unionists in government employment involves.  ment your father used.",46
372,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"It is bad taste introduce family matters and personal marks into a debate in this House,-but any association my honoured father liad with industrial unionism I am proud of. I am glad to know that he was the founder of the Miners' Association i Creswick, a body which, by meeting the employers in conference and discussing matters with them calmly arid deliberpartment. ately, was able to improve the conditions of the workers in those days.  to him 1 They drove him out of the disprinciple trict.",47
373,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,I say that is lutely untrue. ,47
374,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"I was one of the pendents on him, and I ought to know better than the honourable member. I say his statement is absolutely untrue. As this personal matter has with such bad taste been introduced by the honourable member for Grey on several occasions, let me say that if the associations and industrial organizations were the same today as they were when my father was one of their leaders, I would be with them right to the last. My father was connected with industrial unionism before the unions became political organizations. They were industrial organizations only. The Prime Minister, too, was a champion of unionism when it was purely in dustrial, and not political in its organization. Tbis question of administrative preference to unionists was first discovered while the honourable member for Darwin was at the head of the Home Affairs Department. In a debate in this House the honourable member was taxed with having given preference to unionists, and with having issued a minute in the Department ordering that preference to unionists should be given. The interpretation of that minute by the administrative head of the Department was that, if preference to unionists was to be enforced in the Home Affairs Department, it would be necessary to dismiss all non-unionists then employed.",47
375,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPLOSIVES,I never sacked anybody.,47
376,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"That was the interpretation placed upon the instructions in a memorandum issued by the administrato tive head of the Department. The M in reister's instructions declared that only unionists should be employed, and that the Department was to be furnished with a list of the non-unionists in the employ of the Department. No other interpren tation could be placed on the Minister's instructions than that contained in the memorandum from the head of the DeHonorable members on this side believe that if the instruction had not been discovered, and the discussion do had not taken place in this House, the contained in that minute would have been the prevailing policy in the absoHome Affairs Department. It is now stated that this Bill is not necessary, because by administrative act the Governdement have repealed an administrative act of their predecessors. Honourable members opposite argue that the Bill is a redundancy, and that all it could have achieved is already achieved by an administrative act of the present Government. It is fortunate that the people returned the present Government to power, if only for the fact that one of its i m portant administrative acts has been to repeal that pernicious instruction in regard to preference to unionists in the Government service. Honourable members ask why we want this Bill . I am going to show that it is necessary that we should have an Act on the statute-book which will prevent the possibility of any such policy being repeated by a mere administrative act if the Labour party should be returned to power.",47
377,Mr BRENNAN,EXPLOSIVES,"If the Labour party are returned to power, will they not haye a mandate from the people to give preference ?",48
378,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"I agree with the honourable member, but if the present Opposition are returned to power at the next election, and wish to restore the old practice of preference to unionists, they can only do it by bringing down another Bill to repeal the measure which is now before us; otherwise they will be breakers of the law.",48
379,Mr BRENNAN,EXPLOSIVES,You desire to stand against the will of the people?,48
380,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"I want to prevent any Government repeating this principle by any secret act of administration, under pressure from the outside organizations which control them. I have another reason. A f t e r the discussion in this House on the preference to unionists ordered by the former Minister of Home Affairs, the then Prime Minister declared that, all things being equal, preference to unionists would be given. He laid that down as the policy of the Government.",48
381,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPLOSIVES,I had done that twelve months before.,48
382,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"For the time being the then Government put that saving clause forward as a justification for enforcing the principle of preference to unionists in the Government service. But we find that, in defiance of that statement, the Minister of Home Affairs attached a minute to specifications for a contract stating that the principle of absolute preference to unionists should be applied in private employment by the contractor.",48
383,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPLOSIVES,"Yes , I was boss of that show.",48
384,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"It has been stated in this debate that if preference to union. ists is given, it can only apply to a very small number of employees in the Public Service; but we have found out from our experience with the past Government that the principle did not apply only to casual employees in the Service, but could be enforced in connection with all private contracts taken under the Government. This minute was attached to the specifications for certain works in the Northern Territory by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, some time after the order for preference to unionists in the ' Government service was given. The minute on the specification read : "" In the employment of labour and the carrying out of this contract,, absolute preference is to be given to unionists."" This instruction proved that, if preference can be given to unionists by Executive act, it may not be given merely to casual employees, but may be made a condition in all Government contracts.",48
385,Mr ABTHUR,EXPLOSIVES,"That condition might be overridden by the Arbitration Court. - Mr SAMPSON - We have no evidence that it would be. The public expenditure is increasing, and our commitments are very large. There are immense works to be undertaken in the Northern Territ o r y ; we have railways to construct; and, directly, or indirectly under contractors, must employ thousands and tens of thousands of workmen. To all these persons the principle of preference to unionists might be applied.",48
386,Mr MCDONALD,EXPLOSIVES,What wrong would be done by applying it ?,48
387,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"It would mean that public funds would be used to force men into unions, and to reward political supporters. It would be a misuse of public money, a violation of public trusteeship, and a blot on Australian public life. The discussion of the Bill does not involve the discussion of preference to unionists generally.",48
388,Mr ARTHUR,EXPLOSIVES,The Attorney-General says that the Bill is a step in the direction of the abolition of preference to unionists.,48
389,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"It is for the Prime Minister to make a public declaration of the policy of this party in respect of in dustrial organization, unionism, the powers of the - Arbitratio n Court, and other matters of that kind. Until he has done so, I must confine my remarks to the measure before the House. The Leader i of the Opposition has stated that the Bill is designed to give preference to non-unionists. ,",48
390,Mr FISHEK,EXPLOSIVES,It makes it impossible for unionists to work.,49
391,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"Surely the right honourable gentleman has not read the Bill? The measure prohibits the giving of preference, leaving the field open for the employment of all qualified persons.",49
392,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,"It is a Bill to euable the friends of the Government to be employed, and to prevent unionists from getting employment.",49
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPLOSIVES,The best answer to that statement is that the Government employ thousands of unionists.,49
394,Mr FISHER,EXPLOSIVES,Because Ministers cannot help themselves.,49
395,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"To say that this is a Bill to give preference to non-unionists is to distort its language. to remove disabilities, and to make i sible for every citizen to obtain ment in the Commonwealth service. hope that the measure will not be cussed at length, but will be passed through the House as speedily",49
396,Mr ARTHUR,EXPLOSIVES,"If the Bill became law, and preference were given in spite it , what would happen ?",49
397,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"The ordinary man who violates the law is put into gaol, and a Minister who did so would deserve Parliament some time ago. the same treatment. If the discussion this measure is unduly prolonged, vernment will be prevented from submitting measures to give effect to other planks of the platform for which we have the mandate of the people. We promised ance scheme. the people that we would remove the stain of preference, to unionists from the polition t i c a l escutcheon, so that the public money time. must be spent in the interests whole community, and not merely of a privileged class. When the Labour Government was in power, ifs measures were not inordinately discussed when it could be shown that they had been introduced in accordance with a mandate from people. The Opposition held up the postal vote proposals for a night or two, beto cause we claimed that the people had given a mandate to the Labour party exclude the sick and the old fro m exercise of the franchise. I agree with what has been published one of the morping newspapers in regard to the attitude p f the present Opposition towards this Bill . I hope, also, that the advice of the other morning newspaperthe Argus-that the closure should be ap' plied, will be adopted if there is any undue debate on the proposal. I hope that the Government will fearlessly avail themselves of 'all the legitimate forms that the Standing Orders permit to secure the speedy passing of this measure.",49
398,Mr ARTHUR,EXPLOSIVES,Will the honourable member include Mr Speaker in the application of the closure?,49
399,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,I am not going to particularize. Every member of the Liberal party owes it to his constituents so to vote as to insure the passing of this Bill after a reasonable debate.,49
400,Mr MCDONALD,EXPLOSIVES,The Prime Minister can move the application of the closure at any time.,49
401,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,"I hope that will be It is a Bill done if the Opposition continue to hold t posup public business.

We should show the people that we are prepared to do business, or else as possible. go back to the country.",49

I am sorry that it should have been necessary introduce this Bill . I regret that we not should have had in Australia a Governto ment which would so misuse political and the administrative power as to apply publio funds to reward their own political supi n porters in Government employment.",49
408,Mr MCDONALD,EXPLOSIVES,You are a liar for making that statement.,49
409,Mr SAMPSON,EXPLOSIVES,It is correct.,49
410,Mr LAIRD SMITH,EXPLOSIVES,It is absolutely correct. You know that you are telling lies.,50

If , however, he_ did make the statement, it must be withdrawn at the direction of the Chair, even though it might not be offensive taken by itself.

446,Mr HUGHES,EXPLOSIVES,"I desire to raise a point of order.

466,Mr SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,The honourable member is not in order in taking his present line of discussion. There is an order of the House that Government business must take precedence of all other business; and what the honourable member is now doing is reflecting on the decision of the and discussing something that is on the notice-paper.,52

468,Mr SPEAKER,EXPLOSIVES,"I again point out that the House itself decided that Government business was to take precedence; and before the Government could have rearranged the business-paper, even had they been willing to do so, they would have to get leave of the House to vary the decision already arrived at ",52
469,Mr JH CATTS,EXPLOSIVES,"Quite so, but I submit that the Prime Minister, had he not been very badly advised, would have taken steps to enable the motion as to your Tilling to be discussed.

Next Wednesday he can ask for leave to the Bill , and he will be granted The leave, and if he places the measure first on the business-paper it will be discussed, and no doubt passed very speedily. The same remarks will apply to insurance, so far as the Constitution will allow. The Prime Minister, nearly twelve months met a deputation of unemployed, and he sympathized with them- I suppose that while he was speaking he felt that of sympathy-but , so far, he has made no attempt to introduce legislation to insure people against sickness, or to pass a law to assist widows and orphans, or to pass a Bill to endeavour to insure people against the unemployment. Where are tliese measures ? Where is the Bill for the appointment of commissioners to manage the Office, or that to appoint industrial disboards to settle Inter-State disputes, or on that to appoint a board to settle the maternity allowance-the Bill which the Knight of the-Crown of It a l y is to introduce when opportunity offers. I do not know that we will pass the Bill very easily, but we have a right to know the nature of the measure.

He thinks that any alteration will prevent him and those whom he We represents doing so well. Of course, he entirely mistaken in that Conservative and Tory view, but, nevertheless, he holds m it . I would like the public of Australia to take particular notice of the Government and their method of doing business. I would like them to read the Ministerial statement of twelve months ago, and compare it with the Speech of the Governor General a month ago. They would realise that Ministers are merely marking time, and have no intention of introducing these items of legislation, but intend to fool the general public so long as the poor general public are unacquainted with their real aims.",53
482,Mr YATES,EXPLOSIVES,"Adelaide) [4.9] would like to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a matter which is rather urgent to the old people of Adelaide. The place where the old-age pensioners are paid is on a flat on the riverside, about three-quarters of a mile from the nearest spot to which these old people have to go. The road leading to it is very little used, and is very steep. It is a hardship for. old people over seventy years of age to have to struggle down there, particularly in the summer time, when the heat in Adelaide is very severe. Ever since tire ground has been levelled, the place has been used as a gun-carriage shed. It is.simply constructed of wood and iron, and has a narrow bench inside on which the old-age pensioners are obliged to sit in summer, with their backs to the heat. There is uo. shade outside, and they have to sit in that position for some time before they can get their wants attended to. In winter, the place is flat and dismal, and having been laid out as an evolution ground for cadets, it becomes simply a sheet of water after heavy .rain. In addition, the soil is of a clayey character, and that makes walking somewhat dangerous to those who are not nimble on their feet. Honourable members will see that this is an awful place to send old people to in order to get their pensions. I hope that the Treasurer w i ll try to secure an office more centrally situated in Adelaide. I would suggest the General Post Office, or Selborne Chambers, which are almost exclusively used for Commonwealth purposes. If the Treasurer looks at the matter from a sympathetic point of view, the obtaining of improved accommodation w i ll not be a difficult matter. I hope that he will take the matter into consideration at an early date.",54

485,Mr ANSTEY,EXPLOSIVES,"If I thought there would be any other opportunity of saying what I wish to say, I would not proceed witli this matter, because I feel that the delay is probably inflicting an injustice on some members of. the Chamber. If the -- I Prime Minister would exercise the same regard for the opinions of honourable members as he wishes us to show, I , for one, would be pleased to do as he asks. The point I wish to draw attention to is this: Last Friday I moved an amendment in this chamber; it was seconded, and was properly before the House. The Attorney-General raised a point of order, and you, Mr Speaker, expressed the opinion that the amendment was out of order.",54

493,Mr FENTON,EXPLOSIVES,"Maribyrnong) [4.14] There is considerable hardship imposed on several members of the community. I refer to lads who are apprenticed, and are compelled to leave their trade to attend drills and parades. Will the Prime Minister endeavour, either by regulation or au amendment of the Defence Act, to relieve those apprentices from parades and drills which, interfere with their apprenticeship and employment, and very often lessen the money which goes into the family purse ?",54
