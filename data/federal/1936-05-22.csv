Minister in charge of War Service Homes promised that he would visit South Australia to inquire into matters relating to his department. Is he yet able to say when that visit is likely to lie made?",13

36,Mr THOMPSON,CORONATION OF,"In common with other honourable members, I have forwarded to the department during the last twelve months a number of applications for new war service homes, but have always been informed that the applications must await their turn. I have heard nothing more about them, and, apparently, never will. Can the Minister say whether the accumulation of unconsidered applications is being reduced to any extent?",13
37,Mr HUNTER,CORONATION OF,"It is true that the department is about two years in arrears in dealing with applications for new homes, but it is hoped that sufficient funds will be allotted in next year's Estimates to permit of those arrears being substantially reduced.",13
38,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CORONATION OF,"Will the Minister take immediate and urgent steps to protect from victimization the unfortunate wife of a returned soldier living in the Nambour district, who has been threatened by the department with eviction unless she pays arrears extending over twelve months? The woman's husband is an invalid, but he has been denied a pension hecause he cannot prove that his disability is due to his war service.",14
39,Mr HUNTER,CORONATION OF,"This is the first I have heard of the case, but full inquiries will be made before any further action is taken.",14
40,Mr LANE,CORONATION OF,"Will the Government place upon the Estimates sufficient money to enable the occupiers of war service homes to have their premises connected with sewerage mains, so that they may not have to continue paying sanitary dues to local municipalities?",14

46,Mr THORBY,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,"Yesterday , the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) inquired regarding the distribution of funds under the provisions of the Farmers' Debt Adjustment Act, and I supplied him with figures relating to distributions up to the 28th February. I have now been informed that the States have advised the Treasury that their estimated requirements up to the 30th June, 1936, will be as follows:New South Wales .. 120,000 Victoria .. .. 150,000 Queensland 30,000 South Australia .. 00,000 Western Australia .. 150,000 Tasmania. .. 50,000 Total .. 500,000",14
47,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,Is the Commonwealth Government satisfied with the rate at which the State Governments are proceeding with the distribution of funds under the Farmers' Debt Adjustment Act?,14
48,Mr THORBY,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,"Althoug h the figures I have given are comparatively small compared with the total of £12,000,000 provided for in the act, honourable members must understand that some of the States were unable to operate under their own legislation, because it did not conform to the requirements of the federal act, and it was only during this session hon- that the Commonwealth act was amended to enable the States to come into line. It is hoped that, during the next financial year, large sums will be distributed through the agency of the States. RESTORATION OF PENSIONS.",14
49,Mr WARD,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,"In view of the fact that the Government will have a substantial surplus at the end of this financial year, wilt the Prime Minister state whether any provision is being made in the next budget for the restoration of invalid and old-age pensions to the full amount of £1 a week?",14
50,Mr LYONS,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,All matters concerning the budget will receive careful consideration by the Government.,14
51,Mr WATKINS,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,Has the Prime Minister received from the Invalid and Old-age Pensioners Association a request that he shall meet representatives of the association to discuss the restoration of their pensions to the former level of f l a week?,14
52,Mr LYONS,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,"I am not aware of any invitation, but perhaps it has been overlooked by .me. I shall make inquiries into the matter. I may add that I shall be only too glad to receive such a deputashall tion at a suitable time. OVERDRAFT RATES.",15
53,Mr CASEY,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,"Yesterday , the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) inquired regarding certain press reports dealing with the rates charged for advances by the trading banks. I have made inquiries, and find that no official statement has been made by the associated banks on this subject. I do not know the origin of the statement to which the honourable member referred, nor can I vouch for its truth. NORTHERN TERRITORY. SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION FOK ""WHITE CHILDKEN.",15
54,Mr COLLINS,FARMERS DEBT ADJUSTMENT,"Can the Minister the Interior state whether provision been made for separate accommodation in schools for white children at Darwin and other towns in the north, or are they still compelled to share the same classthat rooms with coloured children?  modation has been provided at Pine Creek, but I do not know what the posisider tion is elsewhere.

57,Mr CLARK,POST OFFICE AT SOUTH,"In view of the inconIsland venience caused to country telephone scribers by the fact that telephone direcordinance tories supplied to them are published only once a year, will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General consider the suggestion that country directories be published twice a year as is done in the cities ?",15

59,Mr MARTENS,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"I ask if it is a fact that the Commonwealth Bank is desirous of obtaining, for the purposes of erecting a banking premises, a portion of a property in Brisbane controlled by the Postal Department and that the Postal Department is holding the matter up and whether the Postmaster-General will go into the matter with a view to settling the trouble thus enabling the erection of the proposed new bank building to be proceeded with?",15
60,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,I for shall be glad to have inquiries made has respecting the matter raised. OIL TANKS AT DARWIN.,15
61,Mr BLAIN,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"In view of the fact the oil storage tanks at Darwin are on the surface and aerial photographs been taken which are on sale in the town, will the Minister for Defence conthe advisability of decentralizing oil storage by having future tanks constructed 30 miles westward at Bynoe Harbour, which has been favourably reported on as a site for oil tanks?",15

63,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,I ask the Minister conrepresenting the Minister for External Affairs when he anticipates that the Government will take action radically to. alter the newspaper ordinance at Norfolk as was promised some time ago? subIs the Minister aware that the existing was responsible for closing down the only newspaper at Norfolk Island and that the advisory council of Norfolk Island unanimously agreed to ask the Minister to amend it?,15
64,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"My information is not complete on the matter but, such as it is, it shows that there is a great deal more behind the matter than might be inferred from the honourable gentleman's question. However, I shall get in touch with the Minister for External Affairs and see what can be done in the direction of amending the ordinance. POST OEFICE AT MORTDALE.",16
65,Mr LANE,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-<General endeavour to have placed on next year's Estimates sufficient money to build a new post office on land already owned by the Commonwealth Government at Mortdale?,16

67,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"In the preparation of the budget, will a review be made of the estimates of costs prepared by the Royal Commission on National Insurance 1928 and by the Royal Commission on Family Endowment somewhere about the same time of the two schemes? The various recommendations contained in those two reports should be reviewed so that we may have within our knowledge some approximate idea of what any schemes similar to those then proposed would cost. Mr LYONiS - I shall be glad to endeavour to obtain the information sought by the honourable gentleman. MEMBERS' DINING-ROOM.",16
68,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"Mr Speaker, in view of the fact that the House Committee or officers of the House Committee refused certain officers of the departments to partake of lunch in a room set aside for - parliamentary officers and the Press, and in view of your endorsement of that last week, when the matter was raised by the honourable member for Lang (Mr. Mulcahy), will you explain why last .""night Captain Bracegirdle was taken into the members' dining-room and partook of supper with yourself and ministerial members ?",16
69,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"Hon. G. J . Bell) The matter referred to was inquired into by myself last night immediately after supper because my attention had been directed to it. The official mentioned by the honourable gentleman is the Military Secretary to the Governor General. I noticed his presence but he was not having supper with me. When I inquired as to which honourable member had invited him, I was told that the honourable member understood that Captain Bracegirdle had the permission of the President of the Senate to use the refreshment rooms.",16
70,Mr THORBY,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,He was here on official business with myself.,16
71,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"The question of the gentleman being on official duty does not influence the case. The members' diningroom is set apart for honourable members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, for members of the State Parliaments, and for former members of the Commonwealth Parliament. I shall consult the President of the Senate upon the matter aud the objection made by the honourable member for Hunter. I think, however, honourable members will agree that the President of the Senate and the Speaker should have discretionary powers to give permission to any one on special occasions, if they think that it should be granted. MATERNITY ALLOWANCES.",16
72,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the Government finds itself in the position of having a considerable surplus, it is intended, in the preparation of the next budget, to make provision for the restoration of maternity allowances to their former level ?",16
73,Mr LYONS,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"I can only reply, as I did to an earlier question asked by the honourable gentleman, that this matter also will be taken into serious consideration in the presentation of the budget. SHORTER WORKING WEEK.",16
74,Mr LYONS,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [11.S] - by leave-Subsequen t to the debate in this House in regard to the question of the desirability of the introduction .nto Australia of reduced working hours, and to the decision of the Government not to proceed in the absence of representatives of labour with the convening of the proposedconference, the matter has received the fullest consideration of the Government. The subject is regarded as of such importance that some method alternative to the proposed conference must be adopted to enable the whole question to be fully considered. A consultation has been held with His Honour Chief Judge Dethridge, Chief .Fudge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as to the best method of having the matter investigated from the point of view of all interests concerned, and the conclusion has been reached that, if a plaint were filed in the Arbitration Court in which the claim, or one of the claims, was for a shorter working week, the whole question of the effect on Australian industry of the introduction of a shorter working week could be fully investigated. In the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, provision is made for the full consideration by the court of any question of standard hours in industry where that question is the subject of a plaint filed in the court. In such cases the act permits any person or organization or association of employers or employees to apply to the court for liberty to be heard, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. In order that, if any such hearing takes place, it should be thoroughly comprehensive, the Commonwealth Government would welcome the application to the court by all organiauthority zations interested. Such a plaint, it is realized, could filed only on the application by one or more organizations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. If such R plaint is filed, the Commonwealth Government will do everything in its power to facilitate the proceedings and the presentation to the court of all relevant evidence. It is necessary that the Full Court Bench of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitrat'on hear such a plaint. In the absence abroad of Mr Justice Beeby, Mr Lyons. who is at present on leave, the case could not be dealt with until towards the end of the year. I am assured, however, by Chief Judge Dethridge that the hearing should not occupy a greater period than six weeks.",16
75,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"Eremantle) [11.10] by leave-The statement which the right honourable gentleman has just made to the House does not in any way advance the situation beyond action which the unions had a right to take without that statement being made. The Government has not in the statement intimated the essential contribution which it could make towards the settlement of this question; that is, it has not said whether at the proceedings it will be represented and will intimate to the court that, as a matter of policy, the Government is in favour of a shorter working week.",17
76,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,Would that be proper?,17
77,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH BA NK AT,"Thos e who appear before the court are entitled to urge the court to grant the claims which they believe to be proper, and if the Government believes in a shorter working week it should bring before the court evidence justifying its belief. The unions, in this instance, will have the greater burden of the preparation of the case for a shorter working week. In view of the belief in the principle of a shorter working week, which has animated it from time to time, the Government should be prepared to assist the unions to compilerelevant evidence which would justify the court in reducing .standard hours. One further point-and I do not want to make this too controversial-is that I feel the Commonwealth Court of Conciliationand Arbitration has very limited with respect to the fixing of standard hours for industry in general.' be Before the court is asked to make a-, decision, this Parliament should, therefore, indicate what it believes to be rightprinciples to apply in connection with areduction of hours. I say this because this-. Parliament has been directly represented on what is practically an international parliament, by which a draft convention for a 40-hour week has beeu adopted. At the present moment Australia is. represented on a conference, the purpose of which is to decide whether or not draft conventions applying the shorter workingweek to specific industries should be made. The Government is responsible in this matter to. a far greater extent than' merely facilitating the hearing of the case in the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. As a matter of actual fact, the Government cannot resist the court hearing such a claim, and the course it has taken today, while it has the virtue of keeping the issue alive, does not in any way identify the Government in Australia with the principle with which it desired to be identified internationally. NA RESEARCH BILL 1936. Message reported recommending appropriation. In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message). Motion (by Mr THORBY) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for on act to make provision for improving the quality and increasing the production and use of wool. Resolution reported and-by leave adopted. SECOND READING.",17
78,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Calare-Actin g Minister for Commerce) [11.18] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. As this bill will be followed by two other measures which will fix the amount of the proposed tax and provide for the irssessment and collection of it, I ask leave to discuss the three measures together.",18
79,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Hon. G. J. Bell) As this bill is one of three cognate measures, it will be permissible for honourable members to debate all three on the Minister's motion.",18
80,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"This bill provides for the establishment of an Australian Wool Board which will control wool publicity and research in Australia and overseas. It will consist of six members nominated by the Australian Wool growers Council and one representative of the Commonwealth Government, and will be financed by a levy on all wool shorn in Australia after the 1st June, 1936. It has been suggested that the proposed date be amended 1 to the 1st July, 1936, which is the beginning of the financial year. It is unnecessary for me to emphasize the importance of the wool industry in Australia or the need to give wool growers the power provided in this bill to raise funds for a world-wide publicity campaign; to finance further scientific research to discover new uses for wool and improved methods of manufacture, to improve the quality of the wool grown in Australia. With more than 110,000,000 sheep in Australia the sheep-breeders provide in excess of half of Australia's exports, in point of value, and although we produce the bulk of the fine wool of the world, considerable improvement may still be effected in the quality of our clip. It is also possible to increase considerably the carrying capacity of many of our pastures. In addition, many of the millions of sheep lost annually through drought and disease could be saved if proper control methods were thoroughly understood and applied by the stock-owners. It is impossible to forecast what the scientists may be able to discover in the future by research activities, and it would be difficult to indicate what benefits may accrue to the wool industry from a carefully planned world-wide publicity scheme. While I was abroad last year with the Prime Minister's delegation, I was privileged to represent Australia at the International Wool Conference held in Berlin in June, 1935, and I had an opportunity to secure first-hand information respecting the development of the artificial fibre industry of Germany and to meet representatives of all the important wool manufacturing firms of Europe and the United Kingdom. Subsequently, I paid a visit to the Wool Research Station at Torridon, near Leeds in England, and the Woollen Textile Technical College at Bradford, and I had the opportunity to see and appreciate the valuable research work of the scientific officers at both centres. I was amazed to find that no satisfactory arrangements had been made to provide the necessary finance to enable the Torridon Research Station to continue its investigations for any length of time. Upon my return to London the High Commissioner for Australia, Mr Bruce, called a 'conference of representatives of the British wool manufacturing interests, the New Zealand and South African Governments, and the expert officers attached to Australia House, at which many problems confronting the wool industry of the British Empire were fully discussed. The South African representatives pointed out that they already had a fund derived from a levy on wool which had been in operation for some years, and that they were prepared to cooperate with Australia and New Zealand in an extensive wool publicity campaign, and to contribute to a fund to place the research work on a permanent and satisfactory footing. The New Zealand representatives indicated that they would be prepared to recommend to the Dominion Government the necessity for similar action, and we agreed, on behalf of Australia, to urge the Australian wool growers to agree to a levy to obtain the necessary funds to undertake the kind of work indicated in this bill. A strong committee, representative of the wool interests, was formed in England, first to secure the co-operation of the growers and, secondly, to urge the dominions to adopt an Empire-wide publicity plan to combat the ill-effects being suffered woollen industry through the development of artificial fibres in various parts of the world which were gradually robbing the wool-growers of part of their world market. I have in mind not only the artificial fibre being manufactured in Germany under the name of Vistra, but also many other fibres which are coming on the market and competing with our wool. Lord Barnby had several interviews with us in London oh this subject and subsequently visited New Zealand and Australia to urge the necessity for further publicity and research. Later the matter was taken up by the various graziers' associations of the Commonwealth. The scheme was strongly supported by Mr R. Wilson, a visitor from overseas, who, under the auspices of the Australian Wool growers Council, and accompanied by its President, Mr Dalziel Kelly, addressed meetings throughout the Commonwealth, with the result that the proposals now before the House obtained almost unanimous support. The Australian Wool growers Council is a thoroughly representative body, consisting of delegates from the great Mr Thorby. majority of the wool growers' organizations throughout the Commonwealth. Among the organizations represented on it are the following:The Pastoralists: Association of Western Australia; The Primary Producers Association of Western Australia; The Stockowners Association of South Australia; The United Graziers Association of Queensland; The Graziers Association of Victoria; The Victorian Country Party which absorbed the Victorian Farmers' Union; The Victorian Chamber of Agriculture; The Tasmanian Farmers Stockowners and Orchardists Association; The Graziers Association of Southern Riverina; The Pastoralists Association of the West Darling of New South Wales; The Graziers Association of New South Wales; The Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales. by the The last two mentioned associations represent the Primary Producers Central. Council of New South Wales, which is an organization representative of all the sheep-breeders' associations. Any organization associated with the wool-growing industry not already represented on the council, may obtain representation by merely applying for it.",18
81,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,But it does not follow that it would get direct representation on the wool board itself.,19
82,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Once an already organized or a newly organized association affiliates with the Australian Wool growers Council, it will have representation on the board, for six direct nominees of the council will sit on the board. Obviously it will not be possible for one person from every separate organization affiliated with the council to be a member of the board.",19
83,Mr SCULLIN,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,What are the conditions of affiliation with the council?,19
84,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"The body concerned must represent stock-owners in some way. The graziers' associations alone represent considerably more than 55,000,000 sheep, which is in excess of half the sheep of the Commonwealth.",19
85,Mr CLARK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,Is the Minister referring to stock or only sheep? ,20
86,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Onl y sheep. It is proposed to provide for a maximum levy of od. a hale, 3d. a hutt, and Id . a hag. These will be the maximum amounts in each case. It is estimated that the levy will yield between £60,000 and £80,000 a year, according to the clip. The average will probably be £70,000 a year, but the exact amount will be subject to seasonal and price conditions. The levy will be collected through the wool-brokers' and - dealers' organizations by deductions from the wool growers' returns, which will avoid the necessity for the wool-growers individually to furnish returns or pay tax. I emphasize that only a limited number of persons will be required to - furnish returns in connection with this tax. Definitely, the wool-growers themselves will not be burdened with the necessity to furnish returns or pay the tax as individuals. This will be done through the wool-brokers, dealers or banks, as I have indicated. I emphasize that while the three bills relating to this proposal will create a statutory board with power to receive the levy from the Commissioner for Taxation, they will in no way cause Government control or interference with the wool industry. Six of the seven members of the board will be direct representatives of the wool-growers' own organizations, and they will completely control the work to be carried out in the interests of their own industry in close co-operation with the wool-growers of New Zealand and South Africa and all the wool interests of the United Kingdom. Later, the board will, in all probability, extend its activities and influence beyond the Empire, widening existing markets and seeking new avenues and uses for our wool. Honourable members must surely agree that the passage of this legislation give the wool-growers of Australia power to establish an organization with suffithis cient funds to confer untold benefits our greatest primary industry, and this, in turn, will react to the advantage of sections of the community. It should be remembered that the Ausauthorize tralian wool-growers are almost the only large section of exporters who have not asked the Government for any form of bounty or financial assistance to enable them to maintain their exports, and in this instance they are merely asking the Commonwealth Government to provide them with the statutory powers to raise the necessary funds to help themselves to further organize and improve their industry. I do not desire to go into unnecessary detail in connection with these measures, but the scheme that is being implemented is very necessary in the best interests not only of the wool industry itself but also of the Commonwealth. Realizing the vast amount of wealth derived in Australia the from the sale of wool and the dependence of the country on the absorption by the overseas market of our surplus wool clip, the Government feels that everything possible should be done to promote scientific research into the industry. Research workers will undoubtedly plan operations for years ahead when they know that sufficient funds will be forthcoming to give continuity of operations. The assessment bill which will follow this one is merely a machinery measure. I intend to move several amendments to this measure at the committee stage. One amendment will provide for the deletion of the words "" the quality "" from the title of the bill. Another will provide that after the fourth year of the operation of the scheme the Minister for Commerce may, on the presentation of a petition, authorize the taking of a ballot of wool-growers of the Commonwealth to determine whether the Wool Board shall continue in operation after the end of the fifth year.",20
87,Mr CLARK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,Why not give the growers that privilege before the scheme is put into operation?,20
88,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Because , in the first place, I am satisfied that the request is will almost unanimously supported by the wool-growers of Australia. In addition, measure is in the interests of every upon wool grower as well as in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. In all the circumstances, we are justified in passing the bill without taking a poll to the inauguration of the scheme. Such a poll would cause great delay; it would require the creation of a complete set of special electoral throughout Australia. At a low estimate, it would cost £10,000 or £12,000 for the compilation of the rolls alone. In all, about a year's revenue-£70,000 would be absorbed. Eolls would have to be compiled showing every wool-grower in Australia. There would have to be a postal ballot, and the rolls would have to be exhibited throughout the Commonwealth for a certain period. would then have to be revised, and the necessary machinery would have to be provided to enable objections to be lodged. Review courts have to be established to consider objections, and to enable the names of growers who had not been enrolled to be included. We should lose the benefit of the proposed organization for at least a year. No poll was taken as to whether the Australian Meat Board should be established, yet the meat producers have raised no protest against the constitution of that body.",20
89,Mr RIORDAN,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,They have had no chance.,21
90,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"They had every opportunity to do so. That board has statutory powers, and collects levies. In a number of other instances, no preliminary ballot was taken. I propose to submit an amendment to give the wool growers of Australia an opportunity, by presenting a petition supported by the necessary number of growers, and representing the necessary number of sheep, to demand a poll to be taken throughout the Commonwealth during the first five years of the operation of the scheme; and, if the growers so desire, they can terminate the scheme within five years. Although provision will be made for the collection of a certain levy, a maximum amount only is specified in the bill. Until the Wool Board has been established, its recommendations have been received, and the regulations scribing the amount of the levy have been gazetted - no money collected. It will be in the power of the wool growers' own representative on the hoard to make recommendations to the Minister to reduce the levy to any figure desired, or to eliminate it entirely. machinery Mr LANE - This body will represent 9,000 growers, but 40,000 will have no opportunity to say whether they agree to it or not.",21
91,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,That statement is entirely inaccurate.,21
92,Mr LANE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,The small growers will not be represented.,21
93,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Yes , they will . They Mr LANE - It is necessary to check up all the Minister's statements in regard to both wool and wheat.",21
94,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"In reply to that would impudent interjection, all I have to say is that any observations by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) are more likely to mislead those who read - my speech than assist them to understand it . The matter will be entirely in the hands of the Wool Board, which can reduce or eliminate the levy at any time. It w i ll not be necessary for it to wait five years, so long as the levy does not exceed the maximum amount mentioned in the bill.",21
95,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Capricornia) [11.38] I move That all the words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:- "" the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for a ballot of all Australian wool-growers as to whether they favour the proposed levy on wool, and the proposed method of administration of the fund."" I do not wish it to be considered that the Opposition is hostile to any organization calculated to benefit such an i m portant industry as the wool industry of Australia; but I hope to be able to show that there is a very substantial number of growers who are opposed to this measure being put into operation, if they are to be deprived of an opportunity to express their view upon it . The Minister in charge of the bill (Mr Thorby) said that the Australian meat growers had not protested against the establishment of the Australian Meat Board. He endeavoured to lead honourable members to believe that he was anxious to provide prein legislation of this kind for the taking of a ballot of the producers in the in w i ll be dustry. I refer him to the D a i r y Produce Export Control Act 1924, section 2 of which readsProvided that a proclamation under this section shall not issue unless' and until, at a poll of producers taken in the prescribed manner throughout the Commonwealth, a majority of votes have been given in favour of the act being brought into operation. Section 4 of the D a i r y Produce E x p o r t C o n t r o l Act 1935 shows h ow the members of the b o a rd appointed under measure are to be elected. I d r a w attent i o n to the following paragraph s of that section:(c) two representatives elected by the owners of proprietary butter and cheese factories and privately-owned butter and cheese factories; (e) one representative of each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, elected by the producers in each of those States; and (/) one representative of the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania elected by the producers of those States. I could give further instances in which primary producers have beeu given an opportunity to cast a vote as to whether they favour a levy of the kind contemplated under this bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) has received the following telegram from Mr W. G. Mott of the Quilpie branch of the Selectors Association of Queensland:We emphatically protest against legislation in its present form to collect wool levy. Suggest you move amendment to take postal ballot of all Australian wool growers on levy nni'l administration thereof. This should fail in with the views expressed by primary producers' association in your own State.",21
96,Mr MCBRIDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,How many members has that association?,22
97,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"It has more than the Pastoralists Association in South tralia. The Selectors Association Queensland telegraphed follows:On behalf of grazing selectors, Queensland, we,. beg to protest strongly against seinisectional wool levy without taking postal ballot of Australian wool growers. Letter following. N u m e r o us graziers have been w r it in g o n this subject to the d a i l y press in the c a p it a l cities. Mr John G r ill s , w r i from Moree, has c o n t r i but e d the following letter to the S y d n e y Herald:Sir,-In the Sydney Morning Herald today, the statement is made that legislation is to be introduced into the Federal Parliament covering a levy for sales tax on every bale of wool for the purpose of publicity and research. As a wnnl-growcr of this State. I would advise the Federal Government to delay action in this matter. The request for legislation has been made by the Graziers Association, but that body cannot speak for the majority of sheep-owners, as its membership does not represent half the number of sheep-owners in. that New South Wales. Many individual members of the Graziers Association, as well as non-members, arc opposed to the levy. In justice to the opinions of those men, a referendum should be taken to definitely settle whether the majority of sheep-owners are in favour of the proposed campaign. My experience, by conversation with many men interested, is that they are opposed to the proposal. No substantial evidence has yet been produced that wool consumption is decreasing. The evidence available is rather to the contrary. Mr A. S. Wheatley, of Ootha, wrote as follows: The proposal certainly requires somewhat more examination than was given to it at the Graziers Association Conference, where discussion was limited by the standing orders. In the first place, as the Graziers Association does not represent by any means all the wool growers of the State, the Government can scarcely assume that a vote by an association properly represents the views of the wool growers in such an important matter as the imposition of a levy of this character. The Selectors Association of Queensland,. in a letter dated the l l t h May, dealing with pastoral research, saidWit h reference to the application of portion of the levy to .scientific research, we feel that this may not bo objected to if the fund were placed directly within the control of those who will be asked to contribute. We think that pastoral research should be conducted in each State under a State authority, preferably the Minister for Agriculture of each State. AusI have received a communication from of the General Secretary of the United to me as Graziers Association of Queensland, dated the 8th May, which reads as followsThere is one phase of the proposal which I wish to bring before your attention, that is, that so far as we are concerned, we are adamant that whatever is done by the Federal Government in providing legislation for the collection of this levy, the control of the fund must be in the hands of the growers themselves; otherwise we would be opposed to t in g legislative action if it is to be taken out of the control of those who are providing the funds. Morning F e a r is expressed by the wool growers of Australia that persons m a y be selected to serve on the W o o l B o a r d w ho m a y represent the interests of the b i g concerns, and that the smaller wool growers m a y not be given adequate representation. It is feared by the small wool growers that the directors of big companies such as Mooreheads Limited, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Limited, and Dalgety's, or large pastoralists whose interests are interwoven with those of such companies, may be appointed to the board.",22
98,Mr NOCK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"They are not members of the ""Wool Council.",23
99,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"That is so, but there is nothing in the bill to prevent the inclusion of certain wool-growers who would be the nominees of those big interests. The small producers contend that there is a vast difference between the farmer who conducts his own business on the land as a family asset, and the man who invests money in the pastoral industry whose main concern is the profits which he can derive from that investment. Why should Pitt-street, Sydney, have greater representation on the board than wool-growers? I ask that the bill be withdrawn until such time as a poll of the wool-growers has been taken to ascertain their wishes, as was done in the case of the dairy-farmers before the Dairy Export Control Board was appointed.",23
100,Mr THOBBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,This is not an export fund. control board.,23
101,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Nevertheless , I consider that the same opportunity to express their views should be extended to growers as was given to dairy-farmers under other legislation. What reason can the Government advance. for its refusal to consider the request of the small selectors that no action be taken to appoint the board until a poll of woolover growers has been held? The Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) has admitted that he is willing to agree spending and taxation buoyancy. to the taking of a poll, after this legisladoubt tion has been in operation for four years; but why should the taking of the poll be delayed? What is the reason for this undue haste to place this legislation on the statute-book? This Government has been in officefor nearly five years, now in the dying hours of this session it asks honourable members to agree to the speedy passage of this bill on the ground that it is extremely urgent and must put into operation at once. The opposibought tion of the Queensland Selectors AssoI ciation to this bill is, briefly, that grazing selectors of Queensland object the collection of a levy until all wool producers have had an opportunity to vote on the matter, and they consider that the fund should be placed under grower control. The Labour party is not at all unfriendly to the wool growers of Australia; on the contrary it is, and always has been, most sympathetic with them. We realise that the primary and exporting industries are the very basis of Australia's existence, and that the wool industry is the chief export industry. With the trade balance constantly drifting to the bad, we realise the necessity for encouraging our export industries so that credits overseas may be built up to meet our heavy commitments for interest, and to pay for necessary imports. Our wool exports comprise about 40 per cent, of the total exports from Australia, and anything that will tend towards popularizing the use of wool will be of immense advantage to Australia. We agree with the majority of the wool growers, particularly the smaller growers, that, before they are subjected to this levy, they should have some say as to whether they approve of it, and of the proposed method of administration of the There is, I think, an unduly optimistic view as to the benefits that woolmay accrue from the proposed advertising campaign. Australia's wool cheque for last season amounted to £52,000,000. The average price was 14d. per lb., or £17 10s. a bale, which represented an increase of 4d. per lb., or £4 17s. a bale the figures for the previous season. This additional money has brought about increased employment, increased No this Government claims credit for these increased prices, and the increased buoyancy of the revenue, but we know that they are due, not to the Government's legislation or administration, but rather to world conditions. All wool produced and last year was saleable, not only at a good price, but also in the right quarters. Britain was our best customer, and took over 1,000,000 bales of wool and 6,000,000 be carcasses of mutton and lamb. Japan over 600,000 bales of wool, and believe the time will come when it will the increase its purchases to over 1,000,000 to bales. The lines of wool purchased by the Japanese manufacturers are the staple of Australia's world trade, for which there is strong competition; and tlieir operations in the Australian market have a substantial effect upon prices. Every now and then free trade interests in this country dangle the spectre of artificial fibres before the graziers, as it threatened their existence; as a matter of fact it does nothing of the kind. Australia's wool production is 50 per cent, higher-than before the war. That is something of which we may be justifiably proud. In the last pre-war year the average price of wool was 4£d. per lb. less than in the season which has just closed, and the total value of our exports in that year was only £26,277,000. Local purchases in that year were very small. Rayon and other artificial fibres were then practically unheard of. The production of artificial fibres on a large scale did not commence until 1924-25, and the output increased every season. Nevertheless, Australia is selling 1,000,000 bales of wool more today than in 1924-25. The fact that Japan's rayon output increased by nearly 50 per cent, last year did not prevent Japan from buying more wool. The expansion of the use of western clothing in that country has increased to such an extent that, at the present time, eight out of every ten Japanese wear western attire. Japanese manufacturers buy our woo! because it suits their purpose, and we appreciate their patronage. Our own Australian wool manufacturing and treating industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and the purchases by the local factories liave a considerable effect in bringing about an increase of the pr'ie of wool. During last season the mills in the Commonwealth were the best buyers of fair to good length spinning wools, their purchases amounting to over 300,000 bales. Notwithstanding the facts which I have set out, the Australian ""Wool Council has become panicky with the result that the Government has decided to indulge in an expensive adventising campaign costing £100,000 per annum for five years at the expense of the wool-grower. This campaign has the approval of the British manufacturers who will gain an indirect benefit from it. The money is to be expended in advertising in. various ways. The advertising campaign will be conducted per medium of the newspapers, posters,, films, and exhibitions in an effort to make people wool-minded. A representative of British manufacturers told the graziers if recently that the industry refused to be beaten hy the chemists, and pleaded with his hearers to make the wool campaign, a reality. There is, however, much work that could with greater profit be done within Australia. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is starved for funds. During 1934-35, out of a total Commonwealth revenue of £76,000,000 only £94,915 was spent on scientific and industrial research. The Government should be more generousin that respect. Research is necessary to prevent the extension of the ravages of blowflies, and to inquire into the diminishing of bore water supplies and the preventing of soil erosion. Immense losses of sheep and wool, which are surely preventable, are sorry features of every drought. I hope the board to be constituted under this bill will give consideration to these suggestions. In asking that a poll be taken, I am merely asking for a privilege which was granted to the dairy-farmersof Australia when legislation was. introduced to benefit them, not after a precipitated campaign hut, as the Minister has stated, as the result of concerted action extending over a period of ten years. Before that legislation wasbrought into operation, they were given the opportunity to say whether they were, in favour of it or opposed to it.",23
102,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,That was because control was taken of the marketing of their butter.,24
103,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"The wool-growers are to be asked to pay a levy, and to support a board in the election of which, according to a big section of them, they will have no voice. They say that they should not be subjected to taxation without having representation. If the Minister will agree to the taking of a ballot, not after four years, but immediately, the Opposition will allow the measure to pass on the voices.",24
104,Mr FISKEN,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Ballarat) [12.1] - Wit h a certain amount, but only a very little, of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) has said, 1 can agree. The purport of this measure is the institution of a wool board, which will administer a fund for advertising purposes, biological research, and research into the manufacturing side of the industry. I am particularly pleased that its introduction affords an opportunity to discuss, in this national Parliament, Australia's greatest national industry. I was glad to hear from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he realizes that the prosperity of Australia depends very largely upon the prosperity of the Australian wool industry. ""Wool hat. been the foundation of the prosperity ol many nations, almost since the dawn of history. The progress of Great Britain itself in the middle ages was associated with wool. In the past, the governments of other countries have done all that they could to popularize the use of wool and to promote the advancement of the industry. In the middle ages, burial in a shroud of wool was compulsory in Great Britain. Until the beginning of this century, Australia was almost entirely dependent upon wool for its prosperity, and even since then it has exercised a mendous influence upon our financial stability. It is an amazing fact that during the last 35 years the sale of wool has brought into Australia the enormous sum of over £1,400,000,000, an amount greater than the whole of the national debt. That this House should do everything in its power to assist this industry, which is of such vital importance to the nation, is therefore evident. Within the last few days the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has expressed the opinion that borrowing has had a great deal to do with the increase of prosperity during the last few years. I maintain that the wool industry has had a much greater effect. More widespread biological research seems essential. In spite of the enormous increase of the area devoted to dairying, wheat-growing and fat lamb production during the last few years, the Australian wool clip has increased remarkably, even though it has been grown on an area considerably less than was formerly utilized. That means that a larger number of sheep to the acre has been carried. As a matter of fact, due to the skill of our Mr Fisken. stud masters, Australian sheep have given a bigger clip to each unit. But additional problems have arisen for solution. A strain has been imposed upon our pastures and upon the constitution of our sheep, which have developed in more marked degree diseases which are making the existence of the graziers more difficult than it was a few years ago. I speak with particular knowledge of the State of Victoria. The number of parasites, particularly worms, among stock, makes well nigh impossible the rearing of sheep on certain of the. areas of that State. There is also the problem of fluke, and the disease which ensuesblack disease. The disease, foot-rot, also has developed very considerably, brought about to a certain extent by additional top dressing and better pastures. We have always had with us, of course, the blow-fly pest, one of the worse with which the industry has had to contend. The State Departments of Agriculture are most efficient, and to the best of their ability assist the stock producers to cope with their problems. I was rather disappointed at the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that some of trehis advisers in this matter had suggested to him that the departments of the States could best administer any research fund. If he will give further consideration to the matter I believe he will come to the conclusion that that would be a wrong principle to adopt.",24
105,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,I quoted the opinions of representative associations to illustrate the diversity of the views that are held.,25
106,Mr EISKEN,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"There would be divided effort, and money would be spent by the different governments in an attack uuon the same problem. That would be a waste of both money and effort. Concentration under one central administration would be very much better both for Australia and for the industry. I am quite prepared to admit that problems may arise in one State which are not encountered in another. I maintain, however, that there should be a central coordinating authority. The trouble is, that the State departments are starved for funds and have not sufficiently large staffs to enable officers to visit and advise producers who need their assistance. Upon more than one occasion sheep have died from a certain disease in my district, and the producer has endeavoured to have animals examined before death, but has failed to do so, and, consequently, has not been able to obtain necessary advice. A central co-ordinating authority would enable us to do on a large scale what is now done in Victoria on a small scale. In that State, an officer is subsidized by the Pastoral Research Trust. If action along these lines were taken, the industry would be able to cope with its veterinary troubles much more easily. I am prepared to admit that, in Australian currency, wool prices are now good. After the return to Australia last year of the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) and the Minister directing negotiations for Trade Treaties (Sir Henry Gullett), these gentlemen said in this House, in reply to questions, that in their opinion artificial fibres did not constitute a very grave danger to the Australian wool clip. Those who, because of the nature of their work over a number of years, have come into close contact with the industry, disagree with them, and rightly maintain that artificial substitutes are a very grave danger to wool. The production of substitutes has increased enormously during the last few years. It must be obvious that, if they were not used, there would be a better market for the natural product. In 1922 the manufacture of artificial fibres totalled 78,000,000 lb. In 1934 that figure had increased to 795,000,000 lb., and last year it amounted to 943,000,000 lb. That must have a marked effect on the use and, consequently, on the price, of wool. So worried have been the graziers of Australia, that the Federal Graziers Council invited a representative of the British wool manufacturers to visit Australia to inform the wool-growers generally of the steps he considered necessary to counter this growth of the manufacture of artificial fibres, and also enormous advertising campaign of the manufacturers of the fibres. Mr Wilson, who was sent in response to that invitation, is the representative of a manufacturing firm in Scotland, which has a tremendous connection throughout the world in woollen manufactures. 170] In an address to graziers, Mr Wilson said that summer sales of woollen underwear in Scotland had practically disappeared. In Leicester, he said, the manufacturers at one time had manufactured 90 per cent, of woollen goods, but were now producing 90 per cent, of their goods from anything but wool. Mr Wilson had the greatest trouble in getting the National Hosiery Association to endorse his coming to Australia, so little interested in wool was it. He pointed out that in the summer months in the biggest stores in London, women's underwear departments, so far as wool was concerned, did not exist. Any woollen underwear in the store was sold in another department. Underwear for summer use is made from artificial fibres. Mr Wilson declares that the British public is no longer as wool-minded as it used to be, hut I thiuk that is only natural when one considers that artificial fibres are being manufactured on such an enormous scale. In Mr Wilson's own district, Hawick, in Scotland, in recent years, woollen underwear shops have had to be shut. The manufacturers fortunately have been able to exist by the making of woollen pullovers and outer gar merits. Mr Wilson pointed out, however, that, on the vessel on which he came to Australia, most of the women wore outer garments made from artificial fibres. He. says that we have to fight these substitutes from the point of view of health. It is most important that his advice should be followed. Artificial fibre manufacturers have concentrated on a very intense advertising campaign, and not only have they advertised the claims of their own goods, but also they have attacked wool. 1 do not propose to be an advertiser myself for these fibres by reading out all the things that the manufacturers say, but it is necessary for me to cite one or two examples. Regarding linen mesh underwear, the artificial wool manufacturers say, "" This is a vegetable product the- made from a clean, sweet flax "". Regarding woollen underwear, they say, "" This is. a product of animals very susceptible to diseases-tuberculosis , rheumatism, &c"". That sort of advertising would possibly appeal to ignorant people, but not to members of this House. It is inconceivable that tuberculosis and rheumatism could be transferred from a sheep to its wool, yet that is the type of advertising we have to put up with. Mr Wilson points out that, in America, an advertising campaign in favour of wool was carried out, and that, as the result, the use of wool was increased in that country in one year by more than 20 per cent. Advertising and biological research are necessary, but it is all-essential to have research, made into the technical end of manufacture. It is necessary to make woollen articles more attractive in appearance and handling to compete with the artificial substitute. Some of the money which will be made available by this levy will undoubtedly be used for this purpose. As a wool-grower, and as a representative of wool-growers, I regret that it has been necessary to come to this Parliament for authority to carry out this scheme. The industry attempted, by voluntary means, to get finances to carry it on. We attempted years ago, through the Pastoral Research Trust, to get funds, and then, more recently, we attempted to induce the wool-selling brokers to collect a levy for us. Any grower could have objected that he did not want to pay it. I do not believe that auy grower would have been short-sighted enough to refuse, but, unfortunately, two brokers in Sydney refused to come in with their colleagues and help to collect this money. Therefore, it has been necessary for the industry to come to this House to ask for statutory authority to levy upon themselves. It is generally admitted, I think,, that the wool industry is the best organized primary industry in Australia. Its organization is the envy of every otlier wool-growing country. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), speaking in favour of a poll to be taken to show whether all the graziers were in favour of the levy, said that the organizations mentioned by the Minister as being represented on the Wool growers Council did not represent more than 55,000,000 sheep. I should like to correct him. I feel that his statement was either a clerical error or a slip of the tongue. The Graziers Association alone represents 55,000,000 .sheep, and the other organizations represented on the WoolMr Fisken. growers Council, added to the Graziers Association probably represent S5 per cent, or 90 per. cent, of all the sheep .in Australia. However, I believe that it would be a good thing for a poll to be taken in four years' time. It is essential that the scheme be enforced for at least five years, because it would bo impossible to tell in one, two or three years, wdiat the result would be. After fi ve. years, we should have some idea whether advertising or research is of benefit or not. I have shown the increase of the manufacture of artificial fibres, and I have tried to show the lack of interest in Great Britain in the sale of wool. The problem should be tackled ri.ow whileprices are good and not be delayed until prices recede. If there is some small opposition to this, what a trivial thing it is! The growers are asked to contribute one-seventh of 1 per cent, of the wool cheque, that is f l in every £700. If they are not prepared to do that to help themselves, this industry and Australia, I do not think they are very much consequence in Australia. In the interests of the industry and Australia generally, this levy should, be made before it is too late, as it will contribute to. the graziers' retaining prosperity for themselves and for Australia.",25
107,Mr NOCK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Riverina) [12.28] - I support this bill because it is necessary and equitable. Its object as has been pointed out is to provide' finances for publicity, technical research and biological research-publicit y to increase the popularity of wool, technical research to improve the treatment of wool, and biological research to improve the work already carried out in connection with the prevention and curing of disease. The care and health of sheep are important to Australia. It is expected that, the result of the expenditure of the money which this Government has heen asked to collect from the growers will bring advantages, not only to Australia in the increase of the wool cheque which will, with the velocity of money, circulate through the community, but also directly to the growers themselves. If every grower is to get the advantage of sustained demand for wool and increased prices, then it is equitable that every grower should contribute in a small way towards the cost of producing such results and the proposed levy is the simplest way to secure it. It was pointed out by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Fisken) that efforts have been made previously to obtain funds from the growers on a voluntary basis, when the Pastoral Research Trust was instituted and the graziers were asked to contribute 2s. a bale. The scheme resulted in the collection of less than £30,000, and there were thousands of graziers who would receive equal advantage from the work who did not contribute one penny. There were many very generous donations from brokers and other persons interested in the industry, but after a period of nine years, it is realized that it is futile to expect to be able to collect the finances necessary for tliese purposes on a voluntary basis. A request was made to the brokers that they should deduct from the sales returns of graziers a trifling amount on each bale sold to be contributed to this fund, but that also failed. graziers and the brokers are conservative, and they object to coming to the Government. Most of them were prepared to agree to the proposal, but two or three brokers stood, out. Consequently, as it would prejudice the business of those who proposed to collect the levy against those who did not, the whole scheme fell through. Since then we have had a visit to Australia hy Mr Wilson, the representative of British manufacturers, who are indirectly concerned with the position of the wool industry. It is all very well for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) to say that more wool is being used today than ever before. That is not correct; the fact is that the production of wool is at a stand-still. MR. FORMC - I have had made available to me an international publication which shows that Australia is increasing its production of wool.",27
108,Mr NOCK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Notwithstanding the statement of the honourable gentleman, I repeat that the world production of wool is declining. It must, therefore, follow that the use of wool is also declining for its use cannot exceed its production. The following figures showing the world production of wool are enlightening:Year. Lb. 1929 3,882,000,000 1930 3,790,000,000 1.031 .. 3,812,000,000 1932 .. .. 3,78.1,000,000 1933 .. .. 3.050,000,000 1.934-35 (not greater than 1933). And there has been a decrease in the current year. One result of this decline of production has been an increase of the price of wool. Although the world's population has increased there has not been a corresponding increased use of wool. These figures cannot be disputed. The decline in the use of wool is due to the enormous increase in the use of the wool substitutes which have been put on the market in recent years. Having realized the futility of the voluntary efforts that have been made to increase the use of wool, mainly because a few brokers have refused to co-operate in it, graziers are now see""king the co-operation of the Government to enable them to collect the levy and put into force a plan to achieve the The desired ends. They are prepared to tax themselves to provide the money necessary. The levy proposed will amount to only 6d. in every £17 worth of wool. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the position of small wool growers, but I point outto him that a man. who markets ten bales of wool a year will be required to contribute only 5s. annually by means of this levy. That is surely a trifling amount.",28
109,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,The rates which I mentioned are the maximum.,28
110,Mr NOCK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"That is so. I should also like to remind honourable gentlemen that the wool manufacturers of Great Britain regard the position so seriously that they too are prepared to co-operate in the scheme. Tlieir heavy overhead charges and huge capitalizations have made them realise that their decreased output makes it essential for them to do something to attempt to regain their business, so they have voluntarily agreed to co-operate with the graziers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and contribute on a £1 for £1 basis to an amount of £50,000 to implement this campaign of publicity and research. This shows their bona fides. There is a general recognition of the fact that if our wool industry is to he stabilized, the use of wool must be popularized. It would, of course, be quite inequitable for the South African graziers to have to bear the cost of a wide publicity campaign to popularize the use of wool, when a considerable proportion of the improved trade would inevitably come to Australia, but organizations have already been established in South Africa and New Zealand to assist in financing a scheme of kind, aud it is only reasonable that the graziers of Australia and those interested in the wool industry in Great Britain should co-operate in an Empire-wide campaign. Certain figures were submitted by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Fisken) to show that in mills in Leicester, where 90 per cent, of the goods handled were once woollen, only 10 per cent, of them now consist of wool. The National Federation of Hosiery Makers of Great Britain has converted many big plants to rayon, linen fibre and cotton production. A special inquiry made recently in the drapery departments of many London stores to ascertain the position in regard to woollens, showed summer woollen underwear simply did not exist. In fact, seven-eighths of the fixtures previously occupied by woollen fabrics now hold goods manufactured from synthetic fibres. The high price of wool which followed the war and also the subsequent depression of world trade had a serious effect on the wool industry. Woollen goods were expensive, and cotton and artificial silk products took their place. The people of Great Britain are now no longer woolrninded, and shop assistants know practically nothing of the history of wool and its virtues. There is no sentiment in business. Manufacturers will make the goods required by retailers, and retailers do not care two hoots what they sell as long as they make a ""rake-off"" or at least a satisfactory profit. They will supply the goods that the people want. It is vitally important, therefore, to the wool industry and to Australia that an education campaign shall be set on foot to recover the trade previously done in woollen goods. We must, if possible, recover Mr Nock, the ground that has been lo3t in the last ten years. - I have already referred to the excessive overhead costs of woollen manufacturers resulting from reduced output compared with the high amount of capital invested in their industries. I now propose to refer to the great strides that have been made during late years by the rayon and artificial silk manufacturing industries. Last years' production of wool rethis presented about 2,000,000,000 lb. of scoured wool. The output of rayon and artificial silk in 1922 was 7,800,000 lb., in 1934 it was 700,000,000 lb., and it is forecast that the output for 1936 will be 1,000,000,000.' When it is realized that the average weight of garments made of artificial silk and rayon is only half that of garments made of wool, it will be appreciated that the 1,000,000,000 lb. of rayon and artificial silk fabric will make the same number of garments as 2,000,000,000 lb. of scoured wool. The amazing demand for rayon and artificial silk has heen caused by widespread publicity and advertising campaigns. In the last five years, two firms alone have spent £336,441 in press that publicity. Undoubtedly advertising pays.",28
111,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,Has the honourable member any figures to indicate the aggregate quantity of cotton material sold ?,29
112,Mr NOCK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"I have not. What I have said reveals beyond question that while the production of wool has remained almost stationary, the production of rayon and substitutes for wool has increased enormously. Every extra £1 received from our wool as the result of the proposed campaign multiplies the purchasing power of the people of Australia, and every section of the community will reap the advantage if the output of wool or' its price can be increased. We must advertise the virtues of wool. We must tell the world to "" wear wool for warmth "". We must emphasize the elasticity and softness, the strength and durability of wool. We must advocate the use of wool, because it absorbs moisture, and reduces risks from burning. Every one who has seen a child dressed in a muslin frock, and another child dressed in a woollen garment playing near the fire must have realized that the child in the muslin frock is in much more danger from a flying spark than the child in the woollen dress. 'We must advocate the use of wool for long-term economy, and as the natural and ideal textile for human clothing. woollen manufacturers of Great Britain, as I have already said, have been thoroughly convinced of the need for the campaign now proposed, and have promised their £1 foi- £1 subsidy to an a mount of £50,000 for five years. The levy of Is. a bale being imposed in New Zealand and South Africa will allow them to contribute £15,000 annually, and it is expected that into the jointly controlled fund for use in Britain, Australia will put £35,000 a year. Some people may ask why the imposition of this levy is necessary, but we must be guided by experience. In the United States of America, the trade in summer wool suits gradually slipped until it fell to only 40 per cent, of the normal figure. An advertising campaign was set on foot throughout the United States of America and, in less than three years, the trade increased to 81 per cent, of the normal output.. One result has heen that American competition is again noticeable in the Australian wool market. This is what we want. The value of advertising has been demonstrated in connection with many other commodities, particularly in Great. Britain. Take gas as an example. In the eleven years before 1914, the average increased annual consumption of gas in the United Kingdom was 800,000,000 cubic feet. I do not suppose that it would be contended that one gas company could be expected to set out on an advertising campaign to increase the use of gas, but, in view of largely increased use of electricty, the gas companies of Great Britain cooperated in a. national advertising campaign to boost tlieir product. The result was that in the subsequent 21 years the average increased consumption of gas in the United Kingdom advanced by 5,967,000,000 cubic feet per annum. The cost of this advertising campaign worked out at. 2-Jd. for each extra 1,000 cubicfeet of gas sold- a huge increase of business at :i cost of less than 5 per cent. This-was a remarkable result to achieve in a period when the use of electricitywas advancing so rapidly. The advertising campaign inaugurated by the Fruit Federation in 1923 to increase the sale of fruit in Great. Britain The was also most successful. For six years, £30,000 a year was spent to advertise imported fruit, and in that period sales increased by £17,000,000. In the first year, the increase was £1,000,000; in the second and third year - s it was £3,000,000 a year, and in the sixyears the aggregate was £17,000,000. The cost of the campaign was £180,000, which represented about 1 per cent, of the increased sales.",29
113,Mr GARDEN,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,What about beer?,30
114,Mr NOCK,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Yes , I have the figures about heer.. The sales in Great Britain in ""1925 amounted to 20,863,000 barrels. The demand annually decreased, until, in 1932, the sales had dropped to 13,228,401 barrels. For seven years the average decrease was at the rate of 1,000,000 barrels a year; but, after an advertising campaign had been carried on for two years, the business recovered and the sales have since increased at the rate of over 1,000,000 barrels a year. Tea and telephones were also advertised to great advantage. The campaign was so effective in regard to telephones that the department was unable to cope with the demand for instruments, and, for a time, the advertising had. to be suspended. The proposal put before the House today provides also for research. In Great Britain technical research is being carried on at Torridon, and there is a Wool Industry Research Association at Leeds, which deals, not only with the improved methods of growing wool, but also with its weaving and manufacturing. the In the past, a prejudice against woollen garments has arisen, because of their susceptibility to shrinkage. We now find that a process has been perfected, whereby woollen garments can be made totally unshrinkable. This represents a big step forward, and will tend materially to popularize their use. Serious difficulties were formerly experienced in connection with the dyeing.of woollen cloth. It was not possible to print patterns on wool in such a way that they would last, hut that difficulty has now been overcome. Another trouble complained of is the tendency of woollen clothing to cause itching or tickling in the case of the wearer with a particularly sensitive skin. This aspect is being seriously studied, and, it is hoped, that a remedy will be discovered. Many people have suggested that all our wool should be scoured before it is sent abroad. Some say it would cost too much, but this is only part of the reason. Serious mistakes can be made in the treatment of wool through the scour, and, after it has been scoured in Australia and pressed into bales for shipment, it has been found liable to ing, which is a serious disadvantage for many manufacturing purposes. The Research Association is trying to solve these problems, and any improvements which increase the sale and demand for wool must react to the advantage of the Australian growers. These associations have and use both chemical and biological laboratories. The cause of unsatisfactory cloth has beeu traced to its being woven in too damp a condition, or to tlio use of machinery of the wrongtype. It is certain that many mistakes of this kind can be avoided by scientific research. - The honourable member for Ballarat also referred to the need for biological work in connection with the wool industry. The grasshopper and blowfly problems, and the foot-rot trouble, have not yet been solved-. Hoven, resulti ng . from putting sheep on frost-covered green oats, has caused serious losses, the cause of which owners are only now realizing and can avoid. Pulpy kidney in lambs, and worm and parasitic: troubles in sheep, are still demanding research. Much has been done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to find a remedy for these troubles, and finance has heen provided hy the Pastoral Research Trust; but more is needed, so that these problems may be solved as quickly as possible, and the continuous heavy losses avoided. A levy of Cd. a. hale, 6d. on every £17 worth of wool, is such a trifle, and so many associations representing a huge majority of the wool growers have appproved of it. that a preliminary ballot of the wool growers is quite unnecessary.and unjustified. - Another objection' to the ballot is its cost.' We object to wasting on ballots Mr Nock, money which could be used to.much better purpose. More than that, the matter is urgent., A ballot would delay things for twelve months. An offer of a subsidy of £1 for £1 has been made by the British manufacturers. Let us take it, and get on with the job. Why wait, and let staple fibre and artificial silks further supplant wool? Let us boost it, and increase .the demand. Wc can increase the supply. From the roof of this building can be seen thousands of acres, the sheep-carrying capacity of felt- which could be doubled by superphosphates, and the introduction of subterranean clover and other grasses. Between Canberra and Sydney are. to be seen millions of acres of scrub that has never felt the axe. That land could carry large numbers of sheep. There are thousands of miles of good rainfall-country along the Queensland coast awaiting improvement and stocking. Australia could, if the price warranted it, increase its wool clip by 50 per cent., bringing an extra £25,000,000 per annum into this country'from overseas. This sum, multiplied by five-by the velocity of money-would , mean an extra £125)000,000 of purchasing . powur annually permeating, the community. With this we could carry many more settlers, or have a higher living standard for the present population. The only objection which the Opposition has to this 'bill, is that it does not provide for a ballot before the schema comes into operation. I point out that the Wool Board will represent from 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of the growers, and SO per cent, of the sheep in Australia, and also that growers' representatives will control the expenditure of the money collected. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) - suggested that only 9,000 growers would be represented by the Wool Board, but. that is absurd. The members of the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales alone number 9,000. and there are S,000 members of the Graziers Association of New South Wains. The Farmers and Settlers-Association has agreedto the levy of 6d. They represent small growers, and there should be no objectionto the scheme being put into operation as goon as possible. The trifling levy, which; to many, will amount to but a few shillings a year, is not sufficient to justify opposition to the measure. Tho need for action and the prospective advantages are so great that I commend the - proposal to the House. Mr - PROWSE (Forrest) [12.55] - I supportthe bill, and oppose the amendment which has been submitted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Forde). Ordinarily, it would be advantageous and wise to take a ballot of the growers before imposing a levy upon them; but, as has been pointed out, the wool growers have expressed opinions, which show that immediate action is necessary, and, therefore, I fail to see any justification for a preliminary ballot, which would be a costly process. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition read a communication for the purpose of suggesting that the small growers in Western Australia had expressed similar views to those held in Queensland. The Primary Producers Association of Western Australia has expressed its approval of the scheme. [Quorum formed.'] should be no objection to this bill. The Government is not asked to provide the necessary funds. The wool growers of Australia seek legislative power to put a levy upon themselves. The scheme will be controlled by the growers, of whom 95 per oent. produce 50 per cent, of the wool and 5 per cent, grow the other half of it, but the representation on the Wool Board will be such that it will embrace both small and large growers. I have received the following telegram from theP r i m a r y Producers Association of Western Australia :Wool executive agreed tolevy for research publicity and collection statistics all mutters purtiiining advancement wool consumption and production. Also believe assurance should be obtained from all States for legislation abolition draft allowance. The Government, .! think, should take separate action to remove the draft allowance. All growers in Western Australia support the bill, and feel that they ought to have the right to control their own affairs, particularly as they will provide the money necessary to give effect to the scheme. Sibling suspended from 1 p.m. lo 1.45 p.m.. Debate (on motion by Mr. adjourned. TRADE DIVERSION.",30
115,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Henty-Min ister directing negotiations for ' trade treaties) [1.45] - by leave- I wish today to advise the House of certain important decisions which have been made by the Government, with the object of increasing our exports of primary produce, expanding secondary industry, and bringing about a considerable increase of rural and industrial employment. The 'Government proposes to proceed towards these desirable nation ill developments by a series of steps intended to bring about a diversion of carefully selected portions of oiir overseas trade. The effect of these diversions will be, in the first place, to widen and strengthen Australian secondary industries by halting some imports of commodities with a view to their manufacture in the Commonwealth. The chief of these commodities is the motor chassis, which we hope T-here will be manufactured in Australia on a large scale within a very few years. In the case of other imports, which we intend to divert from their present source of origin, we are aiming in future to draw our supplies from countries which are already great customers of ours, and which we may confidently expect will become greater customers if we increase our purchases from them. In this way we expect, substantially to increase our export trade, and so clear the way for increased production over a wide range of people employed in country industry. Thedecisions arrived at will mark the first, step of a considered trading policy to place our overseas financial affairs in a sound and enduring position. They will give great, impetus to engineering and to the iron and steel industries; they will make a significant indirect contribution to defence; and, by reducing unemployment, they will hasten the day when immigration can be resumed on a basis not harmful, but helpful, to every industry and worker in this country. Finally, they aim to maintain the Australian standard of living, and keep the way clear for its steady advancement. In view of these claims I need scarcely say CT-ABK) that, before arriving at its conclusions, the ' Government has given ' long and detailed consideration to the general condition of the Commonwealth, which, as we see .it, is both satisfactory and unsatistion factory. Compared with our position during the depth of the depression, and with the position in which most other countries still find themselves, we must consider ourselves in happy circumstances. In the mind of the Government, lion/ever, and, J. am sure, in the minds of all members of this House, and of the people of this country, we have still to make up a good deal of leeway before we shall find ourselves in a condition which we can contemplate with complete satisfaction. This is the third administration led by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). The aim of these three administrations has been, without ceasing"", to rehabilitate national finance, and to restore tolerable prosperity to primary and secondary industry, and by that means to bring employment back to normal. The achievement of that aim so far has been, by common consent, considerable. The steps we are now proposing are in direct succession to the steps already taken. In some respects they may appear somewhat unusual, but if we are departing from the beaten track in our resolution to show a lead in industrial, trading, and financial problems, in these days of unprecedented difficulty, we are only following in the footsteps of most of the other governments of the world. While the Government fully subscribes to the principle that, in Australia, primary and secondary industries arf each essential to the welfare of the other, it clearly recognizes that general prosperity and development must, in this young country, for a long time to come, have their origin in the prosperity of the man on the land. If the farmer, to use the term comprehensively, and tht pastoralist, enjoy fair seasons, and suffU cient profitable export trade to ensure a sound local price level, then in a material sense all is well with the nation. As our rural industries are, in the main, producing more than Australia can consume, overseas markets for the surplus arc vital to our welfare. Recognizing this fact, the Government entered wholeheartedly into the Ottawa agreement, which keeps open to us, on preferential Sir Henry Gullett. terms, the only great market in the world for our primary produce, with the excepof wool, and the market, which is still the largest individual buyer of wool. Owing to causes upon which I need not dwell, our dependence upon the market of the United Kingdom has increased in the four years since the Ottawa agreement was made. With the exception of wool, speaking broadly, agricultural products during those years have been increasingly excluded from all, or nearly all, foreign countries, and in some countries even the sale of our wool has been severely restricted. The Britisli market has served us greatly in clearing the surplus of many of our great primary products, as well as those of less importance, and in providing profitable price levels for that surplus. Those price levels have been reflected in higher prices in our home markets, and have played a great part indeed in our general national recovery. At the moment there is no immediate prospect of recapturing our old position for primary produce in foreign markets. If we are not to come to a national standstill, primary production must be increased, and the only way it can be increased is by selling more of our rural output in the British market. Happily that market, although perhaps approaching a state of surfeit in some primary commodities, has still room for further supplies from the dominions. These additional supplies, however, can only 'be furnished by the displacement of foreign supplies. It is desirable that we should clearly recognize the position of the British Government in its policy of external trade. The very strength of Britain depends upon its widely diverse secondary industries and its export of manufactured goods. Roughly speaking, one-half of the total exports from the United Kingdom find their market within the Empire, and the other half in foreign countries. In the main, Britain's capacity to sell to the Empire and to foreign countries, depends upon her capacity to purchase the exports of those countries. Putting it plainly, there is room for a substantial increase of Australian exports of primary produce to Britain provided we arc able to give to Britain an increased share in the Australian market. If we would sell to the United Kingdom more of those things which we can sell nowhere else, we must buy more from the United Kingdom. A disproportionate share of our imports is obtained from countries which take relatively small quantities poi'table surplus. Obviously it would brighten our trading position with our good customers if a larger share of our imports were purchased from them instead of from countries which have very little capacity for the absorption of Australian products. The Government has had these simple facts in mind in its recent deliberations. It is aiming simultaneously to increase our exports, to expand industry and employment, and also to guard and enhance our financial credit abroad. From the survey we have made we have decided that circumstance compels us, however, reluctantly, to follow the policy adopted by a large number of countries throughout the world, and divert a certain amount of our import trade from countries which are very indifferent purchasers of Australian exports, first as far as practicable with respect to Australian secondary industry, and next to countries which are, or recently have been, heavy purchasers of our exports. In other words, we have resolved to give more room in this market to those who nre our great buyers, and somewhat less room to those who are indifferent buyers. To achieve this object the Government has decided to proceed in two ways, first, by the adoption of a licensing system over a limited range of imports, and secondly, hy the imposition of higher duties where this course appears more desirable. With the exception of motor chassis, all goods of British Empire origin will be excepted from the licensing proposals. The restriction, however, will not apply to motor chassis from the United Kingdom. Under the licensing scheme, with the exceptions mentioned, the importation of specified commodities will be prohibited except with the consent of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and from the date of its operation, importers of those commodities must receive a licence before the goods will be permitted importation. These licences, however, will be freely granted upon application, in respect of the imports of [77] all countries with which we have a favourable balance of trade, and all other countries in regard to which, although the balance may be adverse to the Commonwealth, the Government is satisfied of our ex- with the position. The Government has decided at once to enter into conversations with the Canadian Government to endeavour to bring about a friendly arrangement by which the supply of imports of the goods subject to licence control will not he diverted from their present source of supply to Canada. In view of our large adverse balance of trade with Canada, if this occurred, it would completely defeat the Government's object of diversion. If friendly arrangements cannot be reached upon the matter with the Government of Canada, the Commonwealth Government will give the matter further consideration. I wish to emphasize that the Government is not adopting the principle of bilateral balances with individual countries as its trade policy, but is seeking to divert imports into channels which will confer most benefit upon the national economy. We have perforce to look to our exports to pay for our imports, and in the national interest we cannot allow our market for imports to be absorbed by countries which fail to extend a fair measure of reciprocity to the products of our export industries. With respect to those countries against which licences to import may be refused, such refusal will apply not to the whole of the imports from such countries, but only to the commodities named in a selected and limited list. Commodities not included in the selected list will be freely admitted withdut restriction as at present. The Customs Department is satisfied that such a licensing scheme can bo administered witliout difficulty, and with but slight, if any, work or embarrassment to Australian importers.",32
116,Mr BEASLEY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,B y what means was the discrimination fixed ?,34
117,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"B y a most thorough and painstaking examination of the whole position. In the case of countries from which imports will be restricted under the licensing system, the Government will be prepared to consider a modification of the restrictions in proportion to increased purchases from Australia, which such countries may make from this time forward. The total value of our import trade, which we anticipate will be diverted almost immediately by both the licensing system and the increased duties, will be £2,290,000. Of the goods represented by this amount, it is estimated, after a very thorough investigation, that Australian manufacturers will benefit by an increased output to the value of £S45,000 sterling, the manufacturers of the United Kingdom by £1,310,000, and good-customer foreign countries by £135,000. The aim throughout was to give the benefit to Australian industry. Details of the diversion to be brought about under duty proposals will be disclosed by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) at a later stage of the sitting. The figures I have just mentioned do not take into account the larger diversion to Australia of motor chassis manufacture to the value of over £4,000,000 st erling. While the licensing system will reduce by a substantial amount, our adverse balance of trade with some countries, it will nevertheless still leave to those countries a very heavy favourable balance. In giving consideration to the adoption of this licensing system by Australia, we must beaT in mind that a similar scheme is in operation against practically all of our exports, not excepting wool in some cases, in many parts of the world. We are in actual fact compelled to take this action because it has been so generally adopted against us. Where actual licensing is not in practice against us, we have been more or less completely excluded^ by tariff and otlier barriers equally hostile to our exports. I need scarcely say that, despite all the circumstances, which I think the House will agree make the restrictive measures decided upon unavoidable, the Government takes these steps with the deepest regret. We could have wished that, although Australia has suffered so much from restrictions by other countries upon its exports, we might have escaped the necessity for this action, which, at first sight, may be regarded with disfavour by the governments of the countries affected. We feel confident, however, that when the problem, which Sir Henry Gullett. we have had to face is fairly and fully pondered, it will be recognized, that we are acting in no spirit of retaliation, but are unwillingly driven by very pressing national interest. I now come to the matter of certain textiles, and to the great depreciation which has taken place in this, the most important item of the trade of the United Kingdom with this country, owing to the extraordinary growth of imports from foreign sources at prices which defy all competition. These low prices necessitate some action to preserve a reasonable proportion of the trade for the United Kingdom. Honourable members are already aware of the prominent position which textiles assume in the total exports from the United Kingdom to the Australian market. At Ottawa, we found that the Government of the United Kingdom attached the greatest possible importance to the preferences which we proposed to accord on cottons and artificial silk piece goods. The real significance of these textiles to the trade of the United Kingdom with Australia is discernible from the following figures: In 1931-32, the Ottawa year, imports into Australia of cottons and artificial silk piece goods from the United Kingdom amounted to £4,098,000, or 23 per cent, of the total' imports from the United Kingdom. In 1934-35, notwith-' standing the improved position in Australia and the general upward movement of trade, this figure only slightly increased to £4,284,000, representing 13 per cent, of the total imports from the United Kingdom. Values do not truly reflect the trend of the trade. I , therefore, place before honourable members a picture of the trade in terms of quantities. In 1932, Australia's imports of cotton piece goods from the United Kingdom were 167,000,000 square yards, .and in 1935, they were 118,000,000 square yards- a falling off of 49,000,000 square yards. Imports from foreign sources were 40,000,000 square yards in 1932, and 90,000,000 square yards in 1935, an increase of 50,000,000 square yards. In artificial silk, the United Kingdom supplied approximately 8,000,000 square yards in 1932, and 7,250,000 square yards in 1935, while foreign countries supplied 13,000,000 square yards in 1932, and 68,500,000 square yards in 1935, a gain of 58,000,000 square yards. The imports of artificial silk from foreign sources in 1935 represented almost 90 per cent, of our total imports of artificial silk piece goods. Due to the extraordinary price reductions for foreign textiles, the position is not far distant when the cotton trade of the United Kingdom, with Australia, will become practically insignificant, and foreign suppliers will demonstrate their capacity to absorb that trade as they have already absorbed the trade in artificial silk. Under the existing duties, foreign artificial silk can be purchased in Australia today at prices lower than those of cotton textiles. The Government, after many months of deep and close consideration of the development of these low-priced foreign textiles, and after very thorough investigations by the Customs Department, has decided that it can no longer look with indifference to the effect upon the Australian interest of these swollen and still swelling arrivals of cotton piece and artificial silk piece goods. It has reluctantly come to the conclusion, based solely upon the necessity to grant protection to British industry, and our complete reliance on the market of the United Kingdom for the absorption of our exportable surplus of all difficult selling commodities, that the imports of these low-priced foreign textiles cannot continue unchecked. Mr Foams - What guarantee has the Minister that Australia will have an expanding share of the market in the United Kingdom?",34
118,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"We have always obtained it so far, and have every reason to believe that we shall continue to obtain it. As the principal foreign supplier of these textiles is Japan, exhaustive attempts were made by the Government to make a friendly arrangement with the Japanese Government, whereby the exports to Australia would be curtailed to a basis agreed upon. After many weeks of negotiations, agreement between the two governments could not be achieved. The Government is, therefore, compelled to move by means of duty impositions. The present duties on artificial silk piece goods are 20 per cent. British, and 40 per cent, general tariff, plus 10 per cent, primage in both cases. It is now proposed that new specific duties in place of the old ad valorem duties on these textiles should be fixed as follows:British InterPreferential mediate General Tariff. Tariff. Tariff. Per sqyd. . . H d . . . , 8d. 9d. with provision for by-law admission at the rates ofBritish InterPreferential mediate General Tariff. Tariff. Tariff. Per sq. yd. . - Jd -. 3d -. 3d. Primage duty will be removed under the British preferential tariff and reduced from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent on foreign supplies. The by-law admission at the lower rates will be applied to artificial silk ordered before the 15th March last, and entered by the 30th November next in respect of goods the value for duty of which is not more than 7d. a square yard. It is scarcely necessary to mention that under the existing duties the British preference on artificial silk has long since disappeared. The average duty a square yard now being paid on the product from the principal foreign supplier is considerably less than that being paid on British goods. The effect of the existing ad valorem duties is readily discernible in the following average weighted f.o.b. value of artificial silk imported during the month of February last from various countriesd. United Kingdom .. .. 14 Betgium .. 14J France .. .. .. 381 Germany .. 281 United States of America .. 19} Japan .. .. .. 4J I should mention that these imports, other than those from Japan and the United Kingdom, were nominal in quantity. The action now proposed against lowpriced foreign textiles is in no sense exceptional. As far as I am able to discover, practically all countries of any importance have been compelled to control these imports either by quota restrictions, exchange control, or high specific duties. It is interesting to observe that in Japan the duty on artificial silk is 100 per cent. In the case of the weighted average price of 14d. a square yard of the United Kingdom just given, the Japanese duty would be equivalent to 14d. sterling a square yard. On cotton piece goods, the present duties are ad valorem 5 per cent. British, and 25 per cent, foreign, together with a primage duty of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively. The Government is under an obligation to remove primage on British goods as the finances permit. The proposed new duties will beUnbleachedper sq. yd. i d . * . . 2id. Bleachedper sq. yd. i d . * . . 2Jd. . Printed, dyed or coloured- ' per sq. yd. Ad.* . . 31d. * or 5 per cent, whichever the less. Primage duty on British cottons will be abolished, and the foreign rate will reduced from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent. It is not possible to give a sound mate of the effects of the new duties upon the imports of rayons and cotton piece goods. Japan, even under the new duties, will continue to be the principal supplier of our market in rayon. In cottons, there should be a considerable increase of imestablishment ports from the United Kingdom, but Japan will still continue to supply a stantial portion of our imports. It must be admitted that for a time new duties will cause some dislocation the soft-goods trade. It should be bered, however, that the enjoyment of the present great flood of low-priced foreign protected industries. artificial silk and cottons has prevailed only for the last year or two. I wish to dissipate any apprehension which may exist in the minds of honormembers, able members that the duties which be introduced by my honourable colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, will in any way be discriminatory. They will apply equally to all foreign countries. Most-favoured-nation principles will observed in tlieir application. Lower rates have been established under the intermediate tariff, and these have heen inserted for the specific purpose enabling us to carry on treaty negotialabour. tions with the many good customer counlaid tries which are interested in supplying the Australian market with these texparts tiles. Sir Hentry Gullett. A supplementary factor, which weighed with the Government, was that we did not consider we could stand aside and see any great section of this Australian market entirely absorbed by goods of relatively low and completely non-competitive levels. Only with the greatest reluctance has the Government felt compelled to take this action. But irrespective of country of origin, we could not observe these import levels without serious thoughts of ourBritish Inter- Australian standards. If such shatterPreferential mediate General ing price levels in a competitive sense can Tariff. Tariff. Tariff. be adopted for any one industry, they ... 2Jd. may be at any time adopted in others. It appearod to us that the stand we are 3d. making had to be taken sooner or later, and we would be lacking in courage and . 3id. in our duty if we failed to take it now. I come now to the manufacture of the be motor chassis. The magnitude of the value of the trade to be diverted to the Commonwealth in this particular indusestitry will be gathered from the fact that, the imports of chassis for the year ended December, 1935, reached a value of £4,500,000 sterling. The determination of the Government to give strong, and as we intend, decisive encouragement to the of this industry in the Commonwealth is in our mind separate from, suband independent of, the general scheme of trade diversion which I have outlined. these In our view, the time has arrivedof indeed it may be overdue-whe n this rememgreat industry should be established locally as a contribution to our existing We have tht> market; we have the raw materials; we have engineering direction and artisans second to none in the world. Honourable who may have doubts as to our will engineering capacity to make economi cally and efficiently our varied requirements in motor car and truck engines, may be reminded that already Australia, is manufacturing upwards of 80 per cent, be of many types of the complete car now.on the Australian market. Four-fifths of almost every car on the Australian roads today is already the product of of Australian material and Australian Indeed, it may confidently be down that in the manufacture of motor car bodies and the wide range of and accessories already being produced in the Commonwealth, we have overcome the larger part of the task of complete motor car achievement. We have every reason to believe that the engine and the chassis frame, together with accessories such as radiator cores, gear boxes, and petrol tanks, which arc now imported as part of the chassis, can be fashioned in the Commonwealth at least as efficiently and as economically as the 80 per cent, which our specialized industrialists are now contributing to the complete car. I would go further, and say that there is sound evidence to lead to the conclusion that the motor vehicle engine can be produced within Australia on a basis fully as economic as that of our other Australian products of engineering. Other countries with a lower motor vehicle registration than Australia have successfully engaged in complete motor car manufacture, a notable example heing Italy. Italy today has a number of worid-famous cars on the market, despite the fact that its output is small in comparison with the number of motor vehicles registered in this country.",36
119,Mr MOBBIDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,What will be the position in regard to prices?,38
120,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"The only increase of prices that can take place is limited to the 20 per cent, of the finished car, which is not now being made in the Commonwealth, and, to my mind, any increase would be small. The Government anticipates that satisfactory engine production can be commenced within two years, and that within five or six years Australia should be producing 80 per cent, of its engine requirements. At this stage, I do not propose to exhaust the House with excessive details, as these can be announced from time to time as progress is made.",38
121,Mr BEASLEY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Does the Government propose to follow a policy similar to this in the development of the ship-building industry in this country? - Sir HENRY GULLETT - Withi n the course of time it may be possible to do so; I hope so. We intend to offer a bounty to local manufacturers of motor engines, and to give the undertaking that, with respect to the accessories now being imported as part of the chassis, the Tariff Board will be asked, as soon as it becomes necessary, to investigate the position with a view to the imposition of protective duties to encourage their manufacture within the Commonwealth. This will place these accessories upon the same protective basis as the wide range of accessories now being made here. To provide the funds needed to encourage the Australian manufacture of engines, steps will be taken forthwith. It is proposed to impose an additional duty of .7d. per lb. upon all imported motor chassis and parts. Generally speaking, this additional impost will average over the range of imported chassis at approximately £5 each.",38
122,Mr MCBRIDE,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,Will the duty apply to imports of British motor chassis?,38
123,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"Yes , it will apply to all imports of motor chassis. The Minister for Trade and Customs will cover the matter of preferential duties to the United Kingdom subsequently. Simultaneously, the Government commits itself to the undertaking to submit to Parliament a bounty proposal for local engine production. The scale of bounty which will be proposed is as f ollows:1938 (or 1st year of production)£30. 1939 (or 2nd year of production)£26. 1940 (or 3rd vear of production)£8. 1941 (or 4th year of production)£3 15s. It is not possible with any close degree of accuracy to lay down the rate of progress which will be brought about in the manufacture of the Australian engine, but wo estimate that production will commence with, say, 5,000 units in 1938, increasing to 15,000 in 1939, 30,000 in 1.940, and 40,000 in 1941. The collection from the additional impost of .7d. per lb. will for this period exceed the estimated payment of bounty, but in our view we should play on the safe side. Moreover, the question of the exact bounty required will be submitted at an early date to the Tariff Board, but the Government will not hesitate in an industrial development of such magnitude and significance to Australia to submit to Parliament that the bounty shall not be less than £30 for the first year, and £26 for the second year ofmanufacture. The additional duty imposed to pay bounty will 3erve as a further measure of encouragement upon overseas manufacturers of chassis to enter into production within the Commonwealth. Moreover, the determination to proceed by bounty rather than by duty with respect to the new industry will enable this Parliament to impose the condition that a proper and very substantial measure of the capital required shall be of Australian or United Kingdom origin. The Government welcomes the intervention of foreign industry aud capital into the development of Australian industry, but we do not think it desirable that the absolute control of a great industry, such as this is surely destined to become, should fall into foreign hands, or that the profits arising from it should in the main be derived by foreign countries. In the opinion of the Government, reached after considerable investigation, there is room in the Commonwealth for the profitable working of at least three separate units of motor car manufacture. It is intended, however, not to limit the number of units, but rather to invite engine manufacturers who are now supplying the Australian trade to participate in this great new venture in secondary industry. Honourable members need scarcely be reminded that the value of this industry to Australia is not to be measured merely by the capital and employment given by the direct making of engines and of additional accessories.' As this great modern industry is increasingly transferred to Australia, it will call for increased activity and employment in the iron and steel industry, and the coal mining industry, and in many other directions. A further decision hy the Government is that, in order to treat the motor car industry of the United Kingdom as fairly as possible, and at the same time to expedite engine manufacture in Australia, the imports of chassis from the principal suppliers other than the United Kingdom, will be restricted to the same level of imports of chassis as for the year ended the 30th April, 1936. 60,000 chassis a year are imported into tins country at present. Sir Hejtry GhiUett.",38
124,Mr BEASLEY,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,Does the Ministry regard the 1936 importations as the peak?,39
125,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL PUBLICITY AND,"No ; my view, for what it is worth, is that imports would probably rise substantially over the next few years. British manufacturers will be particularly invited to participate in the new manufacture within the Commonwealth, and during the period of progressive diversion to Australian manufacture existing British interests will be preferentially considered. The plans outlined are not, of course, of a cast-iron nature, and will be open to reconsideration and re-adjustment as circumstances arise. This mU3t not be taken to mean, however, that the Government will depart from its determination to use all the means within its power to bring about upon an economic basis the early manufacture in the Commonwealth of by far the greater part of its requirements in the complete motor car. I assure honourable members that these proposals are submitted in complete sincerity, and that they have been devised entirely free of any party political outlook. I ask honourable members to consider them in the same spirit. Their aim is to promote the general welfare of the nation. I express my deepest appreciation of the remarkably able assistance, and the complete co-operation, I have had from my honourable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs, from the Comptroller-General of Customs, and from his tariff and treaty-making staff. In mentioning the staff, I make special reference to Mr Arthur Moore. APPENDIX A. NA NA BRITISH EMPIRE IS PROHIBITED, EXCEPT NA NA IN 1934-35. Imports.

Briefly, the duty changes are(1) An increased duty of Is. 6cl. per lb. on tobacco leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco made solely from imported leaf and ou tobacco leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco containing less than 13 per cent, of Australian leaf. (2) An increased duty of Is. 5d. per lb. on tobacco leaf used for the manufacture of cigarettes made solely fro m imported leaf aud on tobacco leaf used in the manufacture of cigarettes containing less than %\ per cent.

(4) Changes of duties on cotton piece goods and artificial silk piece goods from au ad valorem basis to a specific rate, with the exception that on cottons under the British preferential tariff an alternative ad valorem rate of 5 per cent, is chargeable if that rate is less than the specific rate proposed. The rates of duty at present operating are 5 per cent. British, and 25 per cent, general. The following rates are heing substituted:(o) Cottons(i) Unbleached per sq. yd., British, 4d. or 5 per cent., whichever lower; intermediate, 24d.; general, 2Jd.

127,Mr FORDE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,Hav e these rates been recommended by the Tariff Board?,48
128,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,No ; revenue duties do not come within the scope of the board's operations.,48
129,Mr CURTIN,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,But is this not part of the trade diversion policy referred to by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties?,48
130,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"It is, but such matters are not submitted to the Tariff Board.",48
131,Mr FORDE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,Would the honourable gentleman suggest that these duties are being imposed only for revenue purposes ?,48
132,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"Of course the newduties will have some protective effect, but they are also intended to divert to Great Britain trade in Australia which is not at present gcing in that direction. The present primage rates on cotton piece goods are 5 per cent. British, and 10 per cent, general. A notice in the Gazette, to be issued tomorrow, will abolish the primage duty on cottons entered under the British preferential tariff and reduce the primage duty from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent, under both the intermediate and general rates. The existing duties on artificial silk piece goods are 20 per ceut. Britisli , and 40 per cent, general with a primage rate agaiu3t all imports of 10 per cent. The rates now introduced are: per sq. yd., l j d . British , 8d. intermediate, and 9d. general. A by-law item has been, included in the new schedule under which artificial silk piece goods ordered before the 15th March, 1936, and entered not later than the SOth November, 1936, which do not exceed a value for duty of 7d. per sq. yd., will he dutiable at rates of per sq. yd., ^d. British , 3d. intermediate, and 3d. general - Apart from satisfying the two foregoing requirements, importers will also need to give an undertaking that the artificial silk piece goods admitted under the by-law item will be sold to purchasers and the public at a price based on the rates of duty proposed under the by-law item. Primage duty will also he abolished on artificial silk piece goods entered under the British preferential rates, and a reduction from 10 per ceut. to 5 per cent, is being made on foreign artificial silk piece goods. The British preferential - duty on mineral lubricating oil is being reduced by per gallon; the new intermediate rate will he the same as the existing general rate, and the general rate is being increased by 1-Jd. per gallon. The new rates will be-pe r gallon 3Jd. British , 4£d. intermediate, and 6d. general. The increase of the general rate will give the Government scope for trade treaty making. The ad valorem rates of duty on oregon logs and spars are being changed to specific rates. The effective rates at present operating are 20 per cent, against Canadian imports, aud 30 per cent, on general imports, plus, in both cases, primage of 10 per cent. The new rates will be-pe r 100 superficial feet is. 6d. Canada, and os. 3d. general. The primage rates will not be altered.",48
133,Mr GREGORY,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,I take it that these are ''efiuito increases of duty ?,49
134,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"Yes . I shall explain later how the trade is drifting to logs to the detriment of the local hardwood industry, and how these proposals will rectify the position somewhat, and ensure fairer conditions for the local industry. The new duties on unassembled car chassis will be specific, the rates beingper lb., free British. 5d. intermediate, and 5-Jd. general. The rate against Canada will be 2-Jd. On commercial vehicle types the rates will V)-free , 4jd. and 4fd., with a rate against Canada of 2^d. The rates on assembled chassis - will be somewhat higher. An additional duty of .7d. per lb. on all chassis is also imposed, and collections from this source will provide Funds to pay the bounty on chassis manufactured .in Australia.",49
135,Mr FORDE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,Can the Minister give us any information as to the probable increase these duties will cause in the price of American motor cars?,49
136,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,I cannot do so; that is a matter for the sellers of the cars to determine ,49
137,Mr GREGORY,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,I presume that the new duties will apply to trucks as well as cars.,49
138,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"Yes . I wish to state briefly to the committee the reasons for the Government's decisions respecting tobacco and oregon log timber. As honourable members are aware, Australia is producing excellent quality tobacco leaf. A great improvement has occurred in the quality of our production during the last four years. Up to the present all usable leaf has been purchased, and prudent tobacco manufacturers have purchased stocks for maturation purposes, these being available for progressive use.",49
139,Mr EORDH,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"We have told the Minister frequently that the Australian product is of high quality. M.r. WHITE - This Government may rake a good deal of credit for the improvement that has occurred in the quality of Australian tobacco leaf. If we had adhered to the rather reckless policy of the Scullin Government, which protected Australian tobaccoleaf irrespective of its quality, we should nor. now be able to take pride in the high quality of our products. About 50 per cent, of the Australian leaf now being marketed is of good quality. Three years ago only 30 per cent, of the crop was of good quality.",49
140,Mr FORDE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"I am glad that the Government is taking a leaf out of our book. After all, imitation is the sinceresfc form of flattery. . Mr WHITE - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may console himself with a remark of that kind, hut I do not think that it will have much meaning; for other people. The Government has decided that the existing protective ratesof duty shall apply to tobacco blended with a given percentage of Australian leaf, and it is imposing increased duties on tobaccoes which have a lower Australian content than that prescribed in the tariff item. In effect, the Government will ensure that the tobacco is produced for consumption, and not only foir purchasc. During the last debate on this item, T intimated that the Government would take stops to ensure the utilization of all usable tobacco leaf grown in Australia, and the present action is an implementation of that policy. The proposed action will be of some satisfaction to those manufacturers who remained loyal to the tobacco growing industry in the past and purchased large supplies of the Australian leaf. On good quality Australian leaf Ijie grower received the whole of theprotection, but manufacturers were unable by price inducement to persuademany smokers to purchase blends of tobaeco containing Australian leaf. The present duties will offer that inducement. The research work which is being carried out every year should result in the adoption of improved cultural methods, and, in view of the value of the benzol treatment of seedlings for the prevention of blue mould, there should be better prospects for the industry in the future, with a minimum loss of revenue to the department.",49
141,Mr THOMPSON,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"-.Will the manufacturer he exempt from the increased duty if he uses .more than 13 per cent, of Australian leaf?",50
142,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"It has been found that; where a higher percentage than 13 per cent, of Australian leaf is embodied in the mixture, the sales f all off. The department is attempting to popularise the Australian leaf.",50
143,Mr MCEWKN,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"What proportion of pipe tobacco is sold today witli an Australian leaf content of less than 13 per cent? MT . WHITE - I shall obtain that information. A preferential excise duty would have meant a considerable loss of revenue, and would not have had the same result as the present proposal. As regards oregon timber, honourable members are well aware that this Parliament approved some years ago of the grant of protective duties to the hardwood industry in Australia. A development in recent years has to a large extent defeated these protective duties. By reason of the low duties on Oregon logs, many importers have adopted the practice of importing the logs and having them sawn in Australia. Innumerable complaints have beeu received from hardwood sawmillers concerning this practice. The magnitude of this trade will he realized from the following figures. In 1931-1932 the footage of imported Oregon log was 3.8 million super feet. In 1934-1935 it. had risen to 106.5 million super feet. The present proposal is to increase the selling costs of oregon timber milled from the imported log in order to afford protection to the Australian hardwood milling industry.",50
144,Mr CUMIN,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"What was the proportion of the total log importations landed at Port Adelaide, where hardwood supplies are difficult to get?",50
145,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"The proportion would be higher there than in other States, but the practice was general. The duty on the log was low, and the rates were higher on the trimmed timber, so it was almost entirely a log importation.",50
146,Mr FORME,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,Is this alteration heing made on. the recommendation of the Tariff Board,50
147,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,No . This is a matter of trade diversion.,50
148,Mr HAWKER,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"H as the Government considered whether the effect of these duties will influence the demand for oregon for essential purposes from i m ports in the log to imports in flitches and junks which have been sawn in Canada, and the United States of America ?",50
149,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"Yes . There are logs of two types, dependent largely on the quality. I understand that, in the future, the log imports will show a falling off, and that there will be an increase of imports of the junk and sawn sizes.",50
150,Mr ROSEVEAR,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"Does the Minister know that architects, builders and timber merchants in Australia have suffered in the past through having had to take second-class material at first-class prices?",50
151,Mr WHITE,COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED,"That may be so. Oregon timber for mining purposes is still admitted free under by-law, and this provision covers a large range of the imports. Much difference of opinion exists as to the desirability of using oregon for building purposes in preference to our own timbers. The amendment proposed to tin. Exchange Adjustment Act limits deduction on account, of exchange to logs and spars, other than Oregon, where previously this deduction applied to all logs and spars. My colleague, the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, has dealt completely with the subject of pressed panels for motor car bodies, and honourable members will have an opportunity to discuss that item again when we re-assemble. If honourable membevs carefully study the Minister's speech, they will realise, I think, that the Government has done something substantial for tht good of the Commonwealth. Progress reported. NA RESEARCHBILL 1936. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from page 2211, on motion by Mr THOBBY That the hill be now read a second time, and upon the amendment by Mr FORDEThat all words after "" That"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the lowing words :- "" the bill be withdrawn drafted to provide for a ballot of all Australian wool growers as to whether they favour the proposed levy on wool, and the pro-posed method of administration of the fund.""",50
152,Mr CLARK,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"Darling ) [2.55] - In considering the necessity for this measure, the House should first inquire whether the industry would receive good value for the money to be expended, and whether the necessary funds are to be raised on an equitable basis. A difference of opinion exists among those directly interested in the industry as to whether they will get the service to which they are entitled under such a scheme as that provided for in the bill. There"" is also a conflict of opinion as-to whether the proposed representation will be satisfactory to all interests. I have received a communication from the secretary of the Australian Farmers and Graziers Stabilization Association, with which are associated the Australian Wool growers Association, the Selectors Association of Queensland, and the Southern Wool growers Association of Western Australia, pointing out that it opposes the bill ^as being eutirely unnecessary. It stresses the fact that, if the Government decides to proceed with this legislation, a ballot should be taken among all wool growers to determine whether the scheme should be launched, and, if so, to select the representatives on the board. This principle has been observed in connection with other legislation on similar lines. In May, 192S, a Primary Products Marketing B i ll was submitted to the New South Wales Parliament by the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr . Thorby), and provision was made for the taking of a ballot by those affected. There was to be a compulsory ballot, so that all sections of the industry might have a voice in the matter. I understand that an amendment is to he submitted to this bill providing that, after four years, the growers shall be given an opportunity by ballot to say whether they desire the proposed board to continue to function. Under the New South Wales measure, the growers had the right to say whether the scheme should be established, as well as whether it fol- should he continued. Similar provision and reshould be made in the bill before us. Although a ballot may be costly, if the growers are to be given the right to take a ballot as to whether the scheme should be continued, I suggest that the appropriate time to do that is before the scheme is put into operation. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Fisken) states that this matter is urgent, and that the scheme should be proceeded with at once, but I do not believe it to be nearly so urgent as has been suggested. I am now referring not to the necessity for advertising the value' of wool, but to the need for immediate legislation by the Government. I understand that a gentleman named Wilson, who represents a section of the British manufacturers, is now lecturing throughout Australia to induce the graziers to establish a fund for the purpose of advertising wool. According to a communication which I have received from Mr Humphreys, secretary of the Selectors Association of Queensland, Mr Wilson definitely stated that he could give no assurance that contributions would be made by the manufacturers. In a speech delivered by Mr . Wilson, he is reported to have said: "" If we can get the manufacturers on the other side to subscribe ever so little, it will come to a great amount of money,"" It will be seen, therefore, that Mr Will son was by no means certain that he could get the manufacturers to subscribe. At no time has he said that they are prepared to do so. If Australia were the sole country to benefit from any world-wide advertising campaign to bring about an increase of the use of present wool, my objections to this proposal would not be so great, but that is not so. Other large wool-producing countries would share in the benefits which mightresult fro m the expenditure of money provided by only one section of Australian primary producers. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) said that other industries have advertised on a collective basis, and that it would not be fair to impose a levy on one section for the benefit of others not called upon to contribute. That is a quite fair surnming-up of the position as it applies to the wool industry. If it is decided by the graziers that the scheme now proposed will promote the sale of wool, all sections should contribute to the fund and should be given some say in the selection of the personnel of the 'board. The manufacturers, selling brokers and others who would benefit largely by an increase of the price of wool should be compelled to contribute. The turnover of the manufacturers would he considerably enhanced by an increased use of wool and their profits would be proportionately larger; therefore it is only just that they should be asked to contribute a considerable portion of the total amount to be levied. Statistics relating to the importation of wool into Great Britain over a period of years show that 30 per cent, is imported from Australia and the remainder from other parts of the world. Of the wool imported about 382,000,000 lb. is merino and 535,000,000 lb. cross bred and other sorts. Argentina and other South American countries are large growers of wool, and will benefit from this scheme. Therefore efforts should he made to get the growers in those countries to join in a world-wide campaign for the promotion of the use of wool and to contribute on an equitable basis. It is an old axiom that there should he no taxation without representatation. The growers should have some say as to the constitution of the board. In this ease a special levy, which, after all, is only another form of taxation, is being imposed on one particular section of the community, yet that section is to be denied the right to have some say in the expenditure of the money so levied. It has been stressed by speakers on the Government side that the members of the board are to be selected by the Wool growers Council. I point out that that council is not fully representative of all pastoral sections in Australia. In New South Wales, the main graziers' organization is the Graziers Association. In December, 1934, that association had a membership of 8,289 graziers, representing about 30,000,000 sheep; in December, 1935, the membership dropped to 7,537, representing about 29,000,000 sheep. It will thus be seen that even within the last twelve months there !has been a falling off of no less than 752 members, each representing an average of about 1,400 sheep. Many of the small graziers are falling out of this association. But of the 31,708 graziers in New South Wales, only 7,537 are members of the Graziers' Association! Many graziers, for their own particular reasons, are not members of that body, and they should not he forced into an organization which they have no desire to join. The Government should be prepared to accept an amendment to the bill providing for a poll to be taken of all the wool-growers before any levy is imposed. The stated object of the scheme is to improve the standard and quality of wool. We hear all too often loose talk about the deterioration of the quality of Australian wool. I do not believe that there is any ground for such statements. Australian wool is recognized as the best in the world, and it is grown on a sound business basis. If finer wool is demanded in the markets of the world, buyers must he prepared to pay a higher price for it than for wool of the stronger types. Growers of the finer type wools cannot get the same clip from tlieir flocks. Many graziers are today finding that it is a profitable proposition to breed cross-bred sheep, because the carcases yield a better return. It is purely a business proposition, and, if there is a sufficient margin between the prices of stronger and finer types of wool, Australian graziers will be quite prepared to supply the latter. In 1931, the Graziers' Association of New South Wales carried a resolution favouring the establishment of a pool for the marketing of wool, but the executive of that organization was not prepared to accept it. There is a strong urge among pastoralists, all over Australia, that some controlled marketing scheme for wool should be adopted. During the war, when Bawra was in operation, growers were granted within fourteen days of valuation an advance of 90 per cent. At present growers have to wait a long time for their wool cheques, and many of them, because the banks are pressing them for liquidation of their overdrafts, are forced to sell their wool at a low price. Because of this unfortunate state of affairs, growers are not able to hold their wool for the best market. Mention has been made during this debate of the competition afforded to the wool industry by rayon and synthetic fibres. Since the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) returned from abroad, he has repeatedly stated that competition offered by wool substitutes is not very serious and is not worth worrying about.",51
153,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,I have never said that.,53
154,Mr CLARK,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"That , at any rate, was what we gathered from the honourable gentleman's remarks; and, although other honourable members have said that a very substantial increase has taken place in the sale of rayon during recent years, the statistics, I think, to some extent, confirm the Minister's statement. According to the chairman of Courtauld's Limited, the world production of staple fibre rose from 54,000,000 lb. in 1934 to 162,000,000 lb. in 1935. Yet, last year Australian growers were able to sell more wool at a better price than in 1934, when the production of staple fibre was so much lower. The position in regard to the carry-over of wool this year, compared with last year, shows a substantial improvement. The sales by auction totalled 2,351,000 bales in 1934-35 and 2,540,000 in 1935-36. Only 106,000 bales remained unsold in 1935-36, s against 348,000 in .1934-35. In other words, in spite of the considerable increase of the sales of substitutes, the Australian wool growers have been able to clear the greater part of their surplus production. I see no reason for haste in regard to this bill. The Government should be prepared to go carefully into the question whether contributions should not be demanded from all sections of the industry which will benefit from the increased use of wool. The benefit of the draft on wool amounting to about £350,000 per annum, is derived entirely by the wool-buyers. They derive a further advantage by reason of the deduction made in respect of the weight of the packs and hoops. It is estimated that these amount to about £500,000 a year. If an allowance were made for these items, there would be a substantial fund for the conduct of research and of an advertising scheme to improve the sales . of wool. As the buyers of this product are actually the manufacturers and the sellers of it, and as they reap the greatest measure of profit, they should be prepared to make this small sacrifice for the benefit of the industry generally. Mr ""Wilson has pointed out that the advertising campaign is to be inaugurated in England. That country purchases only about 30 per cent, of Australia's wool clip. Therefore, publicity will not be subsidized in the different countries in which 'the biilk of the wool is sold.",53
155,Mr THORBY,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,It is intended that only a portion of the fund shall be spent in that direction.,53
156,Mr CLARK,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"Accordin g to Mr Wilson, "" the idea is to start selling it in Great Britain. You can feel the pulse there, and later spread to other countries "". Probably great advantages are derivable from an advertising scheme. That it pays to advertise, is a well-recognized business axiom. We on this side are not opposed to the principles of the bill. But we are definitely of the opinion that those who are to be asked to pay for such a scheme should have a voice as to whether or not they favour the proposal, and in the selection of the members of the board which will control the expenditure of the money raised. We believe a that there is no great urgency for the measure, in view of the fact that the woolmanufacturers have not given a definite undertaking to find any particular quota or even a £1 for £1 contribution, as has been suggested. According to the secretary of the Queensland organization of growers, Mr Wilson can give no definite assurance that the overseas manufacturers will contribute, but believes that, if they could be induced to subscribe ever so little, a considerable sum would be raised. There is no mention in the bill that the Australian wool growers' contribution is to be conditional upon sellers and manufacturers contributing also. The manufacturers will probably benefit to the greatest extent, and, therefore, should contribute on a far higher scale - than the men who grow the wool.",53
157,Mr STREET,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,Corangamite) [3.18]. - The attitude adopted towards the bill by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) was one of friendliness. His - only desire is that it shall contain a provision for the taking of a ballot.,54
158,Mr FORDE,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"Hear , hear!",54
159,Mr STREET,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"It should be remembered, however, that the bill differs damentally from previous measures - of an apparently similar type, but which could not be brought into operation .before a ballot had been taken. This legislation will not interfere with the growing, marketing, or sale of the product. In the case - of legislation which assumes control of - an industry, it is right that a ballot of the producers should be taken in order that their views may be ascertained. The ±>eputy Leader of the Opposition has apparently missed this point, and his criticism, therefore, rather lacks substance. The honourable member for Darling { Mr Clark) has taken exception to the fact that the Australian Wool growers Council will nominate the members of the board. That is clearly the most representative body of wool growers which could be selected. The Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) read to the House a long list of the ciations which are affiliated with it. associations represent, I suppose, 80 per cent, of the sheep of Australia, and certainly a very large percentage of the growers. This is not a sacrosanct body; any organization of wool growers may join it. No organization which has applied for admission to it has been refused entry. The honourable member for Darling has argued that this legislation is not urgently needed. I disagree with him. The importance of the industry to Australia cannot be overestimated. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Fisken) quoted figures in connection with it. It is generally recognized that disaster to the wool industry would mean disaster to the nation. There are, in Australia, approximately 100.000 wool growers, who graze 113,000,000 sheep. This continent supplies 27 per cent, of the world's requirements of wool-ove r 50 per cent, in the case of fine wooland 33 per cent, of the total value of all the wool produced. During the last 40 or 50 years the weight of fleece has been doubled, and the siza of the carcass considerably enlarged. The belief is generally held that a halt has now been called in connection with these two features. As the honourable member for Ballarat has pointed out, these fun- increases have been accompanied by certain diseases; consequently, the need for more intensive research to combat them is obvious.' The question has been asked: If this is a most efficient industry, if big improvements have been made in regard to the weight of wool and the size of sheep, if it is producing considerable national wealth, and if all the wool produced is going into use, why is it necessary to take steps to increase the sale of the product? The position is deceptive. The increased demand for wool is due to two reasons: First, to the disturbed international situation, with re-armament all over the world; and, secondly, to the temporary shortage which, as the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) has stated exists at the moment. The production of artificial silk has increased from 31,000 lb. 40 years ago to 943,000,000 lb. today. Research and publicity have been solely responsible for that asso- increase. It will be noted that the Those manufacturers of rayon no longer describe it as artificial silk because of the psychological effect upon persons who are disinclined to purchase an artificial product. The latest discovery, staple fibre, is probably the greatest danger to the wool industry. Chemically, it is the same as rayon, being made from wood pulp, but it can be cut into short lengths, and will spin up to about 150 counts, not one long length like rayon. A very real danger to the wool industry lies in the fact that the manufacturers of Great Britain who have experienced difficulty! in continuing their operations with woollen textiles, need no alteration of their machinery to handle the artificial fibres which are now on the market. Surely, then, there is need for immediate action! That wool cannot hope to compete with rayon or staple fibre on a price basis, is universally recognized. It has to compete on a virtue basis. Only by intensive publicity and research, leading to an improvement of the methods of producing what the public requires, will wool maintain its r i g h t f u l place. An y vital in j u r y suffered by the industry would be calamitous to Australia. I fail to see why opposition should, be offered to the bill in its present form . The need for a preliminary poll is exaggerated. The amount for which any individual would be responsible, is comparatively small. A man with 500 sheep would contribute only about 6s. a year. The cost of a poll would be out of all proportion to the result obtained. I am quite sure that even those who favour the taking of a poll know perfectly well what the result of one would be.",54
160,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"Wide Bay) [ 3 . 2 6 ] - I have given much consideration to this subject, particularly because one pastoral association in Queensland is opposed to the proposal, claiming that the demand for wool is even now in excess of production without advertising effort, that, fore, the need for advertising does not exist, that there is no assurance that the grower would' receive any increase of his returns to enable him to meet the extra tax, that, generally, the f u n d would be used more for the purpose of extending the use of wool than in any other direction, and that the scheme is i.ot desired by the industry throughout Australia.",55
161,Mr STREET,WOOL PUBLICITYAND,"Does the honourable member agree with that? Mr BERNARD CORSER,- I have taken the precaution to make myself au f a it with the position generally. I find that, as has been pointed out by many speakers, including the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street), there is dangerous propaganda throughout the world against the use of woollen goods, and it counteracted in the interests of the wool industry. I have communicated with the United Graziers Association of Queensland, and have received from that body a reply which reads as follows:With regard to the proposal of a levy of not more than Is. per bale per annum for publicity and research in the wool industry, may I say that the Graziers Federal Council and the Australian Wool-growers Council, which bodies represent the organized wool growers of Australia, passed the following resolutions as recommendations to the affiliated associations in the other States of the Commonwealth :That this joint meeting of the Graziers Federal Council and the Australian Wool growers Council is in favour of raising a fund for improving the production and increasing the use of wool throughout the world by any means, including publicity and research, which, in the opinion of the controlling body, will attain this end. That the said fund be raised by a compulsory levy with legislative authority. That the levy to be imposed be at the rate of not more than Is. per bale in any one year. That' the Commonwealth Government be asked to arrange for the collection of the said levy, and that it be suggested that this be done under the excise powers of the Commonwealth. A sub-committee was appointed to consider the constitution of a body to control and administer the proposed fund. It is not correct to say that this is a move by the manufacturers in their own interests; it is a move by the wool-growers in their own interests. These recommendations were made on the distinct underthere- standing that the manufacturers would enter into the question of publicity and technical research on a pro rata basis and also that the growers of New Zealand and South A f r i c a , and, possibly, Argentina would take similar action to that proposed in this country. No approach had then been made to the Commonwealth Government. Since then the Commonwealth Government has fallen in with a scheme which is claimed to be almost unanimously desired by the. wool-growers throughout the Commonwealth. As the result of conferences between .the wool-growers and representatives of British woollen trade interests who came to this country not to further their own interests, but at the invitation of the wool-growers, this bill has been brought forward. I think the following extract from The Pastoral Review sums must he up the opinions which actuated those who advocated the suggested levy:The aim of advertising is to counteract the claims, not always supportable in fact, made for wool's competitors, rayon, vistra, "" milkwool "", and the like and to place and keep before the public the inherent virtues of wool as an article of use in many spheres. It is not, however, so much the sometimes extravagant claims made on behalf of wool substitutes that are dangerous to natural wool as the actual goods turned out from themgoods which speak for themselves and which within limits have an undoubted value. As the result of intensive research these have been and are continuing to be immeasurably improved. They have an ever-widening appeal, and by clever advertising and salesmanship that appeal is being translated into constantly increasing consumption. , . . No one can possibly lay it down as a definite filet that the substitution will uot be evolved that will supplant wool. It is only necessary to visualize the consequences to Australia of such a possibility to realise the vital importance of keeping wool in the forefront of public estimation. Having closely studied all aspects of the position, I can make no other decision than to support the bill and thereby the aims of the Australian wool-growers. The fund that will be raised will be used to counteract the scurrilous propaganda that is being used by the people behind the wool substitutes to the detriment of the wool trade. At a very small cost, this bill should bring about great benefits. It has been said that this Government is trying to control the wool industry in the same way as it controls the production and the overseas marketing of butter and dried fruits. That is not the case. The graziers will still remain in full control of the marketing of the product. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee.

July, and not. the 1st June, has for effect many years been recognized as the rates beginning of the new wool-growing season. In Queensland, particular objection is raised to the 1st June being the date for the commencement-of the tax, because the shearing of wool in that State is carried on throughout the year, whereas in Victoria and New South Wales, it does not. start until the month of July. Owing to the bounteous rains that, have fallen a great many more sheep have heen shorn than is usual, and I have been advised that during June 90,000 hales of wool will be shorn. I the Queensland graziers had to pay levy on this amount of wool, they would he put in a less favourable position the graziers in the other States, who would not commence shearing operations until the following month.

168,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BILL,"""Warringah-Minister for Defence) [3.49] I move.That the bill be now read a second time. The amendments of the Wireless Telegraphy Act contained in this bill refer solely to the territories under the control - of the Commonwealth. Clause 2 of the Measure seeks to amend the definition of '"" Australia "" contained in the principal act to ensure that the act will have application of its own force to all the territories of the Commonwealth. It already applies to territories such as Papua, but the new definition extends its application to territories governed by the Commonwealth under mandate from the League of Nations. The Commonwealth, as a signatory io the International Telecommunications Convention, is obliged to enforce the international wireless laws wherever it governs. It is therefore desirable that the Government should be in a position to see that the duties involved in the enforcement of these laws, such as the allocation of wavelengths to avoid interference 'between stations of the Commonwealth and the territories, and by these stations - with those of other countries, are effectively performed. No difficulty has been - experienced, either in the Commonwealth or in Papua, as the result of the control of wireless in that territory, and in the - Commonwealth proper, by the Commonwealth Government. The Lieutenant Governor of Papua is consulted wherever possible, and is kept informed of all - developments. The Administrator at ZRabaul has requested that a similar Arrangement be made for the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The extension of the application of the principal act, to that territory will greatly facilitate the report performance of the Commonwealth's obligations under the convention which I have mentioned. It will also make for uniformity throughout the Commonwealth and the Territories under its jurisdiction, in the regulations for the control of wireless telegraphy. Clause 3 of the bill contains a provision intended to clarify a position which arose in Papua recently, .when a person was prosecuted for operating wireless 1936. apparatus without a licence. The magistrate before whom the complaint was made took the view that he had no jurisdiction to hear cases in respect o.f offences against the Wireless Telegraphy Act. The inclusion in section 9 of the principal act of the proposed new sub-section (3.) in clause 3 of this bill will remove any doubts in this connection. Honourable members will gather from what I have said that the bill does not. in any way affect the application of the aet to the Commonwealth proper. Question resolved in the affirmative.

169,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Warringah-Minister for Defence) [3.35] - - I moveTliat the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to effect a minor amendment of the Removal of Prisoners (Territories) Act 1923. That measure provided machinery for the removal, where necessary, of persous from any of the Territories of the Commonwealth. Whilst it is general in its application, the necessity for it arose particularly by reason of difficulties experienced in dealing with white prisoners in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea: It was found by the Administration that it was inadvisable to confine white persons in gaol there for lengthy periods because of health reasons, and also the faGt that no employment was available to which a white person could be put without loss of prestige to the white population in the eyes of the natives. Subsequent to the passing of the act, arrangements were made with the governments of the States of Queensland and New South Wales for prisoners from a territory to be received into gaols in those States to undergo the sentences imposed upon them by the courts of the territories. The cost of maintenance of such prisoners whilst in custody in Australia is paid - by the Administration of the territory from which the prisoner is removed. Section 8 of the act provides that if the Governor General or the Governor of a State to which a prisoner is removed, requires a prisoner to be returned for discharge to the territory from which he was removed, the prisoner shall be returned to that territory for the purpose of being so discharged at the expiration of his sentence. It provides further that in any other case a prisoner, when discharged at the expiration of his sentence, shall, on application made in such manner and within such time as is prescribed, he entitled to be sent free of cost to the territory from which he was removed. Regulations have been made under the act, requiring an application by a prisoner for a free passage to the territory to he lodged within fourteen days of his discharge. Most of the white residents of New Guinea, prior to going to the territory, were residents of Australia, and arrangements have heen made with the Government of New South Wales for prisoners from the territory who were born in New South Wales, or who were resident in that State for some time before going to the territory, to be discharged in the State at the expiration of their sentences. Prisoners who were horn in other States or were resident for lengthy periods in those States prior to going to the territory, are discharged in New South Wales at the expiration of their sentences, and the cost of their transport to their former States is paid by the Administration. The law of New Guinea provides for the deportation from that territory of persons convicted of certain offences. a deportation order is issued against a ment? prisoner who is transferred to Australia to serve his sentence and the prisoner understand so. claims a free passage to the territory after discharge in Australia, the AdministraMr Archdale Parkhill. tion is put to the expense of a passage for the prisoner to the territory and a passage away from the territory when the deportation order is put into execution immediately after the prisoner returns to the territory. [Quorum formed.] It is not considered that a prisoner against whom a deportation order has been issued should be entitled to a free passage to the territory, and this amending bill has been introduced to. take from such prisoners the right to a passage to the territory after their discharge in Australia.",58
170,Mr BLACKBURN,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Bourke) [4.2] The hill seems to recognize the right of a territory to send a person, whom it regards as an undesirable citizen for that territory, back to Australia. He has been convicted, say, in New Guinea, of an offence for which he can be or8e""red, after completing his term of imprisonment, to be deported, and he is sent to a prison in Australia. His offence is apparently regarded as serious, hecause the penalty imposed includes deportation. Probably the State in Australia does not want him at all, and, after he has been released from the State prison, New Guinea says that the State must keep him. I suggest that when the State authorities understand the position, they will raise objections to the proposal.",59
171,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Warritngah-Minister for Defence) [4.5] in reply-If a person went from New South Wales to New Guinea, and was sentenced there to five years' imprisonment, by an arrangement made between the governments of the Commonwealth and of the State he would serve the sentence in a New South Wales gaol. Under the present law, he goes back to New Guinea for his discharge, hut it is desired that the release should take place in New South Wales to avoid the expense of sending him to New Guinea, and then returning him to New South Wales.",59

175,Mr BLACKBURN,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Bourke) [4.8] In order to preserve the prestige of the white race, and to overcome the difficulty due to the unsatisfactory prison accommodation in the territories, white prisoners are sent to State gaols to serve their sentences. Under the existing law a prisoner, on his discharge, can apply to be repatriated to the territory from which he - came, but that territory may have already made an order for his deportation. The bill has been brought down to obviate the waste of money incurred in paying, first for his repatriation, and then for his deportation. Have the States actually agreed to this alteration of the law? I think, that they will revolt against being burdened with exprisoners who have been deported from territories as unworthy citizens.",60
176,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Warringah-'Minister for Defence) [4.12] My advice is that the States are agreeable to the proposed alteration. In any case, they cannot object to it , because, under existing conventions, they are required to take back their former citizens.

On previous occasions the House considered the message, after passing a resolution that the public welfare demanded the early enactment of the tariff, and that, pending the adoption of joint standing orders, the House refrained from determining its constitutional rights or obligations. It rests with the House to determine whether it will receive and consider the message. In the circumstances of the present case, the House may deem it expedient to act as before-to pass a similar resolution and to inform the Senate of the terms thereof.",60
178,Mr WHITE,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 8 . 3 ] - I do not intend to discuss the constitutional rights of the House of Representatives in this matter. The question arose in connection with each of the previous tariffsthose of 1901-2, 1907-8, 1920-21, and 1932-34-and has been discussed in this House by distinguished aud learned Attorney3-General. In 1933, the then Attorney-General (Mr Latham), replying to a question asked by the present  son) said, inter aliaThe Senate should recognize that the only practical way in which effect may be given to the words of the section which draw a distinction between making a request at any stage of a bill and amending a bill, is by taking the view that a request can be made only once, and that, having made it, the Senate has exercised a.ll the rights and privileges allowed by the Constitution. I shall not say more than that, because I have the greatest respect for the opinion of that learned gentleman. So that the request may be dealt with, I move That, having regard to the fact that the public interest demands the early enactment of the tariff, and pending the adoption of Joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of Message No. 123 received from the Senate in reference to the Customs Tariff Bill 1936, and resolves to consider it forthwith.",60
179,Mr FORDE,REMOVAL OE PRISONERS,"Capricornia) [ 8 . 5 ] support the motion wholeheartedly. believe that I shall have dealt sufficiently with the matter if I read section 53 of the Constitution, which is as follows: The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. I submit that this is really a taxation measure, and that it affects the revenues of the Commonwealth. The Senate has no right to persist in its request for a reduction of duty. It is not necessary to inquire into the merits of the duty, which would have a very far-reaching effect upon industry and employment in this country. I support the attitude adopted by the Minister. Motion agreed to. Motion (by Mr WHITE ) agreed toThat the foregoing resolution be incorporated in the message when the bill is returned to the Senate.

182,Mr BLACKBURN,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"by leave- I ask the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) in connection with his statement on the 40-hour working week, if it is to 'he taken as implying that if a plaint relating to shorter hours is filed in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and pressed by the unions, the Commonwealth Government, through its Attorney-General, will intervene to support the claim for shorter hours ?",62
183,Mr LYONS,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"No , it does not mean that. The Attorney-General would intervene, and by his intervention would enable the whole question to be dealt with from every aspect, and would, I think, subject to correction by the honourable member who knows this matter thoroughly, enable parties, other than the parties to the original plaint, also to go into the matter, so that it might be thoroughly investigated. But it is not to be taken that the Commonwealth is committed to a 40-hour week before the inquiry starts. MEMBERS' DINING ROOM.",62
184,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"Hon. G. J. Bell) This morning the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) referred to an official having a meal in the members' dining room, and asked if I approved; . he indicated that he considered that discrimination had been shown because of objections that had been raised on another matter. I said, at the time, that I should make inquiries as to whether the official referred to had been given permission by the President of the Senate, which I indicated I had been informed he had been given. The secretary of the Joint House Committee, Mr Broinowski, has informed me that the late Sir Walter Kingsmill, when President of the Senate and Chairman of the House Committee, gave a general permission to Captain Bracegirdle, the Military Secretary to His Excellency the Governor General, to use the parliainentary refreshment rooms. That privilege has been availed of by Captain Bracegirdle on more than one occasion, but this is the first time it has been questioned. I merely make this statement in order to make it clear that an accusation of intrusion hy Captain Bracegirdle into privileges of honourable members is without foundation.",62

186,Mr GREGORY,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"Swan) [9.29] - I enter a most emphatic and deliberate protest against the action of the Government in not conforming to the Constitution, by not proroguing Parliament at the end of this sitting, and also in bringing down, on the last day of the sitting, various important changes of the Tariff which impose additional taxes on the people. I do not think that that action is fair. I shall not speak at length as I intended, owing to the desire of members to catch the train, but I hope that, in the future, the Government will endeavour to adhere to the Constitution. The tariff proposals introduced today will undoubtedly have fairly big results, possibly a trade war with the United States of America and animosity with other foreign countries, and, in the circumstances, it was the duty of the Government to afford honourable members an opportunity to. discuss them during this sitting of the House. I trust that my protest will be given consideration by the Government, and that it will endeavour in the future to act fairly, in respect of both the Constitution and the rights and privileges of honourable members.",62
187,Mr LYONS,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E," in reply-[9.30] - I , like the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), had hoped that Parliament could be prorogued after the conclusion of this sitting. I indicated earlier in this period of the session that the Government desired to conclude the session when the House rose, hut that has not been possible. The Constitution does not provide that Parliament must adjourn at a particular period. The HonoraMe member has suggested that the tariff proposals tabled today should have been considered during this sitting, but that was not practicable. He may rest assured, however, that they will be either considered during this session or validated.",63

It is the practice to permit importers of literature falling within the terms of the prohibition contained in the Customs (.Prohibited Imports) Regulations to return the literature to the exporter. 4. It is not the practice to express opinions on matters of law in reply to questions.",64
194,Mr LYONS,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO AL L,"On the 2nd A p r i l , the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) asked me the following questions, upon notice:1. Has the Government yet given consideration to the frequent requests made in relation to the censorship of political books? 2. If so, will he state the steps the Government proposes to pursue in this matter? In reply, I indicated that the matter had been receiving the attention of the Government, and that a statement would be made at the earliest possible date. I am now in a position to State that, as a result of the further consideration given to the question, the Government does not feel that it would he wise to repeal the provisions under which the censorship is operated. It is desirable, perhaps, that I should recall the exact terms of the regulation dealing with the censorship. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, Second Schedule, item 14, sets out a list of "" goods the importation of which is prohibited except with the consent of the Minister."" The list is as follows:Literature wherein is advocated(a) the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country; (6) the overthrow hy force or violence of all forms of law: (c) the Hiholition of organized government ; (d) the assassination of public officials; or (e) the unlawful destruction of property, or literature wherein a seditious intention (as defined by section 34A of the Crimes Act 1014-1932) is expressed or a seditious enterprise advocated. to the It seems to the Government inadvisable are as to repeal that regulation, and thus proclaim to the world that books which advocate the views set out in those paragraphs should be allowed untrammelled entry into Australia. As to the books which come within the various sub-sections (a) to (e), it should be noted that reads the the importation is prohibited "" except with the consent of the Minister and the Minister has, and will have, the complete approval of the Government in interpreting the paragraphs in a spirit consonant with the established British principle of the freedom of the press.
