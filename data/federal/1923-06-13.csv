If one aidede-camp had come and asked our Librarian, who has had probably t h i r ty years' experience of similar functions, he could have seen all that was required to be seen, and there would then have been no necessity for sending along the A d mira l of the Fleet and, I believe, also, the Commandant, as well as ten other highly paid officials.

' Mr WEST (East Sydney) T5.0] - The Governor General, in his Speech, addresses honourable members of this House, and the Address-in-Reply, which we propose to present to him, should reflect the opinions of honourable members of this House. The Government proposes to appoint two honourable gentlemen to - express its views, but the whole of this House, and not merely the Government, should do that. This question may not have been raised in previous Parliaments; the excuse for raising it now is that we are endeavouring to improve upon the parliamentary procedure of the past. The amendment proposes the names of two other honourable gentlemen, who, we think, can better express to His Excellency the views of members of this House. I am becoming tired of formalities in which everything is prepared in advance, and I desire, if possible, to present to His Excellency an Address-in-Reply which will reflect the opinion of the whole of this House, which is composed, not merely of the Government, but also of an Opposition and a .third party. At present we do nob know what are the opinions of the third party. All we know is that the two honourable gentlemen who have been named have been chosen by the Government to express the views of the Government. Obviously, they cannot express the views of other honourable members.

The C o m m it t e e appointe d to prepare the Address-in-Reply h a v in g presented the proposed Address, which was read by the Clerk, Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [ 5 . 7 ] move That the following Address-in-Rcply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech be agreed to:MAY IT PLEASE Youit EXCELLENCY: We, the Bouse of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to Our Must Gracious Soveieign and to thank Your Excellency for the Speer-.ii which you have been pleased to' address to Parliament. I desire to express my thanks for the very cordial reception that honourable members have extended to me. I take it to be a demonstration of kindness to a new member breaking the ice in making his maiden speech. Being both a new and a young member, I approach this subject with a great deal of diffidence and trepidation. That I should be asked to move this motion, I regard, not as a personal compliment, but as a tribute to the great and important electorate that 1 have the honour to represent. A perusal of the reference to proposed legislation in the Governor General's Speech shows that the session promises to bo one of great moment to Australia. The subject which appears to me to be of. outstanding importance is that of, the Imperial Conference. The announcement that the Prime Minister proposes to represent Australia at that Conference has given universal satisfaction in Australia. The chief subject to be dealt with at the Conference will be defence. The time has come when Australia, together v/ith the other partners in the great commonwealth of nations called the British Empire, must seriously face this question. Australia must be prepared to play her part, and do her share as a partner. We must all realise that, times have changed, and that methods which were serviceable yesterday will certainly not be adequate for the contests of tomorrow. We, in Australia, cannot defend ourselves. It is certain that 5,000,000 people cannot hope to hold this country, particularly in a time of world, crisis, without support from outside. To my mind, the only way in which we can hope to defend Australia and keep it for ourselves is by a well-thou<rht-out and well-considerod scheme of Imperial naval and military defence. B r it a in should be made to understand that iVustralia believes that - I the different portions of the Empire must stand or f all together. I believe in the League of Nations, and I am hopeful that it may some day be able to insure the peace"" of the world, but today it cannot do so. Until the 'day comes when our hopes in this direction are realized we must be prepared to play our part and' make certain that we are well equipped to protect ourselves. Wrapped up in this problem is the important question of migration. Only by bringing people to Australia can we hope adequately to defend this country. We need population, not only for the defence, but for the development of Australia. Some critics urge that the introduction of population will create a surplus of labour and result ultimately in serious and widespread unemployment, with all its attendant horrors. This is a proved fallacy. Much the same cry was raised when labour-saving machinery was applied to production, and I am satisfied that no one in the labour world today would say that the introduction of machinery has had that result. But it is obvious that, hand and hand with migration, there must he some well-considered plan for the development of Australia. There must be a nation-wide stocktaking of our resources, and consideration given to the possibility of their expansion. Such a course would permit of the preparation of some comprehensive plan to absorb the added population-from year to year. No sane Government would in duce people to come to Australia if it did not know what it was going to do with them. When we regard the vast-ness of this continent and consider its productivity, and when we remember our proximity to countries with teeming millions of people, we must realise that our only chance of keeping Australia white, or, perhaps, of keeping it at all, lies in the direction of a great access of population. I trust, however, that the people to he introduced under the scheme now in operation will be of the right type, and not comprise a large proportion of those who, instead of settling upon the land and becoming useful producers, will gravitate to the cities. W it h increased population and a correspbnd : inglyincreased production, we shall be faced with the problem of finding an outlet for our products. I believe the solution of this difficulty will be found in - some well-thought-out reciprocal policy on all economic questions, and particularly a scheme for the development of trade within the Empire. Such a policy will enable us satisfactorily to dispose of ' our primary products, such as wheat, wool, beef, butter, and cotton, to mention only a few of them, as well as our manufactured articles. Australia willingly and ungrudgingly - played her part as a component part of the Empire during the recent war, and would do so again if necessity arose. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to suggest that in some such Empire development scheme this country is entitled to better consideration. all know that quite recently important contracts for the supply of beef for the British Army went to America. Britain must be told, in no uncertain' voice, at the approaching I m perial Conference, that the prosperity of the Empire is wrapped up in the progress of the Empire as a whole. I desire now to refer to the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. have watched with great pleasure the progress made by that institution under the able administration of the Governor, the late Sir Denison Miller, and, I feel sure that I am voicing the sentiments of every member of this House when I say that we all deeply regret his untimely death. The proposed reorganization of the Bank and the appointment of a Board of Directors will , I believe, enable the Bank more truly to discharge its functions as^ a national Bank. I believe an extension of its activities to the primary producers is essential to the prosperity of the country. At this point I desire to stress the claims of my own State, with its special and peculiar tropical interests, for representation on the Board. I was pleased to notice in His Excellency's Speech that the Government pose to concentrate on the construction of the first section of the North-South way line by the continuation of the existgreater ing railway as far as Daly Waters. hope that the line will be deviated that point into Queensland, which is the natural outlet for the Northern No less than four-fifths of the population During of Aust - alia is centred on the Mr J. b'rancis.' sea-board."" If the line be deviated, as I suggest, through western Queensland, it will traverse some of the best grazing lands in the whole of Australia. Such a scheme will , in my opinion, go a long way towards solving the problem of - Northern Territory development. It should be remembered also that the Public Works Committee recently concluded an exhaustive investigation into the merits of the rival routes, and came to the conclusion that the time was not opportune for the construction of an expensive line connecting the Northern Territory with South Australia. While on this question of railways I would like to say that,- in my opinion, the present time is not favourable for altering the whole of the railway We systems of the Commonwealth to a uniform gauge connecting the capital cities. I believe that the new proposals, as outlined by the Prime Minister, will serve the needs of Australia for the time being, and at the same time open up for development a large area of new country. I am personally acquainted with a great portion of the country to be traversed by the Kyogle-Beaudesert-Brisbane line. This railway will be almost, entirely, developWe all mental, and will serve an immense area of undeveloped land. I am exceedingly pleased that in connection with Canungra, Beaudesert, and . other saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland, the Government have been bold enough to declare for the disposal of the mills. They have taken the only reasonable course open to them. I trust, .however, that there will be no undue delay in finalizing the tenders, and that shortly we shall hear that the wheels of industry in those areas have been set.in motion again. I wish now to refer to a question of vital importance, not only to my own State, but to the whole of Australia, namely, the position of the sugar industry, which ranks amongst the largest of our primary-producing interests. The pro- Prime Minister, when speaking recently in Brisbane on this matter, saidrail- Economically, the sugar industry is of even importance to the nation than a superI ficial examination of trade statistics would ind i e te. For it should always be remembered from that, if S'iÂ»ar were not nroduced in Australia, from Â£5.000,000 to Â£6,000,000 would have to Territory. be rem-'tted each year to foreign countries, which buy in return scarcely any of our goods. the Government-control period just exeastern piring, over Â£47,000,000 was thus kept and spent in Australia in respect of the locallygiuwn tonnage. l'he naliim.ll or political significance nf the industry is even more arresting tu the mind. In ti.is regard the sugar industry stands in a un.qiie position in Australia-to r it is the sole industry of any magnitude at all that has been successfully carried on in those bar North co.istul lands that are ol sueh strategic importance to the White Australia policy. Cooking at the map observers will notice that the Northern Territory .is practically in the same Utitude as Cairns, innisfail, Mossman, Herbert River, and other very large closelysettled sugar districts. Yet the Territory's white population is lower than it was thirty years ago, and the problem uf developing it seems as difficult of solution as ever. On the other hand, the sugar districts mentioned have witnessed constant suhstantial increases in farms, commerce, and population. The Prime Minister's statement is, T think, sufficient justification for the claims by the growers of Queensland the industry should be stabilized. I also remind honourable members that the 1912 and 1920 Royal Commissions recognised the obvious fact that the continuance of the sugar industry"" waa bound up with the very existence of Australia as a nation. The policy of the Government as announced recently in Brisbane is far from satisfactory to the people of Queensland, and I earnestly request them to reconsider their proposals with a view to extending the embargo on the importation of sugar for a period of at least five years, or, as an alternative, that adequate Tariff protection be given to insure the preservation of the industry. Stability is essential for its progress. It is very gratifying to know that there has been a wonderful increase in the production of cotton in Australia. I desire to express my gratification at the announcement that the Government intend to enter into a joint agreement with the States to encourage this new and important industry by a guarantee, and by otherwise .safeguarding it . speak on. this question in the light of knowledge and experience, gained in m y own electorate, where, despite a very severe drought, through which we have just passed, cotton of the highest grade has been produced in large quantities. This industry, I predict, is destined to bring about a great change in the land settlement policy of Australia. I express my gratification at the announcement made in H is Excellency's Speech that the Government w i ll introduce a measure to liberalize and increase old-age and invalid pensions. I am pleased also to observe that it is proposed to introduce, in the interests of the returned soldiers, a Bill to amend certain provisions of the War Service Homes Act, In conclusion, I have only to say that 1 appreciate very much the new policy which the Government has adopted oftaking the people into its confidence in respect to all national questions. It is imperative that the public should be given the fullest information concerning all matters that affect the national well-being.  - In rising to second the motion moved so ably by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr J. Francis), I desire to say that I also take it as a compliment that to my electorate that I have been selected by the Government to discharge this duty. I remember that when we mei here, not very long ago, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) twitted the Government in a witty and sarcastic speech, declaring that Hi s Excellency's Speech at the opening of the first session contained but very little. That charge cannot be laid against the Speech which we are now considering. It may well be said of it that it is full measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, "" One important matter in His Excellency's Speech to which I should like to refer is the statement that the Government intend to take steps for the abolition of dual income taxation. At the present time the Commonwealth collects taxation indirectly through the Customs, and directly from the individual by levying, as do the States, a graduated income tax. . W it h the right hand the Commonwealth takes toll from the individual, while, with the left it pays back some of that toll in the shape of the per capita I can grant to the States. The public, . no doubt, is full y conscious of any extortion that is practised by the right hand, but is equally forgetful of any benefit handed out by the left. One is reminded that the Government in the past has at least been carrying out the scriptural injunction, "" Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth."" The Commonwealth Government has been incurring 'the odium of collecting a certain amount of revenue which the State Governments have had the privilege of expending. By the abolition of dual taxation, we shall . adhere to the principle that the Government which collects taxation should spend it-that any money spent by a Government must be collected by that Government. The duplication of taxation is indefensible. We have at the present time an army of Federal and an army of State tax gatherers, both operating in the same field, and it cannot be denied that if the people are tired of the waste which this duplication .involves, they are still more tired of having to fill in separate schedules based on different methods of assessment. The practice has to cease. Much has been said regarding the necessity of abolishing this duplication of taxation. It has been spoken about from many platforms, and it is gratifying to know that today the proposal is getting beyond the oratorical stage and is being raised into, the more rarefied atmosphere of action. Simplicity is a merit in mechanism, and it is equally meritorious in respect of taxation methods. The abolition of this duplication will naturally involve, on the part of the Commonwealth, the giving up of the power to levy income tax on individuals which the States have so long held. The Commonwealth will retain the whole of the Customs revenue, part of which it now hands over to the States under the per capita agreement, and will cease to impose income tax on individuals. It will confine itself to the collection of income tax from companies at the source, by means of a flat rate. The flat-rate system is carried out successfully today in New South Wales.. A certain degree of criticism has beeu levelled against the flat-rate method of collecting income tax. It has been said that, as compared with the - scientific method of income tax collection, operated by the Commonwealth today, it is unjust in its incidence; but, although on the surface there may be an appearance of injustice, in actual fact there is little, any. I was informed today by an accountant of many years' experience that he does not know of one case of a small holder of shares in a company which will be taxed under the flat-rate system now proposed, whose income is low enough to - be exempt from taxation under the present system. Doubtlesss, the scheme will involve an increase of income taxation on the part of the State Governments in order that they may recoup themselves what they  will give up by the abolition of the per capita grant. But even if the State Governments should increase their income taxation to an amount equal to the income tax at present levied by both the State and Federal authorities, the individual income taxpayer will at least be able to rejoice in the fact that he will receive only one assessment, and will so be spared much trouble and harassment. Another point worthy of notice is that while this scheme will, not involve any increase in the cost of collection to the States, it will be an immense saving to the Commonwealth. It will be just as easy for the States, should they have to increase their income taxation, to send out an assessment for, say, Â£10 instead of Â£5, or for Â£20 instead of Â£10. It will cost no more in paper, ink, stamps, or effort than it costs now to send out a claim for the smaller amount. Another feature of His Excellency's Speech which commends itself to thinking men is the promise that provision will be made for compulsory sinking funds, for loan redemption purposes, on the part of both the State and Federal authorities. This is but prudent finance. Great strides are apparently to be made in the near future towards doing awav with duplication, and I hope the effort will also embrace joint electoral rolls. Mention has been made of cotton, and the fact that the Government have made arrangements with the States to do something to encourage its growth in Australia. The world shortage of wool and the prospect of good prices for wool being obtained for quite a number of years offer probably the best insurance we could have 1 against any considerable drop in the price of cotton. The value of the one sympathetically helps to raise the value of the other, .and I hope we shall see in the growing of cotton the establishment if of another great Australian industry. The House will welcomt \he assurance that it is to have placed before it the agenda for both the Empire and the Economic Conferences, at which we expect to be represented by the Prime Minister. We must realise that Australia's defence and future safety are inseparably connected with those beneficent t'es which bind Australia, loosely, yet firmly, to the Motherland, and that it would he wise to defer until the return of the Prime Minister from the Imperial Con-"" ferencjc any expenditure on defence which this Parliament in its wisdom might consider it advisable to make. Mention of the Economic Conference gives rise to the hope that, in future, sentiment may go hand in hand with trade, and that preferential trade within the Empire may soon be established. That which has b^en described as "" the crimson thread of kinship,"" and the knowledge of common sacrifices made, should surely be more potent factors in determining the course of future trade relations than any consideration affecting British capital in vested iru foreign countries. I am glad that we are to 'be full y represented at the League of Nations. agree with every word uttered in regard to this subject by the mover of the motion. It is our duty as a nation to do all that we can to deprecate any attempt that may be made to belittle the League of NTations. Despite its present limitations, it is today the hope of the civilized w o i l ' l . Its weakness at the moment lies apparently in the fact that some great nations are holding aloof from it ; but I hope the time will soon come when it will be a league of all the nations. Looking back at the history of the world's quarrels, we find that they began between in dividuals-betwee n Cain and Abel-and that thereafter we had families, then clans, then small nations, and, later still, larger and larger combinations fighting against each other. Law has sufficed to restrain, to a great extent at any rate, fighting between man and man, family and f a m l y , clan and clan-as in the case : of the Wars of the Roses-and today there is very little warfare carried on between small nations. The tendency has been for small groups to join forces and to make war upon a larger scale. Surely, if law in the past has sufficed, step by step, to make it more and more difficult for war to be carried on as between individuals, as between families, clans, and small States, it should not be impossible in the future for international law to supplant force in the sphere of world-wide warfare. Robert Cecil is regarded as being, perhaps, one of the greatest exponents of the League of Nations. Hie has done much to build up its constitution, and is particularly optimistic as to its future. We in Australia can only hope that his optimism will be justified, and that the League will yet become a migh y1 instrument for the prevention .of war. have in this Parliament a new member' who is an eloquent and able exponent of the League of Nations; and I may be permitted to express the hope that during the session we shall have the pleasure of listening to himon the subject. A measure is proposed for the liberalizing of old-age pensions. In the present system there are many anomalies which need rectification, and one which appeals particularly to me lies in the fact that an old man, who is capable of doing a little work intermittently, and is thereby madeto feel that he is still a useful memI ber of society, is penalized to some extent if he earns something in that way. To penalize a man who thus raises his income a little above the standard laid down as the limit , means that, we destroy incentive and do something to paralyze energy. I am particularly pleased to note that a Royal Commission is to be appointed to inquire into certain phases of the War Service Homes scandals. This proposal, I am sure, must be appreciated by every lover of clean administration. If unsavoury facts are elicited, and justice is meted out without - fear or favour, it will redound to the credit of the Government; if , on the other hand, nothing amiss is found, all the better for Australia's reputation for commercial morality. Whichever may be the result, such an inquiry will, at least, allay any possible suspicion that there is something t.n hide. .The Government announces its intention to co-operate with the States in immigration schemes for land settlement. As one who is on the land, I should like to say that there are four necessities for successful land settlement)-fon r necessities apart from hard work. These are: cheap money, reduced Tariff burdens on the staple necessaries of primary production, cheaper freights, and more markets. In Victoria many returned soldiers in the larger dairying districts are putting up a treLord mendous struggle against a heavy interest load. I mention this because I wish the Government, in any financial arrangements they may make for soldier settlement, to do the utmost in the way of making available cheap money to ' the States for that purpose, on condition that the. States themselves make further sacrifices in interest to the soldier - L realise that the conditions laid down for soldier settlement are entirely a matter for the States; but I take the opportunity to mention the Commonwealth's provide cheap money, because there seems to me to be a very intimate connection between the success or failure of our soldier settlement and the success or failure of our future immigration land settlement. If Â° there be any general exodus from their ' blocks, that more to hurt our immigration than anything else could. mpdiately be sa d, "" If your own diggers cannot make good, what is the use of now chums trying?"" ' Cheaper arc particularly necessary, more necessary, perhaps, today, than ever before. ""We in Australia are handicapped, pared with' Canada or the Argentine, in sending our goods to Great owing ro the fact that we are separated by 12,000 miles of water. the Argentine are much nearer to Britain than we are. We cannot hope to have freights as low as theirs, so far as Great Britain is concerned; and I am particularly glad that the. Government nounce their intent'on to do something in the direction of subsidizing to the East. We have a geographical advantage over Canada and the so far as China and India are concerned. We are much nearer to those ports than either of those two countries; yet, at the present t mc, we find that the freight from Australia higher than those ruling from the more distant places. Under such conditions it is impossible for Australia to do bus'ness to any extent with the East. factors contribute to cause high and, possibly, not the least is the higrh port charges. It may surprise orable members, as it certainly me to learn recently, that, if a ship of 9,000 tons net spends three, days at each of the principal Australian mantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Brisbane-it pays something Â£2,000 in port dues. Those charges must have a very considerable - effect freights. H'gh freights have had a great deal to do with the enormous of the fruit industry, in which a large  proportion of our returned soldiers are engaged. The Treasurer's statement made some little time ago in regard to the large losses on the F r u it Pools was sad reading, but we have to realise from obligation to that statement that, even had nothing whatever been paid for the f r u it , there still would have been a great loss. This proves that any spoon-feeding has really been given to the secondary end of the schemes .for industry, and not to the grower. H a d should the grower provided the f r u it to the of soldiers canning factories for nothing, the wholo would do of the price obtained would still have hefii schemes insufficient to meet the demands of this It would im- secondary end. There is an urgent ne-d for new markets, and the scheme for subsidizing ships seems to open up prospects freights in that direction. In China and India there are immense populations. It has been said that the people of China are as com- too poor to purchase Australian f r u it ; but the population there is given as beBritan, tween 400,000,000 and 600.000.000, or something like thirty-four people to the Canada apd square m i l e; and, even assum'ng that only 5 per cent, of this population are sufficiently well-to-do to purchase our products, there is still au immense market. Mr H . Louey Pang, in an adan- dress he gave recently on the prospects of an Australian f r u it trade in China, shipments said that the Chinese have not yet learnt the art of f r u it cultivation, and that Argentine, Australian apples and oranges bri;:g high prices there. He also said that Eastern Hong Kong alone, in 1921-22, imported 1,000 tons of sultanas, and China, as a : whole, imported Â£1 000,000 worth of is infinitely fresh f r u it , of which Australia supplied only Â£3,000 worth. These figures show theimmense possibilities ahead of this proposed shipping subsidy for the East. Many It appears that Canada and the Argentine freights, are already subsidizing steamers which go to those markets, so that Australia only hon- proposes to do what is already being done surprised in other parts of the world. An effort will, no doubt, be made to place before the Ministry a schedule of rates at which ports-Fre- Australia could hope to successfully do Sydney, business with the East. To my mind, it over is of no use to subsidize services to the East-to send boats, even with the greatest on regularity-if the question of freights is not first settled. In calling for tenders difficulties f ^ r swh services, freights must be predetermined, and the subsidies based on them. This would make it possible to do business on a successful basis with the East. While such services will, no doubt, occasion loss for the first year or two, regular dependable arrivals of Australian produce, carried in refrigerated space, will gradually build up a regular demand. That this view is shared by prominent exporters is proved by the fact that recently seven or eight exporting firms in this city have appointed a joint agent, at a large salary, to endeavour to open up markets there. This shows that these reputable exporting firms have great faith in the future Eastern trade. It is pleasing to learn that the Government propose to put the Commonwealth Line of Shipping under a non-political Board, that annual balance-sheets are to be placed before. Parliament, and that the value of those ships is to be written down to something like present-day levels. It is difficult to realise what it means to attempt to make a profit on ships which cost in the vicinity of Â£100 a ton. The Moreton Bay, the fine model of which honourable members have seen in the Queen's Hall, cost the Government something like Â£1,250,000, or Â£100 a ton. These figures, of themselves, do not, perhaps, convey much, but when we know that that one ship represents, in interest alone at 5 per cent., over Â£62,000 per annum, or practically Â£200 a day, wo. realise the stupendous cost. The only possible way in which we can hope to show even a bookkeeping profit is by writing down the value of these ships. I am glad that the Government are endeavouring to improve outback postal facilities, and to provide telephonic communication as far as possible. 1 hope that the Government will turn a deaf ear to the advocates of penny postage, which, in my opinion, would mean the curtailment of outback facilities.",17
41,Mr YATES,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Tell that to your Minister, Mr Gibson!  even the honourable member who interjects, has any quarrel whatever with a flat rate of postage-the rate of postage is the same for 1 mile as for 1.000 miles. The principle involved is that sufficient profit must be made on the short-distance postage to cover the loss on the long distance postage;, and it is but the application of the same principle to say that the rate must be sufficiently high to give in the densely-populated areas a profit sufficiently large to cover the inevitable loss of providing the necessary services outback. Brief mention was made in the Governor General's Speech of a Bill having reference to the Tariff Board. I hope that the Government propose to place on that Board a direct representative of primary production. I cast no reflection upon the present personnel of the Board, but I believe that better balanced recommendations would come to the Government if, on the Board, there were a direct representative of primary production. I will not weary the House further, but will conclude by expressing the hope that this session will be remarkable not so much for battles of wits between parties as for the evidence of a desire to achieve something for the good of Australia. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorrow at half-past two o'clock. ADJOURNMENT. DISPUTE , IN COAL MINING INDUSTRYTARIFF BOARD. Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",25
42,Mr CHARLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Hunter) [5.52] - I desire to briefly call attention to the position that obtains in the coal-mining industry. This is a matter that affects the whole of Australia, and if something is not done quickly the consequences may be serious. A dispute has been in existence in the coal-mining industry in New South Wales for six or seven weeks. I have placed the matter before the Prime Minister (Mrl Bruce) both by letter and by deputation, and endeavoured to prevail upon him to intervene in the interests of .the people of the Commonwealth. He promised that he would give consideration to our request; but, up to the present, no action has been taken by the Government. It is to the credit of the leaders of the men that, so far, they have confined the dispute to a certain area; but I do not know how long they will be able to control the position if some action is not taken to put in motion the machinery set up by this Parliament. The (Jominonwealth Parliament passed legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes, in which special recognition was given to peculiar circumstances of the coal-mining industry. 1 read in a recent article in the Age a statement that the miners are making certain demands. They are not making any demands; they are virtually locked out. I have no wish to hide the facts, and I shall briefly state the reasons that led up to the dispute. For some time prior to this question arising, there had been a good deal of feeling against the police magistrate in the district concerned. The shire council had lodged a prosecution against a man for allowing his cattle to stray in the streets of nock. In consequence of a death in the family of the person accused, he was unable to attend the Court, and the prosecuting officer asked the magistrate to ad, journ the case. Despite the extraordinary circumstances which were responsible for the accused's . absence, the magistrate refused to adjourn the case, and fined the man in his absence. That action incensed the miners; ancl when he presided at the Police Court, they refused . to go to work. I do not contend for a moment that they did the right thing. I admit that they acted wrongly. Their proper course was to place their objections before the Justice Department of New South ""Wales. But after having made the initial mistake they presented themselves for work, and the proprietors refused to permit them to go into the mines. As the miners are working under a Commonwealth award it is idle to say that the dispute is purely local, that it does not extend beyond the boundaries of one State, and that consequently the Commonwealth authority has no power to intervene. Although the men did wrong in the first instance, that is not sufficient justification for the refusal of the proprietors to allow them to work now and fov the withholding of supplies of coal the community. There has been a good deal of complaint by the proprietors about an undue number of stoppages in the mines. The miners are endeavouring to discipline their forces, and have decided that in future any member of their organization who stops work without following the constitutional procedure shall Mr Charlton. be fined for a first offence, and for a second offence shall be expefied from the association. A union could not take any stronger disciplinary measures. But the the proprietors say that, unless the men comply with the conditions which they have laid down, the mines shall not be worked. One of those conditions is that the proprietors shall have the right to victimize about eighty men whom they regard as extremists. No union of any standing will allow its members to be victimized in that way, and this Parliament should not permit its legislation to be flouted by the proprietors for purposes of victimization. The duty of the proprietors is to allow the miners to return to work under the award of the Tribunal created by this Cess- Parliament, and if they desire to propose any new conditions they should submit them to the Tribunal for consideration. They are no more justified in locking out the employees than the employees were in stopping work in the first instance. Two wrongs do not make a right. The miners stopped work on one day and then presented themselves at the mines, and there is no reason why this country - should suffer a shortage of coal simply in order that the proprietors may impose upon the men certain conditions.",25
43,Mr MAXWELL,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Did not the chairman of the Tribunal say that ths frequent stoppages of work for minor causes were becoming intolerable?,26
44,Mr CHAELTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Yes, but since then the union has taken the action I have already mentioned to discipline its '' forces. . Further than that no union could go. In regard to the charge of attempted victimization, honourable members may jump to the conclusion thnt there are in the union some 80 or 100 men who are such extrenrsts that they wish to hold up the whole machinery. That is not the case. The trouble is that there are some men of ability who are from prepared, from time to time, to exercise their talents on behalf of their fellowmen. Men of that class are not wanted - by the employers, but I say that it is in the interests of the country that men of ability should have some scope to apply themselves to the betterment of the condition of their fellow-men - The fact that some men do that does not justify the proprietors in. locking out their employees. I venture say that if the lionorable meinour ls orth Sydney (Mr Hughes) were still to assist in settling the dispute. Prime Minister, he, having a thorough knowledge of industrial conditions, would have settled the dispute three or four weeks ago. It is the duty of the present Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) to intersent vene and instruct the chairman of the Tribunal to take action. ""Whilst I admit that the men should not have stopped work, 1 must also remind the House that it has been customary in the mining industry to allow men to resume their emu n t i l it was settled. ployment if they were not away for two days. The present dispute is nothing more or less than a lock-out. The emtions, ployers have seized the chance which men gave them, and the whole country is resumed. suffering in consequence. It is the of the Prime Minister to consider the welfare of the general public. The dispute can be settled very easily if the ment take the right steps now; inaction by the Commonwealth Government will be an invitation to the men engaged in the dustry to extend the trouble - throughout the Commonwealth, rather than continue (Mr Charlton). paying 15 per cent, of their wages to the men out on strike. If the trouble does extend industry will be held up everytry, where, and the industrial life of the comgeneral munity will be paralyzed. I call upon Prime Minister to see that the legislation enacted by this Parliament is put into character. operation ; the proprietors should be told that if the men are prepared to work under' the award of the Tribunal the mines should be thrown open to them.",26
45,Mr MANNING,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Do you say ' that the States. mine-ownprs have committed a breach of the award ?,27
46,Mr CHARLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do. Whatever private prop""sals either party has to make should is affected. be placed before the Tribunal for conan sideration.",27
47,Mr MANNING,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"In refusing to allow the men to go to work, except under certhe tain conditions, are the mine-owners comone mitting any breach of the award?",27

The cause was similar to that in the predispute; the proprietors wished to victimize about ten engine-drivers, and to that end held up the whole industry. Judge Scholes said to me, "" Charlton, you will never get this trouble settled."" I replied that I would; and I persevered The proprietors are now keeping the men locked out in order to enforce upon them new condiwhich properly should be referred the to the Tribunal after work has been The whole Commonwealth duty should not continue to suffer on account of this dispute between the owners and the miners when there is constitutional Governmachinery for its settlement.",27
51,Mr WATKI NS,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Newcastle) [ 6 . 3 ] - I in - support the claim that has been made by the honourable member for Hunter When the Industrial Disputes Act was passed, the coal-mining industry was treated as a special indusand in addition to provision for a tribunal there was provision for the the appointment of subsidiary courts or boards to deal with disputes local in Now we are told that r.he Federal authority cannot intervene in this crisis because the actual dispute has not extended beyond the borders of one State. The dispute is affecting all the When a shortage of coal occurs through the stoppage of a big coal-field like Maitland,' every industry and every consumer in several of the States The coal proprietors have Inter-State federation, and so have the coal-miners, and it is idle to say that the dispute is not Inter-State simply because stoppage of work has occurred in only State. It is Federal in essence and in fact, and the Prime Minister would be advised to take the matter in hand. I believe that a settlement could be if he would do so. The parties met in conference after the stoppage, and threshed out the whole question until they came' to this stumbling block, the I matter of the victimization of certain I have been reared in the coal mining industry, and I want to say that. although, the members of a coal-miners' union might give way in regard to wages ancl other conditions, they would. never submit to the victimization of. the men who speak in their interests from time to time. 1 believe that if a tribunal were set to work in connection with this industry, to deal with what the Conference has failed to agree upon, a solution would be arrived at. I hope - the Prime Minister will realise this, because if there is any extension of the trouble I am afraid it will become the most bitter fight that has ever occurred in Australia. I appeal to the honourable gentleman to try to restore harmony to the most important industry of the continent.",27
52,Mr FENTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Maribyrnong) [6.8] I take the earliest opportunity of entering an emphatic protest against one section of this House being allowed the privilege of having the chairman of the Tariff Board at its Caucus for a conference in regard to Tariff matters. I was astounded when I read in the newspapers that this had occurred. ""When we realise that five Ministers and one Government Whip are members of the section of the House in question, it is quite apparent that a certain amount of influence must have been used to secure the attendance of a gentleman who is supposed to occupy a position in which he should exercise an absolutely independent judgment, and should not be interfered with in any way. What discussions took place I do not know, but when this fact is made known to the public, they will surely wonder that this Parliament should permit such a thing. I do not desire to impugn the integrity or the honesty of the chairman of the Tariff Board. I think that he is one of the most honest men we could have for the position. I claim, however, that when a section of the House which has a share in the so-called composite Ministry asks this officer to attend its Caucus meeting either to .divulge information, or to he influenced in a certain direction, it. is unjustifiable conduct. The Government cannot exonerate themselves, because half of the Ministry were present at that particular Caucus meeting. If this practice continues the public will begin to lose confidence in the administration of a most important Board appointed to adjudicate, and hold the scales evenly between various sections of the community. On the precedent which has been established, members of the Labour party would - be periectly justified in asking the chairman of the Tariff Board, or even the whole of the Tariff Board, to come to their Caucus. Had the Labour party done what has just been done, there would have been a howl of indignation throughout the country. What has the government of the country come to when we find a most important officer being summoned to a Caucus meeting by a section of Parliament ? .",28
53,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is not correct. Mr Fenton"" - If this practice is persisted in the people will lose confidence in the Tariff Board. What has been done is utterly unjustifiable. The practice should cease at once if we are to have honest, straightforward, clean government in Australia.",28
54,Mr BRUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Flinders-Prime Minister) [6.12] - I listened very carefully to what the Leader of the Opposition said with regard to the coal situation. The honourable member has written to me with regard to it , and he also saw me on a deputation when I passed through Newcastle, about ten days ago. l t is very desirable that the Government should not appear to be partisans in a dispute which is taking place in the coal-fields near Maitland. The Leader of the.Opposition has shown very clearly where he stands, but the Government do not stand for one party or the other in the dispute. It is merely their task to see that the law is carried out, and, where it can beneficially do so, take any action to try to settle any disputes that may occur in the industrial sphere of Australia. However, the facts should he put clearly, ancl I do not think the honourable member has done that. He has led the House to believe that some action has been taken in the Maitland district which should in the natural course result in the Tribunal, which has been established to deal with the coal industry, being invoked to try to settle a dispute or take some step in regard to it. Mr Charlton.'- I said that the men were working under an award of a Tribunal, and that the Commonwealth ought to see that the law was obeyed by requiring that either party desiring a change or variation in the award should send its claim to the Tribunal for decision.",28
55,Mr URUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,What 1I have said relates to the impression that the honourable member left upon the House.,29
56,Mr CHARLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"No . I put my position very clearly. - Mr Bruce-The portion at the present time is that there has been no breach of any award, and that there is no question which it is legitimately, the function of the Tribunal to consider. Nothing of the sort has occurred. A dispute arose. The men went out. They then saw that they had made a mistake, and presented themselves for employment. The owucrs offered to take them back under the existing award and at the existing rate3 of pay. There was no variation of any award. - Mr CHAKLTON - Ne w conditions were being imposed.",29
57,Mr UUUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"-1I have said that there has been no breach of any award, and that when the men presented themselves for employment the owners said that they were prepared to take them back on the basis of the Tribunal's award, and without any variation of it , but they also said that they were entitled to say whom they would employ.",29
58,Mr CHARLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That is the sting.,29
59,Mr BRUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I think my friend will admit that I am stating the case perfectly fairly. I want to tell the House how the dispute arose, and what the present position is. I do not want it to be suggested that the Government have any leaning to one side or the other. It is no part of a Government's function to concern in industrial disputes. It is a matter for the industry itself, and it is not the function of a Government tp take sides in any dispute. The present M inistry have nointention of doing anything of that sort. The question is whether it is desirable that a Government Bhould take action and intervene in the present dispute. I am not conveying the suggestion that we should not intervene on the ground that the dispute has not extended beyond one State. That is a reason that might be advanced, but I am not advancing it . As the honourable member has pointed out, the coal-mining industry works under a Tribunal aopo'ntÂ».H under an Act passed by the Federal Parliament, but we consider that there has been rather too much interference by Governments in industrial matters.",29
60,Mr CHAKLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The action taken by Mr Hughes saved the Commonwealth during the war.,29
61,Mr BRUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"When industrial disputes are in progress, instead of allowing the ordinary Tribunals to follow their proper course, there has been a tendency to demand chat the Government should intervene. I quite realise that on many occasions during the war certain action was from time to time taken which wns absolutely necessary, and, indeed, in pcrativc, for the safety of Australia; b-;t we shall not get this country running on the best basis if , although we have proper machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, as soon as a certain point is reached in any dispute there is to be a_ clamour for the Government to step in and settle it in a way which, as we have seen, is generally on a thoroughly unsound and uupcouo'nic basis. The position in regard to the coal mining industry at the present time is very serious, not only for the district in which the mines are situated, but also for the State of New South Wales and for Australia as a whole, and the Government are watching that position very closely. If it is necessary for them to take action, we shall takewhatever step is required, but we must be convinced before we a<-t that we can do something for the benefit of the Commonwealth.",29
62,Mr CHARLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"We only ask the honourable member to put the machinery of rhe law in motion, but apparently he itself will not do so.",29
63,Mr BRUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member's interjection requires me to go over the whole ground again. There has been no breach of any award.,29
64,Mr CHARLTON,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Is not the imposit on : of new conditions a breach of an award?,29
65,Mr BRUCE,JOINTCOMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The position is exactly as I have stated it . There has been no breach of an award. I do not want ro argue the question from a partisan standpoint, otherwise I would have to read the findings of Mr Hibble in regard to the perpetual stoppages in this particular industry. All I wish to say is that the Government in this, as in every, other industrial matter, are - quite impartial, and stand neither for one side nor the other. We must allow the methods employed for the settlement of industrial questions in this country to take their ordinary course, because Government interference in such cases very often leads to the most disastrous results. With regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) that something has been done which might possibly lead to the influencing of the mind of the chairman of thu Tariff Board, there is not the slightest foundation for what the honourable member has been saying. All that has happened is that the chairman of the Tariff Board, Major Oakley, was asked by the Minister for Trade and Customs to see the Treasurer with re gar'd to certain matters. Those matters were discussed between the Treasurer and the ""chairman of the Tariff Board, but whether any other members intervened or not I do not know. I can only say to my friends opposite, as the Minister for Trade and Customs has already said, that ifany honourable gentleman is desirous of obtaining information, and it is possible for us to place at his disposal an officer who can help him, we shall be only too pleased to do it. It is regrettable that an attitude should be adopted which suggests that the Tariff Board has become an object of suspicion. Tho-Board is doing valuable work for Australia, and attempts ought not to be made to stultify its efforts by'such suggestions as have been made. Question resolved in the affirmative - - House adjourned at 0.22 p.m.",29
