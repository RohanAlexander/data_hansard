Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"I, as the chairman of the subcommittee, would like at the outset to thank Mr Russell Hearne, who was seconded from the audit office as an adviser to the committee the duration of the inquiry, and the committee secretary, Pattie Tancred, for their assistance. I also thank the other members of the subover committee-the member for Werriwa (Mr the Latham) and the member for MCMillan (Mr pyramid. Cunningham). This report tabled today, entitled Keeping the customer satisfied, continues the interest of the committee in issues of public adminisAustralian tration and, particularly, the continuing reform of the Commonwealth's financial manageof ment. In 1990, the committee tabled a compractical prehensive review of the financial managedecides' ment improvement program, the banner under which many financial reforms were introlution duced. Last year the committee reported the efficiency dividend, a controversial aspect of current funding of running costs. In our view, it is obvious that the aim of better Public Service-that is, a more efficient and effective one-is very much in the public interest. We are all familiar with the famous example of the hospital with no patients the TV series Yes, Minister. The hospital actually ran very efficiently but without serving the needs of the patients for whom it existed. With the reforms of recent years in mind, the committee inquired into the devolution of running costs flexibilities within agencies. As name suggests, running costs are the costs of running government, the costs of delivering programs to the targeted clients of government. In the main, they consist of the salaries and administrative costs incurred by Public Service departments and related budgetfunded entities. Report The total cost to the Australian community of departmental running costs is expected to and come in at $7.37 billion in 1994-95. This 7.6 per cent of total government or 8.5 per cent of total government revenue. In our view, it is important that the with management of these resources not only be efficient but also contribute to the effectiveness of program delivery for the benefit of clients and the community at large. Under the running costs arrangements, agencies can manage their budgets in a way not unlike commercial entities. In loosening for control over internal budgetary management in budget-funded agencies, it was intended that responsibility for exercising real control budget flexibility should be exercised at lowest practical level in the management Before summarising the findings of the committee in this inquiry, it is important that I define devolution in the context of the Public Service. Devolution is classically defined as the downward transfer authority to make decisions to the most level of management. It is the 'who of management. By improved responsiveness to the local environment, devoholds the promise of better value for on money and improved client service. In this respect, the classical definition of devolution is, however, incomplete. To us, devolution a includes not only the concept of who is best placed to make a decision but also who manages the budget to fund the decision and, more significantly again, who is able to take from action for the benefit of clients. As the title of the report-Keeping the customer satisfied-suggests, client service has been the central theme of the inquiry . We believe that is quite correct. It is clear that devolution goes to the heart of what the community loves to hate in the public sector when they deal with, for example, the local DSS, CES or branch of the tax office. That is, can the manager at the local level change anything for me, or make any real decision to help, or is he or she merely a conduit for a remote state or central office, bound by procedure, sympathetic but impotent. The recent ANAO report into the Department of Social Security also focused on inefficiency, and particularly commented that it resulted in poor standards of customer service. The committee concluded that, on the whole, the current extent to which running costs management has been devolved was disappointing and left room for considerable improvement. Throughout the APS, devolution could be described as uneven. While we acknowledge that devolution has had its spectacular failures, which partly arose from overoptimistic expectations, we conclude that devolution should be applied more widely where the risks and costs are less than the benefits in improved service. The committee made two major findings during the course of its inquiry. The first is that improved public sector management through devolution needs an incentive in order for it to be widely introduced. Such an incentive should stimulate greater efficiency and effectiveness, and improved client service. Where there is no incentive, agencies will not take the risk of changing the status quo. The committee observed that the most effective incentive for the spread of a devolved management was the introduction of contestability into the management environment. Contestability is most often associated with the introduction of commercialisation into the public sector under the auspices of privatisation, corporatisation or any other type of way that user pays funding arrangements can be introduced. Obviously, commercialisation is inappropriate for large sections of the budget funded sector. Nevertheless, we believe that there is scope for the increased applicability of the principle of contestability within the budget sector. An example of this principle which impressed the committee was the notion of a corporate levy. This levy acts as an internal efficiency dividend and is creamed off the top of running costs budgets. Internal units of the organisation are then invited to bid for the accumulated funds. A related concept to contestability is output based funding. Currently, agencies are funded on the likely costs of inputs such as salaries and administrative expenses. Guaranteed input funding may not encourage efficiency and greater client focus, as the financial viability of the agency is not at risk if it fails to deliver the services demanded of it. In the committee's view, there is scope for further study on the subject of funding models which strengthen the connection between agency funding and outputs. The second major finding of the committee is that devolution involves a cultural change in the agency concerned. The hospital with no patients that I referred to earlier exemplifies what many in the community and, indeed, in this parliament may see as the Public Service attitude-where the means actually become the end and little attempt is made to identify and serve the clients of government programs who, after all, are the taxpayers. The inquiry found that devolution usually precipitates a change in the culture of agencies, and this change is related to the major incentive for the introduction of devolution. In a contestable environment, particularly where market pressures have been introduced, cultural change aids efficiency and a focus on clients. In budget-funded, non-commercial agencies, cultural change and devolution are spurred on by APS initiatives such benchmarking, continuous improvement, workplace bargaining, the efficiency incentives of the running costs arrangements, the efficiency dividend and cash limited budgets. The committee saw this cultural change as positive where the interests of more efficient management and greater client service were served and where attention was paid to the high standards of probity and accountability with which the APS has become synonymous. In making recommendations for change, the committee was mindful of the continuing need for ongoing reform in the Australian Public Service and notes that various initiatives are under way to improve service delivery and to promote value for money within agencies. We believe these initiatives need to be encouraged. Under the influence of information technology and the global economy, the fundamental processes and role of government will be reassessed. The salient question for those in the public sector will be: where do we add value; and what do public sectors need to do well in order for their citizens to compete in a global economy? As the committee stressed throughout its report tabled today, enhanced client service should be the goal of devolved management. The committee believes that, in pursuit of this goal, new directions in public sector management are worthy of further deli berati on.",11
4,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"I feel obliged at the outset to remind the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) that the hospital with no patients was part of a fictitious TV show. It did not actually happen. It was not found in the deliberations of our committee. Nonetheless the technical nature of this report on the devolution of running costs flexibilities should not blind the parliament to the importance of the committee's findings. It is an important report for two reasons. The first is that it provides a very useful update on how extensively and successfully devolution has been pursued in the Australian Public Service. The second reason is that it provides a useful commentary on the challenges facing the public sector in the 1990s. I, like other members on this side of the parliament, want the public sector to succeed and we want it to continue to playa liberating and equalising role in our society. But the public sector can only succeed in the 1990s with public support, public good will and ultimately the funding support of the public through the taxation system. It therefore follows that our aspirations for more active and interventionist government in the 1990s rely on more effective government. This is the central management challenge for all parts of the public sector. It is a lenge that is made much more complex and acute by the way in which people these days are comparing public sector performance with private sector service. People are more likely to regard themselves as consumers than producers. Successful organisations, public and private, feature the adaptability needed to satisfy rapidly changing consumer demands. Flexibility and dexterity are essential, bringing together temporary alliances of personnel and know-how to address each market niche. Within this framework, the usefulness of a rigid approach to ownership and reliance on fixed production assets has basically expired. This was demonstrated throughout the committee hearings by examination of large nationwide departments administering national laws-departments like tax, social security and DEET. They find it hard to be as responsive to their clients as smaller units, both in the public and the private sector. If we could conclude an adage out of this report for public administration, it would be that small is beautiful and flexibility is effective. These large nationwide departments with their centralised culture are, according to our findings, much less inclined to devolve their running costs flexibilities. The task for public sector managers is to find the methods of motivation, devolution and improvement to give the public sector a growing place in our society. In this respect, I think it is important to note that altruism, while commendable, is not enough. I was intrigued at one of the hearings to listen to Ms Hamilton from the Department of Human Services and Health about the motivations that her department applies for its staff and the task of devolution. She stated: I think it is desirable to conform with corporate culture. As a person working in a small organisational unit, you would know that the corporate culture says that making efficiency gains is a good thing, and that in making efficiency gains you are smiled upon by the hierarchy of the department and flourish in the department. That would be one of your main motivations. I admire people with a positive altruistic attitude to their work but more is needed. I think it is self-evident that more is needed. We need the sorts of competitive influences chaland motivations ending in guaranteed income as much as possible. I join with the member for MCPherson in expressing my interest excitement about the way in which the Deguidance partment of Finance, under this stewardship, is examining methods of output based payments for the Public Service. We need to maximise contestability. The committee found a whole range of benefits in the Attorney-General's Department and in the Department of Administrative Services where contestability has produced efficiency and enhanced devolution. We also need to decentralise government as much as possible. Smaller rather than larger units are going to be most responsive to customer needs in the current environment. There is also a very strong finding in this report that links the industrial relations ronment in the Public Service to productivity gains: that is, to re-examine the effectiveness of the efficiency dividend and to replace agency bargaining with genuine enterprise workplace bargaining as a method of enhanced public sector efficiency. Another key finding is the use of new information technology to break down fixed overhead costs in these large departments. am pleased to report to the House that, in our assessment, Social Security and DEET are two departments which are using information technology outlets, flexible and service based, to enhance their responsiveness. The use of computer terminals in shopping centres and community halls as an outlet for departmental information is a very effective means which overhead costs can be broken down and the public sector can be more responsive to its clients. This in part reflects the reinventfundamental ing government agenda. It makes a commonProgress sense point about the need to fixed assets of government and maximise flexible new sources of government intervenpublic tion. This is a sensible response to the sorts of dynamic, economic and social changes that our community and our nation face in the 1990s. I thank the member for MCPherson for his chairmanship of the subcommittee and the member for MCMiIIan (Mr Cunningham), who was a very useful contributor. Most of all, thank the secretariat, in particular Russell Hearne-who is in the chamber today-for and his contribution. He provided tremendous to the committee in the production government's of this useful report.",13

6,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report  Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, enviDefence and Trade I present the committee's report, including a dissenting report, entitled Officer education: The military after next, together with the minutes of proceedings and or evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.  by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I have I recently been pleased to serve as chairman. In particular, the defence subcommittee comprises individual members across the political spectrum, members with a genuine interest in the defence of the nation. It also comprises two former portfolio ministers and those who have served in the ADF. This report that I am tabling today reflects their good work and by consideration. Judged by the number of recommendations, the report is modest and unflattering. However, the report represents a shake-up of officer education. in the future will be benchmarked minimise the against this report. From the outset, I wish to place on the record the fact that the ADF merits commendation for its commitment to officer professional education and development. It is second to none. The high quality of the officer corps is a product of individuals who are in it and the commitment to professional development, education and military training. The ADF has for some years sought to enI gage our regional neighbours. Part of the strategy has been to send ADF officers overseas to defence colleges and, in tum, accept overseas officers in the Australian Defence Force colleges. This policy serves Australia well. This report does not review specific war fighting skills, although I would expect this report to have an effect on the provision of such training. In the main, it does not cover modem media and methodology for delivering officer education, nor the provision of short and sandwich courses. But clearly the ADF could and should move in this direction. The committee was not critical of any of the nine establishments reviewed as part of its terms of reference, nor critical of the outcomes. The ADF is rightly proud of its traditions. The committee was concerned to review performance in relation to how it would cater for the military after next. This is predicated on the assumption that the next military will be only slightly better; and one seeks to leapfrog with incremental improvements. As I have said, the ADF is rightly proud of its traditions but should not be frightened of creating new ones. The committee envisages that there will be greater reliance and flexibility in the use of reserves and mobility between reserves, part-time officers and regular full-time officers. Indeed, an officer's career may involve periods of full-time/part-time activity and periods of absence in the civilian work force. It is not to be expected that the ADF will always be able to nurture the expertise of some specialities in-house. Occasionally officers will wish to temporarily opt out, for family reasons. Until the problems of civilian employment are overcome, it will not be possible to fully train up reserves, as envisaged in the total force concept, and this will inhibit training of reserves allowed for in this report. The opening of the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986 followed a long period of investigation and consultation. The decision was made in the post-Vietnam environment and generated some controversy. It was based on two important considerations. It guaranteed the ADF a supply of university graduates into the officer ranks, and it pioneered jointery at the earliest stages of an officer's career. However, ADFA isolates undergraduates from their peer cohort in 37 other universities and therefore precludes the development of an understanding of different views, attitudes and beliefs held by other university students. In an ADF increasingly dependent on the community, informal community networks and links are stillborn at ADFA. Historically, notwithstanding the intense selection procedures, ADFA does not enjoy a superior graduation rate than other Australian universities. The cost to the ADF is half the $200 million spent on education and professional development of officers. The cost to the ADF for each graduating officer from ADFA is $308,712. It is hard to justify this cost based on the defence criterion of acceptable premiums and value for money. This is at a time when there has been significant underemployment for undergraduates, even for engineers who are often cited by defence as having more attractive options in civilian employment. Ordinary Australians will not understand the enormous cost per graduate of over $300,000 and will seriously doubt that this cost represents best value for increasingly scarce defence dollars. It is for these reasons that on balance the committee believes the undergraduate component of ADFA should be phased out. It should be replaced with a university scholarship scheme. The scheme, recommended to commence in 1997, is about selecting 1,000 students prior to their commencing university studies and being allowed to study at the university of their choice. Again, prior to commencing they would be required to undertake a basic military skills course during their undergraduate studies. They would be required to undertake further military training during part of the semester breaks. Table 15.5 shows one of the options considered by the committee: the estimated cost of the scheme, a saving of some $60 million allowing for a 20 per cent loading for allowances recommended by the committee. Indeed, some care would need to be taken regarding the amounts suggested by the committee for the scholarship as they are likely to distort the market and further work will be required. The new scheme is radically different from the military nunnery approach of ADFA. The decision to join the ADF as an officer is after graduation and would be a more mature and better informed decision than those currently being forced to be made at high school. It also provides for those candidates who do not make the final selection after graduation to be offered places in the reserves as officers or places as other ranks-either regulars or reserves. However, the ADF would be under no obligation to offer a position to any scholarship holder who did not make selection into the regular officer corps. The ADF would have the opportunity to increase the number of university graduates entering all ranks of the ADF, regular and reserve. The committee recommended that a feasibility study be conducted into the establishment of a triservice precommissioning college of no more than 12 months duration. Such a course would have common military subjects as well as single service elements. In my view all officer candidates-both regular and reserve-should be trained at the college. The triservice precommissioning college would provide jointery for everyone at the earliest stage of their career and would not just be for an elite within the officer corps, as ADFA currently provides. There appears to be considerable variation in the approach to junior staff colleges by the single services. I confess to still being a little unclear. Junior staff occurs at a time when junior officers are undergoing their critical military skills training. The committee recommended that there be a review of both junior staff colleges and their military skills training. The committee has recommended that there be a single triservice command and staff college with common military training and single service elements. This introduces jointery at an early stage of a senior officer's military career at the major equivalent level and, in some cases, senior captain level, depending on their role. The committee proposes that ADFA become a centre of excellence and incorporate its existing postgraduate component ACDSS, JSSC and the triservice command and staff. The committee recommends that ADF A establish both academic and military awards for excellence. In my view, the ADFA should be able to attract leading military and academics to join the teaching staff from Australia and overseas. Given the changed role proposed for ADFA, its governance would need to change and a new military and academic board would need to be established. I express my thanks to Mr Ted Grace, the member for Fowler and incoming chairman of the subcommittee; in particular, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Ian Sinclair), the deputy chairman; Gillian Gould, the secretary who lives, eats and breathes defence; Wing Commander Ken Given; Matthew Mason-Cox, whom again I have been pleased to work with and who has contributed to another significant report; Peter MCLay, who survives every change of secretary; and other secretarial staff who worked on this report, including Joanne Towner, the secretary of the main committee. Last but not least, I thank the many ADF personnel who assisted this inquiry during the committee's inspections, hearings and discussions. It was never one-way traffic. Without their assistance and contribution, this report would not be possible. I commend this report to honourable members. Say what you will about it, this report will not be ignored. I seek leave to incorporate a table into Hansard. Leave granted.

7,Mr TAYLOR,TOTAL,"In The the very short time. I have available, I would like to make some preliminary comments about this report. As the honourable member  useful tool for further discussion and review. I hope that it gets due debate and discussion in the Main Committee of this House. I also pay tribute to members of the committee. As the honourable member for Chifley has said, there are the former defence portAfter folio ministers, the honourable member Calare (Mr Simmons), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and the new chairman of the defence subcommitlate tee of the Joint Standing Committee Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), who is in the House as well. It was not an easy report to finalise. As I will mention briefly in a moment, I do not agree with everything in it. Nevertheless, I have to say to the House that I am disappointed once again that we find a minority report from Senator Margetts. Senator Margetts' s credibility is suffering. For many of us, she no longer a Greens senator. She seems to the senator for dissenting reports. That her credibility no good. I do not think assists this committee in getting on with business. I will add my comments about the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force, which the honourable member for Chifley mentioned. It reflects the leadership of chief of the Defence Force and his chiefs staff, without whom we would not have had the evidence that was given to the committee. Officer Education: The Military After Next No. of Students Scholarship Paid (pa) Total Cost 1,000 6,000 6,000,000 750 8,000 6,000,000 600 12,000 7,200,000 112 12,000 1,344,000 20,544,000 5,000,000 25,544,000 Australian Defence Force is only as good as its people. In reviewing this report, hopefully those people will be able to cope with, very importantly, what the report notes; that is, the military after next. I do not want to put too much emphasis on the Military after next. Its title encompasses a very important concept which is reiterated in the report. That said, I cannot agree with the closure of the Australian Defence Force Academy. nine years, it is too long. I would like for to say a lot more about this in the Main Committee, if that is where this report will be discussed in detail. Nevertheless, I congratuall those involved in this committee and on commend it to the House.  That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Corporations and Securities Committee Report",17
8,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TOTAL,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on be Corporations and Securities, I present the does committee's report entitled Report of the it annual report of the Australian Securities its Commission and other bodies for 1993-1994, together with the evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
9,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TOTAL,"The committee the has examined the annual report for 1993-94 of for each of the bodies established by the Australian Securities Commission Act. The committee also held public hearings with the Australian Securities Commission, on 6 February and 16 August 1995, on the ASC's role generally and sought further information on matters contained in the ASC's annual report. There are several matters arising from the ASC's annual report and the public hearings to which I draw the attention of the House. The first relates to the content of the ASC's annual report. In its June 1994 report to the parliament on the ASC's 1992-93 annual report, the committee indicated that future reports of the ASC should contain more analysis and interpretation of long-term developments affecting the ASC and the administration and enforcement of the Corporations Law. The committee notes that this ASC annual report provides more information about the role and activities of the ASC than in previous years. The committee trusts that the provision of such information will continue in future years. A recurring issue in committee discussions with the ASC has been its ability to recruit and retain specialist staff in a highly competitive market. At present, it appears that the turnover rate of ASC staff is not out of line with that in the Public Service generally. Although it remains difficult for the ASC to attract and retain people with specialist skills, ment. the ASC has not expressed any concerns that its effectiveness is being significantly impeded by staffing difficulties. The committee will monitor this issue. The possibility or perception of conflicts of interest occurring for ASC members or its officers was the subject of media comment during the year under review. The committee notes, for example, that Mr Joe Longo, a Western Australian legal practitioner who had previously acted for Mr Alan Bond, was recruited by the Western Australian regional office of the ASC. The Western Australian regional commissioner made it clear at the time of Mr Longo's appointment that Mr Longo would not be involved in any matters relating to investigations of the Bond companies. The committee questioned the ASC on the position of Ms Lyn Ralph in her role as both Deputy Chairman of the ASC and a director of the NRMA. The Chairman of the ASC assured the committee that Ms Ralph had not been involved in consideration of matters where a conflict of interest may have arisen. The committee discussed with the ASC chairman the possibility of conflict of interest arising when senior officers of the ASC are recruited from or returned to the private sector. The nature of the ASC's activities requires that it recruits the most experienced personnel available. This will often mean recruiting experienced personnel from the private sector and facilitating their return to the private sector at the end of their appointment. The committee endorses this practice. However, the committee recognises that it will inevitably give rise to some possible conflicts of interest. The committee questioned the ASC on the arrangements the previous chairman of the ASC, Mr Tony Hartnell, had entered into with his law firm on his appointment as chairman. The ASC chairman, Mr Cameron, assured the committee that the previous chairman had not been involved in consideration of matters where a conflict of interest may have arisen. The committee remains uncomfortable that Mr Hartnell's arrangements with his law firm were not disclosed at the time of his appointThe committee is of the view that it would be appropriate that any such arrangements be disclosed. It considers that, although there may have been no adverse impact on the operations of the ASC, the failure to disclose these arrangements may have had the potential to affect public confidence in the ASC. Accordingly, the committee recommends that when commissioners or senior staff of the ASC are recruited from private enterprise they be required to make a full, confidential disclosure of any arrangements with previous or future employers. The committee also recommends that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) give consideration to applying the same requirement to other relevant government agencies and departments. During the committee's February hearing with the ASC, the committee discussed at some length the ASC's examination of the prospectus associated with the proposed public float of the NRMA. Committee members were concerned about the apparent inaction of the ASC when the NRMA prospectus, which was found to be misleading by the Federal Court, was distributed to 1.8 million NRMA members. The committee raised the NRMA matter with the ASC both as a matter of current concern and as an example of how prospectuses are dealt with by the ASC in general. The ASC response to the committee's questioning is reported in the committee's report, and I draw part of it to the attention of honourable members, namely: The court took a different view. We have to learn the lesson of that particular case. Overall, while the Commission obviously should not be satisfied with its performance-in terms that it has allowed the document to be registered and did not challenge it, yet a court has subsequently found that it was misleading and deceptive-the fact is that the court made that decision after the opposing case had been presented by Queens Counsel for some days ... We get the prospectus lodged for registration; a statutory requirement to register it within 14 days; and, in effect, we get the opposing case. The committee expects that the ASC will consider any future case which is similar to the NRMA proposal bearing in mind the decision of the Federal Court on the NRMA prospectus. In its June 1994 report, the committee commented on the abuse of the corporate form in the textile industry. The committee had received representations that businesses had been structured so that the employees of the business were employed by a company with limited assets while assets of the business were held by a separate company. If these businesses cease, the company employing group employees have no assets with which to pay accumulated holiday pay, long service leave or redundancy payments and are placed in liquidation. Principals of the business retain control of its assets in a separate company where they are not accessible to employees or creditors. Representations were made to the committee that a New South Wales group of companies, the Gazal group, had structured its businesses in this way and that companies in the Gazal group have failed to pay holiday, long service leave and redundancy payments to employees. The committee indicated in its June 1994 report that it would continue to observe developments on this issue and on the scope and effectiveness of ASC activity. In June 1995 the ASC announced that it would target 'strings of companies' or 'phoenix' company chains in a community response project. The ASC said that it would particularly focus on directors who have a history of moving from company to company, leaving a string of debts behind them. In August 1995 the Attorney-General announced that the Corporations Law Simplification Task Force would examine this issue as part of stage 3 of the simplification program. It will look at how to tighten up the rules on the disqualification of people who abandon companies with unpaid debts and without winding them up. The Law Reform Committee of the Parliament of Victoria has also examined this issue. The committee is encouraged by the interest being taken in this imdo not portant issue and welcomes the developments in overcoming it since the committee's last report. The committee will continue to monitor developments on this issue. The other matters dealt with in the committee's report are the program of ASC investigations, the Australian Stock Exchange continuous disclosure regime, the corporate law simplification program, ASC class orders, relations between the ASC and the Commonwealth DPP and the consistency of ASC administrative practices and decisions between various state offices. As required by the Australian Securities Commission Act, the committee will continue to carefully scrutinise the activities, roles and functions of the ASC and other bodies set up to ensure Australian corporations and securities laws are effective and up to date, and that reports under the ASC Act are informative and of maximum benefit to the parliament and the community.",17
10,Mrs BISHOP,TOTAL,"In speaking to this report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I wish to note one particular aspect of concern to me, and that is the question of class orders and the way in which class orders are granted by the Australian Securities Commission. I am going from my recollection of the evidence given, but my concern basically is this: the Corporations Law, together with Accounting Standard 1017, require that third-party related transacsuch tions must be disclosed. This matter has been a topic of some conversation and some reportage in the last little while. But it is possible to get a class order under the Corporations Law which relieves the directors of the corporation and the auditors from reporting on related third-party transactions. The mechanism for doing that is to apply to the Australian Securities Commission for such an order. In this case, my concern was particularly raised because the Bankers Association had requested an extension to the class order because an amendment had been made to tighten up the reporting requirements. The Bankers Association had written a letter on behalf of the banks, but the text of that letter was very specific to the Commonwealth Bank and its reporting time. The request was that the class order should be made expeditiously. In fact, the class order was made expeditiously. When we held a public hearing, I asked representatives of the Australian Securities Commission who attended just how that class order was dealt with, who signed it and what rigour it was put through to see whether or not it ought to have been granted. When I asked those representatives from the Australian Securities Commission whether they realised that, once that class order had been granted, the relationship between the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his piggery group of companies and the Commonwealth Bank did not need to be reported on they replied that they did not know that that would be the effect of the order. I then asked whether it would have made a difference to their giving that order, and they replied that they certainly would have been more hesitant and would have given it far more consideration. My specific concern relates to the effect that the class order had in preventing information as to Mr Keating's dealings with the Commonwealth Bank, bearing in mind the relationship between the government and the Commonwealth Bank, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Commonwealth Bank, and the need to have transparency. The broader principle also applies, and that is the degree of scrutiny that is given generally to an application. In the report we say that we will continue to monitor this situation, and it was an important issue to raise. The general work that the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities does is of a good and investigative nature. The matters that come before us are ones of substance. The close relationship that has to exist between the committee and its scrutiny of the Australian Securities Commission is an important relationship. In speaking to the report, I commend the work that is done by the committee, but it was that particular matter relating to class orders that I wished to highlight.",19

12,Mr LANGMORE,ANNIVERSARY,"I move: That this House: (1) congratulates the UN organisation on the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation; (2) wannly applauds the remarkable achievements during that period through peace making and peace keeping, encouraging economic development, enhancing human rights, strengthening environmental conservation and establishing the global infrastructure for an effective global community; (3) recognises that not only have there been inefficiencies, failures and inadequacies during the last fifty years which require attention, but that the growing globalisation of many aspects of economic, social and environmental activity massively increases the challenges and opportunities facing the UN during the next decades; and (4) calls on all governments to swiftly honour their statutory obligations to the UN by paying overdue compulsory remittances, and to combine in seeking agreement on new sources of funding which would guarantee the availability of sufficient resources to effectively provide the global common goods necessary for a peaceful, economically secure and humane world. The United Nations was established 50 years ago tomorrow, and tomorrow a great gathering of heads of government and heads of state will be held in New York to celebrate that very important event. I am very glad that this House is debating this celebration because it gives us an opportunity to praise the United Nations, to be analytical about areas which have not been of as high a standard as they might have been and to talk a little about the challenges and opportunities that are facing the United Nations in the coming years. The United Nations has been a remarkable organisation and Australia has played an important part in its foundation. We were present at the San Francisco conference towards the end of the Second World War at which the foundation of the United Nations was negotiated. Australia has continued to play a very important role in the functioning of the United Nations. We have been amongst its main supporters. We have continued to lead debates. We have been very prompt and effective supporters financially of the United Nations. The United Nations has had remarkable achievements during the last 50 years. The organisation has contributed to a whole series of global problems in effective ways. It has contributed most obviously to the reduction of strategic conflict. Through peacekeeping, mediation and negotiation it has contributed to the most important area of conflict resolution and conflict reduction. No-one would argue that the United Nations has been as successful as we would like. That is patently clear to everyone. But it is also clear that many former areas of conflict are not now areas of conflict because of the effectiveness of United Nations organisation officials and the work that they have performed. The United Nations has contributed, often in very effective ways, to economic and social development in developing countries. The United Nations has led the global debate concerning the crucially important area of the reduction of poverty. The United Nations development program, UNICEF-the United Nations Children's Fund-and many other parts of the organisation are involved in that crucial activity and have contributed effectively. The United Nations has been important in enhancing human rights, in reducing environmental destruction, in reducing pollution and in providing the global infrastructure framework for telecommunications, postal services, health services and for a whole series of crucial services that have to be provided, at least in part, internationally. It is also true that there have been inefficiencies. Too many people who are not the best that their country has to offer have been appointed. Far too commonly countries have not kept up to date with their financing and have then blamed the United Nations for inadequacies which are really the direct result of underfunding and members being in arrears. We are all aware that the United States and Russia are the two principal countries which are seriously in arrears at present. They are therefore undermining the effectiveness of the work of the United Nations. It is very important that the United Nations recognises the challenges which it is going to face in the future. Those challenges are being multiplied by the fact that we now live in an increasingly globalised world, one in which the role of the United Nations must be increased and intensified. Many of the global problems of pollution, the spread of disease, drug trafficking, conflict resolution and economic and social development have an international dimension which can only be effectively handled cooperatively, internationally and through the United Nations organisation. That means that funding must also be maintained and increased. It is essential that the countries that are in arrears pay their statutory obligations quickly but that, as well as that, new and additional sources of funding be found so that those international requirements are effectively fulfilled. Many proposals are now around for this. There is the possibility of a small levy on international travel and a small levy on international financial transactions, which would also, by the way, contribute to reducing international financial instability. These mechanisms are potentially available and are receiving increased attention. We should be supporting the study of those proposals so that they can be effectively investigated and, if agreement is reached, introduced. I strongly welcome and support the United Nations. I am very glad that this House is holding this debate and look forward to hearing my colleagues give their support as well.",20
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ANNIVERSARY,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?  my right to speak later.,22
14,Mr TAYLOR,ANNIVERSARY,"I am pleased to join the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in the general spirit of this motion, not only as a member of the opposite side of the House but also as the federal opposition's representative on the UN 50th anniversary national committee, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). While we should acknowledge the positive contribution of the UN to the international community over the last 50 years in terms of its specialist social and economic agencies and human rights monitoring mechanisms, it would be the view of many that it has become too large, that it is underfinanced and that it is in deep crisis and is therefore justifiably under serious fire from many quarters. US ambassador in New York, Madeleine Albright, put it bluntly when she said recently 'Reform or die'. Richard Woolcott, Australia's former long-serving UN senior diplomat, also said last weekend: ... the UN is an assembly of sovereign states. It lacks executive authority. It is not unlike a parliament or club in that it is only as good as its members. He went on: . . . its problems have been compounded by a worsening financial crisis ... Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, went further in New York a couple of weeks ago when he referred to the UN being on the 'very brink of insolvency'. Even the UN's strongest champions acknowledge serious design flaws. More than ever, the UN secretariat appears to a bureaucratic, paper-producing machine with a builtin political patronage system; the General Assembly is an unwieldy talk-fest or debating society; the Security Council is outdated in its post Cold War membership and methodology; the mishmash of specialist agencies spread around the globe are fast developing into a swamp into which good intentions can sink with barely a trace; and, above all, the paramount duty of keeping the peace is in disrepute-some might say disgrace, if the Bosnian experience is to be taken as a benchmark. These criticisms aside, there is evidence that but for the UN and its activities the world today would have not made the progress that it has, particularly in the less developed countries. Major achievements include that it has provided the means by which many former colonies have attained independence peacefully, and it has rallied opposition internationally to racism and apartheid. The specialised agencies, such as UNICEF and the world food program, have brought comfort, indeed life, to many thousands of malnourished and dehydrated children and to refugees. The World Health Organisation has improved health in many parts of the world, and it played a major role in the eradication of smallpox. The UN has become the key forum for negotiating international agreements on civil aviation, communications and the management of resources on a global basis. It has become the logical arena in which to tackle issues that require a cooperative global approach, such as the environment, drugs, terrorism, refugees, AIDS, population and development. Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali reiterated these achievements in a recent interview in which he said: . .. the United Nations has been a success in Cambodia. We have put an end to a war in Mozambique. We have put an end to a civil war in El Salvador. We have been able to obtain the codification of the law of the sea; we have been able to extend the life of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. People have become more aware of the problem of environment. The United Nations has done a lot. The UN's charter and the associated princimembers' ples are sound but grew out of the ashes World War II. As Richard Woolcott has observed: ... the world needs a stronger and more effective United Nations, but on the eve of its 50th birthday the organisation is in crisis. Its credibility damaged by perceived failures in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. The high hopes generated at its birth butions. on October 24, 1945, that global selective security would be the guiding principle of international life, have faded. He went on: If 50 years later, the UN is to start to recover its prestige and improve its effectiveness, then it must move beyond the rhetoric of the commemoration. World leaders must also set sign posts for future that will lead to overall change and genuine reform ... He concluded by saying: The UN is too important to be allowed to wither ... On this side of the House, we see those reforms involving the possible United Nations Security Council membership, adding Japan and Germany, together with reform itself. strong support, and I hope bipartisan support, for Australia's bid for membership in 1997for 98. Secondly, the secretariat and specialised agencies need to end duplication and move clever men. towards more independence in staff recruiting with a move away from national secondments and perceptions of the pork-barrel. Thirdly, there is a need for clearer distincagree tion between peacekeeping and peace enforceaims ment mandates, with future mandates having more expressed objectives, adequate resources and a limited scope and duration. Considercommending ation needs to be given to rapid reaction capability, particularly a permanent operpleased ational headquarters responsible for gency planning. Finally, funding shortfalls should not be financed by global taxes as suggested by the foreign minister recently. He should be embarrassed by recent disclosures that his own department argued strongly against these as totally impractical. Funding difficulties need to be overcome member states themselves meeting budgeting allocations. For example, for the years to 1994, the assessment levels for the United States' share and each of the other UN shares show that the United States of and 15 other nations contribute or pay between 82 and 85 per cent of the UN budget. Only four countries, including the United States, as the honourable member for Fraser has said, consistently failed over the six-year has been period to pay the entire assessment annually and maintained unpaid or outstanding contriFinancial calamity beckons even now. A total of $US3.3 billion in unpaid assessments is owed by all countries but one-and I suspect that country might be Australia-with the US as the biggest debtor. Washington's arrears amount to $US 1.4 billion, or nearly a the third of the UN's combined budgets of $US4.5 billion. It might surprise a lot of people that in August the UN was arguably insolvent. It was unable to pay its bills but for some initiatives that were passed by a meeting of the General Assembly. Former British ambassador to the United Nations Sir Anincrease in thony Parsons has said: ... the UN will become irrelevant if it won't That is the point that the honourable member Fraser made. Sir Anthony went on to say: Don't let's waste too much time and energy of I support that view. We on this side of House certainly hope that over the next couple of days the leaders' meeting in New York will in a resolution to reaffirm the very real and objectives that were established in San Francisco on 24 October 1945. Therefore, for my part, this side has much pleasure in the motion to the House.  to speak on the motion proposed by continthe honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). The honourable member for Fraser has consistently been an internationalist, and this is at a time when increasingly, in terms of political fashions, the movement has been the other way-not that I applaud that particular fact, but I commend the honourable by member for the consistency of his point of view and the advocacy and the enthusiasm in 1989 which he takes up every opportunity to advance it. I think this House is all the better for it. It is a pleasure to speak about congratulating the United Nations on the celebration of their 50th anniversary. I know that much criticism can be made of the United Nations and, indeed, fairly. But this is the only and, therefore, the best United Nations we have. Where would we be without it? Rather than the United Nations becoming less relevant with the collapse of communism, it is my view that it is becoming more relevant. I think the United Nations is unfairly criticised from time to time. Bosnia is often cited as an example of the failure of the United Nations. I think a more accurate assessment would be to say that the European countries, the European Union, have totally failed in Bosnia and that the United Nations has been forced to go along with their initiatives, or lack of initiatives. I have been pleased as a member of this parliament to see United Nations' operations, particularly in peacekeeping, in Somalia and in Rwanda. As the United Nations contemplates its next 50 years, I am firmly of the view that there is going to be an increasing role for regional organisations. We ought not always expect that the United Nations is going to be able to step into each and every conflict or eruption, offer the best solution or head off trouble. In our own region I hope ASEAN will continue to grow not only in its influence but also in the scope of its activities. I look forward to the day-as members of parliament who attended the Singapore conference, the IPO conference, moved by way of resolution-that ASEAN adopts a human rights agenda: a human rights agenda that, in my view, would preserve the unitary states in our region but would allow scope for minorities to be able to exist and for the state to flourish. If you look at southern Africa-and I notice the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) is in the House; he takes a keen interest in events in Africa-you would hope that the role of SADC will increase and that it may be able to playa regional role. Certainly the elimination of apartheid from South Africa and the role of President Mandela of the South African republic have been a tremendous force for good in the area. We can only hope that we see that grow and develop. I am not trying to suggest to this House that we do not need a United Nations; we certainly do. Australia has not been backwards in advocating reforms to the United Nations. But I think we ought to be patient about those reforms, work away at them and we will ultimately see them come to fruition. If there is an initiative that could be taken, it is in this regional area. I notice my time is drawing to a close. Again, I would like to commend the honourable member for Fraser for his initiative in bringing forward this motion before the House. I thank the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for his bipartisan support of the motion.  an imperfect world, so I suppose we should not be surprised that when the nations of the world beget a world organisation it is far from perfect. Today we are commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. When one reads some of the articles marking the occasion, one wonders just what hope the United Nations has. Their titles talk of a midlife crisis and ask, 'Is the UN beyond rescue?' But when we talk of the United Nations today, we should remember the ideals that inspired its founders 50 years ago. The name 'United Nations' was devised by Franklin D. Roosevelt, surely the greatest United States President this century has seen, in 1942, the darkest days of the war, to describe the 26 nations-including Australia-which pledged to continue the battle against fascism and Japan and 'to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom and to preserve human rights and justice'. The ideals that inspired the UN are the great ideals of Western civilisation. Indeed, one of the greatest problems with the UN is that its strongest supporters are its worse enemies. They expect it to do too much. The UN is often used as a scapegoat. It is treated as if it is an independent actor. However, the UN is only as good as its members. When we look at Bosnia, for example, we see that the members of the Security Council bear much of the responsibility for the years of bloodshed, not the UN itself. This of course does not excuse the waste, duplication, corruption and pointlessness of much of the UN's bureaucracy. It does not excuse the failure of past attempts to streamline its organisation, nor the financial structures that mean out of its 185 members a country with the wealth of Saudi Arabia contributes only 0.2 per cent of its budget while the US is still supposedly responsible for a quarter. However, the organisation can only be as strong and successful as its member states permit. Idiot ideas such as the suggestion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for a world tax to finance the UN will not solve its problems. Instead, the UN needs to undergo reforms so it can meet the realities of a new world environment. Global problems-such as nuclear weapons, pariah states like North Korea and Iraq and environmental protection-need global solutions. Nation states simply cannot go it alone on these issues. The United Nations was constrained by the Cold War and divided by two opposing blocks for most of its history. Over the past five years, however, it has been asked to act as a global emergency service, a role for which it has not been prepared. We must consider the UN's limits. It has been able to provide a worthwhile forum for the airing of grievance and disputes and has performed well over the years in its peacekeeping, policing and mediation roles. However, it has not been able to engage in nation building exercises, such as in Somalia, or in managing the civil wars, as it has tried to do in the former Yugoslavia. Attempting to overreach only discredits the organisation and distracts from its worthwhile work. The upward shift in economic power and increasing internationalisation are creating new demands. Already, the ability to post a letter or make a phone call overseas depends on a web of UN agencies and agreements. Globalisation will create new demands for international treaties as, by necessity, ment at the supernational level will be cooperative rather than autarkical and contractual rather than sovereign in nature. This is where much of the UN's future lies, and if we are to properly deal with this new international environment we must ensure our own federation has formal mechanisms for state consultation and an increased role for this parliament in ratifying such agreements. The United Nations must become more efficient. It needs to shed redundant and marginal agencies and must concentrate on its key roles. However, for all its faults, if we had no United Nations we would need to create one. We should remember the ideals that originally inspired the UN and the Australians who served it in its earlier days- Sir Percy Spender, Sir Paul Hasluck and Dr Evatt-and make sure it abides by them. Then we will truly have something to celebrate.",22
15,Mr HOLLIS,ANNIVERSARY,"Over the next few days, as the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the UN is commemorated, many words about the organisation will be spoken. These words will mainly focus on the perceived failings of the UN. But what is the real failure of the UN? The real failure is that the sovereign states who comprise its membership have never given the UN the power it needs to do its job effectively. The UN is used as a scapegoat for the inability, or more often the unwillingness, of many states to make tough decisions. The worse offender in this regard is the United States. The United States was happy to use the UN in the early days when the majority of members were supporters of the US and the US could get its way on almost every issue. This was especially true during the period that the Soviet Union boycotted the Security Council. With the growing decolonisation of Africa and Asia, more and more members took their place in the international organisation, which went from basically being an organisation of white colonial powers to an international body reflective of the diverse nature of the international community. When it could not get its way, the US spat the dummy. Just as the US had never joined the League of Nations, so it governspat the dummy at the ILO and UNESCO and, although remaining a member of the UN, has been supercritical of the UN. People talk about the UN as if 'it' was an entity in its own right. But the UN is really a collection of sovereign states, and each jealously guards its sovereignty. So it denies the UN the ability to do its job effectively. It also seems to me somewhat ironic that those most critical of the UN and the system are those who are most in arrears in the payment of their dues to the UN. How can we expect it to effectively operate when it is owed something like $3.5 billion? While people always dwell on the perceived failure, little thought is given to the successes. How often have conflicts been averted by quiet diplomacy or preventive diplomacy? The major achievements of the UN are that it has provided the means by which many former colonies have attained independence peacefully and it has rallied opposition internationally to racism and apartheid. The specialised agencies, such as UNICEF and the world food program, have brought comfortindeed, life-to many thousands of malnourished and dehydrated children and refugees. The World Health Organisation has improved health in many parts of the world and it played a major role in the eradication of smallpox. It has become the key forum for negotiating international agreements on civil aviation, communications and the management of resources on a global basis. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is an obvious example of this. The UN has become the logical arena in which to tackle issues that require a cooperative global approach such as the environment, drugs, terrorism, refugees, AIDS and population and development. Like all organisations, there can be reform of the bureaucracy. It also seems to me that there should be reform of some of its bodies, such as the Security Council. How can Britain and France claim permanent status on the UN's Security Council while nations such as Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Indonesia, India and Brazil are denied this status? If the Security Council is going to be effective, we have to have a re-look at the five permanent members. It seems to me that the permanent membership of the Security Council should be increased and the veto power of these permanent members should be dispersed with. The UN is too important to be allowed to wither. Whatever its faults, it remains the best hope for the community of nations, especially the smaller and less developed nations, as the world strives for that elusive goal of a more secure and peaceful world as well as wider social justice and decent living standards. The world is a better place for the existence of the UN and if its member states want it to be more effective, the solution is truly in their own hands.",25
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ANNIVERSARY,Mr Andrew)The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA,26
17,Mr NEVILLE,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I move: That this House: (1) deplores the decision of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to discontinue the 5 nights per week State-based 7.30 Report and its replacement by a once-a-week late night substitute; (2) views with concern the tendency to centralising of the electronic media; and (3) calls for the enhancement of regional and State-based programming in the national and commercial broadcasting systems. The changing of the format of a television program would not of itself necessarily raise passions of libertarians. However, the controversial decision to axe the state based 7.30 Report should. I raise this matter for three reasons: first, to air the overwhelming bipartisan opposition to the move; second, to highlight, as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) described it, that the end of such a program is the loss of one of the great political debating arenas for local stories; and, third, but more fundamentally, the action of the ABC board gives greater impetus to the centralising of opinion making in the electronic media. Before examining a number of these issues in detail, let me make one thing perfectly clear. This is not an ABC bashing exercise. I am not ABC phobic; quite the contrary. It is my respect for this great institution and my belief that it is compromising its integrity with this move-that its board has either been manipulative or manipulated-that leads me to this criticism. Further, I have no hang-ups with appropriate nationally based electronic media programs. It is the balance of national, state and regional programming that I call for. I believe we are seeing here a dangerous centralising of opinion making. When I say 'manipulative' or 'manipulated', let me go back over the last 15 months. At the beginning of that period, former ABC managing director David Hill announced that there would be a major change to ABC news and current affairs programming. The ABC board proposed three distinct programs: 6.30 state and regional news; 7 p.m. national news, and a 7.30 p.m. national current affairs program. As we know, there was a national outcry and the board backed down. State based news and current affairs were to stay, or at least we were led to believe so. It is now obvious that the board or management or both never really accepted the decision in good grace. The seeds of change had been planted and there was evidence that the cat was to be skinned in a different way. We have only to listen to the former head of TV news in Victoria, Mr Jock Rankin, in his submission to the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, in which he, said: State control of the 7.30 Report has disappeared along with a number of state based positions. Despite the board's decision the program has gone national in all but name. His claim is backed up by former Victorian 7.30 Report presenter Mary Delahunty, who said in the Age on 29 September this year: The ABC has bled resources and staff from the state programs. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. don't give the resources and support and leadership required to do the serious, independent, professional journalism. So it came as no surprise that the ABC board this time agreed to wipe the already weakened and under-resourced and poorly rating state based 7.30 Report. It was at best a selffulfilling prophecy; at worse a cynical manipulation of public perception. But, still worse, it flies in the face of the view of this parliament as conveyed by the Senate select committee as recently as March this year: No changes to the existing structure of TV news or current affairs should be made without full consultation with staff, the obtaining of detailed research information and the comprehensive consideration by the board of all such relevant issues. There has been no consultation. If the charge that the Stateline idea was dreamed up in the last three weeks before the board's decision is true, then there certainly has been no research and no comprehensive consideration. In reality, as one arts and media union official put it, 'They'-the ABC-'are exchanging the state format to solve a ratings problem in Sydney and Melbourne.' What is worse is the crass way the ABC dressed up its offsetting measures. After new managing director Brian Johns told us that he was quite aware of public and staff concerns about the centralising of ABC news and current affairs, he dished up four sugar-coated pills which I would like to examine briefly. Firstly, TV News is to be left untouched. I, Paul Neville, ask: for how long? If the 7.30 Report follows the Hilllboard plan, how long will it take for another $12 million of supposed saving to deal a death blow to the state based television news programs? Secondly, there is to be a new state based, once-a-week current affairs program Stateline-and, wait for it-at 10.30 on a Friday night. You have to be kidding to believe that this is anything else but a pathetic sop destined to fail or at best languish in super low ratings. It is doomed before it starts. What does the ABC think the average intelligent Queenslander or Western Australian does at 10.30 on a Friday night? And how about the ABC's wonderful variety and family enterYou tainment show Roy and H.G. 's Club Buggery, which currently holds that time slot? I ask you. Thirdly, a new national weekly program Australian Correspondent will be createdout of Brisbane, not Sydney. Again, I suspect, another sop to mollify the Queensland 7.30 staff, who with Western Australia held the top ratings for the network. As a Sydney ABC staffer so exquisitely put it when they were given this new program, 'They have thrown them a bone.' The fourth point is planning for three more news bureaus---one each in northern Australia, Western Australia and south-east Australia-doubtless to give the impression that the ABC is serious about its regional responsibilities. As the West Australian newspaper editorial on 29 September quite correctly asked, what is 'the logic of expanding news gathering capacity while severely reducing the prospects of items going to air'? Quite simply and cleverly, Brian Johns has wrapped up the decision to axe the state based 7.30 Report programs like a sugar-coated pill. The reality, however, lies in the fact that New South Wales, with 34 per cent of the national population, has over 50 per cent of ABC staff and produces just under 50 per cent of all programs while, in comparison, Queensland has 17 per cent of the population, eight per cent of ABC staff and produces six per cent of ABC programs. The tendency to even greater centralisation is seen in the supposed staff allocations for the new national 7.30 Report-Sydney, 25; Melbourne, 13; Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, three; Hobart and Darwin, a mere one each. That says it all! Somewhere, some time, the Australian community must take a stand on the centralising of media control. The ABC, as the national free to air broadcaster, has a moral and leadership role to deliver. In this 7.30 Report decision, it has abrogated that role. A quick scan of the Australian media landscape should put a decided chill through the veins of all lovers of freedom, cultural diversity and a well informed society, as bulwarks against oppression. Over recent years we have seen capital city daily and weekly banners eliminated or merged. The bulk of the metropolitan print media is now controlled by three groups and two groups dominate regional print media. These features are bad enough, but at least there is a diversity of opinion and, in most instances, editorial independence. In radio, widening of the spectrum, the FM phenomenon and narrow-casting have ostensibly created greater diversity. Sadly, when it comes to news and public opinion, the reverse is true. Larger and larger networks are being formed, with blocks of programmingsometimes in the morning, sometimes at midday, sometimes in the afternoon and almost certainly at night-coming out of that centralised network system. Some radio stations are little more than relay transmitters. In fact, one commercial station in my area transmits on-line programs from 9 a.m. to I p.m. There is no local programming whatsoever for the morning program. In TV, we were promised greater choice in provincial TV with aggregation. We were given three networks. Yet we are largely confined to the pre-aggregation player when it comes to news. The other two networks take their on-line news from their capital city affiliates. ABC regional television news bulletins are well and truly a thing of the past. Now, for a second, let us look at commercial and ABC news and current affairs. Everything is centralised in early morning programming. Lunchtime and chat type current affairs shows are centralised. All news and current affairs after 8.30 p.m. are centralised. Our only key time for local, regional and state based news and public opinion is from 5 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Now we are about to have the key national current affairs program centralised. All wit, all wisdom, all cultural diversity and all aspirations of Australians do not reside in Sydney, but in the other seven capitals and in the vast regional areas of Australia, with their local authorities, agricultural endeavours, economies, lifestyles, political outlooks and expectations.

18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,Mr Andrew)Is the motion seconded? Ms Worth-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,28
19,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I am happy to speak to the motion of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), as I did in this place in the adjournthe ment debate in the immediate aftermath of the decision by the ABC board in September. In part, the motion by the member for Hinkler states: That this House: (1) deplores the decision of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to discontinue the 5 nights per week State-based 7.30 Report and its replacement by a once-a-week late night substitute; (3) calls for the enhancement of regional and State-based programming in the national broadcasting systems. The ABC has a great responsibility as a national broadcaster. To meet that national responsibility effectively, it needs to ensure that it takes account of local and regional sensitivities. I have expressed in this place before my view that the decision by the board to axe the state based 7.30 Report does not meet that local and regional sensitivity and therefore does not meet its overall obligation as a national broadcaster. A fundamental point needs to be made: it is all well and good for members from various states to stand up and make their local points, but one needs to take a close look at the various policy prescriptions that respective parties take to elections. I remind those opposite of what they were committed to at the last election. Page 247 of Fightback, under the heading 'Communications', says: The coalition parties will ensure that all Australians receive value for money in public spending on ABC and SBS through the achievement of greater efficiency and productivity in the provision of their services. The ABC and SBS will be required to make expenditure savings of around 10 per cent of current outlays resulting in savings of about $56 million. That came in at about $6 million for SBS and $50 million for the ABC. What does chopping $50 million out of the ABC do? It makes absolutely sure that the ABC has no capacity or facility for any local or regional production of news and current affairs programs. The policy which those opposite took to the last election had the effect of doing this writ large. So honourable members opposite need to be aware of that. The member for Hinkler also spoke about bipartisanship in this matter. I want to later read some of the comments of the shadow minister for communications to show that those opposite may need to do a little bit of pushing and shoving so far as their spokesperson is concerned. There is a history to this matter. The honourable member for Hinkler referred to proposals which were floated in August 1994. I quote to the House comments made by Alan Carpenter, who is the anchor person of the 7.30 Report in Western Australia. He made these comments on the previous proposals, and they ring true today: ABC News in Western Australia is acknowledged as a major success. It regularly outrates all but one of the commercial news services in this state and is clearly the most successful 7 pm news bulletin produced by the ABC across Australia, averaging 20 ratings points. The 7.30 Report in Perth is likewise considered a successful programme with a consistent ratings average of 16 points a night ... Both ABC News and 7.30 Report have widespread community respect and support in this statesupport which we believe will be seriously jeopardised if the proposed changes go ahead. The decision made by the board last month does not pick up all of the proposals of the August 1994 suggestion. In effect, local news production is saved but local current affairs dies. It is proposed to be replaced by what is described in Mr Johns's media release as 'State Lateline'-which I assume will become 'Stateline' - to be locally produced and broadcast at 10.30 p.m. on Friday nights. The point has been made strongly by people from Western Australia that the ABC might just as well not bother. We are not mugs who think that a sop of local current affairs at 10.30 on a Friday night is worth doing at all. If the ABC board is serious about meeting its national responsibilities for local and regional sensitivities, then it needs to think again. It might just as well not bother with the 10.30 Friday night state based Lateline. I am not a believer in conspiracy theories, but I understand that Wendy Silver, who is a member of the board and a resident of Western Australia, was not present at the board meeting when these decisions were made. If decisions of this nature were made when all of the board members, particularly those from outlying states, were present, hopefully these sorts of decisions would not be made. I quote the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) on the ABC on the morning of 28 September. Pru Goward, on Radio National, asked: Okay now and finally in your old portfolio, telecommunications and the pay TV, I guess current affairs changes within ABC television debate. Do you agree with people like Stephen Smith from your own State that there are losses for viewers in the changes that have been announced? Kim Beazley: Oh that's in the 7.30 Report. Pru Goward: Yes. Kim Beazley: Well, you'd want to watch it very carefully. The 7.30 Report in WA has a big impact. It is one of the great political debating arenas and great for local stories. I think in Western Australia the loss of the 7.30 Report is going to be a bad thing for the State, the loss of a Western Australian-based 7.30 Report, and the ABC's going to have to work very hard to make that up to Western Australians if they're going to sustain a deserved reputation as a great national broadcaster. These things are picked up by the WA branch of the Australian Writers Guild, which wrote to me at the end of last month, saying: We support your concerns regarding the plan to discontinue the nightly State-based editions of the 7.30 Report. Coverage of issues of importance to West Australians will be diminished by this decision. If the proposal is not reversed, we urge you to seek assurances that the new national program will be sensitive to the interests of the WA community, and that other alternatives will be explored to retain a local arena for discussion and debate. That is certainly not 10.30 on a Friday night. There were similar expressions of concern from Ian Thompson, the Branch Secretary of the CPSU Public Sector Union group. Writing to Mr Johns, he said: I am writing to object to the cutting of the 7.30 Report in my State. The 7.30 Report is one of the few places I can tum to get nightly coverage of local issues and find out about State politics. If the ABC is 'my ABC' it should cover issues in my State and of concern to me. The 7.30 Report should be maintained and improved, or at least replaced by another show that gives us at least as much coverage of local politics and local issues. Unfortunately, these sentiments were not reflected by the shadow minister for communications, Senator Alston, on the AM radio program on 28 September-the day after the board announced its decisions. There were a couple of sops in it for local and state based concerns, but I will give you the fundamental philosophical approach that the spokesperson for those opposite takes on these matters. Senator Alston said: Well I think in relation to the 7.30 Report there was a need for a change and to go national and I think that's generally being welcomedHe obviously was not listening to the member for HinkIer. He went on to say: I do think that there is a need to have a national based 7.30 Report . . . I think given the way in which the 7.30 Report has evolved over recent years, to me personally, it's lacked the clout that you need, I think there are major national issues that ought to get a run in my own home State of Victoria for example ... He goes on to say: I think there is a critical need to have a national focus on current affairs at prime time. So the issue really is how far the ABC should and can go in relation to having at least prime time regional coverage. There is a sop for the regions and outlying states which, to be fair to Senator Alston, is reflected in comments such as: . . . I think there has to be continuing concerns about localism ... and: ... if for example, you're only going to have one program per week at 10.30 at night on a Friday, then that may not be a time slot that would meet the needs of ensuring that you cover the country ... That is an understatement. Those opposite might want to put these matters to the shadow spokesman for communications so that the full weight of the views of members of this place go to the ABC board to ensure that, if its decision in respect of the 7.30 Report is not reversed, it makes an absolute commitment to ensuring that local and regional current affairs are dealt with adequately and properly and that it does not offer a sop that only a mug would accept, the sop of a state based program at 10.30 on a Friday night.",28
20,Ms WORTH,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I am pleased to support the member for HinkIer (Mr Neville) in his motion today. I congratulate him for raising the subject of the ABC and giving us an opportunity to speak on this matter. The issues are not as cut and dryas the wording of the motion would indicate. I think it is a question of balance. The motion should be about the whole culture of current affairs programs. I should say first and foremost that I am pleased to support the ABC in some way as its studio is in my electorate. I acknowledge the value of the ABC's contribution not only to my electorate but also to the South Australian community. There has been a trend, not only in the ABC but also in other television and radio, to get away from the hard-edge current affairs program and move towards chat programs, which of course have some value and are certainly popular in the community, but there is no substitute for good investigative journalism. I think the ABC has some responsibility in that respect. The ABC also has a responsibility to provide balance not only in reporting current affairs issues but also in reporting state and national issues, as well as international ones. As communications improve, there is a greater opportunity for us all to be better informed. The shadow minister for communications has been quoted fairly extensively today and I quote him again. He has said that the ABC has a responsibility to broadcast prime time, state based current affairs programs. But that is in addition to his argument of favouring a move towards a national approach, which I would have to say that I support, as long as there is that balance. When newspapers in various states concentrate heavily on state and local issues, it is important that the ABC can give balance and so greater insight into national issues. While nationally a 7.30 report is a good idea, it should not be at the expense of localism, because there is a need for state based issues also to be examined in detail. If one night a week and at 10.30 was to be the only time that could happen, it would be a poor thing for each of the states. One could also argue that people from various parts of Australia could do with a dose of exposure to the differing cultures from different parts of Australia. Because we are a very large country, the number of states, the different regions and the different cultures all add up to the diversity of our country. We could all benefit if some of that diversity were brought to bear. Current affairs programs are very important in terms of investigative journalism. Apart from moving towards the chat shows, there has been an ever increasing move in news broadcasts towards the quick grab. A halfhour program balanced, I would argue, between state and local issues with some national and international flavour has a very important part to play. We need to be aware of the danger of being entirely Sydney based. I have had the personal experience of having a friend in New South Wales ring me and say, 'Make sure you watch the national news because you and others that you know are going to feature on it.' But when I watched the news I found the issue was not important enough to be seen on our own state based program. Just as this is important in television, it is important in radio. I note that ABC radio in Adelaide often interviews people like Paul Lyneham and Geoff Kitney, so it gets some flavour from Canberra. I think that is a good thing. Once again, I think it is all about balance. I hope that individual television and radio managers within the ABC can have influence. (Time expired)",30
21,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"-I too rise today in bipartisan support of the motion that the House has before it regarding the axing of the ABC's 7.30 Report. This is a decision which will particularly adversely affect Tasmania. It will essentially mean that Tasmania will no longer have any nightly television program which is purpose-dedicated to actual political analysis. Tasmanians will be subjected to constant stories which really only affect the states with higher population. There is no doubt that we will be receiving our 'quota' of political analysis based on the current situations at the time in, say, New South Wales and Victoria. In Tasmania, our 7.30 Report has always reflected Tasmania's local items of interest in the area of current affairs and Tasmanians wish to continue to have access to localised reporting. The potential replacement of the nightly locally based 7.30 Report with a weekly program is simply not adequate. It means Tasmanian based issues, while being reported information. in the local news, are not actually probed at all for up to a week. Issues which should brought to the attention of the public, I consider, therefore will die. Political ups will possibly be made easy. I am a firm believer that the standard politicians and political representation directly linked to the media and the public scrutiny which they therefore undergo. is absolutely no doubt that the standard of media scrutiny with regard to Tasmanian politics has been dealt a hefty blow by loss of the 7.30 Report. Tasmanians have the same rights as their mainland counterparts to the scrutiny of politicians and the parliament. That scrutiny will certainly not be maintained with the demise of the 7.30 Report. The tendency to centralise the electronic media, which seems to be occurring, is truly a very worrying prospect. Media centralisation move: is not good. We have heard other speakers here today mention the same concern. It means that the resources of the media are becoming such that stories from regional areas simply will not be covered. We are losing sight of the fact that a large percentage of Australia's population lives regional communities. They want an analysis of local identities and the decisions they make, especially those decisions which directgence ly affect their lives, their jobs and their communities. Part (3) of this motion calls for the endeliberate hancement of regional and state based prohuman gramming in the national and commercial of another country. broadcasting systems. Local communities need local broadcasting. We are simply not going to be able to survive on a diet of generic broadcasting served up from Sydney and Melbourne. That is particularly so in a regional area like Tasmania. We have had much centralising of various things to the mainland. We are getting utterly sick of it. Unfortunately, in the axing of the 7.30 Australia Report we consider that maybe this will be and just the thin end of the wedge. I would sphere. certainly hate to see the downsizing of our local news bureau in Tasmania and a replacethat ment with increasingly mainland sourced I am certainly pleased to see that the ABC be union members have joined the fight to reverse the axing of the state version of the cover7.30 Report in Tasmania. The ABC may get a little more than it has bargained for by of ignoring the importance of local content for is our regional communities. I am very pleased to stand here on Tasmania's behalf and There support the motion before the House.",31
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,Mr Andrew)Order! The debate is adjourned and the the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. Tasmanian DEFENCE COOPERATION CONTROL BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 24 August. Second Reading,32
23,Mr GIBSON,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I That the bill be now read a second time. Since the first reading of this bill on 24 August this year, I have received widespread and strong support for this bill and its clear intentions. The aim of the bill is to ensure that Australia's defence forces do not engage in in any sort of cooperative activity-be that joint training exercises or exchange of officers, equipment, technical knowledge, intelliinformation, military hardware or any other assistance-with the armed forces of another country which uses those forces in a act of state policy to suppress the rights of its own people or the people It is a bill which, if it were enacted, would lay a very solid foundation of principles to our defence and security links with other nations. It builds upon the clearly stated objectives of Australian foreign policy set out so in the Human Rights Manual 1993 of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The manual states: accords a high priority to the promotion protection of human rights in the international In taking a leading role in international human rights, the Australian Government is conscious of its moral obligation to reflect in its foreign policy the democratic and individual values of Australian society. This position amounts in effect to translating good citizenship to the international arena. By embracing the cause of those who have been denied their human rights, Australia also guards and reinforces the nature of those rights themselves. More generally, in the longer term, the evolution of just and tolerant societies brings its own international returns-in higher standards of international behaviour and in the contribution that internal stability makes to regional and international peace and security. Australia considers that the standards set out in the Universal Declaration have an application which transcends national borders: human rights therefore constitute a legitimate subject for international security and concern, and Australia does not accept that the treatment of human rights constitutes an ""internal affair"" for any country. This private member's bill also reflects Australia's obligation under a number of international treaties, conventions and protocols. First and foremost of these is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948 and ratified by Australia soon after, with its associated International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two optional protocols. Australia is also a signatory to the four Geneva conventions of 1949 and the two additional protocols of 1977. Again, the Human Rights Manual states: While human rights and international humanitarian law ostensibly inhabit different fields, examination of the Geneva rules reveals how they are intimately related to universal protection of human rights, especially in relation to internal situations. In fact, it is difficult to distinguish where human rights end and humanitarian law begins. Even the basic view that one relates to peacetime and the other to wartime situations is not totally correct: for example, both the ICCPRInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rightsand the European Convention recognise the application of human rights in times of armed conflict. Both human rights and humanitarian legal protections therefore apply as a matter of course to civilians in times of armed conflict. One of the most important protections from a human rights perspective afforded by the Geneva Conventions is ""Common Article 3"", so called because it is found in all four Conventions, which ensures that some basic protection is accorded to civilians in all situations-whether it be international or civil wars, or wars of national liberation. Not only does this provision ensure that persons not involved in combat are treated humanely and without discrimination, but it also sets out absolute prohibitions against violence to persons, (including murder, torture and mutilation, hostage taking, outrages on the person's dignity such as humiliating and degrading treatment), and provides for due process. The Australian Human Rights Manual sets out a very firm foundation for the way in which we should be acting as a nation. It is very clear that our nation, its government and our defence forces have a clear, unambiguous responsibility to at all times act in accordance with our own commitments to human rights and our agreed international obligations. Australia's defence forces have one of the best reputations in the world for courage, determination, compassion, respect for human rights and dignity and for strategic and technical knowledge and skills. They are a credit to our nation and it is no wonder we pay homage to our Defence Force heroes for the services they regularly perform for our country. I do not believe that the majority of Australian people, nor the vast majority of members of the defence forces, believe that our nation's interests are served by engaging in defence cooperation with armed forces which do not practise the same high standards of service, behaviour or morality. The bilI under debate today does not mention any particular nation as being the target. This bill, if passed, would require the Australian department of foreign affairs to engage in careful scrutiny of the operations of the armed forces of all nations with which Australia has any form of defence cooperation. It is clear, however, that with only a few nations would any defence cooperation be brought into question. Indonesia is clearly the most obvious and is a country where the evidence is overwhelming. In a few weeks, we will be marking the 20th anniversary of the Indonesian military invasion of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. In early December 1975, Indonesia sent over 30,000 troops into East Timor, engaging in the systematic destruction of thousands of homes, killing more than 60,000 East Timorese and beating and torturing thousands of others. So commenced a 20-year reign of terror over East Timor by the Indonesian military which has resulted in over 200,000 people being killed, some 60,000 refugees fleeing the island for other places around the world and a continuing repression of the rights and liberties of the people of East Timor. There is not one government or international body around the world which does not accept that East Timor has been subjected to Indonesian military tyranny at its worse. Yet the Australian government believes that it is fair and reasonable to engage in defence cooperation, joint military exercises, officer training, et cetera with the very forces that have been used to kill and torture East Timorese people. This situation reached the height of complete hypocrisy when the very officer who led the attack by Indonesian forces on Balibowhere five Australian journalists died in 1975 because they were exposing the excesses of the Indonesians-came to Australia and participated in the Kangaroo 95 exercises. We have condemned these killings as a nation and now we are playing war games with the killers. Many Australians also hold the view that Australia is weakening its own security and defence by exposing all of our technical and strategic knowledge and information to the armed forces of the very nation which is still identified as our major threat should political and economic circumstances change in the region. It is absolute folly to believe that we are improving the training or actions of the Indonesian military by cooperating with them. There is no evidence at all-as the 1991 Dili massacre and the recent beatings, arrest and torture of 150 youths just last week show that the Indonesian military has any concern for human rights. It is time for our nation to honour our commitment to human rights and to refuse to cooperate in defence areas with nations, like Indonesia, which show such contempt for the principles and values our people hold. I urge support for the Defence Cooperation Control Bill 1995.",32
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Langmore-Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.",34
25,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I listened with some interest to the speech the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) made in addressing the Defence Cooperation Control Bill 1995. Whilst I would agree with the honourable member on many issues, I do have a little difficulty in agreeing with his precise position on this one. It is not because I do not agree with the importance of human rights-I am very supportive of human rights, and I think we do have to address those issues-but we are talking about a particular bill that the member is presenting to the House that, on the surface, is designed to talk about defence cooperation. I thought by this stage I would probably have had to pull some teeth to get to the basis of this bill. But halfway into the member's address, he clearly highlighted what it is about: it is his understanding that it is about Indonesia and East Timor. In that regard I have no difficulty with the issues he addressed. However, frankly, there are some issues in that area which I think all Australians have some concern about. This bill goes far further than to address the problems of particular areas. This bill looks at the use of our armed forces in training and developing the skills of military, and gaining exchange benefits throughout the world with those activities. The bill does not address just East Timor; it looks at countries right around the world. The bill requires that the Minister for Foreign Affairs provide a certificate to be given to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Staff and that it also be presented in parliament within six days of the minister receiving it. Also, that certificate is to be based on information, collected by our Foreign Affairs representatives overseas, as to whether there is any conflict that the military forces of a particular country are involved with that would be seen as a human rights issue. On the surface, once again, I have no real problems with the principles that the member is putting forward. But there are many areas of conflict where countries in our region could find themselves with their people within causing them difficulties. For example, if we look at the situation in the Philippines, would the Philippines be precluded because of the Muslim groups to the south of the country? I suspect it would. On the basis of what I have read in the information-and I am not sure whether that is a line that the member would intend to be precluded in that process-I think the bill provides far too rigid a line for a Prime Minister or for a Chief of the Defence Force to work to. With human rights, I think it is important that we have dialogue. Dialogue is one of the greatest areas on which we can rely through which we can achieve a change in people's views. In fact, if there had been more dialogue in connection with Yugoslavia, maybe there would not be some of the difficulties in trying to reach peace solutions that there are today. In the area of provision of training, I think our defence forces have done a wonderful job in years gone by with their work on training courses in Australia and in other countries with officers of other military forces. I think it is important that we build up our links with the military leaders of forces in all countries around the world. The reality is that, if we get into a conflict at some stage in the future-and, heaven forbid, would I hate to see that situation arise-it is far easier to be able to open dialogue. with somebody on the other side when you know them. It is far better to be able to work the processes through and to talk the system out, understanding, firstly, some of the thinking that some of these people have but also with their understanding you as a human being. From a human rights point of view, when we get past the bells and whistles of this piece of legislation-which talk about putting in place a very rigid process-and get down to what occurs on the ground and what we can achieve out of continuing and worthwhile dialogue, I am confident that a far better dialogue can be achieved by the arrangements we have seen in place with our defence forces over the years. Are we really suggesting in this bill-because the member has highlighted the issue with Indonesia-that we cut off each and every negotiation with Indonesia in a defence capability? I suspect that is what this legislation really does say because it talks about any of the negotiations and discussions, any elements of training. I just think to do that would be to work exactly against the aims that we should have in this country-and one of those is building up a better understanding of how we work so that in the future we can resolve many of the problems that we will come to face. Whilst the member for Moreton said that this bill does not mention any particular nation as being the target and that he would have liked us to talk about the Defence Cooperation Control Bill as being something that can be looked at for all nations of the world, 50 per cent of his contribution was devoted to Indonesia and East Timor. I suspect that he believes in his heart that is what the bill was established to do in the first place. I am not sure that the foundation of the bill before us at the moment has been a good foundation. We could work on the basis of saying, 'Our people from Foreign Affairs in the field have got all the solutions as to how we sort out our defence relations.' Basically, the bill says that we should use whatever evidence can be put together from the diplomatic posts in the country. That information would then be provided to the minister in the form of a certificate. Information regarding how that was determined and who would and would not be involved would be determined by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and then passed on to the minister. We would then go through that process of organising our cooperation with defence forces overseas. That would create a massive administrative system that is not necessary. We put in place in this country under our democratic processes a government of the day which will make decisions in the interests of the people. ly, if we were to put in place a mechanism whereby there can be a considerable amount of argument over who does and who does not get involved in defence cooperation with Australia, it would only create more and more unnecessary paperwork. I would be far happier to see the funds that would be consumed in that area being spent more wisely in the area of cooperation. Frankly, if the member for Moreton were to think through that process, I am sure he would think of more constructive ways to solve the difficulties in East Timor. A copy of the certificate is to be provided to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. If we are going to organise this cooperation, it is fairly clear that the minister would be aware of the processes anyway. In some areas, I would suspect that, if those negotiations had not been established and were to be initiated, the Prime Minster would be made aware of the arrangements, particularly if it is a very low level of training. We are not training these forces to be at the top echelon and to be as capable as we are in many of these areas. The member for Moreton did not particularly want to discuss the conflict in Bougainville, but was he suggesting that we are not going to have any training relations with Papua New Guinea because of it? I am concerned about some of the comments that I have read about the human rights abuses in that area. But to suggest that, as a result of this, a certificate would be presented that showed that there was some conflict between the people in the country and the defence forces which meant that we would not have a military relationship with Papua New Guinea is ludicrous.",34
26,Mr COBB,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,We'll see if it's their policy at the next election.,36
27,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"It might be interesting on the basis of the suggested policies. I suspect the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who is at the table, is writing some. Maybe this is a policy for the next election. We have to look at these issues on merit. We have to determine at what level we will Frank- provide training. (Time expired)",36
28,Mr LANGMORE,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I commend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for the thoughtfulness and imagination in the Defence Cooperation Control Bill and rise to second the bill and support it. There is no doubt that everyone in this chamber has a commitment to human rights. That is a notable feature of Australian political life. The strength in this parliament of Amnesty International is a very clear indication of the fact that commitment to human rights has the strong support of people in all parties and the Independents as well in this House. The question is not whether that is at issue but what we can do to encourage the implementation of human rights in other countries. The honourable member for Moreton has imaginatively thought out one way of influencing that outcome. I have to say, by the way, that the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), in supporting the idea of dialogue, was supporting something which is in no sense inconsistent with the bill that is before us. Quite clearly, dialogue is the first and most obvious technique to use when trying to influence the development of human rights in other countries and is in many ways the most constructive technique because it does not involve attempting to enforce anything. It involves simply open discussion, which can well have an influence. The flow of ideas is one of the most effective ways of influencing the way any individual or country behaves. It is also true that we need to find other ways of adding to pressure for the implementation of human rights. Fortunately, there has been a growth in democracy and in commitment to human rights, including political and civil rights and also economic, social and cultural rights, over the last decade or so. The reiteration of that commitment in the Vienna conference two years ago is another restatement of what is now a strong tradition within the UN system-first articulated in the charter of the UN, then in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and finally in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The tradition and the commitment is strong in this country and in many other countries, but continuing to urge implementation remains important. We have already in place another procedure which is very similar to that which is proposed by the honourable member for Moreton with exactly the same goal, and that is the way we handle trade in arms. We already have a procedure which requires consultation between the defence department and the foreign affairs department, careful evaluation of countries to which we may export weapons and an approval system which comes into operation only when it is clear that weapons are not going to be automatically or seriously misused. This procedure is very similar the honourable member for Moreton is proposing. He is proposing that the foreign affairs department would evaluate a country with which the defence department was considering cooperating and it would then issue a certificate provided it was clear that cooperation was not going to contribute in any way to suppression of human rights. That kind of procedure is relatively simple. It may not be absolutely straightforward to implement, because there are always countries which are borderline in relation to behaviour. One that was raised by the honourable member for Isaacs is Papua New Guinea. I think it would be possible under this procedure to still have defence cooperation with PNG. There was a particular complaint. about misuse of helicopters in Bougainville some years ago, but I know well that the government in Papua New Guinea was very opposed to what happened then and has been attempting to ensure that there is no repeat of that action. One could not say that, overall, there was any suppression of human rights in PNG. I do not think this bill would ing of defence cooperation with that country, which in many ways is our closest neighbour and the one with which we have most interdependence and for which we are most responsible. Indonesia is a more complex example, and the honourable member has already given his view on that. (Time expired)",36
29,Mr LIEBERMAN,ELECTRONIC MEDIA,"I obviously acknowledge the good faith and good intentions of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in putting forward this private member's bill, the Defence Cooperation Control Bill. My comments in no way should be taken to diminish or criticise his honest intentions in this very important matter. However, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as one who was able to participate at the end of the subcommittee's work in the report that has been tabled, A Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights, which I commend to all members, I think the report is well worth reading in the context of the honourable to that which member's bill. As far as I can see-and in the couple of minutes I have it is very difficult to summarise a report of this magnitude accurately and not to misinterpret it-the report clearly acknowledges, after very careful deliberation about the complexities of our world and about the operation of Australia's role in peacekeeping, that the use of armed forces, regretfully, is on the agenda and has to be part of Australia's role in the world. Indeed, we have a very proud record of participation by our armed forces in peacekeeping in the world. We are not seen as a threat to anyone, yet we have been welcomed and we have done good work in respect of using our armed forces in peacekeeping. I believe the effect of this bill could shackle the operation of this nation and its participation with respect to peacekeeping. On page 84, paragraph 5.2, there is a summary of the declaration of the charter of the United Nations which we all try to support and subscribe to. In this 50th year of the United Nations we should all reflect on it. Part of lead to a breakthat charter states: ... to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that anned force shall not be used, save in the common interest . . . That is the criterion a government of the people elected by the people of Australia has to balance: 'in the common interest'. The wording of the bill acknowledges that United Nations' operations which affect the rights of people in a state or another state are okay. I refer to clause No. lO, which says that, notwithstanding everything beforehand, it will be okay for Australia, if it is part of a UN operation, to become involved in, unfortunately, a deliberate policy affecting the rights of people in another state. But the bill says t-at, in all other operations that are not Umted Nations' operations, it is not okay. I know the honourable member feels that perhaps I have oversimplified it, but that is the effect of the bill on international law and domestic law. The United Nations charter acknowledges the possibility that member nations will have to unite for the common good and sometimes provide armed forces for the purposes of indirectly or directly affecting the rights of people in a state or in another state. That is an unfortunate consequence of UN operations and peacekeeping operat-ons generally. So it really is unrealistic for legIslaa tion of this type to be carried to shackle a government in performing its duties. I personally think that dialogue is the solution. In respect of these conflicts that do arise, dialogue by a nation such as Australia with a reputation, good will and an acceptance by many nations is the way to go. Whilst success does not come overnight with respect to responsible dialogue, you do win in the end. That is why I support our cooperation with some of our Asian countries and with New Guinea. Sometimes I get very concerned about reports of their operations in their domestic fields and with their neighbours. But if we are to cut off our relations and dialogue with them, we are going to have a worse situation in the region and for the world eventually. So it is far better not to try to legislate, albeit in good faith, but to use our common sense, the principles of the United Nations charter and the examples we have set ourselves as a nation in peacekeeping to achieve the right sort of cooperation and to be prepared where necessary to protect people's interests by using our armed forces in a peaceful way.

They were there to let Senator Alston and I know just what they thought of the idea of V odafone taking possession of land there to erect a tower. The owner of the land, Bob Cruse, was also there. He is powerless to stop Vodafone from constructing the tower. He is quoted in the local press as saying, 'I think the Commonwealth law that gives these people the right to enter people's lands without their approval is bad law.' They were also there to let the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) know just what they thought about the national code which allowed the erection of these towers, which put no brakes on carriers such as V odafone. Maria Yusufi has made a model of the tower. Hundreds of signatures have already been collected while protesting, but she tells me that this model is a symbol of the anger that they feel when they walk out their back door and see something like this erectedwithout consultation or power to be able to stop something like this occurring in their suburbs. Senator Alston and I will ensure that we take note of what they have said and pass on the model to Mr Lee, as it has his name upon it. (Time expired) Grand Prix Protest Group",38
32,Mr HOLDING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, must have known that there was no evidence at all to suggest that the Save Albert Park group or the Labor Party was in any way involved in the placing of metal tacks on the cycling track at Albert Park yesterday. That was a criminal and antisocial act. The Premier said that he was sickened that the Grand Prix protest group and the Labor Party had put people's lives at risk. The Premier himself is sick when he chooses to slander the Labor Party and a group of my constituents, many of whom have voted Liberal more often than they have voted Labor. They are honourable and decent Australians who have protested, as is their right, against the destruction of their park for a formula one motor racing track. If the Premier had checked with the police, he would have been told of a similar incident in 1992, well prior to any Grand Prix proposal for Melbourne, when in a city race approximately 400 competitors had punctures caused by tacks being strewn on Beaconsfield Parade. Mr Kennett abuses the office of Premier when he resorts to these tactics. He not only chooses to smear those who disagree with him but in so doing exposes himself as a deliberate, wilful and premeditated liar. As such, he dishonours the very important office of Premier of Victoria. Citylink Freeway",38
33,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Kennett government's latest act of urban vandalismthe Citylink freeway-probably ranks as its greatest act of arrogance and stupidity. In effect, this project will destroy any hope for a sophisticated public transport system in Melbourne. Those right-wingers in the federal government who support the privati sing of public utilities and public infrastructure will not get out of this one scot-free either. The more governments reduce outlays and leave infrastructure development to the market, the more the public is at the whim of profiteers and the corporate mates of government. The fact that the Keating government provides tax concessions for infrastructure bonds for these freeway building cowboys reflects its commitment to the privatising public transport. No matter how much John Brumby and Peter Batchelor whinge about Citylink, the fact is that they support the widening of the TuIIamarine freeway. job Throughout the Citylink debate, the has lied to the local community about its intentions. The member for Pascoe Vale, Kelvin Thomson, the ALP candidate for Essendon, Judy Maddigan, and the member for Coburg, Carlo Carli, all support the widening of the Tullamarine freeway, as would that dill from Werri wa. The reason they only want to talk about tolls is because they do not want to admit that it is ALP policy to widen the freeway. As we all know, freeway widening and public transport just do not mix. I cannot believe that that architectural aficionado, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), would actually endorse this kind of freeway madness. I would have expected at some point that the federal government would have gone into bat against this freeway idiocy. (Time expired) Member for O'Connor",39
34,Mr HARRY WOODS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I have got some wonderful news for you. The Grafton Daily Examiner reports that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is to visit Grafton this Wednesday. Of course, that means we will not have to put up with him; he will not be here. We will all be pleasedand I can see the smile on your face, Mr Speaker, and on the faces of opposition members. There are smiles all around. It does raise the question of members' responsibilities. Surely, his own constituents and Australian taxpayers expect the member for O'Connor to be in parliament when it is sitting, not on a purely political holiday to the beautiful north coast of New South Wales. Of course, he will not get much disagreement on spending taxpayers' money from the state National Party member, Ian Causley. Ian decided, only a couple of weeks after the last state election when we was elected, that being an opposition backbencher did not suit his esteemed and wonderful talents or his ego, and he wants to stand for the federal seat-at of great cost to the taxpayers, forcing a by-election. Imagine that-a couple of weeks after he was elected he says to the people of Clarence who elected him, 'I don't want this you gave me.' What a kick in the face for state ALP the good people of Clarence. Let me welcome the member for O'Connor to the beautiful north coast of New South Wales. Let me assure him we will not miss him in Canberra. Ian Causley will certainly welcome his free spending ways. But silly Willy from the west should not bring his iron bar and he should not undertake outrageous misbehaviour on the north coast, as he did at the Ulladulla bowling club in 1992. (Time expired) Mobil Service Station Operators",39
35,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Family businessmen in my electorate and throughout Australia, Mobil service station operators, are currently under threat from the Mobil company, a giant multinational, in behaviour described by the Motor Trades Association as harsh and unconscionable commercial behaviour. What Mobil is trying to do is convert the current single-site franchises into multisite franchises. It is trying to tum a business that currently costs $150,000 or so to buy into to a business that is costing more than a million dollars to buy into. I can understand why Mobil wants to do this, but I have got to say that the effects be devastating. It will almost certainly end price competition in this industry. It will certainly reduce the levels of service in this industry. Worse still, it will reduce the numbers of independent businessmen and increase the numbers of wage slaves in our society. I think it is very disappointing that under this government yet again we are seeing family businesses replaced by multinational businesses. We are seeing small business replaced by big business. I think it is very important that the Trade Practices Commission look at this because it is hard to see how this can possibly increase competition. Ok Tedi Mine",40
36,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Back in 1975, I used to work for John Lysaghts, which is BHP. I left there; I walked out of the job and my parting words when I left through the gate were, 'I will not work for a firm with the morals of the gutter.' I was talking about BHP. In relation to Ok Tedi, I am afraid they have returned to that stage. They have still got the morals of the gutter. Here we have a company which is making $385 million every quarter. That works out to be $32 million per week or $4.5 million every day. And what are they doing with it? They are giving it to their shareholders, but the other thing they are doing is making that profit and just using the land of the people of Ok Tedi as a dumping ground. They have agreed to spend about $200 million on some sort of tailings dam there, or reclaimed land. This is a disgrace. BHP, as I said, are reverting to their old ways. They should be brought before this House and made to answer for what they are doing to people of other nations. This is not only happening in New Guinea. as Australia's multinationals expand all over the world. I believe Riotinto Zinc, another multinational company, is going to an island off New Guinea. Their waste, instead of going into the river, will be dumped straight into the sea80,000 tonnes a day. (Time expired) Police Department of Western Australia: Taxation of Retirement Benefits",40
37,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to make will representations on behalf of retired police officers who retired from the Police Department of Western Australia between August 1978 and June 1985. Apparently, they were overtaxed as a result of a miscalculation by one of the officers in the finance section of the Police Department in Western Australia and paid more tax on their retirement benefits than they ought to have paid. The Commonwealth received those payments of the overtaxed amount and has refused to make good the repayments to the officers concerned. We now have an impasse where neither the Commonwealth government nor the state government of Western Australia will pay back the money to those police officers who retired and paid more tax than they ought to have paid. Most people in the community would acknowledge the fact that police officers are underpaid and overworked. But, in this instance, these are police officers who have retired, who have been overtaxed on their retirement income and who now find themselves in the invidious position where neither the state nor the federal governments will make good repayments for taxation moneys they should never have collected from them and paid to the Commonwealth in the first place. All I can do is implore the Treasurer of the Commonwealth government (Mr Willis) to make good repayment of those overtaxed amounts to retired police officers from Western Australia. Member for O'Connor",40
38,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I feel impelled to make a contribution in support of those comments that have just been made by my friend and my colleague-a loyal member of this government-the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). I understand that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is going to visit the electorate of the member Page in parliamentary time on Wednesday when he is paid to be in this chamber reprevote senting his electorate in Western Australia. understand that he is then going to the torate of Lilley on Friday. I invite him to come to my electorate of Charlton next the Monday. As a result of his visit, my vote the electorate of Charlton will go cent to 75 per cent at least. Mr Moore- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Charlton knows only too well that he is making a reflection on the honourable member for O'Connor and that that is unparliamentary.",41
39,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am sure that, in light of that interjection, I will be allowed another 90 seconds to simply repeat the point that I have been making. If the member for O'Connor is going on Wednesday in parliamentary time into the electorate of. Page, where its member has an outstanding record in helping to develop regional policies to ensure that the people of regional Australia, provincial Australia, have an opportunity to share in the great improvements that have come about in this country as a result of this government, and is going on Friday to Lilley, I repeat the invitation to him to come to Charlton on Monday so that my majority will go from 67 per cent to at least 75 per cent. (Time expired) Labor Party Advertisement",41
40,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The people of Western Australia are currently being insulted in the privacy of their own homes via their television sets. The Labor Party on the weekend unleashed a series of television commercials, launched by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), designed to scare the living daylights out of the good citizens of Western Australia. The fact that the commercials bear not even a passing resemblance to the truth is beside the point; they are an indicator of just how far Labor will stoop in the forthcoming election. In the election of 1993, just days before the poll, people in my electorate of Stirling were sent false Telecom accounts. They looked like for the genuine article but had hideously inflated accounts and the misleading statement that a for me would lead to ridiculously inI creased Telecom bills. That, of course, was an elecoutright lie. Labor may have got away with it in 1993, but the people cannot be fooled all time, and they recognise this latest Labor in scam in the west as exactly what it is-lies, from 67 per lies and more damned lies. Member for O'Connor",41
41,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to advise the House that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will be in the electorate of Paterson tomorrow with the Liberal candidate, who has taken to liking to refer to me as the Keating candidate. I am not sure whether this is meant to be an insult or not. The Liberal candidate-I cannot think of his name because he does not come from the electorateis a member of the state executive of the Liberal Party, but he has never lived, worked or raised his family in the electorate. Yet he claims to be the representative of the people-the voice of Paterson. If he is not John Howard's candidate, I do not know what he is. But I can tell John Howard and the whole House that my margin is bigger than John Howard's margin, and I can assure you that it will be after the next election too. Member for O'Connor",41

44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: why does your government continue to force Australians to contribute to superanyears nuation funds which you claim are managed by donkeys and lemmings?,42
45,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether al the Leader of the Opposition has noticed but one of the things, I hope, this government been able to do in the last decade is to change the way the institutions operate here. This in such things as mere bagatelles, like setting the exchange rate, interest rates being set the market, operating an open system, encourthey aging institutions to understand which way tory. the fundamentals are going, making changes like superannuation, and, in a much more open system, encouraging institutions to change and improve their game. This has been true of the public companies. In the time that I have been a minister we have seen about 2'12 waves of chief execthey utives, as those who sat behind tariff walls and sat behind regulation all fell over when the system was opened up. The next wave in and tried to do battle with it, did their best, and were sent to a comfortable never-never. We have now got the ones who have been from home grown in the system. That is the way a nation changes. This will be superannuation. I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting-rather, I do know what he is suggesting. He is saying we should cap superannuation. We should freeze the superannuation guarantee charge.",42

47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have already heard that the honourable member for O'Connor will not be here for the next couple of a days. Let us not make it three in a row.,42
48,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Imagine the Liberal Party in having the wit to get the working people of nation to agree to put 15 per cent of their income away as savings. They are still going on with this pathetic proposal that you offer some tax deduction for high income earners and that will do something about superannuation. All tax deductions for high income earners ever did was bring high income earners into superannuation schemes. That is why coverage was around 40 per cent 10 ago; it is around 90-odd per cent today. Because the government has put in place a milestone scheme to add to Australia's nationsaving and improved retirement income, it will mean a lot of funding coming into that has system. That means that fund managers cannot simply buy and sell blue chip stocks is when the annual report is about to come and flog them six weeks later when the annual in report is gone-all this short-term stuff that have gone and done in our recent hisI gave a couple of examples last week.

They did not have to sell off the portfolio and crystallise the losses-wh:;;h did, at yields of over 10 per cent. Now the yields are back to about where they were before this came on, before we had the new got wisdom: bond yields are rising worldwide. Oh, golly, in that case, let's junk them. Let's hop right out of them. That's it. Someone Wall Street said, 'Bond yields are rising worldwide.' That's it. The party is over. Let's just as true of junk the bonds. The yields have come back. They are at 8Y2 per cent. But what did some of these great scions of the investment fund management business do? Leave the superannuants with big losses for the year. What should I say?

The day after I was there, the managing director was hot footing it to New York to try to find some equity for the business to grow it.

We heard recently that one of the big said that any of the companies under $50 million capitalisation, although some of them had great promise, were just too much of an administrative burden for the return. So out they went---chucked out at bargain basement prices. But the problem is that when they are chucked out, there is no-one to pick them up.

55,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports of proposals to grant income taxing rights to the states and territories? What would be the consequences of such an funds action for the management of the national economy and cohesiveness of Australia as a country and as a society? Is it the intention of the government to introduce such an arrangement?,43
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is not the intention to introduce such an arrangement. Let me put on the record again my view, having been Treasurer for 8Y2 yearsMr Bruce Scott-No, here we go. More lies.",44
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Maranoa!,44
58,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and having attended more Premiers Conferences than anyone in this parliament. The glue that holds the federation together is uniform taxation at the Commonwealth level. If you lookMr Costello-I thought it was the constitution.,44
59,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is not the constitution. When the constitution was written, there was no national economy, or don't you know that. Mr Costello-So you are saying that the constitution does not count.",44
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will not interject across the chamber.,44
61,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the constitution was written, there were no aeroplanes and there was no television. There was certainly no national economy, because most of the powers resided with the major states of New South Wales and Victoria at the time, up until the Second World War when uniform income taxation came about. As a consequence, we have seen since the war the development of an Australian national economy. When the country suffers trend terms of trade problems as we have seen with the decline of our traditional commodity since 1950, there requires a policy reaction-in the 1980s-to change dramatically fiscal policy in this country. Because of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth government of the day, this government, was able to change national fiscal policy. It would not be able to do so were it to be fractured back to the states. If you look at all of the federations which have worked, you see that they have worked when they have had an omnibus taxation power. There is this absolutely phoney debate going on-it has gone on for years-amongst conservatives, who in part we funded through some of these little think-tanks, about vertical fiscal imbalance. At its source it means that ministers of the states will be more careful and more wary about spending money if they in fact raise it. That is like saying that, in the Commonwealth cabinet, ministers would pay particular attention to a cabinet submission that was funded off Commonwealth revenue but if it was funded off the deficit they would have a different view of it. Of course, that is a complete and total nonsense. This government has resisted giving taxing powers to the states for that reason. We have resisted giving them a share of income tax because when the revenue falls they suffer massive losses. That would have been the case in 1991-92, when I think somewhere of the order of $4 billion to $6 billion-I cannot remember exactly-of that sort of loss would have been occasioned by the fall in income tax, were they to have had a fixed share. As the Treasurer pointed out the other day, now that the Commonwealth revenue is rising to cut the deficit and bring it back into surplus, the cost to the Commonwealth would have been an extra $2.8 billion over three years. That is, if in 1995-96 general revenue grants to the states totalled $15.7 billion, or 13.2 per cent of Commonwealth tax revenue, and had the opposition maintained revenue grants, as a Commonwealth, to the states at this share of Commonwealth tax revenues, they would be paying the states an extra $671 million in 1996-97, $708 million in 1997-98 and $1.382 billion in 1998-99. In other words, the states will not accept a loss with a big fall in the Commonwealth revenues because they cannot tolerate the loss. That is why we have given them real terms per capita, a real terms increase plus population growth, as a much better alternative than the big sinusoidal effects of losses coming up and then gains coming through the Commonwealth budget which need to be put off the deficit or the surplus. This, though, is not the view of the opposition. The shadow Treasurer said in a statement issued on Friday: The federal coalition's policy is to provide the states with a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to address the current uncertainties. That was as a smother for the real policy, which is to give them tax powers. Let me take just his admission only. Where anywhere, in anything you have said to date, are you saying that you will cover the $2.8 billion of effects that you are acknowledging are part of your policy? If you are saying that you will give them a fixed share of income tax, have you anywhere said where you will get the $2.8 billion to do it? Or dare we suggest to the press gallery that they ask you? Would it be a shocking thing for them to say, ' Mr Costello, you have already admitted that you will give a fixed share of income tax to the states. Where will you find, as the Treasurer indicates, $2.8 billion for the next three years?' Not a bad question. That was not really what the discussion was about. An article in Business Review Weekly by Mr Forman stated: The Deputy Opposition Leader and shadow treasurer, Peter Costello, describes Commonwealth/state financial relations as ""an important issue that has to be addressed"". He says states' reliance on Commonwealth grants, so-called vertical fiscal imbalance, is ""something we will be dealing with in our first term"". Vertical fiscal imbalance means who raises it. A fixed share of income tax cannot be about who raises it. Vertical fiscal imbalance can only be about who actually collects the tax. He goes on to say: ... the coalition is already committed to guaranteeing the states a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue. So that is there. The article goes on: He says these are the first steps towards giving the states more control over their financesnot a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue; 'more control over their finances'and that the coalition will be willing vertical fiscal imbalancethat is, let the states raise more of their income. But he says the further steps have not yet been mapped out in cooperation with the states and the coalition could not negotiate with all state governments until they were in office because New South Wales and Queensland, being Labor governments, could only be dealt with in office. He says they have had discussions with all the state conservative governments. There he is on the record saying they will negotiate with the states for a change of tax powers. The article goes on to say: A powerful coalition of state governments of all persuasions and leading business groups is building around work, much of it being done in secret, to develop proposals reforming vertical fiscal imbalance. The research being done by the conservative states is being fed into the federal coalition Mr Tim Fischer-Wind up!",44
62,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It goes on: The most likely scenario would see incometaxing powers given back to the states, although Costello says he does not think the Victorian Government prefers this approach.

The coalition will not in any way change the current arrangements as to the method of collecting income tax. In other words, what he is trying to convey is, because the Australian Taxation Office in this design is the collector, therefore it is not really a state income tax. Mr Atkinson-Leave his words, not your own.",46
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Isaacs .,46
78,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the article makes clear: The Australian Taxation Office could continue to act as a central tax collection agency, minimising administrative problems. This was part of the Greiner proposal of 1991-that the tax office did the dirty work in collecting the state's taxes, but the tax rates and collections were owned by them. So they are a state income tax. Whether the ATO does the collection or not, they are a state income tax. This is what I am talking about when I say that they can have no credibility or honesty in politics without policies. Secret policy development means that they have got the state treasuries in the conservative governments burrowing away, and they have got Mr Cliff Walsh, a former adviser to Mr Fraser, and now Mr Dean Brown burrowing away at it. Their proposal is that, after the election in 1996 in September or October, they will have state income taxes, with the Australian Taxation Office collecting the money. Were that to happen, the capacity of running a national economy, of running national fiscal policy, of dealing with the deficit as the surplus, of having One Nation type policies in a recession to bring growth back to a surplus in a long period of growth would no longer be there. When I did my best-:-and.I did well-to spike the 1991 proposal, In theIr temerity the states said, 'Not only will we fix the rates on income tax, but if you, the Commonwealth, want to do another accord deal with tax cuts, you will have to compensate us'-the states-'for the loss of revenue were you to do a wage tax trade-off.' Or, for instance, in the money which the Commonwealth, this government, is going to pay taxpayers for superannuation-the three per cent we are going to pay to them-we would have to compensate the states for the loss of their revenue. Because the Liberal Party has never been a national party, it has always been a collection of state based parties, the tail is still wagging the dog. Mr Ronaldson-This is appalling; sit him down.

107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have warned him this afternoon.,48
108,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence, it is the reason why there was so much interest in this in the OECD and the IMF during the Treasurer's last two visits. I think you heard the Treasurer say that at the IMF World Bank meetings many OECD countries were interested to know how Australia had got to the point where 15 per cent of all incomes will go away voluntarily as part of a national savings and retirement incomes scheme. As a result, Australians will have a much higher standard of living in retirement, and there will be a very large pool of national savings. I have formerly given the House the numbers. There will be $1 trillion in national superannuation accounts by the year 2000, and $2 trillion-$2,000 billion-by the year 2020. Even in large countries, even in very large countries, those are very sizeable amounts. But, in a country this large, they are huge amounts. Contrast that with the dullards of the opposition and what they were able to do when they were in office. After seven years of government, you are left a modest sum in superannuation accounts with 40 per cent coverage for people in higher incomes or in the Public Service. That was it-about roughly 10 per cent of what is there now. Mr Reith-It will be lucerne all around that year, won't it.",48

116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I noticed today, by the way, on the front page of the Financial Review, a story from Mr Ian Matheson, who is supposed to be with the Private Investment Managers Association. It turns out that this fellow-32 years of age, South Australian Liberal Party establishment background, worked for Steele Hall and Downer and widely believed to be seeking Liberal Party preselection-can go and put a press statement out and get himself on the front page. You could sell them the town hall clock down at the Financial Review these days. Honestly, you could sell them the Sydney Harbour Bridge-you would have to wrap it, though. But we could get Christo down and they would go for it for sure. This is the sort of tripe you get. When a national government says, 'There are higher objectives here in developing a sensible equities market, a sensible capital market, that actually brings companies to the market and supports those companies that are growing and that need equity and capital,' the opposition does nothing but disparage it while they think superannuation fund money should go chasing the price of blue-chip stocks, pushing Westpac, NAB shares and BHP shares to even greater heights.

That is the issue. I know the opposition have got pressure from the member for Bradfield, who is on their back about adopting their policies. Who is on his back?

When asked the other day, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Oh no, the big issue coming to the election will be that a new group runs Australia,' with all the serious Menzies intonation he could raise at the moment. He said that a new group will run Australia-the new Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer; the new shadow Treasurer;· the new foreign minister, Mr Downer; the very new industrial relations spokesman, Mr Reith; and the exceptionally new member for Ryan. But, of course, they will not have the member for Bradfield, who is going to the great hereafter. But he is putting together their savings policies. They need help over therebadly. United Nations: Women",50
134,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. The minister would be aware that this is the year of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. What is the level of representation of women in the UN and what action is the government taking to increase the level of women in decision making positions in the UN?,50
135,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to inform the House that women now constitute approximately 20 per cent of the total diplomatic staff in permanent missions in the UN. That is a very slight improvement over the last 50 years. In fact, in 1949 they represented 16 per cent. So it has been very slow progress indeed, and all nations need to lift their game. While the participation of women in decision making positions in the UN has improved ever so slightly, it is not surprising that it not increased very much, because the countries represented there have not done much better than that. Women constitute only 14 per cent, for instance, of members of the federal parliament. I am pleased to be able to remind the House that, on this side of politics at least, we have made significant effort to get more women into parliaments around the countrynot just the federal parliament but also the state parliaments. The Labor Party has recognised the problem but, more important than that, it has set up a mechanism to address it. Opposition members-Ha, hal",50
136,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members opposite,50
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will wait. I again remind members, particularly those on my left, that when ministers have the call they will be heard.",50
138,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members opposite do not like to hear this because we have not only identified the problem but set up an explicit mechanism and changed the rules of the party to achieve the 30 per cent outcome. I am delighted to say that, for example, the South Australian ALP have already achieved that goal. They have not only done that with their parliamentarians but gone beyond that with their candidates. I am also pleased to see that at least one member of the New South Wales opposition has also recognised the need for positive action on this front. The New South Wales Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has recognised, as he puts it, that generations of women have become increasingly alienated by the political process and we-that means both sides of the House-have to do something about that. He suggested in Brisbane on the weekend that the opposition should develop explicit strategies, mechanisms, to install more women in our parliaments-not just to wish it would be so but to actually do it. He said on Sydney radio this morning: I believe we need to do morehe is speaking here of the Liberal Partyto get more women in more quickly so that we better reflect the needs of the community. has In other words, he is saying that the present Liberal selection system is failing Australian women-something I would have thought would have been easy to recognise.  concerned and appears to have done his homework on the topic. Indeed, he thought the issue was of sufficient importance that he described it as a matter of life or death for the Liberal Party. Unfortunately, that view is apparently not shared by the Leader of the Opposition, and I am not surprised at that. He told the Sydney  saying: I just think the present preselection system is working well. These things take time. They take time, indeed. It has taken 100 years for women to represent 14 per cent of the positions in this parliament. If we do nothing now, as the dinosaurs opposite are suggesting, it will be another 300 years before we get equal representation in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition is complacent about it-there does not need to be any change. Australian women, including Liberal Party women, are not prepared to wait that long either. I think it is very important that we recognise the need for change. We on this side do, but it seems the Leader of the Opposition is having great difficulty in coming to terms with this concept. He still lives back in the 1950s. He still endorses the views of the Lyons Forum that basically says women should not be out there in the community; they should be at home and they should not be working in this place. A lot of your members are members of this forum. If you think there are no problems at the moment, you are clearly wrong. It is as if, as the Prime Minister said on Friday night, Australia has passed John Howard by. He is not keeping up at all. Nothing has changed in the Liberal Party, and on this matter John Howard wants nothing to change. Superannuation: AMP",50
139,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the editorial in today's Financial Review which states: The timing and the circumstances of Mr Keating's attack on the institutions have left the clear sion that the Prime Minister is seeking to bully the funds in order to protect Labor's corporate mates. I ask the Prime Minister: isn't it true that your attack on the AMP was solely an attempt to pressure the AMP into retaining your favoured nominees on the Coles Myer board? How can the public have any confidence that the value of the funds they have set aside for their retirement will not again be assaulted by your actions for your own blatant political purposes?,51
140,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are going to feed an ALP youth council with a question like that, honestly. I have noticed over the last week that particularly the Leader of the Opposition up there and the deputy leader up there have suggested that, because I happen to have had a meal with Mr Lindsay Fox in Mr Solomon Lew's company and with Mr Kelty",51

142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-Order! I warn the member for O'Connor.,51
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"in some way I was doing some manoeuvring with them about Coles Myer. I told the House that that was not discussed. Both of them corroborated that it was not discussed. But then we find in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday that Mr Howard dined with Mr Solomon Lew and his close friend and fellow board member Mr Lindsay Foxbut not at Mr Fox's house, at Mr Lew's house. How amoral are you? You are over there throwing comments to me about, 'Tell us who's coming to dinner?' You are completely amoral. Dishonest John. You run in two days in question time an attack on me on the basis that I have gone to a social function at Mr Fox's place, the occasion of it being the grant of a piece of Commonwealth property for a collection he is giving to the state of Victoria. Mr Costello-A birthday party?",51
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I was asked by your friend the Victorian Premier; and the Commonwealth agreed. The Herald says: Mr Howard dined with the then Coles Myer boss, Mr Solomon Lew, and his close friend and fellow board member, Mr Lindsay Fox, before Mr Keating impresdid. But Mr Howard's dinner was at Mr Lew's house. Mr Keating's was at Mr Fox's. It says, 'The Herald understands the chief  was there. He was not there talking about the car collection, that's for sure. The Herald says, 'The Melbourne business figure and Federal treasurer of the Liberal Party, Mr Ron Walker, was also there.' I have said before that those opposite have the morals of an alley cat, and they have. On what basis of morality are you up there poking questions to me about meeting Mr Fox socially, when you have met to talk about a subject that you have discussed yourself at Mr Lew's own home? The duplicity of the double standard is faint making. Ron Walker is the Ron Walker of grand prix and casino fame. He is the federal treasurer of the Liberal Party. He is there taking the bag around. Mr Speaker, as you know, Mr Lew and Mr Fox are both supporters of the Liberal Party. Mr Fox made that very clear publicly on television the other day. The Leader of the Opposition was attending a dinner at Mr Lew's home with the federal treasurer of the Liberal Party.",51

150,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"April! Well, there we are. So that entitles you to ask a question of me about Mr Fox, does it? You have double standards, no morality and you are sleight-ofhand specialists. You can bet what the conversation was with the federal treasurer of Liberal Party there. Now there is the expansion of the casino that is just happening, gratuitously, as a gift to that group-the grand prix and the rest. They are the mates. That is the mates club. Mr Costello-What! You talking about mates!",52
151,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know you are not a mate of Mr Kennett. He calls him 'dog' - not 'the dog', nothing as charming as that; just straight 'dog': d-o-g. Mr Moore-Do you know what he calls you?",52
152,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When Mr Howard used to go to the parliament chambers, when Mr Peacock was there he used to say, 'Rodent alert, rodent alert.' They are the sorts of friendships which go on inside the Liberal Party. What a little mates club that was: Mr Howard, Mr Walker, Mr Bartels and Mr Fox and Mr Lew, both acknowledged members and supporters of the Liberal Party. There was even your one-off little luncheon engagement  you have this juvenile question from old laughing gravey over there about mates. Income Distribution",52
153,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Has the minister seen reports concerning the level of income distribution in Australia? How does Australia's level of income distribution compare with that in other countries? What impact does the social security system have in making such comparisons?,52
154,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members who were present at question time last week would recall seeing the Leader of the National Party in a lather of orgiastic delight as he brandished a one-year-old copy of the Economist magazine, purporting to show that the level of inequality in Australia was comparatively high compared to other developed countries. I hate to spoil the Leader of the National Party's day but, in fact, his quotation of those statistics was completely erroneous and misleading. There was a set of bar graphs in that issue the of the Economist that seemed to be the basis of the Leader of the National Party's claim. If you analyse that set of charts, the reality is that the Australian data that was utilised failed to make a technical adjustment for family size, which has the consequence of overstating the degree of inequality in this country by about two to one. If you make that simple correction, that alone is sufficient to completely transform the picture. The suggestion that the Leader of the National Party was making on that occasion was completely misleading and wrong. Comparisons between countries in terms of inequality and the distributive effect of the tax and transfer systems have to take account of the fact that most other countries, particularly in Europe, have social insurance base systems where people make contributions during their working lives towards their retirement incomes. The effect of those sorts of systems is to bring about a very substantial redistribution to the same individuals over the course of their life cycles. If you actually do the analysis properly, it turns out that, in terms of redistribution between people, our system is highly redistributive in comparison to those systems where many of the analyses overstate the degree of redistribution by taking into account that life cycle effect that you get in social insurance systems. I would like to refer honourable members to the recent EPAC report on inequality, which actually made use of OECD data to tabulate a number of measures of inequality. One of the most significant was a set of tables that looked at the current situation and trends over time in terms of the ratio of people at the ninth decal point in the income distribution to those at the first decal point-in other words, the ratio of the incomes of those 10 per cent from the top to those 10 per cent from the bottom. On that sort of measure, particularly in comparison with the other English speaking countries, it turns out that Australia has a relatively high equitable income distribution. By comparison with the United States, for example, the degree of inequality is about half here. By comparison with the UK, the degree of inequality is about one-third less. I would like to table a series of graphs which sets that out very clearly and shows very starkly and graphically what the real situation is in terms of equity in this country compared with a number of other comparable countries. In conclusion, I make the obvious point. All the policy prescriptions we have heard from the opposition are unambiguously regressive at all points when you can actually get to grips with what they are saying-whether it be taking apart the social safety net to introduce a system of industrial relations, which in all countries in which it has been introduced has had the effect of increasing earnings in equality. The protestations of concern are the usual collection of hypocrisy. I refer honourable members to the series of charts which I have just tabled which show the actual position very clearly. Earnings: Equality",52
155,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement at the ACOSS conference that there has been an international trend towards increased wages inequality, which has in Australia 'impacted much less on those workers at the bottom than in many other countries.' Mr Bevis-There are a lot of them in Kooyong.",53
156,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are actually. I ask the Prime Minister: why does he persist with this distortion when the OECD figures on which the EPAC report relies show that in the 12 countries for which an index of earnings is available, during Labor's period in office, the majority of countries actually improved the position of the bottom 10 per cent of workers and reduced earnings inequality, while Australia was one of only three countries that experienced a real cut in the earnings of the lowest paid 10 per cent of workers and increased inequality?",53
157,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether the honourable gentleman is looking at the same data that the government is looking at from the OECD. I have got a graphic illustration of the OECD outlook. It is headed 'Trends in male wage inequality, ratio of decile 9 to decile 1, 1970s to 1990s'. The greatest inequality, of course, is in the United States-right at the top of the chart, which simply confirms what Robert Reich, the US Labor Secretary, had to say. You will remember that I reported his remarks here. He said: The great problem in the OECD is that in the United States we have had heaps of employment growth and faUing real wages. We have got an army of working poor. On the other hand, the problem in Europe is that we have got high real wages, high growth in real wages and high unemployment. There is nothing, it seems, in between. What is in between are the policies of this government and the performance of Australia, which has had high employment growth and, of course, a much lower dispersion between wages growth at the top and wages growth at the bottom. This is obvious by the fact that we have had 26 per cent employment growth in this country in just over 10 years. We have had a 7.2 per cent increase in real wages, a 40 per cent increase in real household disposable income and a 21 per cent increase in real household disposable income per capita. Mr Georgiou-How much per household?",53
158,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the key number, real household disposable income per capita21 per cent real. That takes into account the salary supplements, pensions and other payments. So even if one looks at wage dispersion, you find here that the dispersion is lower. When you look at the chart-and Australia is heavily incised here in the black line-in comparative terms we have got a modest change in the dispersion of wages in Australia. Of course, this chart deals with male wage inequality. It does not deal with transfer payments. It does not mention the family allowance supplement or additional family payment. It does not mention the family allowance or Medicare. It does not mention all the other important elements of the social wage-supplementary payments for people at the bottom. It does not mention all of those things. Of course, it does not mention award superannuation. This is a fair enough issue to talk about, the questioner misrepresented the OECD statistics. The degree of his misrepresentation is apparent from the chart. I table the chart for the perusal of honourable members. Families: Conditions of Employment",54
159,Mr SA WFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What would be the consequences for Australian families of the removal of conditions of service, such as sick leave, overtime, leave loadings and access to superannuation? Is it the intention of the government to remove those conditions of employment?",54
160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the decisions Australia has to make is what sort of society it wants to be in the future-whether it wants to be a society like it is now, where inclusion and equality are important objectives of the national government and of society, or whether you go to a US-style labour market, which has got no safety net, no supports, falling real wages and which, as a consequence, is not improving its productivity to the point where it can grow the US economy at any real speed. As everyone in this House knows, the unofficial speed limit in the United States is 2.5 per cent GDP growth. This country has had, consistently, four per cent. There is all the world of difference between 2.5 per cent and four per cent over a decade in the opportunity and the prosperity which a country enjoys. That is one of the issues that will have to be decided at the next election-whether or not Australia wants to take the regressive path of the coalition to a US-style labour market, with simply no safety net, the no-disadvantage test, or whether wages and conditions can fall, as is the case now in Western Australia. When asked, 'Is it true that penalty rates, overtime, superannuation and holiday loadings could all go under Howard?' the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations, Mr Reith, said, 'It is just more of Labor's lies'the paltry, cheap rejoinder. He thinks that is going to be effective in this period coming up, but the fact is that the policies that the coalition would allow, the ones I mentioned, would be lost without compensation. This is but true, as we are seeing now in the legislation in Western Australia. Surely he does not deny the legislation, the actual written word, of the policies of the government of Western Australia. We found the Leader of the Opposition slipping and sliding on this stuff. You see, he is always saying that he is in favour of families, but he is not in favour of decent incomes. He is in favour of families, but he is not in favour of overtime rates. He is in favour of families, but he is not in favour of penalty rates. He is in favour of families, but he is not in favour of overtime leave loading. Mr Ronaldson-But you said wages are up. Mrs Gallus-Yes, wages are up.",54
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for BaIlarat and the member for Hindmarsh. It's contagious.,54
162,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is in favour of a few give-aways up the top to families in the tax system but always diminishes the value of the working wage, the wage to families of the pay packet, in the immediacy of its relevance to every family in this country. He has been saying, ineffectively-I think unpersuasively-that he does not support the Western Australian legislation, though we know that he went to the Liberal Party national conference six weeks ago and endorsed it. But then last week the Premier of Western Australia put his weights up. In the Australian there was a report which said: The Premier revealed he had met the federal Opposition leader . . . in Sydney last Friday and discussed the legislation. Mr Howard was not at all concerned about the row over the legislation; in fact he was a strong supporter, Mr Court said. Again, what do people need? Do they need it carved in stone? Do they need it up there in blinking lights? The coalition would rip the hell out of Australian wages, just as the government of Western Australia is. We have heard Mr Kennett tell a 100-plus meeting of the Business Council that when the federal Libs get in the employees will have nowhere to go. They will be trapped as they run around trying to find a way out as the weight of coalition industrial relations policy comes down. In the analysis now about the last election result-because stereotypes are always so easily taken up-they say it was all about the GST. It was not about the GST at all. It was about them. John Hewson said, 'The Prime Minister says, ""Put an arm back""'-as I did say-""'and let us bring the low paid, the disadvantaged, the unemployed up with us.'"" He said, 'Put an arm back, and they will drag you down.' It is that cold-heartedness, that mean-spiritedness, that sort of Australia, that cost the coalition the last election. The GST was simply a manifestation of it. They have got the same agenda now. But rather than the integrity of putting it in the marketplace as John Hewson did-give him his due, he had it all out there; even if he had his prejudices with them, he had the policy detail out there-what the Leader of the Opposition is about is cutting wages, taking all these conditions away and supporting a Western Australian style industrial relations system. But when he gets asked or pressed about it he says, 'It is a pack of lies.' That is just like the print of the shadow Treasurer's interview, giving states taxing powers-not a share of revenue. Mr Costello-Oh, what an absolute lie.",55
163,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says that that is an absolute lie. All of this comes from the lack of core integrity in them not producing their policies, not putting into place what they actually mean. Is it not a fact that, for the major parties at least, one incumbent duty on the leadership is to say where they will take Australia, what the direction should be and what the policy directions ought be under their administration? I think that is an incumbent responsibility on governments and on oppositions. But the Leader of the Opposition thinks now he will not fall into the policy trap that Dr Hewson was in and he will slip and slide through with all this secret work. In the last election, up till election day, the Leader of the Opposition, then the industrial relations spokesman, was telling us that he had an industrial relations bill, an actual bill for an act, that he was going to publish in the week coming up to the election. He was going to publish it in the three months coming up to the election. He said it was being drafted privately by private legal consultants.",55
164,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And finished.,55
165,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No doubt it was finished. But where is it? We have never seen it. He has never had the decency to show anybody what he stood for in 1993. He has never shown us what in fact he actually believes in. Now he is giving winks and nods by endorsing draconian measures of the Western Australian variety, and when there is community reaction trying to sheet it home to the government. We saw his paltry effort last Monday morning on AM, sitting like the cat who swallowed the cream, waiting to fit me up with an industrial dispute of his and Richard Court's making. I know what happened when we faced him. It was like a Mr Magoo act on television. We all saw that. Mr Speaker, let's get this right. Here is Premier of Western Australia saying, 'I met the federal opposition leader in Sydney last Friday and we discussed the legislation. He was not at all concerned about the row. He said he was a strong supporter.' Let's have any of these cheap, paltry admonitions about them being lies. We know what it is about. I will tell you what you are about. You are about cutting wages. You are about losing all these conditions. You are going to try to rob people of the proposed Commonwealth payments to superannuants, the three You are going to rob them of that. You are going to cut Medicare to pieces. You are going to do the very same things that John Hewson had the integrity to say he was going to do. I notice that the moment someone from the churches gets up and says, 'Tell us about agreed to: your IR policy, tell us about your support for the disadvantaged,' they cry, 'Foul, foul foul! You shouldn't be mentioning these things if you are a religious organisation.' Mr Reith-I met with the bloke. I met him.",55
166,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,56
167,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, let's make it quite clear that what we have here is the same savagery from the coalition that we always had. They were overtaken by the chill winds from the Northern Hemisphere in the 1980s and they have never given it up. They Services are still onto it. The whole world has resolved, changed. There are international discussions. honesty You have President Jacques Chirac's prime breach minister saying, 'We've got to try to lift the employment in France.' You have a debate across Western Europe about low employment growth. Here we have the double: strong employment growth and real income growth. You want to walk away from it and go back to the sort of policies that the US Labor Secretary says have destroyed the United States' economy. Public Life: Ethical Standards and Honesty Mr ABBOTTI direct my question to the Leader of the Opposition understanding order 143. I refer the leader to the notice of motion standing in his name on page 9251 of today's the Notice Paper, the notice of motion dealing with the government's reckless indifference to ethical standards and standards of honesty in public life. Is there any urgency to this motion and can the leader give an indication of not when the motion might be debated?",56

Mr Speaker, I am absolutely delighted at this unexpected opportunity-absolutely delighted! I was asked by my colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) whether there was any urgency about a motion which asks the parliament to debate the dishonesty of the government. If ever one wanted some evidence of the urgency of this motion, that evidence has been provided by none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during question time today. On our reckoning, in his last dorothy dix alone, the Prime Minister enunciated no fewer than nine lies in the answer that he gave.",56
175,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,Order! The Leader of the Opposition knows a little better than that.,57
176,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,I hope you will apply that to,57
177,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,It will apply everywhere.,57
178,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,"We will wait for that. So great were the distortions of reality that from the Prime Minister during the answer to that question, and indeed the answer to other questions, that I was moved to say to my· colleague the Deputy Leader of tion (Mr Costello) that a few years ago we set up a Waste Watch Committee. I think we have now got to set up a lie watch committee in order to examine the statements that made. This issue goes to the very heart of debate that is going to rage in Australia between now and the next election, and that is, who do you believe? Do you believe Paul Keating or do you believe John Howard? Far be it from me to personalise this debate-it not my wont to do that-but if the Prime Minister really wants to make integrity an issue in the next election, if the Prime Minister really wants the Australian people make a judgment as to who they are going to believe, let me say to the Prime Minister, Labor opponent, the member for Blaxland, that it sits very easily with those who sit this side of the House for the next election campaign to be a debate about whether you believe Paul Keating or John Howard. Those who sit on this side of the House have very little doubt as to what the judgment of the cost.' Australian people is going to be during the election campaign, if that is the issue. This debate gives me a marvellous oppormoment. tunity to traverse a number of the issues that the Prime Minister touched upon during that extraordinarily dishonest and deceptive swer that he gave before I was asked a tion by the member for Warringah. It is very clear that the government have decided on one thing and one thing alone-that is, the only faint hope they have of winning the election campaign is to run a campaign based on lies and personal abuse. Every single thing they will do between now and polling day will fit very neatly into either of those descriptions. I expected it of the Prime Minister and his colleague, the man we call 'the Laurie of lies'-the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). When it comes to integrity, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is battling pretty hard to get into the race. I expected it from them, but I don't know that I expected it from the Deputy Prime Minister came (Mr Beazley). He has always rather paraded himself as being somebody a little better, but he has been sucked into the vortex of dishonesty. He has been sucked into this pattern of the Opposilies and personal abuse. The reality is that you only decide to run on a campaign of lies and personal abuse when are you don't have anything else to run with. That is the great dilemma that this man, my the Labor opponent, faces over the next few months. He cannot run on his record. How can you run on a record when you go to the Australian people saying, 'Re-elect us because, cleverly, we have increased the foreign is debt by 800 per cent. We tried to make it 1,000 per cent, but we could only make it 800 per cent. Re-elect us because, cleverly, we have increased the cost of servicing the to average mortgage in Australia by 50 per cent. We tried to make it 100 per cent, but all we my have been able to do since 1983 is lift the figure from $651 a month, on the average on loan, to $974 a month. We tried harder and there was a time when we hoped we would say to the Australian people that we could have got it up by 75 per cent, but you'll have to settle for an increase of 50 per cent in the And you wonder why the battlers of Australia think they are being hard pressed at the What my Labor opponent has done over the last 13 years is push up by 50 per cent the cost of servicing the mortgage payanments on the average home. That is why so quesmany of you are shaking in your shoes in those marginal seats. That is why we have so much of this false bravado in those 90-second grabs before question time. You are trying to next get together and summon up your 3 a.m. courage, to try to pretend that it is all perfectly all right. But you know perfectly well that it is not all right, and you know darned well that those people who have voted for you, year in and year out, want to know why it is that you have let them down so very badly. So you cannot run on the management of the foreign debt and you cannot run on keeping mortgage rates down, so perhaps you could run on real wages. You could run on the fact that, in the 13 years you have power, real wages have actually fallen. You cannot run on that. But I know what you can really run on. The one thing you could perhaps run on is how the gaps between rich and poor in Australia have disappeared while you have been the Prime Minister of this country. In the course of doing that, perhaps you could explain to the Australian people why it is that, in 1976, 65 per cent of all households in Australia had .incomes between $22,000 and $72,000. In constant dollar comparisons, by 1992 that figure had fallen, over that 16 years, from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. That would have to represent the greatest decimation of the stabilising middle class in this country that have seen since European settlement. So I do not think you will be running on the divide between the rich and the poor. So perhaps you could run on integrity. Opposition members-Oh, no!",57
179,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,"Am I being uncharitable? You could run on all those promises you have kept, Paul. Perhaps you could explain what happened to those l-a-w tax cuts. Perhaps you could explain what happened to that free dental service you promised at Bankstown during the last election campaign. Perhaps you could explain to the Australian public all of those other promises-that you were not going to put the Medicare levy up, that you were going to maintain living standards and all those other promises that you said you were going to deliver on. So I do not think they are going to run on that. You know, perhaps they could run on hope for the future, after having presided over an absolutely scandalous rising youth unemployment rate. In the time my Labor opponent has been either Prime Minister or Treasurer of this country, the average rate of unemployment has stuck at around eight per cent, which is significantly higher than it was under the seven years of the previous government. Those sorts of comparisons can be made in so many areas. So I do not think they are going to run on hope for the future. So you cannot run on your record, although I wish you would. You cannot run on integrity-although, please, run on integrity. I would been in love you to do that. You cannot run on offering hope for the future. So all you have left to do is run on lies and personal abuse. That is what we have been treated to today. That is why this motion I have moved is urgent. That is why I am very pleased it has been brought on for debate today. It gives the House an opportunity to examine the behaviour of the Prime Minister, to examine the behaviour of those opposite and particularly to examine the way in which they have tried to lie about and distort the attitudes of the coalition on particular policy issues. Despite the most emphatic denial by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, what did the Prime Minister do today? He lied through we his teeth about our taxation policy. What has he said about Medicare? He said that we are going to rip the guts out of Medicareanother lie. He said that we are going to take away penalty rates-another lie. He said that we are going to take away sick leaveanother lie. Doesn't it pass very strange? Here he is criticising any arrangement that operates anywhere in Australia whereby entitlements like holiday loadings and penalty rates might be cashed out and paid by way of higher income. He criticises that. He says that is wrong. Mr Snowdon-That is wrong.",58
180,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,"You think that is wrong, do you? Mr Snowdon-Yes.",58
181,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,"Oh, you do. You think it is wrong. That is very strange. Why don't you have a look at some of the examples in the One Nation statement? One of the examples of best industrial relations practice that was held up for everybody to see in the One Nation statement was the leI Botany arrangement whereby the very thing that I have described was in fact practised. What they did there was to get hold of the penalty rates and the holiday loading and cash them out. Everybody got a higher wage. Everybody was better off. They worked less hours. They were better off. The company operated better. Everybody was happy, and you think that is a lousy arrangement. All I can is say is: you go on interjecting and you go on saying those sorts of arrangements are very bad. The reality is that, under our policy, Australian workers will enjoy higher wages because there will be higher productivity. There are no circumstances in which a Howard government would cut the wages of Australian workers. There will be no circumstances in which sick leave is taken away. This attempt by the government, this attempt by the Prime Minister, this attempt by the Deputy Prime Minister to spread this veneer of lies and distortions about our policy merely underlines one very salient feature-that is, after 12Yz to 13 years they have got very tired of you, after 12Yz and 13 years they no longer believe you, after 12Yz to 13 years they no longer believe that you can be trusted with their future. They know that their living standards have gone down. You know that hundreds of thousands of your traditional voters are revolting against what you have done over the last 13 years. That is what Mick Young told you in the wake of the Queensland election. That is what Maher, the former president of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, said at the recent meeting of that particular union. It is being said all over the country. I know that that charge by your own supporters hurts. I know it stings because it is true and it brings home the reality of what has happened over the last 13 years. You have this ridiculous situation that your leader is with these absurd diversions about attacking the management of superannuation funds in Australia. Instead of facing up to a proper debate about alternative approaches to the government of this country, what does he do? All he does is distort and mislead the Australian people and the Australian parliament about what we are going to do. That is all he does. The Prime Minister talks about there being no truth or honesty in politics. He ought to know all about that. Over the last three weeks we have seen this unofficial election campaign go into overdrive largely at the instigation of the Prime Minister. During that time, has there been any attempt by the Prime Minister to seriously analyse the achievements of his government? No. What the Prime Minister has done over that period of time is to deliberately lie and distort the policies of the opposition. One minute the Prime Minister says that I have no policies at all. We heard this remarkable litany from the Prime Minister when I became Leader of the Opposition at the beginning of this year. He said, 'Don't take any notice of him. He is a creature of the 1950s.' Those opposite went on with that and they would occasionally fast forward me to the 1970s but basically I was a creature of the 1950s. They tried that for a while and then they decided to give that away because it was not really biting. Then they said, 'I know what we're going to do. We're now going to say that he's got no policy.' Then they tried that month after month. They said, 'He's got no policy.' Mr Les Scott-What are your policies?",58
182,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,"That is the official line, is it? No policies today, dangerous policies tomorrow, is it? You roster policies off one day and you roster them on the next. Those opposite tried this line that I have no policies. Then they decided that was not working. The next thing they tried to do was say, 'Not only has he got a lot of policies, but his policies are so dangerous and so draconian and they are so full of fear and loathing that they are going to rip apart the fabric of Australian left society.' How can you take a crowd seriously that really invites ridicule from the Australian people-in the first breath to say he has no policy so he should be completely ignored and in the next breadth to say his policies are so full of menace and loathing that they are going to rip apart the fabric of Australian society. That reminds us very much of the bravura of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) last Thursday when he said, 'The problem with the coalition's wages policy is that you won't be able to control the upward movement of wages under a coalition.' Only a minute earlier his leader, the Prime Minister, had said that I was going to cut wages. Three minutes after Simon Crean sat down, the Prime Minister was up again saying, 'You don't want to elect Howard because he is going to cut wages.' Government members ought to make up their minds; they are saying that wages will go up and go down. Wages will either go up, down or sideways. The reality is that the government has no coherent response to the coalition at the present time. I return to the point I made at the beginning of this motion and the reason I am delighted this motion has come on today. It is important that this motion be debated today because it is important that, in the words of the motion: . . . this House reaffinns the importance of truth public life as essential to preserving confidence in government. There is little doubt that one of the worse features of Australian politics at the present time is the breakdown of trust between the Australian people and their elected governments. And the man more than anybody else who is responsible for that is Paul Keating. Paul Keating has done far more to destroy the trust of ordinary Australians in the honesty of government than any other person who has stalked the federal political stage. It is important that this motion come on because it gives the House an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of those principles. Those principles have been highlighted today by the answers given by the Prime Minister, which have demonstrated amply not only to us but to those listening to these proceedings how the government is absolutely bereft of any strategy to handle the next election campaign, other than a strategy which is built on lies and personal abuse. During the past few weeks, we have seen an absolute deluge of personal abuse and personal attacks. All I can say to the Prime Minister is this: You go ahead and continue with that personal abuse and those personal attacks. Every time you engage in them, you go further back in the public's esteem. I do not think anybody on this side of the parliament should be particularly concerned that you are continuing with that strategy. As for the lies and distortions that the Prime Minister is engaged in, every time he lies about and distorts our policies, he reminds the Australian people of the paucity of the arguments he has in the lead-up to the next election-just as his constant harping on my past record and his constant harping a few months ago on the past record of other people in the coalition proclaimed to the Australian people that he is obsessed about the past because he has no answer to today's problems and offers no hope for the future. The fact is that government members will base their campaign on lies and distortions. They have demonstrated these lies and distortions in relation to our industrial relations policy, with the absolute lie that we would in take away sick leave entitlements, the absolute lie that we would take away penalty rates, the absolute lie that we would take away superannuation and the absolute lie that we would cut wages under a Howard government. All of those are complete lies and fabrications. The fact that you have engaged in that action demonstrates very clearly to the Australian public that you cannot run on your record because you are ashamed of it, that you have no integrity to offer the Australian people because they will not believe you and that you have no hope to offer to future generations of Australians. That is why you are left with a contemptible, residual campaign approach of running on lies and personal abuse. The more you do it, the more you proclaim your inadequacy and your unfitness to be returned as the government of this country at the next election.",59
183,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,Is the motion seconded? Mr Costello-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,60
184,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"I have been here long enough to know when an opponent does badly. Opposition members-Ha, hal",60
185,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was completely unprepared for this debate.,61
186,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,"Order! The Prime Minister will wait just a minute while I get some silence. The Leader of the Opposition on this important issue was heard in silence, as the Prime Minister will be.",61
187,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"From a notice of motion, the Leader of the Opposition has exercised a standing order and had himself asked a question during question time-question time being a period which is reserved for ministerial accountability. And what is that question about? It is about honesty and integrity in politics. Then, when the government gives him the opportunity to answer, he flounders around for 20 minutes. What is happening here is this: gradually the public are seeing through the chimera of the new John Howard and his leadership. That is what is happening here. He got the opportunity he never thought would come his way: a second go at the federal leadership of the coalition. He is the coalition's third choice in this parliament. They had Mr Hewson, and then they were done with him. They had Mr Downer, and then they were done with him. In the unlikely event of three leaders changing in one parliament, John Howard was given the Lazarus opportunity and got back for his second time. Anyone who is given such an opportunity would say, 'I've got the opportunity of a lifetime, I'll make it count. I'll actually lay down a structure for Australia. Coming from the conservative bed I come from, I'll lay it down. I'll put out another model'Mrs Bishop--He has your measure.",61
188,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,The member for Mackellar.,61
189,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"'for the way in which Australia functions as an economy and a society.' And what have we seen? We have seen no policy articulation. His federal tor says that his policies are 98 per cent prepared. But he will not show them to people because, he says, I will misrepresent them. He will not show them to people because he does not want them to see them. He will not articulate policies. Mrs Bishop--You call the election.",61
190,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,I warn the member for Mackellar!,61
191,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"He is hoping that he can focus on the government and slide under the line of an election without accountabilityjust as before the last election he said he would show people his industrial relations bill for an act, the election came and went, and he did not show it to them. The thing about John Howard is that Australia has passed him by. His defence and foreign policy speech last week could have been given by Harold Holt. It was a disgrace from a modem Australian politician, a disgrace from somebody who wants security from Asia rather than security in Asia. To go back to the United States as some sort of forlorn mendicant with that sort of rhetoric is not the policy you would expect from a modem Australian leader. That was only one thing he dribbled out. There were other things. Support of industrial legislation around the country: every time we see it, we see an echo of the things he stood for in the past, such as when he again, in a matter of opportunism a few weeks ago, got up and said-after years of pleading with the government to build a third runway at Mascot airport-that he not only would bring the capacity of it back by 40 per cent with a cross-runway heading but also would spike the government's legislation in the Senate, which is on this week, to allow the privatisation of the airports around this country to get the changes that the airports need. In other words, wherever we have seen him on policy, we have seen either the policies of the 1960s or opportunism, as we have seen with Mascot airport. That is why he is not into policies: every time he brings them out, they end up looking bad. Take this week. Here is the shadow direc- Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). Is he denying that he met the representative of Business Review Weekly? Is he denying the quotations that exist under the name of David Forman? Is he denying the fact that he is talking about a state income tax when he says those sorts of things? Mr Costello-Absolutely. I put out a statement. You know that.",61
192,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will have his chance.,62
193,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"Whenever they put their policies out, they look bad. That is why the chimera is starting to fade. Of course, for a government that has been in office for 12 years, the public always wants to see a viable alternative. When Mr Hewson came into the last parliament, there was a strong showing of support for him. It whittled away when people knew what his policies were. In this parliament when Mr Downer came forward, there was a strong showing of support. It vanished very rapidly. Similarly, there has been a strong showing of support for the Leader of the Opposition, and it is now starting to evaporate as people find there is a policy vacuum there and that the country's affairs could not be left in his charge. He has not been somebody who has used his time wisely in opposition to put together a good structure. He has not been somebody who has been thoughtful about Australia or who has any respect for the mores and values of the country that we have developed herefor the inclusiveness of our society, for its sense of egalitarianism and for the fact it is now an outward looking industrial society. None of that serious thought has gone into his policies. He has dragged out simply old policies from the 1970s and policies that he was comfortable with in the 1970s from the 1950s and the 1960s from his mentors-the likes of John Carrick or Sir Robert Menzies in his heyday and those sorts of people. They are the things he sees now as the policy prescriptions for the modern Australia. Yet here we are, with a large part of the earth's crust, happy in this large ancient continent bequeathed to us, with this great opportunity in the fastest growing markets of the world, with our chance for our security and our prosperity guaranteed by the thoughtful reactions of the nation and its government. But what does he say? 'I want security from Asia. I want to go back to the United States.' He is looking for the insularity. He is always hankering after the monoculture. Whenever he has had a chance to beat the immigration drum, he has. He is always hankering after the monoculture. He does not realise that the negotiation with Asia is not complete. When we came in 1788, we only pegged the claim. We are now negotiating our long run engagement with the region and our long run acceptance, cooperation and work with the region. Modern Australia will not accept a leader who basically takes the view that it is an European enclave, whose market preferences are with those places and whose security is with the United States. That is why they know the chimera is disappearing. Let me deal now with the motion, which reads: That, notwithstanding the Government's (a) refusal to stand down the Minister for Human Services and Health until questions of honesty are resolved ... She had arraigned against her unfairly a $5 million royal commission. That is the worse kind of personal abuse you could possibly imagine. A $5 million royal commission was arraigned against somebody whom you would not even give your support to give legal protection to, whom you have cavelled at even giving legal protection to. The motion continues: (b) reckless indifference to standards of honesty in public life ... He said, and this is high humbug, 'We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.' This is coming from somebody who over a long period has shown very clear indifference to those things-whether it be in his remarks about the royal commission that he actually refers to or in his connivance with the Western Australian Premier in setting it up. He asserted an untruth in his speech that, within the government's period in office, real wages have fallen; yet they have risen by 7.2 per cent over the period. He said, 'The very simple principle is that truth is absolute, that truth is never disposable.' But as Treasurer he promised a set of tax cuts in 1977 and took them away five months later. He said he would preserve Medibank and then destroyed it. Then he says of the government that we have not got any integrity in policy when in fact our most solemn commitment at the last election was to restore the economy to growth and to employment. We have had record growth in employment and record falls in unemployment since we have been keeping the records. We have had job growth of 670,OOO-the hardest thing of all to put into place. We have had strong employment growth, which is very much in line with the targets we put into the One Nation program in 1991. The first year undershot and all the other years overshot or met their target. Both the tax cuts and the superannuation will pay more than the One Nation commitments. We were responsible for the introduction and payment of the generalised child-care rebate. We created the home child-care allowance and the parenting allowance, both of which have gone into place, and a structure for the republic. These are all expressed commitments of the election campaign and they have all been put into place. But he has not acknowledged this. A wiser person would say, 'Well, the government has restored growth to the economy. It is the longest growth phase since the Second World War. There has been phenomenal employment growth. We've now got huge participation rates, but even against that we've got falling unemployment levels. They've introduced the child-care rebate and the home child-care allowance. They did put into place a structured republic.' What have we seen from you? Slipping and sliding on the republic, badmouthing the changes which the government is able to put into place, trying to wreck the ones in 1992 in the Senate, in the budget, and now trying to wreck the privatisation program. Then you go around saying that the government is vilifying the coalition with about their industrial relations and taxation policies, which of course we are not. Opposition members-Ha, hal",62
194,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,That is straight off your statements. Then there is personal abuse. He has got the federal President of the Liberal Party saying at every Liberal Party conference that I am one of wealthiest people in Australia-of course he knows that is completely untrue-and that I have enriched myself at the expense of the public through public decision making. Senator Baume for four yearsweekly and daily-has attacked me in the Senate over the investment I had in a piggery. The Leader of the Opposition actually phoned members of the company that I formerly held an ownership in twice this year to get personal papers from that company. The Leader of the Opposition himself did that.,63
195,Unknown,AND HONESTY,Opposition members interjecting,63
196,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"No, I did not; you did. Mrs Bishop says I have a psychiatric disorder and reads on a radio program extracts from a psychiatric handbook.",63
197,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,What?,63
198,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,That is not personal abuse.,63
199,Mr HOWARD,AND HONESTY,What? Mrs Bishop-Correct.,63
200,Mr SPEAKER,AND HONESTY,Order! Those on my left!,63
201,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"That is not personal abuse, but if I say of them that they intend to give tax powers to the states and that the Leader of the Opposition is telling lies he says, 'There you are: personal abuse.' It is not personal abuse; it is policy. That is what we have always fought on. But what Mr Howard always fights on is personalities, personalities and personalities. Part (a) of his motion refers to my 'refusal to stand down the Minister for Human Services and Health until questions of honesty are resolved' when he knows he has arraigned a $5 million royal commission against heragainst one woman-without resources to fight it. If that is not personal abuse writ large, what is personal abuse? Something she mayor may not have said in a cabinet meetlies ing about something which does not affect public administration. If that is not personal abuse, what is personal abuse? Then we had the dishonesty of him last week chiding me about meeting Mr Fox, knowing he had been to Mr Lew's house. The dishonour of it!",63
202,Mr LAVARCH,AND HONESTY,The hypocrisy!,63
203,Mr KEATING,AND HONESTY,"The hypocrisy and the double standards! He sat up on Monday morning waiting to say on AM that I had arranged the blockade. When I went to Western Australia the previous week, the first question I was asked was: ' Mr Keating, what have you got to say about the blockade which has now been on notice for three or four weeks?' It was obviously arranged by the Western Australian trade union against the government over there a month ago. He knew that, but he is there on the program and he thinks, 'I'll get him now. He won't get a right of reply. I'll fit him up with this.' That is sort of dishonesty that Mr Howard thinks that policy is made of. When he talked today in his speech about 8.5 per cent unemployment, he failed to mention that we have had 2.1 million job growth since 1983. He failed to mention that we have had the highest rate of growth-or just about; it is shared only with the United States-in the Western world over a decade. Could But that sort of sleight of hand goes on daily. We have these slipshod, poor and amoral performances by him, and they go on. Only commitments a fool would say, 'We want to assert the very everything simple principle that truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life. ' The same person wore the lies, lies admonition of the Illawarra Mercury-and he wore them fairly-for Only making commitments. The as said, 'Ring and find out how much the tax cuts are,' he took them away five months later. He has got the hide to make these sorts of references in public speeches because at the time he thought it was the glib thing to say about Minister for Human Services and Health who was battling away against one of the most corruptly arranged, unfair commissions in history of this country. It was then by a whole lot of judges and former royal commissioners who say they are abusing the royal commission. I reject the Leader of the Opposition's opportunist remarks and undergiven line how unprepared he was and how poorly he has done in this debate. (Time expired)",63
204,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,"We have to take whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says on these sorts of issues with great deal of humour. There is no intellectual consonance at all. I will start where he left off. What did the Prime Minister say in closing his speech? He said, 'Only a fool would say that truth is supreme, truth is absolute.' First of all, we would like on the record that the Prime Minister thinks it is foolish to talk about truth in public life. Of course it is foolish to talk about truth in public life if you have the kind of record that he has. The trouble with members of this govern the ment is that, when they get up and tell these absolute porkies, they cannot even lie straight. The Prime Minister says only fools would talk about truth being supreme or truth being absolute in Australian public life. I want to take honourable members back to the day that he became Prime Minister. He began his press conference on 9 December 1991 by saying this: I, in my first words as Prime Minister elect, Leader of the Labor Party elect, to you, the Australian people, say that I want to make three to them. The first is I pledge to give I've got to the job and the country. The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell absolute, truth is them the truthlies, and only a fool could assert that truth is supreme or truth is absolute in public life. a fool, then, could have begun his prime up ministership with those words, and how but foolish those words were for this Prime Minister. We only have to quote those words to hear people break out in a hoarse laugh, because telling the truth to the Australian the people and the prime ministership of Paul Keating are absolutely intellectually disconsonant-absolutely. There is no absolute the consistency whatsoever in the way in which attacked this Prime Minister deals. We often see advertised this airline with its frequent flier points or that airline with its frequent flier points, and we are sometimes reasons as to why one is better than the other. But there is no contest at all as to who wins the frequent liar points in this country.",64
205,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HONESTY,"Ha, hal",64
206,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,"The frequent liar points in this country are absolutely won by our a Prime Minister, and you are part of it. You, a fat man with a famous name, have gone around in Australian life trying to playoff the honesty of your father. But every time you back this Prime Minister you hook yourself in deeper and deeper with his lies and his dishonesty. Even in his speech what did he say? He said the central promise of the last election was economic growth.",64
207,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HONESTY,"No; 500,000 jobs.",65
208,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,"That was not the central promise of the last election. The central promise of the last election was this: he promised the Australian people that he would not put up taxes. Do you remember that promise? Do you remember the promise when he went down to the National Press Club and said there is all the difference in the world between some opposition speaker's manifesto and legislated tax cuts, the l-a-w legislated cuts? The central promise of your election manifesto was that you could introduce income tax cuts without a GST. And what happened after the election? Not one Australian saw those income tax cuts, those l-a-w tax cuts, for one day. They are due to be introduced on 1 January 1996. They will not take effect for one dollar for one Australian for one day. That is because this Prime Minister was elected on a platform of complete fraud at the last election. What does the Prime Minister say about this? He says he will deliver tax cuts and that he will be delivering them in 2001. Anybody can work out that in five years time, after bracket creep has clawed back all of those tax cuts and after people have been denied tax cuts for five years, not only are they out of pocket for five years but they have also paid the increased tax claw by bracket creep. Gi ving money in 2001 rather than 1996 is no substitute at all. In any event, people would not even get the money in 2001, when it finally gets to three per cent. Who would get the money in 2001? The superannuation funds, which this Prime Minister says are donkeys and lemmings. The greatest dishonesty of all must be that this government has allocated $12.5 million of taxpayers' money to put as on television which purport to the Australian people that, if they water a plant sitting on their desk, dollar bills will grow on the plant. Money actually does grow on trees! The Australian people are paying for the representation that money grows on trees. Then the Prime Minister gets up and says that the money that is going to grow is so great that people will get $460,000 by the year 2040. That is something to look forward to. And who is going to produce that $460,000 by 2040? Donkeys and lemmings! This is going to be a donkey-led superannuation program, a donkey-led recovery. All you have got to do is put in your nice juicy grass and the donkeys produce money off treesand we have got to pay for this with our own money! The government has taken away the legislated l-a-w tax cuts and is not giving them to tax people-we cannot trust them to the peopleon 1 January. It is giving them to the donkeys. The whole of the government's superannuation strategy is in absolute shambles. Why is it in absolute shambles? As the Financial Review said today, the Prime Minister went off his brain, attacking the AMP and other people not because he had suddenly worked out they were not selling bonds at the right moment. That is not any new development. It was not as if some return had come out that we had never seen before. The reason why this Prime Minister was upset-this is on the front page of today's Financial Review-was that his mates had not got the outcome in Coles Myer that he would have preferred. So this Prime Minister turned on superannuation funds, which are the very cornerstone of his superannuation policy. There is no logic to it whatsoever. Your own Prime Minister has thrown into doubt the savings of all of those Australians who, as a result, do not have confidence in superannuation funds, which he, the Prime Minister of this country, has branded as donkeys and lemmings. So we now have the situation where everybody is going to have 12 per cent taken out of their pay, where they are going to have a three per cent income tax cut, to be paid to donkeys. That is the bottom line of this wonderful superannuation policy that this government is talking about. But it was not just the l-a-w income tax cuts that were stolen from the Australian people. As well as that, there was the commitment that there would be no increases in tax. And what did we get? We got a one per cent and then another one per cent increase in the wholesale sales tax. So taxes on practically every good-toiletry, furniture, towelling, glassware and everything else-have been increased by a Prime Minister who pledged there would be no increases in taxation. What else did we see? We have seen that motorists have had a 5c increase in unleaded petrol and a 7c increase in leaded petrol-all from a Prime Minister who talks about integrity in policy, all from a Prime Minister who talks about credibility in policy. There can be no integrity whatsoever in policy in this country whilst that man remains in the Lodge. That is the bottom line. Then we find in question time that the Prime Minister, absolutely bereft of any defence whatsoever in relation to his own policy, smears and slurs at every opportunity. When we wake up every morning we wonder to ourselves: what will be the fabrication today? It is a bit of guesswork between us. We get on the phone and say, 'What do you think he will make up today?' I am wondering why you just do not come out and say, 'It's coalition policy to butcher babies,' and get it all over and done with. Why don't you just say it? We know that is what it is building up to. You have fired off all your big guns-may I say, everyone of your big guns!-with all of these lies that it must be getting harder you to outdo yourself every day. Acts of God, lightning, the end of the world, the butchering of babies-I do not know where you are going to finish up. The latest proposition that the Prime Minister has come out with is that we were going to have six state income taxes and six GSTs. Mr Beazley interjecting",65
209,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,You find the quote. As if we would have any motivation whatsoever to introduceMr Beazley interjecting,66
210,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,You do not even believe it yourself. You do not even believe it yourself.,66
211,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HONESTY,I do. I do. Mr Downer-Another lie! Another lie!,66
212,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,"The thing I like about these guys is that all you have to do to get a lie is to ask them a question-question, lie; question, lie; question, lie. It is like putting the golf ball in the mouth of the clown that turns its head from side to side. It always comes out as a lie, and you can guarantee it. So he is going to produce a quote that we actually want six state income taxes and six consumption taxes. You know, all of Australia knows and everybody in this parliament knows that that is the desperate line of a desperate man. The fact is that there can be no integrity in Australian politics while the . great liar lies in the Lodge. The great thing we can do for the Australian people is to return some integrity to the promises. Remember when they promised at the last election that they were going to take pensioners out of the income tax system? What happened to that? Are there any pensioners out there still in the income tax system? What happened to that promise? There is another thing I am always amazed about whenever we get up and have these debates about the relative disparity between the rich and the poor: do you remember that by 1990 no child would live in poverty? These are the people who seriously went to an election campaign, stood up and said that no child would live in poverty by 1990. That was for five years ago, and we still have not seen any return on it at all. Do you remember at the last election campaign how company tax was going to be reduced to 33c so we could compete in Asia? What is the rate now? It wouldn't be 36 per cent, would it? It wouldn't be another broken promise in relation to the last campaign! Let's make absolutely clear why the smear and the slur starts in relation to taxes: because you will not give one commitment. You will not give a commitment that if you were to be re-elected you will not be introducing new taxes. You will not give a commitment that if you were to be re-elected you will not be putting up existing ones. You will not give that commitment.",66
213,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HONESTY,Why on earth would we do that?,67
214,Mr COSTELLO,AND HONESTY,"He said, 'Why on earth would we do that?' Let the record show that the Labor Party at the next election wants new taxes and wants to increase existing taxes. Let the Australian people hear, on the admission of the Deputy Prime Minister, that when he is asked, 'Will you give a pledge not to introduce new taxes? Will you give a pledge not to increase existing taxes?' his answer is, 'Why would we do that?' Let's remember that this is not a guywhoo-oops-who does not have form. This is a guy who found it easy to introduce and increase taxes when he pledged last time not to do so. This time he will not pledge not to do so. So let us just speculate on how big the tax increases would be if this government were ever to get re-elected. It may not just the wholesale sales tax, it may wine tax, it may not be the company tax, it may not be the petrol tax this time, and it may not be taking away the income tax cuts this time. It may be any host of things, because this Deputy Prime Minister-let the record show-on this day said, 'Why would we do that?' Why indeed. Let me tell you why indeed it is important for the Australian people at the next election to have the opportunity to hold this government to account. This is a government that has been in power so long, has made so many deals and has engaged in so much duplicity that it has forgotten the difference between integrity and honesty with the people and looking after itself. This is a party that now stands for nothing but itself and its mates. This is a party to do anything it takes, as one of its former members said. They will say anything and they will do anything because, at the end of the day, all they care about are themselves. All they care about is holding on to power for themselves. All they care about is 13 years of privilege, which they want to maintain for themselves. The Australian people need a government which can turn that around and restore to Australia some sense of basic decency and honesty.",67
215,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HONESTY,"Every accusation that we have made against this scrofulous front-bench has been based on their own quotes about their own intentions. We have not introduced a single proposition into question time or anywhere else that has not been based on their own quotes about their own intentions. If there is anyone who is concealing anything about their intentions in this place it is the tumbling of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), as well as his leader, on the taxation stuff. Didn't they panic when they saw that come out. Didn't they rush into print to try to get out a few lies, distortions or whatever on covering their tracks-the tracks that he is laying allover this country with the conservative governments. He asks: 'Where's the evidence? Where are the quotes?' Let me go be through them. He has denied nothing of this. not just be the The document says: A powerful coalition of state governments of all persuasions and leading business groups is building around work, much of it being done in secret, to develop proposals for reforming vertical fiscal imbalance. Proposals for reforming vertical fiscal imbalance outlined in this include a whole variety of state taxes. Okay, we have got that accepted. That is the research that is being done. It is all there. When you talk about vertical fiscal imbalance, you talk about taxation policies. Got that right? If you use words like that, that is what you mean. There is no doubt about that. There is no argument. It goes on: The research being done by the conservative states is being fed into the federal coalition, and leading business groups are confident. The opposition is convinced of the need for fundamental changes to that is prepared the federal system. What is this on? Vertical fiscal imbalance. Related to what? Taxation policy involved in the states. That is what that is based on. So, as far as the opposition is concerned, you are the liars when it comes to presentation on these tax matters, and your lies have been tumbled. Then it goes on: Costello says there can be changes only if there is a cooperative approach with unanimous agreement from the states and a constructive approach from the federal government. The difference between us and the government 'is that we are willing to discuss these proposals, the government is not'. You are right there. What proposals? The vertical fiscal imbalance proposals. What are the vertical fiscal imbalance proposals? The vertical fiscal imbalance proposals are state income taxes and state consumption taxes. They are all there. It is not related to some sharing of tax revenue. It is all there. But when is it due to appear? We go on over the page and find what one of the drafters of all this says: A final reform blueprint or cookbook should be ready for release by September-October next year. We know a bit about the constitution. Is there going to be a federal election after September or October next year? No. The federal election is going to be before it. What will be the position of the opposition? Their position is, 'We will go into this election with a sleight of hand-a sleight of hand that we hope will not be tumbled; a sleight of hand that includes a hidden GST; a sleight of hand that includes state taxes.' A sleight of hand that is being researched, according to this article, by the conservative governments and by you. You have been tumbled. You have been the man of the smart one-liner and of the utterly incompetent policy process. You did not even know, as an opposition shadow spokesman on Treasury matters, when you stood up and said in this place and elsewhere that you supported the idea of a fixed share of income tax that you were in fact blowing out your deficit by $2.8 billion. You did not know that. You did not know that if you got the taxation revenues rising and you put a fixed element in there-which is not there at the moment-it is $2.8 billion up in times of prosperity, as we are looking at over the next four years. Of course, if you had been putting that in place during the recession, it would have been $4 billion to $6 billion down. You did not know that. That is the problem with you. You did not know, in your absolutely pathetic ignorance, that when you got up and said in your smart smarmy way, 'Of course, we are prepared to discuss the conditions of vertical fiscal imbalance, because 1'm a great Treasury spokesman. I know all about these things. I'm a total economic genius. Thank God I've been put upon the Liberal Party,' that you were in fact tumbling your agenda. Vertical fiscal imbalance addressed by state taxes-state income taxes or state GST. Talk about liars in this place. You try to hide behind this document or hide behind the fact that you are responsible for this document. You have been engaged in these discussions. You are there quoting, obviously showing you have been engaged in these discussions. Do you think that you would say something like this: The difference between us and the Commonwealth is that we are willing to discuss these proposals. The government is not. Keating's view of Canberra, of government, is that he wants everything controlled by Canberra and everything controlled by him. Out there in the ether is this just a statement de novo standing out there on its own-a single individual statement-or does it come off the stuff that we are talking about here that you have said you have been involved into the people who are producing this article? Is it a conspiracy by your lovely little state governments and one or two little business groups to produce your real taxation policies by September-October next year? Isn't it the way? Doesn't this come off the quotes of all of you after the last election? 'What was our big mistake on the GST? Not that it was an inequitable hopeless policy and not that it was devastating for the ordinary person in this country. No, we were stupid to do it upfront.' Haven't you been trying to conceal that ever since? John Howard gets out of the bottle and the genie has to be put back in. Your parliamentary assistant gets out of the bottle and he has to be put back in. There is one after another. We get accused of lying when we draw attention to these statements. These are not the statements from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). He does not get up and say, 'The opposition hankers after the GST. It is the opposition which says it is inevitable and it is going to be introduced,' and then I get up here and quote him. I am quoting your parliamentary assistant. Then they say, 'Oh, gee, he's a liar.' You have these quotes from the parliamentary assistant saying it is inevitable that there will be a GST. They say, 'Heck, he's a liar! You're telling lies about our policies.' We get industrial relations policies up here. We quote John Howard saying that the West Australian legislation is a template-a model-for him. The opposition says, 'Gee, you're liars. Fancy quoting John Howard saying that and believing it was the truth!' That is the implication of what you are saying. The implication of what you are saying is that, if we actually quote what John Howard says, by your normal, sensible English translation of what it would mean, we are lying. If you quote what the leader says and you say that it is what he means, we must be liars because obviously the leader would never say what he means. I will not put up with the Leader of the Opposition coming in here as he does day after day with his views on the changing perspective of industrial relations. He tells us how their policy is being devised, looking at every single criticism that Laurie Brereton might make or that I might make or that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might make. He says what we all have to say and then devises a policy to deny it. That is their proposition. That is where they are coming from until they get caught out by making statements to the Business Council, which the Premier of Victoria spoke to. Richard Court comes out and says, 'I had a chat with John Howard; he has no problems with the policies. I support it.' He goes to Keirath and after Keirath comes out of those conversations he says, 'He supports 90 per cent of what I am doing.' The Leader of the Opposition goes to Western Australia and says that as far as he is concerned it is a model-a template-for him. The government says all those things. We say that it is a model or a template. We say, 'Let's discuss these things through with the West Australians and indicate to them that they support it.' We say that Graham Keirath has come out and said that the opposition supports this legislation. We say that he has had conversations with Richard Court and given him these assurances. He says, 'You are lying; that is a lie.' We merely may have revealed all of this, but when you say it obviously we would not say that. They say, 'You're a liar.' That is a most extraordinary situation-to be called a liar by people who are directly quoting the people whom the opposition is led by, whether they be the deputy leader, the leader, the opposition's industrial relations spokesmen or their various Premiers around the country. We quote them and we are called liars when we are quoting them. It says a hell of a lot for them. It says a hell of a lot for the newspapers that are supposed to be reporting their remarks. Is there a bigger liar in Australian politics than the man who went to the last election campaign and said, 'I have in my possession the industrial relations legislation' - not the policy proposals-'that I propose to introduce. I am prepared. I have the document. When we come into office' - this is him speaking before the last election-'I will place this bill before parliament. I will have the changes through forthwith.' He has had that bill now for three years. Where is it? This is the man who talks about the highest standards of integrity and probity in politics. That document-that industrial bill-sits in his back pocket. Is this a democracy or not? Are the people entitled to see that or not? It is one thing to say that you do not have your policies developed. It is one thing to say that your policies are only a broad, rough indication of what you intend to do. Everybody is in that situation once or twice in politics. It is an inevitable course of the political process. But to have the bill in your pocket for three years-an identifiable and analysable document-and it not appear! This man believes that that behaviour corresponds with the highest standards of integrity in politics. When we draw attention to that we are liars. When we draw attention to that we are fearmongers. When we draw attention to that we are trying to skate back into office on the backs of misleading and inaccurate portrayals of our political opponents. That is absolutely absurd. The Leader of the Opposition had a lot else to say during his 20 minutes. He had to do a fair bit to fill in. I am going to go through one or two items of his speech. He said that this government is the government which has produced outstandingly high rates of youth unemployment. This standard of honesty apparently accords with the following figures. When he was in office there were 155,000 young people seeking full-time work in this country. There are now 88,000. Is that a lie? Is that presenting a truthful picture of the contemporary situation? Then the Leader of the Opposition went on and said-on our policies on interest rates relation to the housing sector-that it is 50 per cent more expensive to service a mortgage now than when they were in office. mortgage rate now is 10.5 per cent. That is if you are doing badly. If you go to one of the new superannuation backed outfits, you can get 9.4 per cent. If you go to one or two of the banks who are prepared to do smart deals, you can get 10 per cent or less. What was it when we came into office? It was 13 per cent. It never fell in that entire time that he was Treasurer, for that last term, below the level that it is now. That level was put in place to produce a sensible slowing of the economy. What did they used to do then? They used to cocktail them up. The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, who loves to portray himself in this Abbott, A. J. place as a man of great integrity and all the Anderson, rest of it, had this to say about the policies Beale, 1. H. that the Leader of the Opposition condemns. Bradford, 1. W. This is what Mr Costello said on 27 July Cameron, E. H. 1994: Under the system of credit controls that prevailedthat is at the time when they were in officebanks refused to lend to borrowers who did not have a record of saving with them and refused to lend to borrowers who could not offer generous security against their loans. This made it harder for Hicks, N. J. * the lower income groups to compete for housing finance against the middle income groups and forced them to seek out housing finance through alternative and more costly forms of finance. That was the position that applied before we got into office. Then he goes on and talks about Medicare. He opposed Medicare legislation put into this place twice-once during Whitlam's time and once under our time. Since that time on four or five separate occasions when the election has been around the place he has put forward the proposition that Medicare should be done over and pulled apart. He now says that he supports Medicare and he takes umbrage when we suggest that people perhaps ought not to believe him. They might actually be a bit suspicious about that. This is a man who is making an art form of lies in this election campaign-lies about where they stood, lies about where they now stand and lies about what their intentions are. Neither the Leader of the Opposition, nor the in deputy who seconded the motion, who has been putting forward lies about his intentions on state policies, has the moral authority to The move this motion. I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Question put: That the motion (Mr Howard's) be agreed to. The House divided. [5.14 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

217,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Last Wednesday, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked me about the acoustics in the chamber galleries. Concerns have been AYES expressed about the acoustics in the Senate and the House of Representatives public galleries for some time. A working group of NOES officials was appointed to consider measures to improve the system. Following their report, changes were made to the chamber acoustics. Members may recall that this resulted in changes to both the microphones and the speakers. This took place in August 1992. A proposal to upgrade the acoustics in the public galleries was postponed because of the cost, estimated at $530,000. The need to upgrade the acoustics in the public galleries has now been identified as a critical project and I expect to consider it as part of the 1996-97 capital works program shortly. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the order of the day No. 1 government business grievance debate when called on continuing until 6.15 p.m. NA",71
218,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Landmines To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia NA draws to the attention of the House that many countries, which have been the scene of conflict, are infested with tens of millions of landrnineslantipersonnel mines which were not removed after hostilities ceased. that although the military effectiveness of landmines/anti-personnel mines is open to question they do continue to kill and maim civilian men, women and children long after the conflict has ended that the infestation prevents people returning to their homes and livelihoods and renders vast areas of land unusable for any purpose Your petitioners request the House to: (1) Support the campaign to ban the production, stockpiling, sale and use of landmines/antipersonnel mines. (2) Support the establishment of an international fund to pay for clearance operations with contributions from the producers and sellers of landmines/anti-personnel mines. (3) Support the establishment of a fund for rehabilitation work with victims and cooperative rehabilitation programs. (4) Urge the international community to support these endeavours. by Mr Bevis (from 303 citizens). UN Weapons Conventions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention of the House to the coming Review Conference of the United Nations Weapons Convention. The Convention came into force in 1983 and has been ratified by 41 countries. This is the first opportunity-and the last for at least another 10 years-to review its workings. It is clear its good intentions, the Conventions has had little impact on restricting the use of deadly weapons it set out to regulate in 1983, particularly landmines. Mines are now proliferating so fast that there are perhaps as many as 1()() million of them in 62 countries. Scattered like deadly seeds, they have turned whole swaths of many countries into deserted, no-go areas. We believe: that the 1980 UN Weapons Convention should impost effective restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons; that from a humanitarian point of view, that the only truly effective solution is the outlawing of anti-personnel mines; that the Convention must take a stand against new, even more terrifying weapons, such as lasers which can destroy the eyesight of their victims; that the UN Weapons Convention be extended to cover internal armed conflict and include practical means of enforcement and wide-ranging control mechanisms. We urge the Parliament to support the extension of the UN Weapons Conventions in the above terms and press for its ratification by all nations. by Mr Braithwaite (from 288 citizens). Department of Social Security To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division Wills points out to the House that the Department of Social Security is considering closure of offices in Coburg and Brunswick. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to reject any such proposals and retain existing services at DSS offices in both Brunswick and Coburg. by Mr Cleary (from 476 citizens). Hearing Resource Centre To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the Citizens of Broken Hill draw your attention to their concerns that the Broken Hill and District Hearing Resource Centre may close through lack of finance. The volunteers at the Centre have served the Hearing Impaired of Broken Hill for the past ten years without anyon-going Government funding. Your Petitioners request the House to ensure that the Broken Hill and District Hearing Resource Centre receives some on-going Government funding before it is forced to close the doors. that for all by Mr Cobb (from 1,293 citizens). Adult Migrant English Service The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the adverse consequences of a decision by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to close Adult Migrant English classes in Auburn New South Wales and to require the Adult Migrant English Service (AMES) to transfer these classes to Parramatta. This action presents obstacles to attendance at English classes. It would impose a need to travel on many migrants and refugees in their early stages of settlement. Many lack the confidence, language skills and money to do so. It would create difficulties for parents caring for young children. Some would not be able to overcome these obstacles and would forfeit their entitlement to classes. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to continue to fund the full range of AMES classes at Auburn. by Mr Ferguson (from 592 citizens). Marriage To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: We believe that the traditional Christian view of of the family unit excludes anything other than a male and female, living in a lawful marriage relationship, along with their children, and that it is necessary for this to be restated by our political leaders. We reaffirm our belief in the traditional Christian view of marriage as God's holy institution in which male and female become one flesh. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5,6) We reaffirm that God is the author of marriage, and has restricted it to the union of male with female and that such marriage between male and female is commended in Scripture as honourable among all. (Ephesians 5: 15-23) We reaffirm that such marriage between male and female is ordained for life-long companionship, help and comfort which husband and wife ought to have of each other. (Romans 7:2,3) We reaffirm that children are a heritage of the Lord and should be nurtured in a godly home, and that human society can be strong and happy only where the marriage bond is held in honour. (psalm 127:3) We reaffirm that incestuous marriages can never be made lawful by the law of any man or government, or the consent of parties, so as to allow those people to live together as married couples. (Mark 6: 18; Leviticus 18:6-28) We reaffirm that, according to Biblical law, it is forbidden for a male to practise sexual intercourse with another male, or for a female with a female, and that since this is an abomination before the Lord, such as a prohibited relationship for marriage. (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13) We believe the entire stability and well being of our society depends on maintaining this traditional Christian view of marriage. (Leviticus 20:15-16; 18:23-24) Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should call on the Government to: (a) Preserve completely intact the exclusiveness of marriage as being between one male and one female. (b) That the definition of a prohibited relationship in the Marriage Act 1961, Part III 23(2) be amended with the addition of a new clause (c) so that it reads as follows: (2) Marriages of parties within a prohibited relationship are marriages(a) between a person and an ancestor or descendant of the person; or (b) between a brother and a sister (whether of whole blood or the half blood); or (c) between a male and a male or between a female and a female. Your petitioners humbly pray by Mr Tim Fischer (from 39 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition is to show that: We, the undersigned citizens, respectfully claim that Australia must preserve and uphold its present National Flag which has proudly represented this country ever since the federation of its sovereign States in 1901, and then being confirmed under the Flags Act (1953). We do so because: It truly reflects our history and heritage, our culture, law and language, It embodies our common law rights and liberties, our very birth right, It signifies the Christian ethic, friendliness, international goodwill, It enshrines in memory the wartime sacrifices of our gallant servicemen and servicewomen, It symbolises our past achievements and inspires future loyal efforts. So therefore do we petition thatour present Australian National Flag be not changed, replaced or diminished in any way whatsoever without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Ms Henzell (from 100 citizens). HECS Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The students of The University of Canberra draw the attention of the House to the current industrial stalemate that is paralysing our university education. The current dispute between unions and management has already disrupted our campus and is now threatening our examinations. The students on this petition therefore ask the house to ensure that students of The University of Canberra are provided acceptable education and examination conditions. the If such action is not taken immediately, the students of the University of Canberra will forward the Federal Government individual accounts for the refund of Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and all related education expenses for the year 1995. by Mr Langmore (from 1,310 citizens). Gold Pass: Members of Parliament To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following matters: 1(a) We call for the immediate abolishment of Gold Passes (past, present and future) for retired Federal Members of Parliament. (b) We call for the immediate abolishment of cars, offices, telephones etc., of retired MPs. 2. We call for a moratorium on all pay increases and ""perks"" for Members of Parliament and top bureaucrats for a period of five (5) years, and immediate disbanding of the so called Independent Remuneration Tribunal. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will take these measures to stop Members of Parliament (past, present and future) from plundering the public purse. by Mr Mack (from 56 citizens). Chinese Nuclear Testing To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The Petition of Certain South Australian Citizens: Draws to the attention of the House that the Chinese Government is carrying out Nuclear Testing again. Your Petitioners request the House to vote, resolve and/or move that the Federal Government of Australia: (1) Request the Australian Government to obtain an injunction against the Chinese tests. (2) Request the General Assembly of the United Nations to get an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice that the proposed tests are contrary to International Law. (3) Requests the House of Representatives to move a motion condemning the tests and convey that fact to the Chinese Government.  Nuclear Testing To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The Petition of Certain South Australian Citizens: Draws to the attention of the House that the French Government proposes to commence Nuclear Testing at the Mururoa Atoll again. Your Petitioners request the House to vote, resolve and/or move that the Federal Government of Australia: (1) Request the General Assembly of the United Nations to get an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice that the proposed tests are contrary to International Law. (2) Requests Members of the European Parliament to move a motion condemning the proposed tests and to resolve that the European Parliament request the tests not go ahead. (3) Request French Nationals in the Pacific Region and in Tahiti to bring an action against the tests in the European Court of Human Rights and undertake to support such an action morally and financially.  Union Amalgamations To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of electors of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Vehicle Division, draws to the attention of the House that we believe the absence of legislation that allows for the dissolution of union amalgamations is one of the serious drawbacks of current amalgamation laws and constitutes a denial of a fundamental human right. Any kind of partnership, whether business or personal, can legally be dissolved. Separations, divorces and dissolutions recognise that partnerships do not always work and a system is in place for orderly and just break-ups. The same right must exist for unions which feel that the amalgamation, a contractual arrangement, has not been respected or successful. Your petitioners therefore request the House to introduce legislation that allows for the dissolution of union amalgamations. by Mr Reith (from 1,606 citizens). Nuclear Testing To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Perth in the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House the grave environmental and health consequences arising from the recent decision by the Government of France to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Your petitioners therefore request the House note that those petitioners whose signatures appear below: (a) are appalled at the political arrogance of the recent decision by the Government of France to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific; (b) commit themselves to a volun- boycott - f the consumption of all goods made In France unul such time as the French Government reverses its decision; (c) calion the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to initiate the diplomatic action necessary to bring about a reversal of the French decision. by Mr Stephen Smith (from seven citizens). . Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned shows: the unjust and inequitable nature of the Government's policy to restrict Childcare Assistance to 12 hours per week where a parent is outside the workforce. This policy will cause hardship to lowe! .income f-­ lies, to the children of those fanulies, and child care workers. The Government should be condemned for breaking its promise to ensure access and affordability in child care. Under the Government's policy parents will have to pay full cost fees after 12 hours of childcare per week if one parent is outside the workforce. This will widen the gap between rich and poor, and many child care workers may lose their jobs. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House should oppose the passage of this Bill into law. by Mr Vaile (from 31 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Taxation Fraud",71
219,Dr KEMP,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I wish to raise the issue of taxation fraud within the computer industry. The fact of this fraud has been drawn to my attention by a constituent of mine who is a major retailer of computer equipment and who, over the past two years, has worked tirelessly to expose the fraud being perpetrated. On top of the myriad of pressures facing small business today, including excessive paperwork and high taxation, and taxation which involves very high compliance costs, computer retailers have an added pressure-some of their competitors are undercutting them by taxation fraud. Some officials of the Australian Taxation Office have estimated that this fraud could be costing the Taxation Office as much as $140 million a year. However, there are legitimate operators who think the figure may go as high as $1 billion in lost revenue. Other Taxation Office officials do not feel that they have sufficient information to make an accurate estimate of the extent of the cost to revenue of this fraud. There are two distinct aspects of this fraud: the non-payment of taxation due, and the claiming of a rebate for wholesale sales tax which has not been paid. The first scam involves a company purchasing computers and computer equipment, such as printers, from wholesalers and claiming exemption of wholesale sales tax because they are selling directly to a retailer. The company then offers the computer or computer equipment for sale to a retailer or consumer at a particularly good price, claiming that tax has been paid. The invoice issued by the company includes a declaration that wholesale sales tax has been paid, but the Australian Taxation Office misses out on the revenue. Given that wholesale sales tax on computers and computer equipment is currently at 22 per cent, the price difference between a computer on which wholesale sales tax has been paid and one on which it has not been paid is substantial. This is what is hurting the legitimate businesses and, ultimately, the wider community. It is hard to compete with someone who is offering an identical product at a very substantial and illegally obtained discount. The second stage of the fraud occurs when the computer or computer equipment has been sold to customers who have an exemption from wholesale sales tax, such as farmers, churches and schools. The operator acting illegitimately then claims and receives a rebate on the wholesale sales tax from the tax office, even though tax was not paid in the first place. Currently, it appears that this problem is predominantly a Victorian one, - ut there is evidence of the fraud spreadlOg interstate, particularly to New South Wales. The Australian Taxation Office was advised by computer retailers in Victoria of this problem almost two years ago, but retailers still feel that not enough is being done to protect legitimate businesses and prosecute the fraudulent ones. I am personally not satisfied that sufficient effective steps have been taken by the government to stop this fraud and to bring the offenders to justice. There has been considerable correspondence with the Treasurer, Mr Willis, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, and the Commissioner for Taxation over the past 18 months. On 27 May, Mr Gear claimed: My constituent can rest assured that the necessary action is being taken to ensure that the correct amount of sales tax is paid. However, it has been reported to me that the tax office told my constituent that it is beyond them 'to police the fraud under current sales tax regulations'. Both cannot be right, and the reported comment from the tax office to my constituent clearly contradicts the assurances given by the Assistant Treasurer that the necessary action was already being taken to ensure that the correct amount of sales tax was paid. The government must clarify this matter. IT there is a need for further legislative action, then this should be clearly identified and action should be taken. IT there is not, then .it is up to the government to explain why the prosecution of this fraud is taking such a long period of time. Legitimate operators have suggested that one needs only to pick up the classifieds section of any newspaper to find evidence of the fraud taking place. Such evidence includes computers and computer equipment being sold for less than the dealer cost plus the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. It is quite impossible for legitimate businesses to compete on these terms, and there is a great deal of anxiety amongst the legitimate computer retailers that they are being undercut in this way for a very extended period of time in a way which is damaging to their business. As I stated earlier, the tax office was first advised of this tax avoidance by various legitimate retailers two years ago, and it has taken some steps to act on the fraud. But legitimate retailers are wondering how long they have to continue competing against illegal operators. Some of the steps taken by the tax office include both top-down and bottom-up audits of the distribution chain. A bottom-up audit starts at the retail end of the chain, identifies those companies selling at the lowest prices and then traces back to their supplier. The tax office is also using the classified advertisements in newspapers to identify and then visit certain retailers as part of its bottom-up audit process. The tax office, I understand, is also monitoring all new applications of business registrations which refer to the computer industry instead of just a sample, which is common practice, and it is monitoring refund claims. Any application for registration that refers to the computer industry is checked to ensure that the person applying is actually a legitimate person from a legitimate address. I understand that, in the last six months in Victoria, this process has identified between 20 and 30 applications which do not meet the criteria and which have been refused. The tax office is also refusing refunds if it suspects that wholesale sales tax has not been paid. On top of bogus refund claims in Victoria, the tax office has also identified shonky refund claims in New South Wales. The second part of the tax office's strategy to combat the fraud is an education campaign aimed at educating the industry participants in their responsibilities. This campaign is designed to inform newly registered businesses of their responsibilities with regard to wholesale sales tax and rebates. It is based on the idea of industry self-regulation. However, the legitimate operators justly claim that the problem with tax avoidance and fraud is not a lack of knowledge amongst industry participants about their obligations. Some know their obligations full well, but the illegal operators make a conscious decision to flout the law. As part of industry self-regulation, the tax office wants the large importers to ensure that their goods are sold only to legitimate operators. This aim may be somewhat naive as the importers are not necessarily in a position to identify legitimate operators and they cannot be held responsible for .their products all the way down the distribution chain. The tax office also wants the legitimate businesses to educate the public about the tax avoidance issue, although customers are not inconvenienced by purchasing equipment on which wholesale sales tax has not been paidin fact, they benefit from a lower price. It is being rather gullible to believe that people will happily pay a higher price for goods just so the tax office does not miss out on revenue, or that they will necessarily consider the legitimate operator who is abiding by the law and therefore has a more expensive product. By far the best way to ensure that legitimate operators are not bankrupted by unfair competition from illegal operators is to stop the illegal operators. This process has been unduly long. In Victoria, three cases have been referred to the Australian Federal Police under the Crimes Act; about 10 cases have been or are being prosecuted under the Taxation Administration Act; between 40 and 50 cases are being pursued through the courts in relation to wholesale sales tax and income tax returns; and multiple assessments have been issued which have resulted in debt collection activity in more than 70 cases. The tax office obviously has identified that fraud in the computer retailing industry is a problem which needs to be addressed and it would certainly be distorting the situation to say that no action has been taken. However, the legitimate operators in the industry do not feel that enough is being done, and anything that is being done is taking an extraordinarily long time. The government has also given assurances that have not been borne out in this matter. Legitimate businesses have been competing against illegal operators for at least two years and are struggling to keep their businesses afloat in an unfavourable environment. The tax office must act and must be seen to be acting swiftly and competently to prevent fraud in the computer industry and to prosecute those who perpetrate fraud. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport Television Captioning for the Hearing Impaired",75
220,Mr ELLIOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (5.33 p.m.)-I rise today to bring to the attention of the House two matters in this grievance debate. The first relates to issues concerning Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and, particularly, Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. I will then raise a matter, on behalf of a constituent, relating to the needs of people who are deaf or hearing impaired. That is a matter of national significance as well. There has been a deal of discussion in the past, and in matters presently before the House, relating to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and the proposed second airport at Badgerys Creek. When those matters were under discussion in the past I strongly supported, as did others, stronger curfew measures at Sydney airport and further steps being taken to ameliorate the detrimental effects of noise on residents. I am pleased to say that, amongst other things, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has agreed that noise monitors be placed around parts of the Parramatta electorate to help in the evaluation of the extent of the noise impact. Information will be provided to residents to inform them of the measures being taken to improve aviation operations and reduce noise impacts. This will also build a decent information and consulting base in relation to the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. It is important to put on record in the House the fact that residents of western Sydney demand, just as vigorously as residents in any other part of Australia would, that there be the most comprehensive environmental study and analysis process in regard to all the operational aspects of Badgerys Creek airport. Residents of western Sydney-in particular, the residents I speak for in the Parramatta electorate-do not accept the sort of proposition that the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has portrayed as the opposition's approach to what needs to be done to solve a small interest that he might have in his own constituency. I have here a copy of Howard's Report, a paper produced by the Leader of the Opposition for the residents of his electorate. Amongst other things, it says that the government has 'failed to adequately develop the second airport at Badgerys Creek despite giving this undertaking prior to the new runway's construction'. He says that the additional funding does not ensure that Badgerys Creek will proceed without haste, and has numerous other comments on the record in that regard. In June this year the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed by Clive Robertson on 2GB. He was asked: Have you seen a map indicating who's going to be affected by aeroplanes flying twenty four hours a day to Badgerys Creek? The answer from the Leader of the Opposition: Well, I have seen all sorts of projections on that and they vary a bit according to who is making the projections but that obviously is a ... is a debate and ... that will have to be undertaken . . . a that'll have to be ... be dealt with at the time when the . . . when ... when the airport is opened but I have to deal with current realities and current problems and you have a grossly unfair situation at the present timeaffecting a number of people in his electorate-under the flight path, no doubt. It is clear that much can be learnt from both the environmental impact process followed in respect of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport's new parallel runway and the new noise analysis approach. That airport's experience has shown the need for more comprehensive environmental impact work than was carried out in the mid-1980s. With respect to the Badgerys Creek airport, the key thing that residents are quite rightly saying is that they are not convinced, on the basis of the 1985 study, that all of the issues to do with air, water, noise, flight path planning-all of those aspects-have been properly addressed. We must take account of all the noise analysis work, all of the experience of airports here and around the world, the impact of changing aircraft design and the potential that has to change some of the strategies that were part of the study process, and the variables included in the study process for the original EIS on Badgerys Creek in 1985. It is absolutely critical, as residents are rightly saying, that those studies be comprehensive and that we go through a process of analysing all the new data and all the new material available to ensure that we have a strategic approach to the aviation needs of Sydney which will not only meet the aviation demands of the Sydney region over the next 50 years but will also satisfy the legitimate concerns of residents throughout the whole Sydney region. That includes making sure we have proper planning processes for Badgerys Creek. In the past, all too often, governments have not taken enough account of the environmental concerns of western Sydney. We have had a series of developments there which have not had the planning they should have had. It is particularly regrettable to note, since the original decision was made in 1985 that Badgerys Creek would be the site of the second Sydney airport, that there has been a fight deal of planning and development that should not have been allowed to occur in such proximity to the airport as to exacerbate the problems that may occur as a result of the airport. The conflict between development and airport operation could have been avoided had we had a state government in the latter part of the 1980s that was strongly committed to preventing that unwanted development, and had we had that state government using its planning powers, in conjunction with local government, to ensure land was not released for inappropriate activity over the last seven to 10 years. What we now need to do is ensure that Badgerys Creek airport is designed in a way that will make sure all of the operational aspects of airport development provide the absolute minimum of adverse impact on the community and on the environment of the region. The fact is that numerous studies undertaken by the CSIRO and others point to the substantial air pollution problem that occurs in that part of the Sydney region. As you move out towards that point, before you go to the Blue Mountains in Sydney, there is the great capacity there for much of the wind movement to generate extensive pollution across western Sydney. It can sit there for days just building up and becoming a substantial problem. How you fit that into the problems relating to overall aviation demand is something again. It is a major challenge. What it needs is to take a step back and say, 'These are very fundamental issues in 1995 that the community of western Sydney wants answers to.' They want to ensure that the inadequate planning processes of the past are not revisited on them. It is incumbent upon all of us in this parliament to say, 'We will give those residents that commitment and that reassurance.' The Leader of the Opposition says he believes that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport should be closed to international traffic and that all international traffic should be diverted to Badgerys Creek. That is quite contrary to what was talked about in the 1985 EIS process and is inappropriate regarding the announcements made about Badgerys Creek and what role it will play in aviation in the Sydney region in terms of meeting Australian aviation requirements into the future. I say most directly that it is absolutely crucial that all the environmental study work that is done on Badgerys Creek be most comprehensive and conscious of wide consultation with the residents of the region so we . do not go through the process that the residents are in any sense duped by the poor planning and the poor processes that were followed in the past. Briefly, I want to raise one other matter. A constituent of mine has raised with me on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the million people in Australia who are deaf or have hearing impairment get access to captioning on news programs, particularly through the national news services on the ABC. The fact that there are a million people who have such a requirement is one that I think the nation should see as a reason to give this issue priority. I take the opportunity to urge the government to take steps to recognise.· that this is an important community servIce that should be provided, at not significant cost, in a way that gives quality of life to many people who have a hearing impairment but are seeking not a great deal from us other than the fact that they be able to see the national news service in the same way as everyone else does and get appropriate benefit from it. (Time expired) Australian Federal Police: Raid on Office of the Member for Stirling Legal Aid Family Conferencing",77
221,Mr CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 26 July this year, my office was raided by officers of the Australian Federal Police. There has been ample publicity about the raid, so I do not intend to go into the details or circumstances of the raid in great detail, but I would like to put on record some matters about the raid which I feel need to be made. First and foremost, I would like to put it on the record that I and my staff have been cleared of all the allegations made against us. I knew all along that we would be cleared, for we did nothing wrong. The search warrant which prompted the raid on our office alleged certain conduct which neither I nor my staff were involved in. I am proud to say that the police have declared that my office-I and my staff-are totally innocent, as I knew would be the case. We played no part whatsoever in the alleged offences detailed in the search warrant. . The reason I put this on the record is that on the day of the raid, and days following, it was reported in the media that my office had been raided and that I and my staff were the subject of police interviews. My Labor opponent in the seat of Stirling even took out a full-page advertisement which included headlines such as 'Cameron in police interview'. I honestly thought that she would have remembered the tenet that one is innocent until proven guilty rather than trying to sneakily give the impression of our being guilty of something we were not involved in. Despite our innocence, the implications were there and hurt us dearly. It was made worse when we were used by my opponent for cheap, nasty political point scoring. Over the course of these events, I read 27 reports-including front-page newspaper stories and virtual full-page stories-mentioning the raid on my office, not to mention the countless television and radio reports about it. When the Federal Police announced we were cleared, how much publicity was there? There was one story I read in the West Australianone story-plus a few small reports on television that night. That is all I have seen. I am still having people calling my office asking what the results of the raid were, whether we have been cleared and so on. So, for the record, we have been cleared. The news certainly is not as interesting for the media when people have done nothing wrong and are cleared as when they have been raided or arrested. While I am utterly delighted we have been cleared, the adverse media publicity did hurt, and it was a very stressful time for me, my staff and our families. Following the raid on my office, I sought legal assistance for me and could get on with our jobs without being interfered with too much by the police inquivery ries. Our lawyer also, of course, was required to sit in during interviews for guidance. Today, I and my staff are paying off a bill totalling over $5,000 as a result of the raid. Approximately $3,500 was for counsel over the raid itself, and another $1,500 was spent on legal representations where I lodged a criminal defamation complaint to the Western Australian Police Force about comments by another person about the circumstances regard surrounding the raid, but which unfortunately was not further investigated, and which I did not further pursue because of the costs insociety. volved. I am lucky to have a generous lawyer who is allowing me to pay off the bill over time. Members would know that on our incomes we are lucky that we can survive comfortably, even with disruptions such as this. However, there are many people in the community are not able to qualify for legal aid but also find it a struggle to afford legal representation when required, and this seriously comproresources mises their ability to access justice. Access to justice does appear to be a contradiction in terms. For example, in the 1994-95 financial year, there were 5,500 unsuccessful applications for legal aid in Western Australia, of which 3,200 satisfied the tests under current guidelines relating income and assets, the merits of their and the type of case. A number of those people have passed through my office, seekstating ing assistance, and to my absolute regret many were not successful in receiving the legal aid they sought. With limited funds, it is inevitable that funds can only go to the most worthy cases, even though those cases that are denied funding are still very worthy. Despite the best intentions of all governments, there will always be those who cannot afford legal assistance but are ineligible for legal aid and, as such, will be deprived of justice or have difficulty accessing it. Those who cannot access the legal representation they desire or require will be compromised by these limitations in their pursuit of justice or the defence my staff so we of their innocence. I honestly believe that it is going to be a long time before there will be equity before the law. It is also, I believe, middle income earners, Australia's forgotten people, who are the most disadvantaged. They neither have access to legal aid, nor earn the salaries of higher income earners to afford the representation they desire. It is the same in this area, as it is in many other forums of government, that this group is forgotten or ignored. They must be considered at all times in this and it is something parties of all political persuasions must continue to look at if we are to achieve our goal of a fair and just I would like to think that the raid has been positive in one respect. It gave me the opportunity to view the working conditions of our federal law enforcement officers and, quite frankly, they are appalling. We are expecting these officers to chase the Mr Bigs of the who criminal world, we are expecting them to catch the drug lords who are destroying the lives of so many young people, but the with which they must operate and the conditions for them to work under are utterly appalling. At the interview my staff were put in a room to wait. The room held a desk and a computer. The computer was ancient and the desk was tatty. This is the sort of equipment we are expecting our law to enforcement officers to work with-and this cases is but one of many examples. Just recently we had a newspaper story that the Western Division-the Western Australian section of the Australian Federal Police--could not even afford to pay their rent. The officers of the AFP cannot be paid overtime so are only able to work between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. I could not be interviewed on one occasion because I was only available to them after 4 p.m. and they could not claim overtime. When you consider the criminals they must chase, this is appalling. How many criminals work between those hours? They don't, and we cannot expect the Federal Police to operate only between those hours either. The Australian Federal Police, certainly in Western Australia, need a major injection of funds or the fight against crime will not be won. We will be a laughing stock of the criminals, if the funds which the police are given to fight crime is just a pittance of the funds invested in crime by the people they are chasing. I appeal to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to visit the Western Division of the AFP and view their working conditions, and to give serious consideration to giving them an increase in funding. If no action is taken, the minister will be derelict in his duty of providing the resources to fight the criminals and protect the community from these maggots of society. We have huge sums of money spent on politicians, our offices and resources, but there is a more important group deserving of more funding; that is, our law enforcement officers. It is time the government gave them the resources they require. If they do not, will be neglecting the responsibility of providbetween ing for one of society's most basic needs, that of safety. I implore the minister to review the funding to the Australian Federal Police because a failure to increase funding will simply see more kids' lives destroyed by these criminals. It is the duty of us all to work to ensure that funding is increased and that the perpetrators of crime are fought, and beaten, with adequate resources. Turning to a somewhat brighter matter, I have been fortunate enough over the past few months to have had working in my office here in Canberra another intern from the Australian national internships program. The young lady I have had working with me on this occasion is a young woman by the name of Helen Geard, from Tasmania. She has presented me with a report on family conferencing in Australia with the rather creative title Crime sux! Change the roolz. To give you an idea of what it is all about-I would urge members to take this up and study it closely-I read Helen's executive summary: There are many underlying and complex factors contributing to the level of juvenile crime in Australia Innovative strategies are required to address juvenile crime issues and the focus of this report is one such innovation-family conferencing. Family conferencing gives young offenders and victims the opportunity, in a supportive environment, to discuss important issues about an offence which has been committed. Conference participants aim to reach a consensus about a suitable course of action. The core process of family conferencing is similar across Australia, however, there are significant variations. Variations include; the term used to describe the process, where family conferencing is placed in the juvenile justice hierarchy and which organisation is responsible for its co-ordination. It is too early to determine what is the most appropriate means of implementing family conferencing so innovation must be allowed to continue. Innovation requires commitment to discussion, implementation and evaluation from all stakeholders in family conferencing. The report identifies two barriers to the continued success of family conferencing in Australia The first barrier is the existing fragmented approach to the collection of data on juvenile crime. A comprehensive and integrated data collection strategy is required to assist in evaluating family conferences and the development of public policy. The second they barrier is an apparent lack of communication stakeholders across Australia preventing constructive dialogue and innovation. An important first step in addressing the many issues, highlighted in this report, would be to hold a national conference on family conferencing. I congratulate Helen on her excellent piece of work. I commend it to the House and ask members to read it as an important document on family conferencing in Australia. I seek leave to table the document. Leave granted. International Financial Markets",79
222,Mr LANGMORE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Fraser) (5.53 p.m.)During the grievance debate last week time ran out and I was interrupted, so I will begin by summarising what I was saying then, and then complete my remarks. I was speaking about international financial markets and I noted that there is widespread unease about the effectiveness with which international financial markets are operating. The Volker commission in the United States argued last year that the swings in foreign exchange markets since floating was introduced has been a contributing cause to the low growth rates in industrialised countries during the last couple of decades. The apparent recent misalignment of major currencies appears to be a significant factor in the slowness of economic recovery in some countries. That is very clear at present in Japan. The theory of rational speculative bubbles has increased understanding of this process; that is, the theory that market operators will go on acting as if currencies will go on rising or falling, whether or not that is justified by fundamentals. The constant smaller fluctuations of exchange rate add to risk and cost for business. The variability of financial increases the difficulty of monetary management, particularly in thin, emerging markets, and swings of confidence can cause massive movements of capital and exchange rates with enormously damaging economic and social consequences, as Mexico so vividly demonstrated in the six months since last December. The collapse of Barings Bank adds to concern about the effectiveness of internal corporate and market supervision. These and related concerns have caused . increased interest in means of reducing international financial market volatility and risk. A return to fixed exchange rates seems fanciful in foreseeable circumstances except on a regional basis, as in the European Union and perhaps, at some point in the future, between Australia and New Zealand. Proposals for macro-economic coordination between the G3-the US, Germany and Japan-with the aim of constraining currency movements to target zones would involve a degree of cooperation which none of the major countries is interested in at present. This has led to some growth of interest in the possibility of a small levy on foreign exchange transactions, as proposed by the Nobel laureate in economics, James Tobin. Professor Peter Kenen proposed at a conference on the Tobin tax a few weeks ago what he described as a feasible plan for a small levy on foreign exchange transactions. An ad valorem tax would apply on the value of the transaction at a fixed rate and could be applied to all transactions-swap, futures and forward, as well as spot transactions-by banks and other dealers in the foreign exchange markets. A voidance would be minimised by imposing a penalty tax rate to dealings with parties based in tax-free jurisdictions. So if someone was in the Cayman Islands, a penalty rate of, say, five times the tax rate could be charged on funds transferred from the Cayman Islands. Keeping the rate low would enhance viability. Kenen suggested a rate of 0.05 per cent. Discussion at the same conference tended towards a rate of 0.1 per cent. That is about double the current transaction cost. The tax would be collected at dealing sites because flows these sites are less readily moveable than settlement or booking sites. Dealing sites involve employees and dealing rooms. The tax would be collected by governments on a market basis. Such a levy would generate considerable revenue for national governments and for the provision of global public goods. The Bank for International Settlements is in the process of gathering up-to-date data, but figures released by the major markets suggest that the daily global tumover-that is, the turnover every day-now averages around $US 1,300 billion. On the basis of plausible assumptions that a tax of 0.1 per cent would reduce the volume of transactions by about 20 per cent, Professor Jeffrey Frankel estimates that the tax would raise a total of about $US 176 billion a year. The major recipients would be the countries in which the volume of financial transactions is greater, which are, in descending order: the UK, which accounts for nearly a third of global transactions; the US; Japan; Singapore; Switzerland; Hong Kong; Germany; France; and Australia. We are ninth in this ordering of markets in which the most financial transactions occur. For other countries, the tax would be a valuable additional source of revenue, as it would be for all of those nine countries, including Australia. International agreement would be essential on the rate the administration of the tax, and the exte-t to which revenue would be shared internationally. The rationale for international revenue raisin- is. now - ery s-ong. With growing globalIsatIOn, an mcreasmg number of issues mu-t be. addressed, in part at least, on a global basIs-:-!SSUes such as reducing pollution, - ontammg the spread of disease, peacekeepmg, development cooperation, disaster relief and drug control, just to give some clear examples. As .well as the - eduction of market volatility and nsk, all reqUIre a degree of international cooperation. Yet all remain inadequately addressed because of a combination of the free rider problem and the prisoners dilemma. Some of the solutions for these issues require the provision of international public goods. Public goods are services from which all benefit, whether or not they contribute to their cost. Examples of global public goods are: the prevention of war or terrorism; prevention of - nlargeI?ent of the hole in the ozone layer; mternatIOnal postal, telecommunications and civil aviation organisational infrastructure' and international financial stability. Although all people have an interest in these goods, they remain underprovided because everyone waits for everyone else to act, hoping for a free ride. While this interest is rational - or each individual and country, all end up being worse off because of inaction which exacerbates the problems, which is the prisoners' dilemma Compulsory comprehensive revenue collection to pay for global c-mm-n goods is an essential way of coping WIth thIS form of market failure internationally as well as nationally. That is why we have national tax systems. The most relevant way in which a portion of the revenue from a Tobin tax could be use? would be to improve the functioning of capItal markets. Some of such activity is already under way: the work of the IMP to increase the accuracy and transparency of national economic and social data; the proposed doubling of the general arrangements to borrow, including by drawing in additional countries including Australia, which was discussed at the IMP meeting about two weeks ago in Washington; the proposal to establish currency stabilisation funds in developing countries and economies in transition, which is another IMP proposal which is on the table for discussion; the work of the Basle Committee and the Bank for Interna-ional Settlements to recommend ways of Improving prudential supervision. They are all the kinds - f activities which could appropriately be paId for by the revenue from a Tobin tax. Several influential commentators, including Felix Rohatyn, who is one of the doyen of money market dealers in New York, and Fred Bergsten, who is one of the leaders of international financial economists in the US, have proposed the establishment of a new institution-a capital market supervisory authority. The World Bank is planning more technical - sistance to developing countries, wanting to Increase the efficiency and sophistication of their financial markets. All of these activities, an- others related to them, would be entirely SUItable uses for revenue from a Tobin tax, so too would broader activities aimed at strengthening international development. ' The best functioning capital markets are worth little if the rest of the economy and society are in disarray. There are other important purposes that would be served by the tax, reducing the volume of international financial flows and reducing short-term speculation. As well as that, it is important to note that many countries are beginning to show an interest in this proposal and that study of it is under way. I am glad to say that our foreign minister is one of those who are suppo-ing study of the idea. That study is an essentIal prelude to negotiations between countries which would be a necessary condition for the introduction of such a tax. Treaties",81
223,Mr WILLIAMS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Tangney) (6.03 p.m.)The Votes and Proceedings are the formal minutes of the House of Representatives. The Votes and Proceedings for Wednesday last week recorded the tabling in the House of the texts of 24 treaties to which Australia is a party or in respect of which Australia is taking action to become a party. The 24 treaties dealt with subjects as diverse and as significant as civil aviation, reciprocal defence procurement, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, protection of investments, social security, safe containers, hazardous wastes, the AsianPacific postal union, oil pollution and international telecommunications. Of the 24 treaties, four have already entered into force, including as long ago as April. In respect of a further three, the government indicated that it expected to formally accede to them during this current month. Nobody in the House could have known the treaties were tabled except by reading the Votes and Proceedings on publication the following day. They were not tabled by presentation by the Speaker or a minister. They were tabled under the deemed tabling provision of standing order 319 which allows papers to be 'delivered to the Clerk who shall cause them to be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. Papers so delivered to the Clerk shall be deemed to have been presented to the House on the day on which they are recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.' This procedure being, for practical purposes, in secret. there is no provision for parliamentary debate on the tabling. In the Senate the procedure is a little more open but for practical purposes there is no effective debate there either. In the Senate the documents are tabled by presentation. There is provision for debate for 30 minutes in relation to all documents tabled in the Senate that day-the debate taking place just prior to the adjournment. On Wednesday, in addition to the 24 treaties, there were tabled in the Senate 16 other documents such as annual reports. Thirty minutes is divided among six speakers, giving each five minutes. If the six speakers spoke only about the 24 treaties, each could devote 1 minute 15 seconds to each of four treaties. The situation is clearly absurd. It occurs every six months in both Houses in the same manner. The six-month process itself is another absurdity. In Australia there is currently widespread interest in treaties, how they are made and the obligations they create. By entering into a treaty, Australia undertakes internationally that it will enact any domestic legislation necessary to implement the treaty. Treaties plainly have significant consequences therefore for legislatures. Notwithstanding that consequence, Australia's entry into treaties does not involve the Australian parliament. The constitutional power to enter into treaties is virtually without qualification vested in the executive, meaning in effect the cabinet. Recently, control of the treaty making processes appears to have been steadily passing from the cabinet. the elected government, to the bureaucracy-<:abinet considering only a portion of the treaties to which the executive commits Australia. The executive has no formal obligation to consult this parliament in relation to any treaty to which it proposes to commit Australia. Similarly, the executive has no formal obligation to consult state or territory governments or any person likely to be affected by implementation of the proposed treaty. There is a need for consultation by the executive arm of the federal government with the state and territory governments and interest groups and there is a need for the involvement of the parliament in order to achieve wider consultation and to make the executive more accountable. In recent months an increasing body of public opinion has called for more consultation, more accountability and a proper role for the parliament. Among proposals made by the coalition for institutional reform of the treaty making processes is a proposal to establish a joint house treaties committee in the parliament. Under a coalition government. this would be set up by resolutions of the two houses. It would be made up of senators and members and would be serviced by a permanent secretariat. The membership of the committee would be drawn from government, opposition and minor parties. As with many parliamentary committees, the chair would normally be of the government party and the deputy chair would usually be from the opposition. It would not be feasible for the committee to monitor extended international negotiations of prospective conventions or to review a series of drafts of conventions produced at different negotiation phases. The best use of a parliamentary treaties committee would be for reviewing a proposed treaty only once, at a relatively late stage in its development either immediately prior to the anticipated signature or after signature and before ratification. The principal issue for the committee would be whether it would be in Australia's interest that the treaty be signed or ratified, as the case may be. Unless narrower terms of reference were agreed, the committee would seek to analyse the implications for Australia of adhering to a proposed convention. Submissions could be sought and obtained from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, from any line department involved in the subject matter of the treaty, from state and territory governments and from the public. In most cases the committee would take evidence in public hearings. The committee would be expected to produce an inquiry report which would be tabled in the Senate and in this House. The report would usually be available to members of the public. Fundamental to the success or failure of the committee would be how the committee obtained references. The object of the committee could be defeated if its ability to undertake an inquiry was dependent upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs or another minister with an interest in the subject matter agreeing to refer a proposed treaty to the committee. Such a committee should be free, of its own motion, to inquire into any prospective treaty to which it is anticipated Australia will become a party. Australia becomes a party to scores of treaties each year. The proposed joint house committee could not conduct full public inquiries into all of them or even a small proportion of them. It is likely in fact that there would be little or no interest among members of the committee and other senators and members in reviewing most proposed treaties. Many treaties have bipartisan support. The committee's secretariat, however, would be able to do a brief preliminary analysis of each proposed convention for the purpose of recommending to the committee whether a more detailed inquiry was desirable. The sensitive nature and national security implications of some treaties would require the committee to develop techniques to conduct more limited inquiries or confidential inquiries. Negotiation of bilateral treaties involves different considerations from negotiation of multilateral treaties or conventions relating to or emanating from international organisations. The committee would have to be conscious of bilateral sensitivities in any inquiry into a proposed bilateral convention. It is the coalition's proposal that the committee's report be tabled in this House and in the Senate and that parliamentary time be res-Ii\'ed upon the tabling for speeches from members of the committee and others. I would expect that the unanimous recommendations of the committee would be accorded considerable weight by the government If, however, the recommendations run counter to the directions taken by Australian representatives in negotiations, it is certainly possible that there could be some embarrassment in international forums. But, given the importance of effective consultation and accountability, that is a price that should be paid. It is certainly preferable to the existing system under this government of five-minute speeches upon the tabling of batches of treaties, some of which are already in force, or the even more ridiculous secret tabling under the 'deemed presentation' provisions of the standing orders of this House. In any event, if they knew in advance that any proposed treaty negotiated for Australia would be subject to parliamentary committee review, the negotiators would be in a position to minimise any potential embarrassment. This is just one of the coalition's proposals for reform of the treaty making process, but a parliamentary treaties committee alone would go a long way towards ensuring that the people of Australia have a say in the sorts of international obligations that are to bind them. This would eliminate the charade that took place in the Senate last Wednesday, the simultaneous secret tabling in this House, and would improve the quality of the democracy in which we live. A Howard coalition government would not take the arrogant, nonaccountable approach taken by the Keating Labor government. Conservative Parties",83
224,Mr CLEELAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"MCEwen) (6.12 p.m.)In the short time available to me, I wish to draw to the attention of the House the outrageous, deceitful behaviour of the tories and the Liberals of this country. I listened to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) comment about how honest a tory government would be in this place. Let me tell him that throughout Australia they practise lies and deceit. There is no honesty and no integrity of any conservative party in any state government in this country at the moment, and I see no reason why you should be any different in this place. That is the fact, and that is the evidence. Let us not run away from it. In 1992 in Victoria Jeffrey Kennett went to the polls saying, 'No Victorian will be worse off. Not one Victorian will suffer because I will not do anything which will hurt Victorian families.' That is what he said. Like the opposition in this place, he also had no policies. But he kept running on dead, of course. He kept pointing out to Victoriansthe guilty party-that Victoria was in a parlous state because the Labor government had raised this enormous amount of debt. He, Jeffrey Kennett, and the conservatives in Victoria would bring Victoria into a much better state; we would have economic goodness and happiness, and all Victorians could smile ever after. It was a lie. It was a deceitthe ful, deliberate lie. Victorians now pay an enormous price because of that lie and that deceit. Our hospitals are a shambles; nothing less than an absolute shambles. In Victoria if you want an ambulance to pick you up and take you to a hospital, first of all you have to get the ambulance-if you are lucky. Secondly, if you are still alive, you will be picked up and taken to a hospital. Recently, in the case of a three-year-old boy at Mornington, the emergency centre was locked and the doctors could not get a key to open it. That lad died. Under the conservatives of this country, that is the sort of deceit and lies that are practised. Let us not sit here and listen to the garbage that we have heard in this place today. That is all it has been. Go and ask Victorian families about the deceit and lies of Liberals and National Party members. Victoria is now the highest taxed state in Australia. Rural towns are suffering. Three hundred schools have been closed. I did not hear the honourable member bleat once, and he says that he represents rural Victoria. He did not bleat once when 300 schools vanished off the face of rural parts of Victoria. In all rural towns public servants are getting the boot-over 80,000 of them. You cannot sell a house in rural Victoria because the DCNR has been cut to blazes. SEC offices have been closed. Schools have been closed. Rural Victoria is being devastated. And you have just sat there and done nothing about it-you and your colleagues. Your deputy leader down there, Pat MCNamara",86

228,Mr BEDDALL,PROGRAM BIDDING SYSTEM FOR,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The purpose of this is to introduce amendform ments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and the Export Control Act 1982. The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will provide for the continuation of AWRAP's chemical residue monitoring and education programs which were to cease at the end of 1995. These activities will now be specific functions AWRAP, although AWRAP will have regulatory powers in this regard. Under the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, these activities were to be divested to industry before the end of 1995. However, the wool industry has been unable to identify a more effective and efficient means of undertaking residue monitoring and education programs than currently exists through AWRAP. Given the growing sensitivities in world markets chemical residues, these amendments will allow the responsibility for the activities of residue monitoring and conducting of related education programs to remain with AWRAP. There are three amendments to the Petrosystem leum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The first of these reflects the government's commitment to ensuring that the rights of indigenous Australians are protected. To that end, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 will be amended to ensure that persons conducting offshore petroleum operations under that act will be required to respect and not unduly interfere with native title rights and interests when conducting those operations. This Section 3 amendment provides an explicit legislative basis for the protection of native title rights and places these on a level footing with marine interests, such as navigation, fishing and conservation. The second proposed amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 takes account of government responsibilities in regard to industrial health and safety. The offshore petroleum industry has an excellent safety record, despite being involved in hazardous activities. The risks involved and the need for a sharp focus on safety was brought to light in 1988 when an explosion and fire on the Piper Alpha platin the North Sea claimed 167 lives. The lessons learned from that disaster have resulted in a new regulatory approach to petroleum safety in offshore Australia involving a move to objective based regulation. This provides companies and employees with the flexibility to manage safety in a way which best suits their specific circumstances. Such an approach recognises that managerial of commitment and work system controls are no crucial to safe operations. This amendment strengthens the ability to make safety regulations under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. In particular, it places a management focus on safety by specifically allowing for the making of regulations to ensure companies maintain management systems to secure the health and safety of personnel. The amendment also contains amendments to the act to remove an ambiguito ty to ensure that, where state or Northern Territory occupational health and safety legislation applies, the provisions contained in schedule 7 of the act do not apply. The third amendment deals with a revised of awarding offshore petroleum exploration permits under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, known as the guaranteed work program bidding system which was introduced almost 10 years ago by the government. A review of the system has revealed that the current provisions of the act are not adequate to fully support it. The amendments proposed are designed to give legal force to the system to ensure that it is fully effective and adequately protects the rights of explorers. The guaranteed work program bidding system was introduced to enable soundly based work programs to be submitted and to avoid applicants overbidding for exploration permits and, if successful, not being able to fulfil their commitments. Over the past 10 years, the system has worked well and bidding rounds have been characterised by strong but realistic work program bids. Under the system, successful applicants are required to meet the work program for which they bid for the first three years of the term of the exploration permit-that is, the guaranteed component. If they elect to continue beyond the first three years, they must meet the work program in each of the three remaining years of the initial permit term. There is an option to surrender the permit on completion of the work in each of the last three years. The holder of an exploration permit may apply to vary the work program conditions of the permit, if circumstances beyond their control occur. Exploration permits can be renewed for further five-year periods on the basis on an agreed work program, with the first three years being a guaranteed commitment. In accordance with the existing provisions of the act, 50 per cent of the blocks contained in the exploration permit must be relinquished at each renewal. The system was introduced after consultation with the petroleum industry and with the state and Northern Territory governments who are involved with the Commonwealth in the joint administration of the act. The system continues to be strongly supported by the respective governments and, I am pleased to say, by industry. The amendments also seek to validate past decisions on the award of permits under the system. This will add security to the system, a factor that is essential to the industry in view of the vast amount of high risk capital invested in exploration each year. The government considers that it is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the bidding system is maintained so that the Australian offshore area remains an attractive place for explorers to invest and that a high level of exploration activity continues to enable the full extent of Australia's oil and gas resources to be properly assessed for the benefit of all Australians. The proposed amendment to the Export Control Act 1982 deals with the government announcement in the budget that a dedicated and independent monitoring unit would be established within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to implement new monitoring arrangements to monitor compliance with hardwood woodchip licence conditions. The costs of the monitoring arrangements are to be recovered from licensed hardwood woodchip exporters. To enable me to make regulations to recover the costs by way of licence fees, an amendment of the Export Control Act 1982 is necessary. The proposed amendment will enable me to do that. This amendment arose out of a complaint from the state of the honourable member opposite, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), that in the wombat forests there were people not complying with conditions in the export licences. Once we had investigated that, we found there was little the Commonwealth could do to monitor those conditions, and that is how this arose. I am pleased to say too that this now has the support of industry. Once the amendment is passed and royal assent is granted, I will be able to make ministerial orders to recover the costs of monitoring. It would be intended that licence fees for the monitoring be charged in connection with the 1996 hardwood woodchip export licences. I commend the amendments to the House.",89
229,Mr MCGAURAN,PROGRAM BIDDING SYSTEM FOR,"I wish to address those parts of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 relating to the proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The guaranteed work program bidding system for offshore petroleum exploration is an orderly bidding process which allows companies to bid for the right to explore for petroleum in specific areas or for permits in the offshore areas under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. These permit areas are released by the federal government for bidding, when geophysical and other studies have indicated the possibility of petroleum being found in that area. Companies then submit bids, based on the nature of the exploration they wish to undertake and the amount they expect to spend. These bids are assessed by the federal government, and the right to explore in the permit area is then awarded to the bid which best agrees with the established criteria. This system has been widely supported by state and territory government and the industry at large for the 10 years of its operation. However, as the House has been advised by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), a loophole has been discovered which potentially allows holders of exploration permits to surrender their permits at any time, without having completed their bid. This has caused a crisis of confidence in the fairness of the bidding system, as it its success that winning companies be compelled to carry out the agreed work program with which they have won the bid. Otherwise, companies could win by padding out their bids by work they have no intention of completing and, ultimately, the attractiveness of Australia for petroleum exploration would be affected. The coalition accepts that the amendments must be retrospective to December 1985 to minimise the possibility of legal challenges to previous permit awards. Our acceptance is firmly based on assurances from the government that there are no outstanding Administrative Appeal Tribunal cases or court cases which could be affected by this legislation. While this uncertainty has remained, the government has delayed the awarding of permits on exceptionally attractive acreage released in November 1994, holding up an estimated $1 billion of investment. The coalition parties are concerned to see this uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible so that the process of awarding exploration acreage can be restarted and industry returned to normal operations. A further amendment addresses native title. Currently, under the provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, it is an offence for holders of petroleum exploration or production permits to interfere with navigation, fishing, conservation activities, mineral exploration and pipeline operations to a greater extent than is necessary for the reasonable exercise of the rights and obligations of the operator. This amendment will add native title rights to this list and provide a firm legislative basis for current administrative practice. The final group of amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act are noncontroversial and will clarify and update the operation of the act as it relates to occupational health and safety. Safety is a critical issue in any industry but nowhere more so than in the offshore petroleum industry. I know from my own observations in visiting Bass Strait and North-West Shelf platforms that with a heightened risk comes an inis vital to creased dedication to safety. Unlike the more predictable activity associated with workplaces such as machine shops, petroleum exploration involves bursts of activity which require comprehensive safety planning and debriefing. Given the dangerous nature of the work, it is a tribute to all those involved that we have seen a significant improvement in safety in the petroleum industry over the last few years. From a level of 8.9 in 1990, lost time injury frequency rates for the industry have fallen to a creditable 5.8 in 1994. This compares very favourably with the total mining figure in the year 1993-94 of 27. This excellent result is reflected throughout the industry and, as an example, Esso employees recently completed 10 million work hours without a lost time injury. As a consequence, Esso now concentrates on eradicating all injuries and focuses on 24-hour safety for its employees, modifying behaviour away from the workplace. A further outstanding example of safe working practices is the heliport operation at Longford which serves the Bass Strait platforms and rigs; it recently won an award for not having had a lost time injury in 20 years of operation. The crews carry about 150,000 passengers a year, with 116 scheduled flights per week, often in hazardous and inhospitable conditions. I congratulate them on their outstanding achievement. One worrying element in regard to safety issues in offshore operations is the extent to which restrictive industrial relations practices are hampering the development of a safety culture. At present, the operator of a vessel has no say in the choice of crew since crews are selected using a roster established by the union. With different personnel for each trip, experience in safe operation under petroleum exploration conditions is not being accumulated. There is a break in the continuity of those in the workplace. Without the ability to retain and encourage good performers, safety issues are much harder to address effectively. These restrictive practices have no place in an industry which has to be internationally competitive to survive. Let us take the wider view. Statistics from Worksafe Australia record 455 deaths in the Australian workplace over 1991-92, while over 140,000 workers suffered some kind of job related injury requiring compensation. Given that many near misses will occur with every lost time injury reported, Australia has some distance to go in integrating a safe culture into the workplace. Our safety record reveals something disturbing about our society, especially as it is easier and less costly implement effective safety programs than to cope with the aftermath of an accident. Nevertheless, there are trends towards improving safety in the offshore petroleum industry which the coalition wholeheartedly encourages. We support the amendments before the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Works Committee Reports",90
230,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 20th and 21st reports of the committee for 1995 relating to construction of a new chancery, Geneva, and refurbishment of the Australian Embassy, Washington. Ordered that the reports be printed.",92
231,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The reports which I have just tabled deal with two overseas projects: the first is the construction of a new chancery in Geneva and the second is the refurbishment of Australia's embassy in Washington. The estimated cost of the Geneva chancery is $22.446 million at December 1994 prices. The estimated cost of refurbishing the Washington embassy is $17 million. The committee has recommended that both projects should proceed. Australia has four diplomatic missions in Geneva and three ambassadors. Those missions include the United Nations, the environment, GATT and WTO, and disarmament. The Ambassador for the Permanent Mission to the Office of the United Nations is also the Ambassador for the Environment. There are currently 27 Australian based staff and 20 locally engaged staff. The committee was advised that it is not envisaged that more diplomatic staff will be posted to Geneva, nor is it envisaged that further Australian missions will be posted there. The Australian chancery in Geneva comprises leased premises which are deficient in access, services, layout and space. The lease will expire in March 1999 and will not be renewed. There is a need for to a new chancery building to be constructed for Australia's permanent missions in Geneva. On 27 July and 8 August, as part of private visits to Geneva and Washington, I inspected the existing chanceryMr Snowdon-You travel often, don't you? Mr MCGauran--At the taxpayer's expense.",92
232,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,I said it was a private visit.,92
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Andrew)Order! The parliamentary secretary and the member for Gippsland! The member for Throsby is inMr MCGauran-At your own expense?,93
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The member for Gippsland! The member for Throsby is entitled to be heard in silence. The member for Gippsland has an obligation to address his remarks through the chair.,93
235,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"As I said, on 27 July and 8 August this year, as part of private visits to Geneva and Washington, I inspected the existing chancery and the site proposed for the new chancery in Geneva, and the Australian Embassy in Washington. The visit to Geneva convinced me of the need for the work and gave me an appreciation of the suitability of the site for the chancery. With the Washington visit, it was helpful to have discussions with the ambassador and members of his staff. I am sure the ambassador will regret not being able to see the work of the committee come to fruition. Without these inspections, the committee-you would appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, as you are a member of the committeewould have been fully reliant on brief videos which showed aerial and ground shots of the Geneva site and existing unsatisfactory accommodation in Washington. The committee again draws attention to its inability to travel overseas to inspect existing premises and proposed sites and to have discussions with planners, designers and staff. The committee regards this as a completely unsatisfactory situation. As I said recently in this House, it would save the taxpayer of Australia a considerable amount of money. The committee has concluded that the proposed design of the Geneva chancery will provide a building suited to the task of providing accommodation for the three ambassadors of the four Australian missions in Geneva. A feature of the chancery complex is the inclusion of a separate annex which will house the New Zealand mission. The Australian and New Zealand missions will be separated by a landscaped courtyard, which will hopefully include a symbolic water featurewhich, I suppose, indicates the water separating the two countries. The committee believes the concept of shared diplomatic premises with nations such as New Zealand could be extended to other projects when opportunities arise, and the committee has recommended this proposal. One rather disturbing aspect of our representation in Geneva is the very high cost of leasing residential accommodation for two of the three ambassadors and their Australian based staff. It may surprise the House to know that it costs Australian taxpayers almost $2 million a year to provide residential accommodation for our diplomats in Geneva. The committee has therefore recommended that a review of existing residential accommodation is required, aimed at reducing or eliminating the financially burdensome recurrent expenditure associated with leasing residential accommodation. The design concept submitted to the committee has not reached the detailed design stage, and the committee has recommended that consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union should continue during the detailed design phase. The second report I have tabled relates to the proposal by the Overseas Property Group to refurbish the Australian Embassy in Washington to a standard suitable for efficient and effective operation. The proposal entails a staged program of internal refurbishment to provide tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and the provision of office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs. Physical security protection will also be improved. The estimated cost of the proposal when referred to the committee was $16 million at November 1994 prices. The original building which houses the Australian Embassy in Washington was constructed in 1969 and is well located at 1601 Massachusetts Avenue and was extended in 1976. But the building is now 25 years old and has not undergone a major refurbishment since it was constructed. Considering that the industry norm is to refurbish office buildings after 25 years, it is not unexpected that the Washington embassy now has many deficiencies. Quite frankly, it is looking its age, especially the interior. It lacks suitable fire protection and fire egress, and major building services have reached the end of their design life and require replacement. In addition, office layouts are inefficient. The provision for current and future technology is inadequate. Physical security protection is also deficient. The embassy services some 19 government departments and organisations with functions as diverse as foreign relations, defence, immigration and trade. Washington is one of Australia's largest and most diverse overseas missions. It has a total staff number of approximately 310. It is also the hub of the communications network for Australia's diplomatic missions in North and South America. Overseas Property Group advised that an energy audit of the building was undertaken in 1988 and since that time a 20 per cent saving in energy usage has been achieved, mainly through the modification of plant operation and lighting levels. The committee believes that there would be considerable merit in Overseas Property Group testing the effectiveness of the energy conservation measures to be incorporated in the refurbishment program by undertaking ail energy audit of the building following 12 months occupation. As the building will remain operational during the refurbishment, the committee has recommended that Overseas Property Group continue to consult with staff and the Community and Public Sector Union during the refurbishment program to ensure minimal disruption and inconvenience to staff and other users of the building. I commend the reports io the House. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 27 September. Second Reading",93
236,Mr SNOWDON,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (6.41 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. The bill would make machinery changes consequential to the implementation of changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to CES notification requirements and allow the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, to obtain goods and services by using a credit card. The bill would provide for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act. In particular, the bill would allow for inclusion in determinations made under the act provisions relating to resetting unemployment registration to zero of particular clients who decline to continue to participate in the case management system. This is in line with announcements made in the 1995-96 budget and already implemented. The new arrangements were introduced for part-time and seasonal workers because they have substantial and recent work force experience and may not require, or in some instances want, the level of assistance provided under case management. The bill would seek to make consequential amendments to that part of the act that defines job compact eligibility for the purposes of a case management activity agreement. The bill would streamline requirements on the CES to notify and interview a person after they become a participant in the case management system. The existing provisions of the Employment Services Act 1994 require two separate contacts to be made, the first being when a person becomes a participant in the case management system and the second when the person is to be referred to a case manager. The bill would require the CBS to make a single contact with the job seeker for the purpose of notifying participant status and for requesting the job seeker to attend or take part in an interview. Under the bill, notification that a person is a participant in the case management system will be made when the CBS calls the job seeker in for an interview and considers that a referral can be made to a case manager within 24 days of a referral interview taking place. At present, ESRA is unable to use government credit card facilities because the act not provide for it to borrow money. To overcome the administrative inconvenience this causes, the bill would provide for BSRA to obtain goods and services on credit by the use of a credit card. Consequential amendments are also required to the act following changes to the Social Security Act 1991 to allow for the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart allowance with effect from 20 September 1996. The bill would provide for these consequential amendments. I commend the bill to the House. (Quorum/ormed)",94
237,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"It is very indicative of the government that it has no speakers, apart from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), on the Employment Services Amendment Bill. The government has no speakers, as I understand it, listed for this piece of legislation. Mr O'Keefe-The parliamentary secretary just introduced it, didn'the?",95
238,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"This is apart from the parliamentary secretary. This indicates how embarrassed the government is over the need to introduce legislation at this stage to fix up some of the minor errors of Working Nation. Working Nation has become a monumental embarrassment to the government, is regarded around the country as simply a device to hide unemployed people from the statistics in an attempt to make the government look good in the run-up to the election campaign and offers far too little real practical assistance to unemployed people. As I said, this bill corrects a number of oversights and mistakes in Working Nation. The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and also established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. This bill makes machinery changes arising from changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to the CBS notification requirements does and allow BSRA to obtain goods and services by using a credit card. The bill also allows for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act 1994. At present the CBS is required to notify a person that they have become a participant in the case management system as soon as practicable after they have become a participant. The reason why this provision was put in initially was to bump up the numbers apparently in the case management system as early as possible so that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) could appear in this House and tell us how many people were already participating in case management. The embarrassing thing about this particular proposal was that it meant there were many more people participating in case management than there were case managers able to handle them. So there were many instances of participants-the word 'participants' has to have inverted commas around it in this particular context-who found it very difficult to ever get to meet their case manager. They were sitting around for prolonged periods waiting for that opportunity. Although the government was telling them and the nation that they were participating in case management, it was not apparent to them that they were. This meant that many people received two notices: one when they became a participant in the system, and the government could boast that they were in the system, but they could not be referred to a case manager; and another notice when they were referred to a case manager. It no longer serves the government's purpose to have these two notices. So we are told that on the basis of administrative efficiency we will now move back to one notice. The two-notice system served its original political purpose. Now we will move back to a one-notice system. From the point of view of unemployed people, this is a much more sensible arrangement. But it highlights-and let me underline this-the political design inherent in the original procedures established by the government. The bill also relates to job compact eligibility for certain seasonal and part-time workers. This is also to be amended in the bill. The definitions of persons eligible for job compact is amended to include the requirement that, in addition to having been in receipt of the jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance for a period of 18 months, a person must also have been registered with the CES for a period of 18 months. This is apparently to take account of persons who have had their CES registration date reset to zero. I understand that the reason for this is that the system was, by the way in which was defined, drawing into the case managewhite ment system people who were not appropritackling ately case managed in their own eyesjobs indeed, they aimed to be part-time or casual workers-and otherwise were registered with the CES and formally eligible for case management but it was really not appropriate case management be provided to them. Under the provisions in this bill, when seasonal and part-time workers elect not to participate in case management the period 18 months registration required to be eligible under the proposed amendments would be taken to commence from the time of that lasting employment. election for seasonal workers and for part-time workers after they have completed at least 13 weeks of work. Provision is made in the bill to save those persons eligible for the job compact for the purposes of the section before the proposed amendments and to save determinations under existing section 39, subsection 14, that were in effect before the proposed amendments. The bill makes provision for ESRA to purchase goods and services on credit from any person by the use of a credit card. The present ESRA does not have the power to borrow money and, accordingly, cannot use government credit facilities. I have to say that one may well wonder what is the rationale for the provision of this credit card to ESRA, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. I think most Australians, and certainly all Victorians, would feel a twinge of unease when they realise that this credit card is to be provided to Joan Kirner and her committee. Of course, Mrs Kirner is the person who virtually bankrupted the state of Victoria by her - excessive borrowing. Now she is to be provided with a credit card to borrow on the behalf of ESRA. I am sure a close watch will be kept on her proclivities by the members of the ESRA board. The opposition will certainly be keeping a very close watch on the way in which this card is used. It will be very closely monitored. The measures in the bill, according to the government, are not expected to have a significant financial impact. I hope that applies also to the credit card arrangements. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that it case management was highlighted in the paper Working Nation as a means of long-term unemployment through the compact. It was to involve one-on-one service provided by a case manager to a job seeker unemployed for more than 12 months or considered to be at risk of becoming longthat term unemployed. Case managers were to work with the job seeker to negotiate a case management activity agreement which sets out the course of action tailored to the needs of of the job seeker and agreed between the job seeker and the case manager. The object is to assist the job seeker to obtain and retain Case managers provide counselling and jobsearch assistance supported by access to programs, vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills or community based experience or subsidised employment. The case management activity agreement requires a job compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any placement under new work opportunities or the new enterprise incentive scheme. It is clear that the case management system is not even now operating in an entirely satisfactory way in many parts of Australia. As I talk to unemployed people in different states, I find that it is still the case that many long-term unemployed people who have been assigned a case manager have not actually met their case manager. The one-on-one case management of the original Employment Services Act has not really materialised. I think it is fair to say, and this has ly been confirmed in discussions I have had with officials in the department at the area level-I suppose that is the correct area description-that the concept of case management has really undergone some change since the initial white paper was brought down. Instead, today there are case managers with loads of over 200 cases. I have heard figures far higher than that. It is obviously the case that a case manager with such a load as that is in no position to provide the kind and quality of case management required which those with long experience of assisting the long-term unemployed know is required. Many contract case managers-that is, private providers of case management-face problems in getting started. Despite being advised that their tenders were successful, they waited for quite some time to be connected to the departmental computer system, which is essential to their effective operation. In addition, some contracted case managers feel that they have been given the hard cases-people who have been unemployed for four or five years or more. There is a belief, which I think should be dispelled by the government in its response in this debate, from the point of view of the contracted case managers that perhaps the department is retaining 'easier' clients to ensure that their commencement and outcome figures are optimised. Certainly there is a problem that has been identified by many in Working Nation. I remember it was quite recently identified by the national executive director of skillshare, David Thompson, that the incentives in the system are such as to encourage officers of the department to place people in programs rather than to focus on the employment outcomes of the people who are being case managed, because the officer is assessed much more by the placement in a program, even if this does not lead to an employment outcome. Many case managers have demonstrated effectiveness in helping unemployed people, and I certainly am not critical of the efforts and the enthusiasm of many of the officers of the CES in struggling to make the system work. I am sure in many cases there have certainbeen successful outcomes. But there is no doubt that they are being hamstrung by the bureaucratic nature of the Working Nation package and its great complexity and by the fact that innovative and successful solutions which may vary from region to region, or even within regions, are constantly having to be altered or abandoned to fit the model of help laid down by the government. DEET has basically determined how unemployed people are to be helped. Unless you are prepared to help unemployed people in the way determined by the department, your scheme is most unlikely to receive departmental funding. Some comment can be made about that by way of exception because there is another tendency at present-that is, for funds to be made available almost on a 'no questions asked' basis. The department is still finding that this massive pot of money has to be spent. Of course, the government is very keen that as much of it as possible be spent before the election campaign. The more people who are placed in subsidised employment of a project kind, as is the classic case, the better the unemployment statistics will look. Unfortunately, this reflects the fact that there is a great concern, I regret to say, on the part of the minister with the statistics rather than with actually making sure that unemployed people are receiving the employment opportunities that they so desperately need. In relation to the case management system, the House should note that the Auditor General has recently questioned the effectiveness of the operation of the case management system. The Auditor-General's report revealed that there were significant weaknesses in the system which, according to the Auditor General, must be 'quickly remedied' as they reduce the capacity of the system to provide assistance to long-term unemployed people. The criticism made by many was borne out by the report-that many unemployed people had very tenuous links with their case manager or were not receiving effective assistance at all. The Auditor-General's report found that almost one-third of people being case managed-that is, those who were surveyed by the Audit Office-did not believe that their contact with the CES was useful, despite visits or personal contact. Thirty-nine per cent of clients did not realise that they had a return to work plan, which is a key element of case management, and 43 per cent of clients said they were no more motivated to find work after starting case management. At the time the case management system was introduced the coalition stated that it would welcome the introduction of competition to case management if it meant that a genuine choice in employment case management would be made available. The responsibility for ensuring that that level playing field, as the government described it, comes into existence falls on the Employment Services Regulatory Authoritythat is, ESRA. It is obvious that there are a number of issues which have arisen in the implementation of the system which certainly have needed the attention of any authority determined to ensure that the system of contracted case management operates efficiently and effectively. The coalition has focused on the importance of taking a holistic approach to the long-term unemployed and has made a commitment to establish community employment organisations comprising local, state and federal officers and community and business representatives to revitalise community based employment programs and to assist unemployed people. These structures will enable the regional character of unemployment to be recognised. Case management has been in place for almost one year and is still facing significant problems. Industrial difficulties abounded when the system was introduced. The CES is still facing increased pressure on its resources and contracted case managers have complained that there are insufficient funds to provide an adequate level of case management for those who need it. The Public Sector Union has trenchantly criticised the government for the way case management has been implemented. In September 1994--just over a year ag<r-the Community and Public Sector Union stated quite clearly what was happening in the department. The union's newsletter states: The result of this is the current chaos as DEET management tty to frantically rearrange staffing resources to meet Case Management targets, as well as fudge statistics to make it look as though targets are being met. These quite serious charges by the union were never, and never have been, effectively answered by the government. Nor were these charges confined to one point in time. A year later, in the newsletter published by the union for September this year, the charges were effectively repeated. The union states in its September 1995 newsletter: . . . we have clear evidence that much of Working Nation isn't working. This piece of legislation before the House, to which no government member other than the parliamentary secretary has deigned to speak, is designed to correct some of those problems with the implementation of Working Nation, although not the most serious problems. The most serious problems remain to be addressed in other ways. But the problems have been there. They have been known to all those charged with the responsibility of implementing the program and they have been pointed out on numerous occasions by the opposition. The minister claims that if only we will tell him what the problems are he will correct them. Over the last year we have told the minister at great length what the problems are. Virtually every change that has been made to Working Nation of any significance is a change which has been recommended to the government by the opposition. The opposition has been extremely constructive in this matter because we have been greatly disturbed at the fact that effective help to many unemployed people has been denied over the last year because of the design flaws and the blundering which have accompanied the introduction of Working Nation. The strategy has caused quite a lot of difficulty to many unemployed people. One of its greatest problems has been that it has actually fed the pool of people who are long term unemployed. Working Nation has created long-term unemployment. I identified that problem to the minister and the government well over a year ago. I have done this because of a very serious blunder made at the time. That blunder was to deny assistance to many unemployed people until they were long-term unemployed. Many were sitting around waiting to be long-term unemployed so they could qualify for assistance under the Working Nation guidelines. Mr Ronaldson-That is crazy.",95
239,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"That is appalling. As the member for Ballarat says, it is a crazy decision on the part of the government. The minister has recently announced that assistance will be allowed at an earlier stage-after six months. That is a direct response-let us make no mistake about this-to the coalition's identification of this problem. Let us have none of the cant from the other side of the chamber that the coalition has not been constructive. We have pointed out many of the difficulties, but particularly this design flaw, which only now-almost 18 months after Working Nation was brought down-the government has moved to correct. I believe that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has been derelict in his duty in allowing this problem with the system to persist for so long. At the moment the government is claiming great success in terms of its employment record. It claims that it has created over 600,000 jobs since the last election and that Working Nation is on target to achieve unemployment of around five per cent by the year 2000-01. The facts show that the reality is quite different from the impression that these claims are designed to create. The recession we had to have destroyed 337,300 jobs. Net job creation is about half the number claimed by the government-net being once you take away from the 600,000 or so jobs, the jobs that were destroyed. These net new jobs have been insufficient to meet the demand from the growing number of people in the work force. In other words, over the last five years job creation has not kept up with the growth in the work force. As a result of that, over the last five years unemployment has gone up from 6.2 to 8.5 per cent. Job creation has now slowed down to zero. The last ABS labour force figures showed that employment had fallen, despite the enormous number of subsidised jobs which the government is creating monthly through spending taxpayers' money under Working Nation. The rate of subsidised job creation is now running at somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 a month. In June it was 20,000. There are presently about 85,000 people in subsidised jobs in the work force. Imagine if the department was not creating 20,000 subsidised jobs a month; what would job growth have been last month when, even according to the ABS labour force statistics, employment fell by 15,000. The department is trying to hold up the employment scene by balloons at the moment. Of course, the public is well aware of the fraud in these figures. None of this daunts the government because its objective is to distract people's attention from the record and to focus their attention on some mythical future. So, in superannuation, the Prime Minister asks us to look ahead to 2020 and that people on very low incomes today should be immensely grateful to him because he has promised them some benefit in 2020. Mr Ronaldson-In 2040.",99
240,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"In 2040, as the member for Ballarat reminds me. It has gone out a very long way. Of course, in the employment area, we are asked not to think about the unemployment rate-one of the highest in the industrialised world-but to think about what it might be in five years time, and that might be five per cent, according to the government. Our view is that the growth in the economy at the moment and the likely growth is nowhere near enough to get unemployment down to five per cent by the end of the decade. Even if it were five per cent by the end of the decade, youth unemployment, which is typically three times the adult rate, would still be about 15 per cent. So it is not a great outcome. It is clear that virtually no responsible commentator believes for a moment that the government is correct when it makes these claims. The claims are, in a literal sense of the word, incredible-unbelievable. The rate of economic growth over the year to the end of June 1995 was 3.7 per cent. The government has been saying that if we can sustain economic growth at about four per cent, we can get unemployment down. The Prime Minister has stated that if you can't get four per cent, you might as well give the game away. The government has not been able to get four per cent. It is falling well short of that, and well short of its predictions. The budget paper forecast for economic growth for 1995-96 is 3.75 per cent. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has recently indicated this may have to be revised downwards. Many commentators simply do not share the government's rose-coloured view of economic growth. Professor John Quiggan, speaking at the Jobs for Young Australians conference in Adelaide, had this to say about growth and unemployment: ... the target of Working Nationthat is, five per centis not achievable with 3.7 per cent growth... It's dishonest of the Government to maintain that [5 per cent unemployment by the Year 2000] as its target ... It's very clear that policy makers have a target range of 7 to 8 per cent and the design of policy to ease the rate of unemployment a littl- below 8 per cent and then keep it in that range. That was said by Professor Quiggan at the Jobs for Young Australians conference in August. Michael Dwyer of the Financial Review wrote on 7 September 1995: The latest forecast from Access Economics suggests jobs growth will remain strong enough to see the unemployment rate bottom at around 7.9 per cent in mid-I996 before it begins to climb back towards 9 per cent in 1997... The slowdown in employment growth will make it difficult for the Federal Government to meet its 5 per cent unemployment target by the end of the decade. Professor Helen Hughes makes this sobering prediction in her publication Achieving Full Employment: · .. unemployment levels are likely to be around 7 or 8 per cent in the late 1990s, and they could ratchet up again in an economic downturn to 11 per cent or more. The Financial Review on 24 February 1995 echoed her concerns: Unemployment in Australia will balloon to 11.7 per cent by 2000 unless the country can achieve average annual growth rates of 5 per cent for the rest of the decade... To bring it down to 5 per cent, Australia will need annual growth rates of 5 per cent Professor Hughes had this to say about growth rates in June this year: We will be lucky to average an annual GDP growth of 3.5 per cent to 1999 ... Alan Mitchell wrote on 4 September 1995 in the Financial Review: · .. the more likely unemployment rate in the year 2001 is 6 per cent or more. Saul Eslake, the Chief Economist with the ANZ Bank, said it would be 'quite difficult' to get unemployment below seven per cent by the end of the decade, even if the economy grew at a sustainable pace of around four per cent a year. Tim Colebatch, on 8 September 1995, wrote: · .. key parts of the economy have been slowing for months; now jobs are too . . . if jobs growth in 1995-96 continues as it has begun, the Government and the economy are in for tough times. Professor Judith Sloan has stated: · . . it is quite possible that the unemployment is outcome will greatly exceed the target-by as much as 2 percentage points. That was written in the Australian on 14 September. Perhaps the most telling criticism which sums up the conclusion that I think any reasonable listener must draw from these expert comments came in an editorial in the Australian, the national newspaper, on 8 September: Employment Minister Mr Crean claims we are on track to cut unemployment to 5 per cent. At best he is deluded and at worse Mr Crean is not telling the truth. That is the conclusion of the country's major national newspaper about the government's five per cent claims. So let us have some honesty, frankness and realism about the employment prospects for this country under the kinds of policies which the government has brought down. The fact is that over the last 12 years this government has failed miserably to meet the demand for paid employment by this community. (Time expired)",99
241,Mr RICHARD EVANS,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"I join my colleague the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) on this issue because I believe it is important not only to this parliament and those who are associated with this place but also to our community in Australia, and certainly the community within Cowan which currently is suffering high unemployment-in particular, high youth unemployment and its associated social problems. I note with interest, though, on the speakers list for the Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995 that no-one from the government is prepared to speak on this issue. Maybe that confirms that they think it is not a particular problem to be addressed by our nation. Back in 1994, I addressed the House on the issue of unemployment in terms of it being a continuing challenge for the people of Australia. I must take back those words as they are now proven to be little more than a gross underestimation of reality. Unemployment in Australia has gone far beyond being a challenge; it has actually become a real and acceptable alternative to employment of any kind. It is also an endemic social problem which is worsening week by week as our unemployment numbers seem to soar. It is an attitudinal trap from which long term unemployed can see no reasonable escape. It is an expectation of the future of many of our young schoolleavers and young people in general, which is sad to see in a country like Australia. What an indictment that is of our Labor government. What an appalling situation. What a tragic cycle of total dependency and deprivation for the people of Australia, all created by a short sighted, short-term thinking and short on talent Labor government. The Employment Services Amendment Bill that we are debating today is similarly short on content and planning, short on underlying strategy and very short on the basis for equity among our very needy unemployed. Australia needs two simple things in relation to unemployment. The first is obviousthat is, jobs for all people who want to work, jobs created through business confidence and support. Secondly, we need a dynamic attitude shift among Australians, to once again believe that to earn a living through gainful employment and work, and long-term employment, is a real alternative to accepting government handouts. This brings a bundle of associated social concerns, such as the ability to earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. But this is not under question at the moment. I do not believe that the long-term unemployed are either lazy or unwilling to work; far from it. I want to make that point clear and not open to any misinterpretation by anyone. However, I suspect that some have lost the will to work. They are thoroughly despondent and morally shattered by the whole experience of being unemployed. Having had an extended period of unemployment when I was quite young, after transferring from Victoria to Western Australia, I can say that it can be quite a shattering experience to be out of work for a long period. The long-term unemployed are also feeling totally rejected and dejected by the total lack of government support and initiative in helping them get back to work. I suspect that they are totally sick to their back teeth of green papers, white papers, discussion papers, standing committees, sitting committees, surveys, action plans, et cetera, that all talk about issues and initiatives but do not really give Joe and Jackie Average a job, or a job that they want. The bill being discussed today does not address this fundamental of creating jobs. The essence of this bill, as I see it, is the issue of case management, a concept which I find most unappealing in both the term itself and its activity base. I am appalled that unemployed persons are referred to as 'cases'. They are not medical problems and they are not part of student case studies. They are quite simply people who want to work. They are in need of a job-nothing more, nothing less. The second part of the term-managethese ment-relegates the unemployed to the ranks of the unthinking, those people who need be managed and controlled-like unruly children, for instance. The fact is that all need is employment guidance, a helping hand and a lead in the right direction. They do not need to be forced into any situation. They not need to be managed as you would manage livestock in a yard. They need help, assistance, guidance and support-not management For goodness sake! Let us not take away the last vestiges of self-esteem from the unemrather ployed. Case management, as it was termed, highlighted in the white paper Working Nation as a means of tackling long-term unemployment through the so-called jobs compact. This was to involve a one on one service and liaison between a case manager years. and job seeker who has been unemployed for more than 12 months or considered to be at risk of being long-term unemployed. However, the role of case manager, as created in the bill, was to be suited to the likes of a superman or a superwoman. This superperson has to provide counselling and jobsearch allowance, vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills and opportunibusiness ties for community based work experience subsidised employment. This superperson charged with being all things to all clients also has to cope written reports, face-to-face contact, networkendorsement ing and community liaison, as well as keeping up to date with changing work practices, changing legislation and changing roles within their own field, and who knows what other changes. It is little wonder that the system not fully operational in many parts of Australunder is at present. It is little wonder that many long-term unemployed are yet to even meet their assigned case managers. Let us be reasonable. Some case managers have workloads of 200 cases. They really cannot be expected to cope with demands of this magnitude. The one on one case management concept, as in the original employment services bill, has not materialised. Many of people are contracted to positions through a tendering arrangement. They should to reasonably expect support from the government in undertaking their roles. However, they even after being accepted as contractors-all signed, sealed and delivered-they have to wait for some time just to be connected to the do departmental CBS computer system, a pivotal element in their successful operation. There was also a growing realisation that these case management contractors had been given preferential treatment. That statement is misleading. Case managers were allocated what I would describe as negative preferential treatment, if there is such a term. was It appears that these case managers were given a fair case load but that those cases were mainly considered to be the hard core unemployed or by definition those who had been looking for work for some four or five The CES staffers, on the other hand, took on the issues and the cases of the shorter term unemployed. The reality is that the case managers were hamstrung: they were denied access to information, denied a balanced case load and denied real and meaningful liaison with the department by the very bureaucratic nature of the Working Nation package. These are not my thoughts alone. As a manager of considerable success, or these problems could have been envisaged by even the most naive operator in business. To have these issues arise with the support, with planning, so-called wisdom and overall of a so-called professional-the minister himself-is unforgivable, misleading and reeks of incompetence. My views are backed also by the Auditor General, who recently questioned the effecis tiveness of case management and the system which it operates. The report revealed significant weaknesses in the system, recommended the necessity for quick remedies and highlighted the tenuous link between the jobless and case managers. My views are supported yet again by the facts-a few hard, cold, non-negotiable figures. Firstly, one-third of case managers do not believe that their contracts with the CES were in any way useful. Secondly, 39 per cent of clients did not even realise that they had to return to work, which is a key element of case management. Thirdly, a staggering 43 per cent of clients said they were no more motivated to find work even with the assistance of a case manager. What have we really got? We have a scheme that is poorly named and demeaning to those involved, a scheme that the CES does not totally support and which is open to bias and rorts, a scheme that the unemployed do not understand, a scheme that has no proven results and a scheme condemned by the Auditor-General himself. I will leave it to my colleagues to point out the many problems with this bill-and believe me they are many and varied. Without doubt, there are few other pieces of legislation that have been so badly prepared, badly developed, poorly trialled and poorly evaluated as this one. Once again I am forced to say that the essence of the bill is sound, but thanks to the ineptitude of the Labor government it is impractical in its implementation and not its intent. Unemployment cannot, and must not, be seen as an island issue-an issue in isolation from all others. It is an issue which touches on so many different areas and the only approach to unemployment must be addressed with broad thinking, long-term strategies and sound business acumen. Only a Liberal government can deliver all of these. Debate interrupted. NA",101
242,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being approximately 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Republic of Singapore Air Force Flying Training School",103
243,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"It has been brought to my attention that the government of Singapore, through a company operating in Western Australia, may be flouting not only our immigration laws but also our industrial legislation. As a result, I believe the Singaporean government is actively denying Australians work in their own country while insidiously putting in place draconian industrial practices transplanted from that country. On 10 February 1988, the government of Singapore and the government of Australia entered into discussions regarding the establishment of a republic of Singapore air force flying training school in Australia. The government of Singapore and the RSAF were finding their existing arrangements were not allowing them to attain the flying hours that their trainee pilots required primarily because of restrictions on airspace in and around their existing flying training areas. The establishment and subsequent operation of a RSAF flying training school in Australia would be beneficial to the RSAF's training scheme as the airspace that would be available under such an arrangement would be far less restrictive and far less crowded. The benefits to Australia were perceived to be primarily economic in the form of providing employment to a depressed aviation industry, a boost to Australian aviation maintenance facilities already established and a strengthening of ties between the two allies. On 10 February 1988, a status of forces agreement was drawn up between the two governments. This SOFA covered, among other things, the guidelines regarding personnel and equipment transfers from Singapore to Australia and the terms and conditions that would apply during the established period of the new RSAF flying training school. On 9 March 1993 a memorandum of understanding between the two governments was drawn up and signed. This MOU laid out specific guidelines, dates, personnel numbers, local industry involvement and local employment requirements for the establishment and subsequent operation of the RSAF training school at RAAF base Pearce in Bullsbrook north of Perth near my electorate. By September 1993 the initial advance deployment of 16 RSAF aircraft was stationed at RAAF base Pearce, housed temporarily in RAAF hangars while the new RSAF facilities were being constructed. These facilities were to be fully funded during design, construction and ongoing maintenance as per the MOU. At about this time, Australian aviation maintenance personnel recruitment began. By January-February 1994, recruitment of Australian personnel had increased but not to a sufficient degree to compensate for the resignation rate of the initial Australian employees. In May 1994 the new RSAF facilities were completed and the RSAF flying training school moved into its new complex. The activities of the Singaporean government, through its company in Australia, have been questionable. I have received numerous complaints about alleged breaches of the memorandum of understanding in the original agreement. It has been alleged that, amongst other things, from September 1993, when recruitment of Australian aviation maintenance personnel began, it was even then apparent that paragraph 5, titled 'Scope', of the MOU was being contravened. Although the MOU specifically stated that, excepting for Australian contractor support personnel, only RSAF personnel would be engaged by the GOS with the RSAF flight training school, there are a considerable number of Singaporean civil aviation maintenance workers as part of the program. These personnel were and still are employees of Singapore Aerospace Engineering, the parent company that wholly owns the Australian registered contractor, Perth Aerospace Engineering. As the number of aviation personnel increased, the Australians were told that it was only an interim arrangement and that, as recruitment increased, so the civilians would be sent back and Australians would take over their various roles. Alongside both the civilian Singaporean and the Australian contractor personnel was a large contingent of uniformed RSAF maintenance personnel. By January-February 1994, recruitment of Australian personnel had increased but not to a sufficient degree to compensate the resignation rate of the initial Australian employees. Terms and conditions of employment, and the contrast between what Australians were led to believe would happen and what in actual fact was happening, were the primary reasons for the resignation rate, which was exceeding 50 per cent. There were also grave concerns in the areas of safety, maintenance standards, wage rates, hours of duty and shift arrangements, and a general feeling that the Australian personnel were compromised in their professionalism and future prospects for employment in the Australian aviation industry. In May 1994 it became apparent that uniformed RSAF personnel were returning to Singapore, not the civilian SAE personnel, who still remain employed by PAE-as I have said, an Australian company-in Australia under GOS travel orders. It also became apparent that PAE management was actively encouraging RSAF maintenance personnel to discharge from the RSAF with the promise of guaranteed employment with PAE in Australia at the RSAF flying training school. This is a blatant abuse of the originally agreed position. As a consequence, a situation now exists where an Australian company is employing overseas labour to the detriment of the Australian work force by apparently rorting the SOFA agreement between the two countries. PAE is bringing in civilian Singaporeans without any sort of visas but using government of Singapore travel orders, a situation reserved for the use of transfer of military personnel between the two countries.(Time expired) Thoroughbred Racing",103
244,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, as you would appreciate, I am a very strong supporter of representative and accountable administration of Australia's major sporting codes. I do not believe, for instance, that unrepresentative, unaccountable media barons, like Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer, should control rugby league or rugby union in this country. You can imagine my delight upon reading the recommendations of the recent Temby report on the administration of thoroughbred racing in New South Wales. The report recommends that the Australian Jockey Club be stripped of its governing powers and that a thoroughbred racing council be established. It is very important for an industry with a net revenue of $350 million, for an industry that brings employment and so much entertainment to so many people in New South Wales, to have effective and representative administration. Let me provide an example of how unrepresentative the AJC has been in its long history. This is something I am sure the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) will be interested in, being a long and strong fighter for the rights of women in Australia. There has not been a female committee member of the AJC in its history, going way back into the last century. Small punters, small owners and small trainers in the thoroughbred racing industry have never been effectively represented by the Australian Jockey Club. In my own part of Sydney, in the south-west, we only need to look at the Warwick Farm racecourse to understand that it is very much the poor cousin of racing in the Sydney metropolitan area. There are two AJC controlled tracks in Sydney: Randwick and Warwick Farm. Warwick Farm, well out of proportion with its share of punters and population in Sydney, has a low number of Saturday meetings, a low number of feature races and in fact has always been stripped of the quality racing in the Sydney area. No comparison could be made with the capital facilities. The Randwick racecourse in east Sydney is given Rolls Royce treatment and capital funding by the AJC whereas Warwick Farm receives nowhere near the same amount of capital funding and capital support. One only needs to look at the residential address of the majority of the committee members of the AJC to understand they much prefer racing at Randwick, in the eastern suburbs near the lower north shore of Sydney, than where the people live and where the people are moving-that is, the Warwick Farm racecourse near my electorate in the south-west of Sydney. I would urge the Carr government, in the establishment of the thoroughbred racing council, to make sure that the interests of punters, trainers and racing lovers in the greater western Sydney region are represented on that particular council. I would urge the council and the Carr government's racing minister, Richard Face, to make sure that the south-west of Sydney, through Warwick Farm, and the west of Sydney, through Rosehill racecourse, have a fair share of the Saturday meetings, the feature races and the qUality thoroughbred racing to match the population share and the interest in this tremendous sport. I was not surprised to read that the chairman of the AJC, Bob Charley, is upset about the idea of club busting, the idea of breaking down the elitist control the AJC has exercised over racing in New South Wales for many decades. I was not surprised to read at all that Bob Charley has mentioned that four Labor governments tried it in the past. Mr Charley would not be too keen on Labor governments doing anything. I hope this Carr Labor government in New South Wales, unlike its predecessors, actually introduces representative and accountable administration of horse racing in New South Wales. It is very hard to have confidence in the current circumstances in the AJC. We have already read about the spread of race fixing, money laundering and illegal betting. We have all seen the loss of confidence in the racing industry following the evidence revealed in the so-called jockey tapes. We have all seen the sort of administration for which the AJC has becomes notorious-that is, decisions made behind closed doors, a secretive decision making process which by no criteria can be judged to be in the best interests of the racing industry and racing supporters in New South Wales. The Carr government needs to go ahead with this new representative body. It needs to make sure that in representation the west and south-west of Sydney are not overlooked. I am sure racing in New South Wales can only prosper from this report and these developments. Prime Minister",104
245,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (7.38 p.m.)I will not take up much time as I know some of my colleagues are keen to talk tonight on the adjournment. I just want to talk very briefly about a visit to my electorate on Wednesday by our esteemed leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I would like to pass on to him some of the comments that have been passed on to me in the last 48 hours. My constituents want to know why he is not here fulfilling his duties as Prime Minister but is swanning around the country involving himself in this phoney election campaign. He should either get into it and do it or stay where he should be-that is, in this parliament where his obligations lie while parliament is sitting. While he is there, he might like to tell the people of my electorate why they are paying more for their mortgages because of our overseas debt. While he is sitting on his hands, he might like to tell them why our youth unemployment is double the national average. He might also like to tell the people of my electorate why the adult unemployment rate is well in excess of the state and national average. He might also like to tell my small business sector why their experiences in the last three months have been quite dramatic. He might like to tell me and my colleague the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), whose farmers and small business people and, indeed, unemployed are experiencing similar problems, why he is not here solving those problems but is instead conducting this phoney election campaign. It is all very well for those opposite to be heehawing about this. It is about time they realised that the obligations are on him and his speech today was a very clear example of the fact that this bloke has absolutely lost It was a pathetic performance and one that he should quite rightly be embarrassed about. If the Prime Minister wants to go to his electorate to address his electorate's concerns when the House is sitting, that is fair enough. I would never deny any member of this House the opportunity to go back· to their electorate for electorate functions. But, quite frankly, the fact that the Prime Minister, who has the sole responsibility for running this country as Prime Minister, is not in this House for the sitting of this parliament is an absolute disgrace. If he wants to go around swanning in areas like mine and other marginal seats, why doesn'the call the election and put this thing to the test?",105
246,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT,"He was in my electorate on Friday. Mr RONALDSON....:...I'm not surprised that you want him in Victoria and not in Queensland. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't want him within a bull's roar of Queensland either. He has probably cost you about two or three per cent. I am surprised you did not tell him to stay in Canberra. On reflection, I suppose I should not stop him going there, but I have had a lot of phone calls asking why the Prime Minister is not in this House while parliament is sitting",106
247,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT,Two people.,106
248,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Attorney made a silly comment. I would not have made that comment unless it was legitimate, and it was. There have been a number of phone calls from people in my electorate office today as a result of an article in the paper on Saturday asking why I am not back at some of the functions I have been invited to when the Prime Minister is coming through. My answer to them was that my obligations",106
249,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT,"You wouldn't be ignoring your electorate, would you? It's not like you.",106
250,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very pleased to hear the Attorney interjecting like that. I am sure that he is acutely aware of the fact that his obligations as an elected member are to his electorate and to this parliament. I agtee it. with him on that. They are the two basic things that we have responsibility for. The simple fact is that the Prime Minister should be in this place, not swanning around. He might like to answer why he was there and why he has not been back. He might answer why the promises he made to my electorate during the last election campaign have not been kept and, indeed, what he is going to do about our appalling level of unemployment. What does he intend to do about the problems my small business sector, farmers and unemployed youth are facing? Plenty Road Light Rail",106
251,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"The recent opening of the 2.1 kilometre extension of the Plenty Road light rail from the Bundoora shopping centre, MCLeans Road, to MCKimmies Road and the Bundoora RMIT campus was an extremely positive outcome for students of RMIT and for residents and future residents in the estates along Plenty Road, an achievement celebrated by a community fair at RMIT. It was an extremely positive outcome for the Better Cities program. It was a personal triumph for Brian Howe, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, and the architect of the Better Cities program. However, had you read the local paper the week before the opening, you might have been forgiven for thinking that the federal government had nothing to do with the project. The publicity department of the Victorian Public Transport Corporation had worked overtime on the publicity, announcing details of the opening without bothering mention from where the money had come, sible, which was of course the building better cities program-to the tune of some $12.6 million. At the opening, which was carried out jointly by Brian Howe and the state Minister for Public Transport, Alan Brown, much said along the lines that the extension was shining example of effective cooperation between the federal and state governments. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development himself said that local, state federal government had worked together on this model project. The minister was being modest and undervaluing his role and the federal government's role in this may well have finished up a model of intergovernmental cooperation. It quite easily could have ended up a model of intergovernment uncooperation. The fact is that when the original announcedeficiencies ment was made in December 1991, the coalition project included the extension of the light approximately three kilometres to Childs Road, Mill Park. Not only would this have serviced the rapidly growing Bundoora camthis puses of RMIT but also the extra kilometre would have brought the tram to the 30,000 residents living in the suburb of Mill Park. The housing development in Mill Park has the types of problems that the Better Cities program was designed to address, such as a gross lack of public infrastructure. It is a great shame that the tram was not extended, as originally announced. The reason it was not extended to Mill Park is simple: Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett was elected Premier of Victoria. The change of government in 1992 brought a change of Better Cities priorities. Initially the Victorian Liberal government wanted to drop this extension altogether. It was only pressure from the federal government that put the extension, at least as far as RMIT, back on the rails. Without the pressure from the federal government and the funds from the federal government the light rail would not have moved one centimetre further along Plenty Road past the previous terminus at MCLeans Road. It is regrettable that this attitude of the state to government makes it unlikely, if not imposfor the remainder of the project to be considered in the next round of Better Cities funding, which with a cooperative outlook it might well have been. What this episode demonstrates is that Commonwealth-state relations are tenuous, require the vigilance of was the Commonwealth and need overhaul-but a not the sort of overhaul envisaged by the coalition. As is clear from the recent comments of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello), the coalition if it and achieved government is intent on handing over large areas of Commonwealth authority to the states. This has all been heard beforefrom Fraser, from Hewson, and now from the project. It Howard-Costello biumvirate. Often in my electorate I have had to comment, 'The Commonwealth to the rescue again,' as the federal government covers for left by the state government. The would take away this capacity by rail vandalising the national government and effectively fracturing the nation. Mr Kennett may have some supporters, including some in House, as well as his numerous detractors, but I am sure that even his staunchest admirers would cringe at the thought of him being given more authority. The new tram terminus at RMIT Bundoora is adjacent to another Better Cities project, the redevelopment of surplus institutional land at Janefield for housing. I commend the cooperation that has taken place thus far between some state government departments, the Urban Land Authority, local government and a range of community agencies led by the federally funded Family Resource Centre in Thomastown. For the Janefield development not to simply replay the mistakes of the past there must be a whole-of-government approach, especially at the state level. While the signs are encouraging, there is evidence that at least one state department will not fully participate in a proper planning process. An official of the Department of School Education, a notorious department under Mr Kennett, told a public meeting, 'They do not take the advice of anybody on where they build their schools,' when it was suggested that as part of the proposed development of the Janefield land an alternative site for the Bundoora Primary School might be considered. This attitude is of great concern. Better Cities is about avoiding these mistakes, not replicating them. Calder Highway",107
252,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise an issue which I have raised previously in this House. It is to do with the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo and Mildura being included in the national highway system. I raised this issue in 1990, in 1991, in 1992, in 1993, in 1994 and in 1995 on many occasions. The federal government has refused on every occasion to come to the aid of the city of Bendigo and all of the townships along the route of that highway to upgrade it to four lanes and include it in the national highway system. I have spoken to the Victorian state government and they have at last cooperated with us. It took a change of government to achieve this; the former Labor government, the Cain-Kirner government, would not. We have developed a total strategy for the whole length of the Calder Highway from the bay to the Murray at Mildura. It will include a four-lane divided freeway between Melbourne and Kyneton, a four-lane divided highway between Kyneton and Bendigo and a reservation suitable for conversion to freeway standard in the longer term and a two-lane highway north of Bendigo with driving conditions appropriate for a major state highway with adequate overtaking opportunities and full access for efficient freight vehicles. The role of the Calder Highway is very important in Victoria and in Australia's future. It is a strategic link in Victoria's rural highway network, carrying high volumes of freight transport, business travel and personal travel between Melbourne and the major provincial city of Bendigo, and moderate volumes of traffic between Bendigo, Mildura and New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, South Australia through to the Sturt Highway, which is part of the national highway system. The reason I raise it again is that the Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Bill Baxter, released this strategy just last week. It is a very good strategy. I note the acceptance by the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) of the fact that it is a good strategy. The strategy requires $36 million per annum. The states are going to come up with some money. Of every cent that you spend on fuel, 50 per cent of that money goes on fuel excise, levied by the federal government. What does it return? It returns less than a third of that money to Victoria's roads and it is collecting all of this money. I was interested to hear the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) indicate that it is time the states did something. Here is an opportunity for the federal government to do something. The state government has come up with a strategy. It is prepared to do its part and put its dollars in. If the Commonwealth government is not prepared to accept that the Calder Highway should be part of the national highway system, it has to accept the responsibility for funding part of this highway. Country users are major contributors, through fuel excise, to the federal coffers. The member for MCEwen would acknowledge that fact. He is probably trying to get some of the roads in his area upgraded. Here is the opportunity for the federal government to provide some additional funds to the Calder Highway, which is a most important road in Australia-leading to all of that primary production area north of Melbourne, providing ready access to the ports and airports and providing access for personal travel and tourism. It is an important link and it is one on which the federal government has done some work-I acknowledge that factbut little enough, bearing in mind the massive amount of fuel excise it collects on every litre of fuel. Fifty per cent of all fuel costs is excise-another tax on the motorist-and a minimum amount of that money is returned for road funding. (Time expired). Victorian Government",108
253,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I again bring to the House a black book-the book of Victorian horror stories-and from that I extract yet another story of misery and horror being imposed on the Victorian people by the conservatives of this country. When we talk about lies, deceit and policies, we know what they in Victoria stand for and what the conservatives will do in federal government because we see it daily in Victoria. This is an extract from today's Herald-Sun entitled 'Tehan's miserable cuts'. It concerns the second national mental health report on funding for the mentally ill in Victoria. The report states: The estimated 140,000 Victorians with a serious mental illness can be glad the police Special Operations Group is to swap its guns for sprays and Y-bars. In Victoria, unfortunately, they get shot too often by an uncaring government. The 1995 report has found that Victoria was the only state in Australia to cut its mental health service-the only state. We know what it has done to the public hospital system. For every dollar the Commonwealth puts in, Victoria takes $1 out of the system. So mental health, of course, is a major concern now in Victoria. Not only did the Victorian government make a massive 5.8 per cent cut to its mental health spending in 1994 but, as the report points out, incredibly it siphoned off into general revenue half of the $30 million saved in the widespread closure of beds in separate psychiatric hospitals. This is the conservative policy. This is what we expect out of a Howard government and this is what we know it will do. It does not care very much for people with mental illness, and we see that in Victoria. The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health further found that specialist mental health services are failing to provide any treatment for a staggering half of those Victorians with a serious mental illness. fuel You hear a few mutters on the other side, but if the members from Victoria making the little grunts over there were so concerned with what is happening in Victoria, then we would hear them in this House talking about the lies and deceit that occur in Victoria. We would hear them standing up for ordinary Victorians who are suffering so greatly under this uncaring and unsympathetic Liberal-National Party government. As I have pointed out, the reality is that, if the funding cuts keep going, it is only a question of time in Victoria before country public hospitals will close. We know that in Victoria you die waiting for an ambulance-unfortunately, a not uncommon occurrence now in Victoria. Unfortunately, it is all too common. Just ask Mrs Chong, whose husband died very recently. She was an intelligent, articulate woman, who knew her husband suffered from heart illness and heart disease. When he had a heart attack, she picked up the phone and she capsicum requested a MICA ambulance-a highly specialised group of people with defibrillators who can handle heart attacks. That is why these ambulances exist in Victoria. Mrs Chong knew what the problem of her husband was. She knew he had a heart attack; she knew he needed a MICA ambulance. But no MICA ambulance turned up. After some 20 minutes wait, a normal service arrived, and Mrs Chong said, 'I want a MICA ambulance.' It took another 20-odd minutes before a MICA ambulance turned up. Unfortunately, Mr Chong died. He died because of a Liberal-National Party government that does not care about people and that is slashing so deeply into the health budget in Victoria that it is now common practice for ordinary Victorians to die for lack of services. Mental health patients are ignored on the streets of Melbourne. One unfortunate lady was recently shot by the police because there was no service, no help and no assistance. But the government are not satisfied with the savage cuts they have already made. Each year in Victoria there is now a further 1.5 per cent efficiency dividend-that is what they call it, an efficiency dividend. That is Liberalevery National Party code for further cuts. So all of the services have to keep finding, up to the year 2000, an additional 1.5 per cent cut per annum. If the conservatives on the other side of the House are really concerned about lies and deceit, they should ask Jeffrey Kennett why in 1992 he did not tell the Victorian people what he intended to do to them. They should ask him what he intended to do to the public hospitals and to the mental health system. (Time expired) Breast Cancer",109
254,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"In the short time. I have left, I would like to advise the House that some time this week we are celebrating ABC Day, which is the Australian Breast Cancer Day. Breast cancer is a very serious issue amongst Australian women. It kills something like 2,500 Australian women a year, which equates to six per day, and it is the highest cause of death in women aged between 35 and 54. I have spoken on this issue many times since 1993. I was involved in the Lobby for Life group in 1994, which obtained about 100,000 Australian signatures to present to parliament asking for increased funding, and we saw the increase of funding in the 1994 budget. It is a very important issuesomething that we should reflect on this week. It is Australian Breast Cancer Day, ABC Day, and I urge all Australians to consider donating some money to research. I also urge all Australian women to be concerned about their own health, in particular breast cancer, and ask them to be very aware of their requirements to overcome any particular potential that they might have with breast cancer. I also reflect in the last 50 seconds I have that I spent some time with a hospice unit recently. I met a young lady of 35 years who was dying of cervical cancer. I implore women, not as a paternalistic person but as an Australian male-and I have recently had friends in my age group who have suffered from cervical cancer-to please seek pap smears as much as possible, even if it is only 12 months, because it is a very dangerous condition for women in their late 30s. I ask them to consider that and to seek pap smears as much as possible.",110

Visit of Mr Do Muoi (Question No. 2528) Mr Downer asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (1) Has the General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Mr Do Muoi, been invited to visit Australia; if so, (a) in what capacity has Muoi been invited to visit, (b) what cost the Commonwealth, (c) what is the purpose of the visit, (d) who will Mr Muoi meet in Australia, (e) will representatives of the Vietnamese community be able to meet Mr Muoi during the visit, (f) will he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs meet representatives of the Vietnamese community before the visit and (g) will consultative meetings be organised for Australian Government officials with representatives of the Vietnamese community NA as occurred before the visit of the Vietnamese Prime Minister in May 1993. (2) What sum has the Government spent on repatriation programs of Vietnamese refugees in South-East Asia.",110
256,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"This answer replaces the answer (Hansard, 20 September 1995, page 1430) previously supplied to the honourable member: The response to 1 (b) has been revised to reflect actual costs expended on the visit by all Commonwealth departments. The initial response provided to the honourable member was based on incomplete information. (1) I invited the General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Mr Do Muoi, to Australia when we met in Vietnam in April 1994. The General Secretary visited Australia from 29 July to 4 August 1995. (a) He was invited in his General Secretary capacity. He was given Head of Government status, commensurate with his stature in the Vietnamese political system and previous practice in this area. (b) The cost to the Commonwealth of the visit, based on advice from relevant departments, was $337,512. (c) The purpose of the visit was to continue the development of a partnership between Vietnam and Australia, based on shared interests in the region, substantial commercial ties, assistance in development, and growing people-topeople contacts. (d) During his visit, in addition to his meeting with me, the General Secretary met the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Premier of New South Wales, the Premier of Victoria, the Queensland Minister for Minerals and Energy, and senior members of the business community including representatives of Telstra, BHP, ANZ Bank, Transfield, Pacific Power, Dray tons and Queensland Alumina Limited. (e) Representatives of the Mr Vietnamese community did not seek a meeting with will the visit the General Secretary. (f) Before the General Secretary's arrival in Australia, I had a productive meeting with the leaders of the Vietnamese community to discuss the visit. (g) Consultations between the Vietnamese community and representatives of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs were held in Sydney and Melbourne before the visit. (2) Since 1989, Australia has provided $9.7 million towards the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-chinese refugees, including $1.5 million in 1994-5. These funds have assisted the UNHCR in the maintenance of asylum seekers in camps and their repatriation. Of the funds provided since 1989, $2 055 900 has been directly earmarked for the repatriation of screened-out Vietnamese asylum seekers. In 1994-95, $1 million was spent on the Vietnamese repatriation program. Department of Human Services and Health: Medically Qualified Consultants (Question No. 2530) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (1) Have (a) her Department, (b) the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) and (c) the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare engaged consultants since 1993 who are practising medical practitioners; if so, have the consultants had access to patient servicing or provider data held by the HIC. (2) What procedures or protocols are in effect to ensure that a practising practitioner does not obtain private advantage through access to data which may be related to other registered providers.",112
257,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The following amended answer replaces the answer (Hansard, 20 September 1995, page 1430), previously supplied to the honourable member: (l)(a) Yes, the Department of Human Services and Health provides data to consultants from time to time which can include people with medical qualifications. In some cases medical practitioners may be engaged individually. In other cases they may be part of a team. In some cases a large consultancy organisation may use medical practitioners incidentally. The Department does not know to what extent any of these medical practitioners are currently practising. Data provided to consultants may take two basic forms: aggregate data, where individual patient and provider details cannot be identified, and data which relates to individual providers or patients although patient data is usually deidentified. (b) Yes, the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) has engaged consultants since 1993 who are registered medical practitioners and such consultants do have access to patient servicing and provider data held by the HIC. (c) Yes, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has engaged consultants who are practising medical practitioners in the specified period but neither the Institute nor consultants employed by the Institute have access to patient servicing or provider data held by the HIC. (2)(a) Where consultants (and others, such as researchers) employed by the Department of Human Services and Health are provided with individual identifying data, the data is provided under the provisions of Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (or Section 135 of the National Health Act 1953 if the data is covered by that Act). As such, consultants are bound by the relevant secrecy provisions and they may only use the data for the purpose provided. The standard consultancy contract used by the Department also invests intellectual property with the Department and requires consultants to notify the Department if there is any risk of a conflict of interest in relation to the work being undertaken. (2)(b) The appointment of consultants by the HIC is made by resolution of the Commission and each consultant is required to enter into a formal contract with the HIC. This contract requires the consultant to give the following: (i) an acknowledgment that he or she understands the secrecy provisions in Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 and will not make use of such information otherwise than for the purpose of his/her duties under the Acts. (ii) an acknowledgment that all information will be protected against loss or unauthorised access. (iii) at the conclusion of each consultancy all information held by the consultant will be returned to the Department! Commission. (iv) an acknowledgment that he/she will advise of any conflict or risk of conflict of interest. The HIC is able to monitor computer access should the need arise. This is done in cases of suspected misuse of data. The HIC is also developing an artificial neural network to detect improper access to data. It is not clear what is meant by private advantage. To some extent any consultant (or researcher) may gain a potential saleable benefit from doing work which improves skill and knowledge and which demonstrates success. This is similar to a surgeon working for a public hospital who, through conducting operations and using the facilities of the hospital, may gain skills which contribute to the surgeon being able to earn private income in the future by treating private patients. This incidental commercial benefit from conducting consultancy work is a natural event. The potential use of insider trading type information from the Medicare Benefits database to improve the income of medical practitioner would appear to be limited. Published Medicare statistics already provide information such as bulk billing rates, fees charged and aggregate item use. UN Human Rights Instruments: (Question No. 2599) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 30 August 1995: (1) What are the texts of the reservations which were lodged by Australia in acceding to or ratifying UN human rights instruments and which are still in force. (2) When was each reservation last considered. (3) What progress has been made in (a) withdrawing or (b) modifying each reservation. (4) What states have become parties to UN human rights instruments since 1993 and when did each become a party.",113
258,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(2) and (3) The information is contained in National Action Plan Australia, published by the Australian Government Publishing Service Canberra and available for purchase at AGPS. In particular I refer the Honourable member to: part (c): Indicate human rights treaty reservations Australia intends to remove page 8 Appendix C: Australia's Reservations to International Human Rights Treaties The National Action Plan-1994 Progress Report includes the following comment in relation to part (c): ""c) Indicate human rights treaty reservations Australia intends to remove: (1) Attorney-General's Department: i) Reservation to Article 20 of the ICCPR and Article 4(a) of CERD: Legislation relating to racial hatred was passed by the House of Representatives on 16 November 1994 and is awaiting debate in the Senate, expected to take place in early 1995."" In order to take account of recent significant developments the paragraph should now read: In order to remove these reservations the Government introduced legislation relating to racial hatred. However, the criminal sanctions regarded as necessary for the removal of the reservations were removed by the Senate. The Government has announced its intentions to reintroduce criminal sanctions after the next elections. ""(2) The Office of the Status of Women: i) Maternity Leave: Australia currently has reservations to CEDAW (Article 11(2», regarding maternity leave. The Government has not removed the existing reservation given that full implementation would Reservations require the introduction of maternity leave with payor comparable social benefits throughout the country. Maternity leave with pay is provided for most women employed in NSW and to women employed under Federal, and some State, industrial awards. In the private sector maternity leave is usually granted without pay."" To take account of recent developments this paragraph should now read as follows: Australia currently has a reservation to CEDAW (Article 11(2)(b», regarding paid maternity leave. The Government is considering removal of the reservation. As part of the process State and Territory Governments are being consulted. ""In 1993 OSW convened a seminar on paid maternity leave with the National Women's Consultative Council to further stimulate debate on this issue. The seminar resulted in the release of a document titled Paid maternity Leave-a discussion paper on Paid Maternity Leave in Australia. ii) Australian Defence Forces: Australia has a reservation to CEDAWand Article III of the Convention on the Political Rights of Women (CPRW) in relation to service in the armed forces. In domestic legislation, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 has had, until recently, an exemption for women serving in combat and combat-related duties. In 1990 this was changed to exempt, Infantry, Armour, Artillery and Engineers in the Army. Further changes took place in 1992 and as a result 99% of positions in the Navy and Airforce and 87% of positions in the Army are now open to women."" To take account of recent developments this paragraph should now read as follows: Australia has a reservation to CEDA W and Article III of the Convention on the Political Rights of Women (CPRW) in relation to service in the armed forces. In domestic legislation, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 contains an exemption for women serving in combat and combat-related duties. The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995, which was passed in the House in June 1995, contains a proposal to narrow the exemption so that it only applies to women in positions involving combat duties. This will reflect changes in defence force policy. ""(3) Department of Industrial Relations: Government is committed to considering implementation of ILO 103 of [sic] Maternity Protection, which calls for at least 12 weeks of paid maternity leave for women in paid employment. Ratification would have obvious implications for the reservation to CEDAW. i) ILO 103 Maternity Protection (Revised), 1952 ILO 103 provides for cash and medical benefits while on maternity leave, and states that the employer shall not be liable for the cost of such benefits. Until recently, there were major impediments to compliance in Australia, in that most employees (except those in government employment who were covered by legislation) relied on the inclusion of maternity leave provisions in industrial awards for protection. Employees not covered by awards, or employees whose awards did not include maternity leave provisions, were not protected. There was no absolute prohibition on dismissal of a woman on maternity leave. Furthermore, women were not entitled to receive cash benefits while on maternity leave (although some, mostly public servants, were entitled to paid leave). The federal Industrial Relations Act 1988, as amended, now ensures maternity leave for all employees in Australia, as well as protection from dismissal. In addition, the Commonwealth Party Convention on the Rights of the Child Afghanistan Botswana Eritrea Gabon Georgia Haiti Iran Iraq Japan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Luxembourg Malaysia Mozambique Nauru Netherlands Palau Qatar Samoa Solomon Islands South Africa Turkey Anguilla Government recently announced that it intended to introduce cash payments for women on maternity leave in the 1995/96 budget. This will bring Australia closer to compliance with the Convention, but other impediments still exist which prevent Australia from ratifying: The Industrial Relations Act 1988 requires a 12 months period of continuous service with the same employer before a women becomes eligible for maternity leave, whereas the Convention does not make allowance for qualifying periods; Australia has no provision for paid 'nursing breaks'."" (4) I have addressed only the major human rights instruments: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Intemational Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

260,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA Since 8 June 1994, Australia has ratified three ILO Conventions. They are: C-69 Certification of Ships' Cooks, 1946 C. 73 Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946 C.166 Repatriation of Seafarers (Revised), 1987. The ratification of all three was registered with the ILO in Geneva on the same day, 29 August 1995. Similar advice has been provided in answer to Mr Latham's Question No. 2606 (part 4) on 18 September 1995. FEDERAL-STATE CONSULTATIONS My response to Question No. 1336 in October 1994 listed 25 unratified ILO Conventions appropriate for action by the States and Territories which is). had been endorsed by the Labour Ministers' Council (LMC) as ""suitable"" targets for ratification. That list included two Conventions which have subsequently been ratified (ie Nos. 69 and 73). In May 1995, LMC endorsed a further three Conventions as suitable targets for ratification, appropriate for consideration by the Commonwealth-State consultative machinery on ILO matters. They are: C.97 Migration for Employment (Revised), 1949 C.174 Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents, 1993 C.175 Part-time Work, 1994. LMC also agreed that priority be given to providing fonnal agreement to ratification of three human rights Conventions and a further three occupational health and safety Conventions. They are: C.97 Migration for Employment (Revised), 1949 C.141 Rural Workers' Organisations, 1975 C.143 Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions), 1975 (Part II only) C.148 Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration), 1977 (in relation to noise only) C.155 Occupational Safety and Health, 1981 C.167 Safety and Health in Construction, 1988. The status of three unratified Conventions is still in the process of being detennined, namely: C.138 Minimum Age, 1973 C.169 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989 C.176 Safety and Health in Mines, 1995. Consultations concerning ""suitable"" Conventions takes place regularly within the Commonwealth State consultative machinery on ILO matters. The process is described at pages 20-25 of the Department of Industrial Relations publication Status of ILO Conventions in Australia 1994, which was tabled in the Parliament on 23 August 1995 (and debated in the Main Committee of the House of Representatives on 30 August 1995). REPORTS TO THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL Article 19 Reports In accordance with Article 19 of the ILO Constitution, Member States are required to infonn the Director-General of the ILO about action taken with respect to new international labour standards within 12 months of their adoption by the International Labour Conference (or within 18 months in the case of federal Member States, such as AustralSince October 1994, Australia has forwarded two such Article 19 reports to the ILO: Convention No 174, Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents, 1993 (tabled in the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994 and the Senate on 31 January 1995); and Convention No 175 and Recommendation No 182, Part-time Work, 1994 (tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 7 June 1995). Article 19 of the ILO Constitution requires Member States to provide reports on unratified Conventions and Recommendations, as may be required by the ILO's Governing Body. Since October 1994, Australia has provided one such report to the ILO, addressing Recommendation No 166, Tennination of Employment, 1982. Article 22 Reports In accordance with Article 22 of the ILO Constitution, Australia reported to the Director-General in 1994 on the effect given to the following Conventions which Australia has ratified: C.8 Unemployment Indemnity (Shipwreck), 1920 C.Il Right of Association (Agriculture), 1921 e.22 Seamen's Articles of Agreement, 1926 e.58 Minimum Age (Sea), 1936 e.87 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, 1948 C.I05 Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957 C.III Discrimination (Employment and Occupation), 1958 e.122 Employment Policy, 1964 C.144 Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards), 1976 e.150 Labour Administration, 1978. Due to a change in timing of requests for Article 22 reports, Australia has also forwarded its 1995 reports to the ILO. They included First Reports for the following four Conventions: e.92 Accommodation of Crews (Revised), 1949 C.l33 Accommodation of Crews (Supplementary Provisions), 1970 e.l35 Workers' Representatives, 1971 e.158 Termination of Employment, 1982.

Not all reports were complete, as contributions were not received in time from several jurisdictions. Reports provided by the Norfolk Island Government on the implementation of Conventions 11,87, 98, 105, 122, 142 and 160 were also forwarded to the ILO during 1994 and 1995. NA CONFERENCE, CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ADOPTED, AND AUSTRALIAN NA Since 11 October 1994 one session of the tripartite International Labour Conference (the 82nd Session) has been held.

NA NA Question No. 287 identified three ILO Conventions, and asked what progress had been made in ratifying them. Convention No 169, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989 The process of ascertaining indigenous views on ratification of ILO Convention 169, plus the views of the States and Territories and the social partners is progressing. The completion of the report on compliance in law and practice with the Convention at Commonwealth level was interrupted by the Western Australian High Court challenge to the Native Title Act 1993. The draft report is now being finalised, and an agreed Commonwealth report should be completed by end October 1995. Completion of the report will facilitate the States and Territories and the ACTU and ACCI in consulting indigenous groups in establishing their respective positions on ratification. In respect of indigenous consultations, information dissemination and consultation with indigenous organisations and communities is underway. In this context, my Department will convene a small working group of officials from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to prepare and disseminate relevant information on the Convention to indigenous' organisations and communities. Convention No 151, Labour Relations (Public Service), 1978 All governments, except New South Wales, have formally agreed to ratification, although several jurisdictions have indicated that they wish to review their position because of new or pending legislation. The Convention has been identified as an appropriate target for ratification by the Labour Ministers' Council, the ILO Ratification Task Force and the tripartite National Labour Consultative Council. Australia's 1994 National Action Plan on human rights identified the Convention as one whose ratification would be actively pursued. The ratification prospects of the Convention are currently under consideration in the light of recent advice from the ILO following questions raised by New South Wales on the conformity of its legislation with the provisions of the Convention. Convention No 155, Occupational Safety and Health, 1981 As indicated in my response to Mr Latham's Question No. 2382 (part 3) on 31 May 1995, the Northern Territory formally agreed to ratification in May 1995. All jurisdictions, except New South Wales and Tasmania have now formally agreed to ratification. The New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations has consulted with the Workcover Authority with a view to achieving compliance with the Convention. A submission is currently being prepared for consideration by the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations in order to further progress the matter. Tasmania has identified two relatively minor compliance problems, which are expected to be overcome when the Workplace Health and Safety Bill 1995 is passed into legislation.",118
