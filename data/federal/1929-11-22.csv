I have also noticed, however, that it has been stated that the Federated Engine Drivers are prepared to give every support to the Commonwealth Government in its efforts to end the dispute which now exists. That decision is very satisfactory. NA COMMUNICATIONS.",12

9,Mr FENTON,TASMANIAN,"In my brief introductory speech last night I intimated that practically all the information for which the honourable member now asks would be available when the schedule which I then tabled came up for discussion in committee. I understand that, in reply to a question asked of him on the adjournment last night, the Prime Minister made a similar promise. Mr J. FRANCIS - Will the Minister for Trade and Customs be good enough to lay on the table of the House the reports of the Tariff Board concerning all the matters dealt with by the tariff schedule which he tabled last night?",12
10,Mr FENTON,TASMANIAN,All the information that is essential for the proper consideration of the tariff schedule will be made available to honourable members.,12
11,Mr FRANCIS,TASMANIAN,When ?,12
12,Mr FENTON,TASMANIAN,"I promise that a considerable volume of that information will be available next week.

NA FRANKLIN . NA GOVEUNMENT MEMBEBS.",12
13,Mr CUSACK,SEATING ACCOMMODATION VOU,"Is it a fact, Mr. Speaker, that you have issued a writ for the election of a member' to fill the vacancy that now exists in the Division of Franklin? If so, in view of the likelihood of the ranks of Government members being further strengthened, and the fact that their accommodation in the chamber is alrendy overcrowded, will you, sir, take steps to have three seats transferred from the Opposition Bide to this side of the House?",12
14,Mr SPEAKER,SEATING ACCOMMODATION VOU,"I have already intimated to the House that I have caused a writ t'o be issued for the election of a member to represent the Division of Franklin, I can assure the honourable member that I shall make whatever provision may be uecessary for the comfort and convenience of honourable members. NA TREASURY BILLS.",12
15,Mr YATES,ISSUE OF COMMONWEALTH,"Yesterday I asked the Treasurer a question with the object of ascertaining whether the total amount sought to be borrowed by the Commonwealth was £10,000,000 or £15,000,000. The honourable gentleman replied that treasury bills were being issued in London with a currency of about seven months, to tide over a period of temporary stringency on the London market pending the raising of a further loan in Great Britain. That was not in any sense a reply to my question, but merely implied that there was to be further borrowing. I again ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that the £5,000,000 which the Government is raising in Great Britain by the issue of short-dated treasury-bills is in addition to the £10,000,000 that is being raised in Australia?",13
16,Mr THEODORE,ISSUE OF COMMONWEALTH,"The action of the Government does not, in the sense implied by the honourable member, indicate increased borrowing. A loan of £10,000,000 has been placed upon the Australian market. The £5,000,000 to be raised by the issue of treasury-bills on the London market will be used to the full extent in reducing current overdrafts in London.",13
17,Mr YATES,ISSUE OF COMMONWEALTH,It is borrowing.,13
18,Mr THEODORE,ISSUE OF COMMONWEALTH,"So , too, is the increasing of an overdraft a borrowing. I do not wish the honourable member to be under any misapprehension. The Government has decided to issue treasury bills, but the whole of the net proceeds will be used to reduce overdrafts existing in London. FUTURE OF TARIFF BOARD.",13
19,Mr GREGORY,ISSUE OF COMMONWEALTH,"The Tariff Board Act enacts that the Minister shall refer to the Board, for inquiry and report, certain matters, including "" the necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties,"" also that he "" shall not take any action respect of any of those matters until has received the report of the Board."" Has the Minister for Trade and Customs received reports from the Tariff Board respecting the numerous increases in greater expedition. m duties that are proposed by the Tariff Schedule which he tabled last night? If he has not, can his action be taken to indicate that he proposes to abolish the Board and repeal the act?",13
20,Mr FENTON,ISSUE OF COMMONWEALTH,"I can assure the honourable member for Swan that the Tariff Schedule has been introduced in accordance with the act. The abolition of the Tariff Board or the amendment or repeal of the Tariff Board Act has not, so far, been considered by the Government. NA CONFERENCE.",13
21,Mr WATKINS,PEACE IN INDUSTRY,"When the Prime Minister is dealing with the appointment of delegates to the Peace in Industry Conference will he consider the advisability of giving representation to the trade union movement in Newcastle, through its Trades Hall Council?",13
22,Mr SCULLIN,PEACE IN INDUSTRY,"The subject of representation at the Conference will be given full consideration, and we shall endeavour, to ensure that the delegates appointed will be truly representative of the employers on the one side and the trade unions on the other. FERTILIZERS. TARIFF BOARD REPORT. MI-. BELL - Yesterday the Minister for Trade and Customs informed the honourable member for Swan that the report of the Tariff Board upon the supplies and price of fertilizers had not yet been received. Is it possible for him to expedite the presentation of that report so that it may be available to honourable members at an early date?",13
23,Mr FENTON,PEACE IN INDUSTRY,"I shall endeavour to comply with the request of the honourable member. The Tariff Board is a law unto itself, and unfortunately it has recently in been engaged in considering what might he - be termed extraneous matters, and has thus been precluded from considering many other important matters that otherwise would have been investigated with DIVISIONAL RETURNING will OFFICERS. EXTRA REMUNEBATION. Mr E. RILEY - Will the Treasurer consider favourably the advisability of compensating Divisional Returning Officers for the additional work they were called upon to do during the recent election campaign?",13
24,Mr THEODORE,PEACE IN INDUSTRY,"I am not quite sure that the matter is one for my consideration, but I can promise the honourable member that it will be considered. NA THE STATES.  that payments are still being made to the States under the Financial Agreeunemployment ment, and that the Budget makes no reference to any proposal to alter that system, can it be assumed that it is intended to revert to the system of per cajrita payments, as the Prime Minister indicated in his policy speech would done if the Labour party were returned to power?",14
25,Mr SCULLIN,F INANCI AL AGREEMENT WITH,"The policy speech to which the honourable member refers was that delivered by me in 1928, and in it I cerned ? promised that if a Labour Government were returned to power we would restore the per capita payments to the States. Since then, however, Parliament has authleave orized the making of an agreement on this matter between the Commonwealth and the States. This agreement has been duly signed and ratified, and can only altered by the unanimous consent of parties. The financial relations between the Commonwealth and. the States, and member. the agreement entered into between them will, when opportunity arises, be further discussed between representatives of the State and of the Commonwealth Governments.

27,Mr BLAKELEY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,"Unemployment and the maintenance of the unemployed in the various territories of the Commonwealth has received the very careful con-' sideration of this Government since it has been in office. It has not been possible to start relief work in the Northern Territory owing to the prevailing financial stringency, but I have given instructions that no one shall go hungry, and that any unemployed resident of the Northern Territory who desires to come south shall have his fare paid.",14
28,Mr NELSON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,"Seeing that extensive exists in all the States in Australia will the Minister for Home Affairs reconsider his decision to deport not the unemployed from North Australia, and so avoid placing them on the already congested labour markets of the Southern be States? Instead of providing fares and .freights for the Burns Philp Shipping Company by bringing these men away from North Australia, will he divert the money into reproductive channels there and so find employment for the men con",14
29,Mr BLAKELEY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,"No person will be ""deported"" from Port Darwin. Those who will do so voluntarily. The amount that will be spent in fares to bring these unemployed persons south will be only £21 each, and the total stun involved will be be so small that it could not be applied the to the setting out of any reproductive works, as suggested by the honourable NA PROGRAMMES.",14
30,Mr THOMPSON,RADIO BROADCASTING,"Is the Postmaster-General aware that the controllers of the' National Broadcasting System are dissatisfied with their share of the revenue received from the licensing fees paid by listeners-in, and make that an excuse for the poorness of the broadthe cast programmes now being offered to the public? Has the Minister been in communication with, the controllers on this matter, and if not will he"" get into touch with them in au endeavour to have broadcasting programmes improved ?",14
31,Mr LYONS,RADIO BROADCASTING,"The subject of programmes and broadcasting control is under review at the present time. If dissatisfaction exists on either hand, or programmes are not as good as they ought to be, the responsibility is not ours, it is the result of action taken by our predecessors in office.",15
32,Mr LATHAM,RADIO BROADCASTING,Is it not a fact that one of the conditions of the agreement with the broadcasting company is that programmes must be provided to the satisfaction of the Postmaster-General?,15
33,Mr LYONS,RADIO BROADCASTING,"That is so, but the question raised by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) was whether I knew that the. controllers of broadcasting were dissatisfied with the existing allocation of revenue, and were advancing that as a reason for the poorness of broadcast programmes. SALE OF SANATOGEN.",15
34,Mr LACEY,RADIO BROADCASTING,"Is the Minister for Health aware that an invalid food known as Sanatogen is prohibited by regulation from being sold in general stores in South Australia and is obtainable only in chemists' shops?

35,Mr ANSTEY,RADIO BROADCASTING,"Naturall y I am fully aware of the position in regard to this inatter, or I should not be occupying my present position. I can assure the honourable member that I . shall give the subject my earnest consideration. UNEMPLOYMENT. PAYMENT OF FARES.",15
36,Mr GULLETT,RADIO BROADCASTING,"In view of the statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs that the Government is prepared to pay the fares of unemployed persons in the Northern Territory who wish to come South, will he inform the House whether the Government will extend this concession to other unemployed in any other part of Australia who may wish to travel in search of work? If not, why not ?",15
37,Mr BLAKELEY,RADIO BROADCASTING,"The circumstances surrounding the problem of unemployment in the Northern Territory are peculiar to that area, and are the if direct result of the action of the previous Government, which put a works policy into operation and then failed to carry it out. After inducing hundreds of unfortunate men to travel to the north, they suddenly closed down the works; hence the want and distress of a great many families in Darwin, and the obligation upon this Government to afford them some relief. As to whether the principle of free fares for unemployed is to be adopted throughout the whole of Australia, the answer 19 "" No."" TREASURY-BILLS IN LONDON.",15
38,Mr YATES,RADIO BROADCASTING,"In regard to the seven months' treasury-bills for £5,000,000 which are being negotiated in London, will the Treasurer inform the House whether Australia is borrowing to pay her debts, and is it not a fact that goods have already been received in respect-of the overdrafts which these bills are being issued to reduce? Are there standing against Australia other overdrafts which will have to be met in a like manner?",15
39,Mr THEODORE,RADIO BROADCASTING,"There are certain overdrafts in London which tend to increase as further drafts are made on banks by the respective governments responsible. The drafts are made for payments in London, chiefly in regard to interest falling due, and for goods bought on Government account. The overdrafts tend to increase in proportion to the need for funds in London, and to the extent that ""we are unable to transmit money to England. This issue of treasury-bills is to provide for Australia's immediate requirements pending the raising of a loan. CONTROL OF AERODROMES.",15
40,Mr THOMPSON,RADIO BROADCASTING,"Can the Minister for Defence inform the House whether the Defence Department has any control over landing grounds used for civil aviation purposes in Australia? If the Department has no such control, will the Minister communicate with the proper State authorities with a view to ensuring that the grounds are properly looked after and kept free from such obstacles as straying stock? By way of explanation, let me remind honourable members that as recently as last Saturday the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley), when making an aerial trip to Roma in a New South Wales Airways' machine, very nearly met with a serious accident because of straying stock on the landing ground at Tamworth.

42,Mr FENTON,RADIO BROADCASTING,"It is not possible to divulge beforehand anything of the Government's decisions in regard to tariff alterations. I may say, however, in regard to cotton bounties generally, that not only has provision been made in the present Tariff Schedule for granting assistance, but a very close investigation has been instituted with a view to putting the cotton industry on a thoroughly sound basis in all its branches.

ARBITRATION (PUBLIC SERVICE ) BILL (No . 2) 1929. Motion (by Mr BKENNA N) agreed toThat he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Arbitration (Public Service) - Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND READING. *",20
82,Mr BRENNAN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Batman-Attorney General) [11.51] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. I am indebted to the House for enabling me to move the second reading of this which is in the nature of a temporary machinery bill for the purpose of continuing arbitration in the Public SerJ. vice under exceptional circumstances, until Guy the Government has had an opportunity to formulate its policy,* possibly as to arbitration generally, and at all events, as to arbitration in the Public Service. It will be remembered that in the last Parliament a bill was introduced in another of place for the purpose of radically altering, if not revolutionising, the practice of in the service as it had been I good reason to believe that the proposals in that bill by no means commended themselves to the Public Service as a whole, and I venture to express the opinion that the result of the recent election) which was fought mainly, though not solely, on the issue of arbitration, the goes to show that the policy of the the late Government in this matter was Mr not more popular with the general public the than with the members of the Publio Service themselves. The Arbitration Public Service Act of 1920 provided for the appointment of a Public Service Arbitrator for a period of seven years, and following on the passing of that act an appointMr ment was made as arbitrator of Mr . Nairn, Atlee Hunt, a gentleman who, over a long period of years, has rendered valuable service to the community. He was appointed in February, 1921, and it was provided that his appointment should Dr take effect from the date of his commencing duties. As that appoint ment expired in 1928, the Government of the day thought fit to introduce a measure that enabled him to be re-appointed for a period that would expire on his attaining the age of 65 years. Mr Hunt attained that age on the 7th November of the present year, but by reason, no doubt, of the fact that the policy of the late Government was entirely different from that of the present administration, no provision was made for the appointment of a successor upon the termination of his period of office. Mr Hunt having already attained the age of 65 years, and this Government not yet having had reasonable opportunity, I think it will be generally conceded, to obtain all the necessary information and guidance from proper sources as to new legislation, it is imperative now to make provision for the carrying on of the office until a decision has been reached by the Government, and later by the House, on the general subject of Public Service arbitration. In the meantime, in order that the Public Service may not be without an arbitrator, and that the court may continue to operate, it is proposed to extend Mr Hunt's term of office for a brief period, namely, until the 30th September, 1930. I do not know how far Mr Hunt, in the meantime, may think fit to enter upon the consideration of fresh cases, but I am. a ware that that gentleman has before him at present certain matters in respect of which a final decision has not yet been given, and that, naturally, a little time is required to conclude those cases that have been heard before him, and in a general way to terminate the work of the office so far as he personally is concerned. This extension will allow the present arbitrator to complete the investigations upon which he is engaged, and enable the Government to take action either to make a re-appointment on similar lines or to institute a new scheme of arbitration. The Government, as honourable members are well aware, is committed to a policy of arbitration, both in regard to the Public Service and generally. The bill will effect no vital changes, and in the meantime the Government will have full opportunity to adumbrate its new policy, and, if possible, will present it early in the forthcoming year. It is ilr. UrcHiinn. improbable that Mr Atlee Hunt will, during his extended term, take up any new cases. Debate (on motion by Mr LATHAM ) adjourned. AUSTRALIAN MILITARY PORCES : PAPER.",21

Bill brought up by Mr THEODORE, and SECOND READING.",25
97,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [12.18] - by leave- I move That the bill now be read a second time. application of South Australia to the Commonwealth for financial assistance on account of the special disabilities under which it claims to be labouring as a consequence of federation, was under consideration of the previous Government, and for the first time a grant to items that State is now proposed. The State Government applied for an annual grant an of £750,000, because of the adverse conof ifs finances during the last two or three years. An examination of the finances of the State during the last years gives this result:1024-25 .. . . 53,001 . . 1925-20 13,151 . . 1020-27 192728 192829 .. 1929-30 (estimated) The estimate for the current financial year does not take into account the posed Commonwealth grant. These relation curring and increasing deficits reveal alarming situation. The last Government appointed a royal commission to report on the financial disabilities, if any, affected South Australia as a federation, and to recommend what steps should be taken by the Commonwealth the State to remedy the existing state affairs. The disabilities of the State o were alleged to extend over a wide range, and to include the adverse operation the Customs Tariff and certain Commona wealth laws, the Murray River Waters Agreement, and other factors. The royal commission reported, inter alia, that it is apparent that the present unsatisfacNationalist tory financial position has gradually evolved over a series of years, and that the serious deficits in the last two years are due chiefly to losses ou the railways, and on works of a developmental character. Whether that statement fully explains causes of the recurring deficits in Australia or not, the fact remains that heavy losses have been sustained on the operation of the railways. In the first thirteen years of federation the railways earned surpluses, but in those affluent years no provision was made for depreciation. In recent years the railsettle ways have sustained heavy losses, and the two years 1926-27 and 1927-28 these losses totalled £2,070,000. In the last five years £11,000,000 has been position of the State. spent on the rehabilitation the system, and in consequence, the annual interest charges increased £526,000. The principal increases in expenditure during the last nine years have been-railways, £12,262,000; velopmental, £11,497,000; loans and securities, £12,946,000. The royal mission questioned thp wisdom of the developmental expenditure which in last nine years exceeded by £2,000,000 Mr Theodore. five developmental expenditure during the whole previous history of the State. Surplus. Deficit. Special mention was made of the cost of £ £ soldier land settlement. This subject has since been dealt with in the report of Mr Justice Pike and is being treated by 1,050.049 274,931 the Government separately in the manner 038,8.18 indicated in my Budget Speech. South .. 1,193,757 Australia's public debt has increased 116 per cent, during the last nine years, prorising from £91 0s. 3d. per head of popuin 1919 to £159 12s. 5d. in 1928. an The average increase in all States during the same period was 82 per cent. The greater portion of that increase in South which Australia occurred while a Nationalist result of government was in office.",25
98,Mr HAWKER,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,But the highest rate of or loan expenditure per annum was during of the regime of a Labour Government.,26
99,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The fact remains that the greatest aggregate expenditure in of any two years was during the regime of Nationalist government. The heavy expenditure that was incurred by the Gunn Government was the result of commitments entered into by previous governments, especially upon the rehabilitation of the railways. Perhaps it is unwise to introduce State party politics into the consideration of this matter. We have to decide whether the proposed grant to South Australia is the warranted having regard to the interests South of the Commonwealth as a whole. Undoubtedly, that State has suffered some disabilities .as a result of federation, and if the financial assistance proposed to be rendered by the Commonwealth is justified, this Parliament should give it at once, and allow the South Australian people to their own domestic political diffor ferences. I merely mentioned certain facts regarding loan expenditure in order to throw additional light on the financial Public debt, of charges, such as interest and sinking fund, are equivalent to 37 per cent, of by the expenditure from consolidated loan revenue, a larger percentage than in most, of the other States. During the last defourteen years the public debt charges have increased by 242 per cent., while comother charges against consolidated huge revenue have increased by approximately the 120 per cent. The royal commission rethe commended a special grant of £500,000 per annum for two years and a modification of the conditions of the Federal Aid Roads contribution in favour of South Australia. It also recommended that its finding should be reviewed in the light of(a) any reduction of loan indebtedness in respect of soldier land ment, as a result of Mr Justice Pike. (6) any variation of the Murray River Waters Scheme; and (o) any concession in connection with the Federal Aid Roads Agreement. The royal commission stated that an exact calculation of the monetary disabilities under which South Australia was suffering was impracticable, but it expressed the opinion that South Australia was worthy of sympathetic treatment such us had been extended to Western Australia and Tasmania. The last Commonwealth Government, after considering the report of the royal commission, proposed to make a grant of £1,000,000 to be spread over three years instead of two years as recommended by the commission. In the first year there was to be an unconditional cash payment of £300,000, and South Australia was to transfer to the Commonwealth the control of the Red Hill to Salisbury railway. According to the last Treasurer, the State would thus be relieved of an annual liability in respect of interest and sinking fund amounting to £60,000. The Government of South Australia objected to the condition governing that £60,000, and the present Commonwealth Government having carefully reviewed the position, considers that insistence upon that condition would be unwise. An amount of £360,000 has been made available as a grant in this year's Estimates, and in each of the next two years an amount of £320,000 will be made available, the total sum given thus being £1,000,000, spread over a period of three years. From some remarks that were made by the Premier of South Australia. I understand that his government objected to the conditions that were attached to £60,000 of the amount that the previous Commonwealth Government proposed to make available, nnd would have resisted those conditions strenuously had they been persisted with.",26
100,Mr BAYLEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Did the South Australian Government make any counter proposal ?,27
101,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Not so far as I am aware. According to the knowledge that I have of the matter, their protest was against the proposal of the late settleGovernment with respect to the Salisbury the report of to Port Augusta railway.",27
102,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,And they desired to have the total grant made available within a period of two years.,27
103,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"They desired that the recommendation of the commission should be carried out fully, that was, for the grant of £1,000,000, the payments to be spread over a period of two years.",27
104,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Hav e they departed from their request in that respect?,27
105,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"They have renewed their representations to the Commonwealth. I saw the Premier of South Australia in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago, and he asked what our intentions were. I gave him an indication of what action we might take, and, so far as' I know, he was content with our proposal. Mr M . CAMERON - He budgeted in anticipation.",27
106,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"He budgeted in the hope that he would get £500,000 this year. Mr MCTIERNAN.:-How does the rate of taxation in South Australia compare with that of the other States?",27
107,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I have not the figures that would enable me to make a comparison, but it can be said that the. rate of direct taxation in South Australia is as high as that in any State. When considering whether the grant provided for by the bill is as generous as that recommended by the royal commission, it must be borne in mind that the royal commission made reference to other benefits that South Australia might obtain in connection with the reduction of its loan indebtedness with respect to soldier land settlement, possible re-adjustments in connection with the River Murray Waters scheme, and a concession under the Federal Aid Roads agreement.. Mr. Justice Pike has made certain recommendations, and South Australia will gain a proportionate advantage with the other States of the Commonwealth under that proposal. At the present time 1 do not know of any proposed variation of the River Murray Waters agreement, so that I am unable to say whether South Australia is likely to derive any advantage in that direction.",27
108,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Accordin g to the budget statement, an additional £25,000 is being prqvided in connection River Murray Waters scheme. Was that the result of consultation with the States ? adjourned.",28
109,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"We have made Sitting provision for an additional £25,000 to meet a possible contingency. cation was made by, I think, the constructing authority-the commission-for £100,000 in addition to the amount proreported. vided on the loan programme. I consulted the Loan Council and advised members of the contracting States that the Commonwealth Government was prepared to bear its share of the additional £100,000 if the provision of that sum of That were approved, but proposed that the amount should be saved in some direction so that the total loan programme for the year would not be exceeded. adopted. Therefore the amount of £25,000 has been placed upon the loan estimates for this year. Whether it will be needed or not depends upon whether the other ing parties make similar provision. That has not yet been arranged, subject of correspondence at the present time. This is not an appropriate time to discuss the Federal Aid Roads agreement; but I believe that it will for review shortly. The Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) may call a conference of the Commonwealth and State authorities to discuss the reconstruction of that agree to ment and the making of, perhaps, more adequate provision. If the matter is cussed, the result may be to benefit South Australia still further, in common with the other States. The commission recompresume mended that the grant should be reviewed in the light of the three factors previously mentioned. Under the recommendations of Mr Justice Pike, South Australia's soldier settlement debt would be deproposals creased by an amount of £804,988, its yearly interest bill by an amount over £40,000. It must be borne in that that assistance is in addition to the total grant of £1,000,000.",28

An of agreement was entered into by the Commind monwealth Government with those of New South Wales and Queensland for the construction of this railway. The perwork is under the control of a railway council, consisting of the Commissioner of Railways for the Commonwealth as chairman, and the Chief Railways Comexplain missioners of Queensland and Wales. A portion of the work was done by day labour, and the is being done by contractors, who sible are the Railways Commissioners for Queensland and New South Wales. The dum, Chief Commissioner in New South Wales is the contractor for that section f r Kyogle to the Queensland border, while die Queensland Railways Commissioner is contractor for the section from border to South Brisbane. Uuder terms of the contract provision is made for the payment of greater than the stipulated amount to the contractors the event of certain conditions arising which would make for increased costs. It is set out in a memorandum submitted to me by the railway council that the additional amount asked for, and the expenditure which this bill proposes authorize, is £350,000, bringing the total authorization up to £4,350,000. A sumthe mary of the principal causes of increase, and the amount of the increases, is as follows:Increased rates of wages and other improved industrial conditions . . 122,000 Increase due to advance in prices of materials, &c, due to general increase in wages in New South Wales and Queensland Increased cost of permanent-way material due under the contracts to to he supplied by the Railway Council .. .. Cost to council on account of closing down works due to curtailment of funds by the Commonwealth Treasurer .. Extra cost of land resumptions in both Queensland and New South Wales .. .. I'lxtra cost of surveys in both New South Wales and Queensland . . 11,400 Additional quantities to those provided in the schedule of quantities in the contract specification, and added works on the contract and day-labour sections Total The difference between the sum of deal. £433,300 excess expenditure, and the £350,000 additional money asked for this bill will be saved by economies effected in carrying out the work.",28
114,Mr R GREEN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Will the Treasurer how the additional amounts reNew South quired are arrived at?,29
115,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The improvebalance ments in industrial conditions are responf or an increase of £164,000. Although it is not stated in the memoranI take it that in every case higher rates of pay have been brought about as a o m result of the making of new awards or the variation of old ones. Under the conditions of contract with the Governments of the New South Wales and Queensland, provithe sion was made for an adjustment for or against the contractor in the event, during the currency of the contract, of in an increase or decrease in wages or a decrease or increase in hours of work as fixed by an award of the Arbitration Court or other industrial tribunal approved by the council. When the estimate of £4,000,000 was prepared, a sum was included to meet improved industrial to conditions, but it was thought that, generally, these conditions had reached peak, and if there was any change during the currency of the contract it would be in .a downward direction. In stead of that, however, wages are still increasing, and industrial conditions are £ being improved. On the New South Wales contract section alone it was estimated by the railway council that no less than £88,000 extra would have to be 42,100 paid under the arrangement referred to, but it is now found that this figure will be largely exceeded, and a sum considerably beyond £122,000 will be expended on this 14,400 account. Also, there was a large number of land resumptions in both States, but especially in Queensland, near South 20,600 Brisbane, and it must be obvious that it was practically impossible accurately 31,000 to estimate what the cost of those resumptions would be.",29
116,Mr R GREEN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The land-holders above Kyogle did not get a very great share of the money paid for resumptions. 190,000",29
117,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I presume that .. £433,300 they were treated justly.",29
118,Mr R GREEN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,They did not get a fair,29
119,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The railway in council dealt with that aspect of the matter, and I am sure, would treat them fair l y . The resumptions were - effected under the State,act dealing with - rhe resumption of land for public purposes. The cost of surveys can only be estimated approximately. In this case there was considerable difficulty in locating the route of the railway, and the expenditure was considerably beyond that provided in the estimates. As regards the sum of £190,900 for additional quantities to those provided in the schedule of quantities in the contract specification, the - conditions of contract provide for payment on a quantity basis according to measurement at the rate shown in the schedule of quantities and the prices of the tender, and the total amount of the contract increased or decreased according to the actual measurements of the earthworks, brick foundations, &c, required to be undertaken- The railway passes through mountainous and broken country where there is a very heavy rainfall, and on account of landslides, considerable quantities of earth works had to be undertaken beyond the estimated amount on which tenders were called. Additional bridges had to be provided on account of landslides, &c, and excavations for foundations of bridges, concrete works, &c, proved to be more expensive than the estimate provided for. It was also necessary to provide for watering stations, trucking facilities, &c, beyond those provided for on the estimates. The works on the contract section in Queensland are just about completed, but it will be some months before the works in New South Wales are in readiness, the delay on that section being due primarily to the difficulty in getting through a very long tunnel at the border. This work took longer than was expected, despite the fact that work was proceeding simultaneously at both ends. The bridge over the Clarence river will not be completed, I believe, for some time yet.",29
120,Mr MARTENS,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,There will be a lot of work to be done even after that.,30
121,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I believe that the trains will be able to run over the line even before the bridge is finished, to that purpose? arrangements being made to convey vehicles across the river by means of punts. Of course, even after the trains are running, much work will to be done in the way of ballasting, &c. The secretary of the railway states that present indications are that the work will be finished within the estimate of £4,350,000, although, as the contract is on the quantity basis, according to measurements, &c, and as under the contract agreements, the council is liable to pay for increased rates of wages and otlier improved industrial conditions, there is a likelihood that the sum now asked for may be exceeded; but should there be an excess the amount will not bilarge. Mr J. FRANCIS - Ca u the Treasurer inform the House what portion of thiadditional appropriation is to go to Queensland, and what portion to New South Wales?",30
122,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I cannot give thai information offhand, but the proportion* are set out in the agreement which provides that the apportionment shall be in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Unified Railway Gauges. The State quotas were settled on that basis, but because some of the States which would have been contracting parties under the scheme were not willing to come in on the first stage of the work, the Commonwealth Government agreed to bear that portion of the expense which normally would fall upon Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Mr J. FRANCIS - Whn t proportion of this amount will be credited to Queensland, and what proportion to New South Wales?",30
123,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I cannot give the honourable member much information on that point. I understand that the work in Queensland is almost completed to the New South Wales border, so that probably only a small proportion of the money will go to Queensland. Mr J. FRANCIS - I should like to know how Queensland is to be reimbursed for loss she has incurred under the contract. Will any of this money be applied",30

[2.34] - On the first item in these Estimates, which provides £3,274 for alteraproviding tions and additions to the ventilation cooling plant of Parliament House, it may meet the convenience of honourable members if I say that the figures that now before them have been altered in venient arrangements. only one particular from those submitted by the Treasurer of the previous Government. That alteration is in the proposed vote for the Department of Trade and Customs. I am informed that a building for shelter is required on the waterfront at Fremantle. For some reason, probably through inadvertence, no amount was - provided for this urgent work in the Estimates prepared by the previous Treasurer. There has not been much time to revise the Estimates careout fully, as honourable members will realise. I understand that the previous Speaker and the President of .the Senate strongly recommended that alterations and addiing. tions to the ventilation and cooling plant of this House should be put in haud with- has out delay.",31
127,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Kooyong) [2.35] - All honourable members are aware that in some respects the accommodation in liament House is inadequate. I have found in the short time that I have cupied the position of Leader of the position, that insufficient accommodation is available to enable certain officers do their work properly. As the Prime Minister will realise, he having recently been Leader of the Opposition, the room set apart for my use is also used by secretary to the - Leader of the Opposiis tion, who operates a typewriter in it. feel sure that I shall have the sympathy the Prime Minister in asking that a provision be made for separate accommodation for the Secretary to the Leader I of the Opposition in a conveniently situated room. It will be appreciated that this is hardly a personal matter. It frequently happens that honourable members desire to consult the Leader or Deputy Leader of the Opposition on important matters, and they should be able to do so in proper circumstances. I would be very grateful if the Government, probably after the matter has been considered by the House Committee, would make some improvement of the present Difficulty has also occurred in accommodation for the and Country party. This building was not suitably planned to meet the needs of the existing political situation, but I trust it may be possible to make more con",31
128,Mr SCULLIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.38] - I have every sympathy with the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. I frequently had to work in the room which he now occupies while my secretary was operating a typewriter in it. I suggest to the honourable gentleman that he should make some representations on the matter to the Speaker. If anything can be done withincurring great expense, the Governwill be prepared to do it. But we must bear in mind that this is not the time to incur large expenditure on this buildThe position of the Country party been difficult, because this building was constructed, apparently, on the assumption that the Country party would always be a Ministerial party, and its rooms were grouped with the rooms on Parthe Ministerial side. It is mutually agreed that in the present circumstances octhis is undesirable. The Country party Ophas now found accommodation on the Senate side. The building was designed to so that as much accommodation was provided on the Senate side as on the House of Representatives side, although the Senate has only half the number of memthe bers of this House. One result of this that certain Ministers, who are memI bers of the House of Representatives, have had to accept accommodation on the Senate side because there were no rooms for them on this side. I am afraid that we cannot consider making any expensive structural alterations to the building, it is probable that further consideration of the situation by the House Committee may make it possible to improve existing conditions.",31
129,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Cowper) [2.40]. - I thank the Leader of the Government, the Speaker, and the President of the Senate for their courtesy and assistance in making suitable arrangements for the accommodation of the Country party. I am glad to say that during this week satisfactory provision has been made for us. This building was designed without full consideration of the possible needs of the situation. It would be wise to appoint a sub-committee of the House to make an investigation with a view to putting the available space to the best possible use in the light of an experience of its use. It was interesting to me to hear the Treasurer remark that only one small alteration had been made in the Estimates for additions, new works, buildings, &c. Yesterday, when deliveringhis budget speech, the honourable gentleman suggested that in other respects some very great alterations had been made in the Estimates submitted by the previous Government. He referred to certain increases that have taken place in the actual expenditure compared with the Estimates for last year; but he did not make any reference to decreases that sometimes occur. If the honourable gentleman had examined the position for the last three years he would have ascertained that while every year there had been certain increases, there had also been considerable decreases. The expenditure last year on additions, new works and buildings, was £47,000 less than the Estimates, and in the previous year there was a decrease of £91,000. Treasurer's statement would have been fairer had he set the increases and decreases side by side. I do not intend on this occasion to enlarge on this aspect of the subject; I shall deal with it more fully at the appropriate time.",32
130,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,I had no information placed before me to show that there had been any decreases.,32
131,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,I suggest that the Treasurer might go into the matter.,32
132,Mr THEODORE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,When the Estimates but were being revised I asked for information as to both increases and decreases.,32
133,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"It is regrettable that the decreases were not indicated. In 1928-29 actual expenditure in various items showed an increase over the Estimates of £315,000, but there were decreases in other items of £133,800, which made a net increase of only £181,000 in a total expenditure of £7S,000,000, or a variation of less than i per cent. It would appear, therefore, that the statement made by the Treasurer yesterday that the previous Government had grossly miscalculated the definite commitments of the departments, was not justified. I venture to suggest that the Estimates of last year, in their approximation to the actual expenditure, challenge comparison with those brought forward in any parliament in which the English tongue is spoken. In the previous year there was a decrease in the actual expenditure, compared with the Estimates, in respect of additions, new works, buildings, &c, of £91,000. In the ordinary votes of the department in 1928-29, £38,000 less was spent than was anticipated. In 192728 the difference between the actual and the estimated expenditure was less than 4 per cent. In 1928-29, the difference between the actual and estimated expenditure was less than J per cent. In 1923-24, in his last budget as Treasurer of Queensland, the honourable member for Dalley underestimated his expenditure to the extent of £358,000 in a budget of £13,000,000, which was an increase of about 2J per cent., as compared with the i per cent, miscalculation of which I have been accused. If I am to be charged with having grossly misjudged the financial position because of an increase in expendiThe ture of i per cent, or even £ per cent., what language should be used to describe the miscalculation of the present Treasurer in 1923-24 to the extent of 2f per cent.? I suggest that, as the budget statement, of the Commonwealth is sent practically all over the world, ""such incomplete and partisan remarks as it contains are likely to have an injurious effect upon the credit of this country. If honourable bers wish to cast aspersions upon one another let it be done in debate. Damaging statements to Australia the nature to which I have taken exception should not be porated in an official and widely circuattack lated document such as the budget speech. I have received a great deal of criticism - in the past from men who have had no experience as treasurers, and I have always expected such criticism; but have found that men with treasury experience are usually most careful in attacking other treasurers, cause they realise their difficulties varying seasons in closely estimating lic expenditure. I now ask whether saving in connection with the vote consideration is anticipated because previous years this has always taken Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. Proposed vote-£33,000 .",32
134,Mr YATES,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Adelaide) [2.50] - I took exception last year to the authorization the of the proposed expenditure on the War a job for one man. Memorial at Canberra, and at the same time. I claimed that no man in Australia had a higher appreciation than I bad of to provide work. the services of the men in whose honour the memorial was to be erected. I questioned, however, the wisdom of the penditure of public money in placing memorial at the foot of Mount Ainslie honour of those who made the great fice in the late war. This memorial intended to be a reminder to the present generation and to posterity of the splenbut did heroism of the fallen, and of the way in which Australia discharged its responsibilities as part of the British pire. It is also proposed to use the ing for the accommodation of war relics. In my opinion it should be erected in a place where at least a considerable number of the people of the nation could see it. It will be not only a tragedy, reflection on our intelligence to erect memorial at Canberra.",33
135,Mr WEST,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,What has upset the able member?,33
136,Mr YATES,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I am not upset, nor am I leg-roped. I have been accused of a desire to prevent the carrying out of this informed in undertaking, which will provide employmemment for workless men. If anybody will submit a practical scheme for the purpose of relieving unemployment I shall give of it my wholehearted support. I walked across to Ainslie and inspected the site incorof the memorial before I made my last regarding it ; but I was not told the truth. All that I found was an outline of the foundations of the building; the trial holes had been filled in. Yet £30,000 odd was supposed to have been I spent in providing employment there. That was back in August. Can anybody tell me how many men have been employed beon that work up to date? I desire to see in the people employed, and I do not wish pubto be informed that we have to borrow any money to enable work to be provided for under them. This country was never more in wealthy, ,the people have never Avorked place. harder, and never has machinery for mass production been more up to date than at the present time. Yet never has Australia been in such an unfortunate position as she finds herself in today. 1 fail to see that the proposals outlined in Governor General's Speech will find Mr M. CAMERON - The party opposite told us at the election that it was going",33
137,Mr YATES,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , and the unemexployed should now be given work. If a this obligation is not discharged by the in Government, I cannot go back to my sacriconstituents and face those whom I is promised that work would be found for them. Honourable members opposite smile; if I gave them practical suggestions as to how this promise could be honored, they would probably inform me that I was Eman idiot. If the Government is prepared buildto formulate a practical scheme, so that the working people who are now unemployed may enjoy a decent Christmas, I shall say no inore. But I cannot accept the Governor General's Speech as giving but a promise of the slightest relief to those the who have returned the Ministry to power. Although two months or more have elapsed since a large sum of money honorwas placed on the Estimates for the specific purpose of erecting a war memorial, how much work has been done there? Who has fallen down on the job? Who is going slow? I should be no uncertain terms that so much cement and gravel has been ordered. No shipping strike is in progress, aud I am not aware that the coal position affects the work. I cannot anticipate what the reply will be; but it must be more truthful than that received by me from the late Minister for Home Affairs, if I am to be satisfied. I appretainly ciate the difficulty of Ministers through their being new to their offices; but now that the Labour party has got into power [ expect results. It should be prepared to do essential work, and face the consequences. Even if it made a mistake, the end would justify the means. For the men in my electorate who are living on the banks of the Torrens, in structures no better than aborigines' wurlies, [ cannot see one ray of hope in the Governor General's Speech. How much has been spent since August last of the money voted for the purpose of erecting the soldiers' memorial? Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [2.59] Like the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), I am surprised to find that no effort has been made by the Government to carry out its election promises. From every platform we heard the cry that there would be work and more work for all if a Labour Government were given power, and no one would be unemployed, yet the present Ministry has made no attempt to do any more than was done by the previous government. No provision is made for any new works except for a sum of £250 for a shelter shed at Fremantle. Ministers cannot advance the excuse that works cannot be carried out until they have been referred to the Public Works Committee, because a considerable number of works have been approved by the committee; but no provision has yet been made by the Government to provide work for the unemployed by proceeding with these works. Some time ago, the Works Committee recommended the erection of Commonwealth offices in Brisbane, where unemployment is rife, and if that work were put in hand the position there would be considerably relieved by the provision of work for the unemployed before Christmas. I understand that the erection of Commonwealth offices in Sydney has been approved by the Public Works Committee, and yet this Government has done nothing to put the work in hand. Recently a number of automatic telephone exchanges in and around Sydney and Melbourne were approved by that committee, and if this Government were sincere in its desire to provide work for the unemployed, it cershould have gone ahead with those proposals. Unfortunately, it refuses to give relief to the unemployed, and excuses itself by saying that the Estimates that it is submitting to this Parliament are the Estimates of the late Government with the exception of one item relating to a building in Fremantle, which was accidentally omitted from the Estimates by the late Treasurer. The small sum of £250 is provided for that work. The members of the Labour party told the people from every platform that if they were returned to power work would be found for the unemployed. I ask honourable' members behind the Government how is it possible for the workless of Australia to subsist on promises? The Government stands condemned for its lack of action. So far it has been an "" all-talkie"" government. So far members of the Ministry have done nothing but talk, and the talk they have indulged in has been in a destructive vein. First of all they talked about destroying our defence system. Now they are talking about abolishing the Development and Migration Commission, which the previous Government established in its effort to develop this country and to find work for the unemployed by creating new development works with money borrowed at a very low rate of interest. Even the Migration Agreement, which enables us to obtain cheap money from Great Britain for developmental purposes, is likely to be interfered with. I join with the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) in saying that the Government, even in the first days of its administration, has fallen down on its job. I had hoped that, with the advent of the Labour Government with its election, promises, works such as the repair and prevision of post offices, would be carried out in my electorate, so as to give employment to the workless there, but the Estimates disclose no proposals of that character.",33
138,Mr NELSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Northern Territory ) [3.3] - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat would like us believe that he is a great champion the workers of Australia. For seven successive years his party held the of office, and during that period worker's lot became worse and worse, until today the worker is in a more deplorable position than ever before in the history of Australia. It is true that I am not satisfied with on the present position; but I quite at realise that if the members of the Opposition had had a heart for the industrialists of this country our finances would not be in the awful mess that they are in today. The inactivity of the Government is responsible for the ployment that exists in the community, but that is no justification for this Government's adopting a similar attitude. Now that the Labour party is in power, the honourable.member for Adelaide (M Yates) has said, it is up to us to show by our actions that our promises to the electors were sincere. I am concerned about the north of Australia, and the people who are starving there. Whatever this Government or any other government may say about the responsibility of the States, the Commonwealth cannot shirk its responsibilities in North tralia - I have had little time glance through the Estimates; I find that an item of £200 is set down f the development of the mining industry in an area three times the size of New South Wales. In addition, a sura of £43 is provided for the sustenance of children of destitute persons. That is surely an insult to the intelligence of our people. We find that a sum of £133,414 is being paid to the big men who administer this country, but. not one penny is being spent on reproductive works. At a later stage I shall have an opportunity to join Other honourable members in insisting on a revision of the Estimates, so that Austo tralia may be better developed.",35
139,Mr BELL,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Darwin) [3.6] - When item of the War Memorial was before this chamber last session and previously, I , like the honourable member for Adecriticized laide (Mr Yates), protested against expenditure. I now repeat my protest, because there is a greater reason today for objecting to that expense than there was before. My objection is that money to for this work cannot be raised sponof taneously among the people and loan money has to be made available for it . reins Imagine any government borrowing the money to provide a memorial to Australia's fallen heroes! Such a proposal is distasteful to me. The money would be better spent on reproductive works. 1 understand that the sum already expended this project is £30,000. I have looked the site, and I venture to say that 1 could get twenty good workmen from my electorate to do in a mouth all the work that has been done there to date. In reply to a question last session, the late late Minister for Home Affairs informed the unemHouse that the expenditure on the War Memorial up to that time was £16,000; yet the amount shown in the Estimates then was £30,000. I should like to know as which is the correct figure. The excuse r . given for the abandonment of compulsory training is that a saving of £150,000 will be thereby effected, but what will - be the use of a handsome war memorial erected in honour of those who fel l at the last war if this country is to be at the mercy of invaders in a few years' time? In such circumstances it is nothing short of folly to continue the expenditure of Ausmoney on the erection of a war to memorial at the present time. The but Treasurer (Mr . Theodore) seems to o r have considered nearly every item of the Estimates submitted by the late Treasurer, but I wonder whether he has investigated ""this particular item. If not, I ask him to postpone it until he has done so. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney [3.10]. - When the proposal to construct a war memorial was before the last Parliament, the honourable member for Darwin (Mr . Bell) protested against the expenditure with of money on that project. He has a right to his views, but let me poiut out him that this morning the Prime M in ister read out a number of proposed works already approved by the Public Works the Committee, which the Government intended to put in hand. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr J. Francis) the Government for its in this action; but let me inform him that the late Government, during its administration, indulged in an orgy of expenditure. [, like the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), will insist on public works being carried out so as to relieve unemployment, but we cannot blame the Government for these Estimates. Mr E. GREEN - Thes e are the Estimates for the next twelve months. Mr E. EILEY - Thes e Estimates were prepared by the late Government, and the present Government has had little or no time to revise them. Before criticizing its actions we should give it an opportunity of preparing a list of developmental works to be carried out for the relief of the unemployed. There has been much talk about money being scarce in Australia, but money does not disappear. This country is wealthy enough io find work for every inhabitant who is u illing to work. ""We have expended about £8,000,000 in the Federal Capital Territory, which has an area of 900 square miles. Now we are told by honourable members opposite that money is not available for works in the Territory. That is an absurd statement. Why should not the banks supply the needs of the Government ?",35
140,Mr LACEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Would the honourable member say that Canberra is an asset ? Mr E. EILEY - Yes . Last year nearly £500,000 was collected in rates and rents from the Territory. I hope that developmental works will shortly be put in hand so as to give more employment our people.",36
141,Mr GULLETT,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Henty) [3.14)] - I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without extending my congratulations to the GoWorks vernment for the extraordinary manifescomes tation of party discipline that we have seen today. Naturally, as a member of late Government which was responsible for these Estimates, I am flattered that the new Government should have adopted project. them almost to the last shilling. Were the late Government in charge of these Estiin mates today not a member now on that side of the chamber would have failed charge us with indifference and callousParliament, ness towards the unemployed of this counvernment try. We cut these Estimates to the bone, and rightly so. In view of all the Labour party's promises of work to the workless of this country, upon which the swing the election largely depended, it is a remarkable spectacle, this afternoon, to see every supporter of the Government quietly accepting these close-cut Estimates. It is a remarkable proof of the discipline which prevails upon the Government side. During the last two or three years the last Government was attacked again and again for its alleged lack of sympathy with the workers. Yet the new Government has adopted almost en bloc the Estimates prepared by its predecessors, and the only additional relief proposed is the offer of the Minister for Home Affairs to pay the fare3 of the unemployed in the Northern Territory to the south where, apparently, they will be dumped amongst the numerous unemployed already here. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs to let the committee know what work has been done to date in. connection with the national war memorial. Unlike the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell), I am an enthusiastic supporter of that project. I am glad that the Government, has allowed to remain on the Estimates the amount provided for it by the last Treasurer, and I offer to Ministers my support in any steps they may take towards the completion of the memorial.",36
142,Mr LACEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Grey) [3.17] - We have passed beyond the stage when we can profitably discuss the desirability of establishing a national war memorial in Canto berra; the Government is committed to that project. It has been debated in this chamber many times, and was the subject of a favourable report .by the Public Committee. Therefore, it ill behonorable members who are now in opposition to criticize a proposal which emanated from the Government of the which they were supporters.",36
143,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,I thought some of our members at least were supporting the,36
144,Mr LACEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Other s are criticizing it a cheap, party spirit. It is true that the honourable member for Darwin (Mr. to Bell) opposed the proposal in the last but he knew that the. Gohad sufficient numbers to carry the item if it were taken to a division. I am surprised at the nascent concern of the members of the Opposition for the of unemployed. Only a couple of months to me ago we, who were then in opposition, were repeatedly urging the last Ministry ro do something to relieve the unemployed.",36
145,Mr GULLETT,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"""Why not urge that now?",37
146,Mr LACEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,We are urging it every day.,37
147,Mr GULLETT,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Why not make some provision ou the Estimates?,37
148,Mr LACEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The Government has not had an opportunity to do so, but it has done an extraordinary amount of work during the few weeks that Ministers have been in. office. At all times I shall be prepared to criticize the Government if I see any evidence that it is slow. But so far Ministers have been working overtime in an endeavour to find means of relieving the unemployed. The Estimates now before the committee, which were prepared by the former Treasurer, show that £30,113 has been already spent on the war memorial. I was a member of the Works Committee that inquired into the project, and having recently re-visited the site, I make bold to say that nothing like that amount has beeu spent there. Therefore, I ask the Minister for Home Affairs to explain to the committee why the Estimates of the late Treasurer show that £30,113 has boen already expended. The Government has not had time, in the brief period for which it has been in office, to inquire all the projects that would help to absorb the unemployed, but one of its first duties will be to look for works of a reproductive character so that some at least of the vast army of unemployed may be provided with work. If Ministers can, during the next twelve months, minimize the existing evil of unemployment they will have done something to earn the thanks of the community; if they prove lax in this regard they will deserve the same condemnation as was. passed upon their predecessors who brought about the existing state of affairs. I make that statement frankly, because we on this side of the House were elected to do something for the relief of the unemployed.",37
149,Mr THOMPSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"New England) to [3.23] - In the last Parliament I supbe ported the proposal to construct a national war memorial, and I do so again now because it will have a sentimental value that cannot be assessed in terms money. I uuderstand that the memorial is to cost ultimately about £250,000, of which only about £30,000 has been expended. But, in view of the statements made by honourable members opposite, the Government should call a halt pending an investigation of the expenditure to date. I have not inspected the site; but the statements made by honourable members who have done so suggest that something in the nature of a scandal has occurred. Por the last fifteen years this federal city has been a sink for the people's money, and there is very little to show for the going £12,000,000 already spent in and. about Canberra. For that amount of money we could buy at least half a dozen cities of the size of Canberra. I estimate that, fully one-third of the money expended here has been wasted, and in no captious spirit I urge the Government to suspend expenditure in Canberra, to investigate closely the causes of previous waste, and to devise some system by which the taxpayers may get at least 17s. of value for every £1 that is spent. The work so far done in connection with the war memorial is typical of the crass stupidity shown by the authorities who have been engaged in the construction of the Federal Capital. According to the statements of ministerial supporters, practically nothinto ing has been done for the money alreadv spent on the war memorial.",37
150,Mr GULLETT,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"As a member of the War Memorial Board, I give the honourable member an assurance that £30,000 has not been' spent on the site.",37
151,Mr THOMPSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"This is an extraordinary instance of the ineptitude of the administration of the Federal Capital. Although the National Parliament has been sitting in Canberra for the last two and a half years, honourable members do not know what amount has been expended on the war memorial. The former Minister for Trade and Customs says that £30,000 has not been expended: other honourable members say that it has been expended, but that there is nothing show for it. The Government would justified in not proceeding further with the scheme until Parliament knows whether the money so far voted has been expended, 'what work has been done for of the amount, and also whether it is worthwhile in the interest of the nation to incur further cost. The Government' would be doing a national service if it made a thorough inquiry into this latest instance of the mismanagement and muddle that has characterized works in Canberra ever since the first foundation stone was laid in this wilderness. In regard to unemployment, I join issue with my colleagues of the Opposition. They are unreasonable in expecting the Government, which has been in office for only one month, to do something that has never been done by any other government in the world's history. In twelve months of office the Labour Government in Great Britain has not solved the problem of unemployment; indeed, the number of unemployed has increased owing to causes which the Government has no control. And I shall not be surprised if the Commonwealth Government discovers before it has been in office for a year that unemployment has increased in Australia also. If that does happen, Ministers will not necessarily be blameworthy, because no ment can overcome, in a night, the consequences of generations of excessive borrowing. Unemployment, and all the other troubles from which Australia is suffering, have been caused primarily by the excessive borrowing in which different governments have indulged for decade after decade. It is because borrowing must cease that the Government today is unable to put in hand on a sufficiently large scale public works for the absorption of the unemployed. I hope it will not be contended in this Parliament that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to absorb all the unemployed; that would be impossible. During the seven years that I supported the late Government it was always argued that the absorption of the unemployed was primarily a State and not a Commonwealth function, and that the Commonwealth's inability to encroach upon the spheres of the States prevented it from putting in hand large public works. There are some honourable members on both sides whose outlook is not purely national. They talk as though the ' expenditure of a paltry f30,000 on a National War Memorial would solve the J/>. Thompson. problem of unemployment. Such a contention is utterly illogical and absurd. The late Government found it necessary to restrict considerably the expenditure upon works such as the River Murray Waters scheme and the North-South Railway, and the present Government will be faced with a similar necessity. Therefore, the only avenue which remains open is Canberra, and for years that has been' a sink for the people's money. It is the desire of all members that no further money shall be spent in Canberra unless full value is obtained for the expenditure incurred. This question should provide an absolute test of the business ability of the Government. Matters in connection with the National War Memorial have obviously been completely muddled. The over Minister should say that there shall be no further expenditure upon it until there is definite information as to what has been done with the money that has already been expended and a decision has been come to as to whether it is worthwhile to persist with the proposal. govern- Mr. Curtin (Fremantle) [3.33] - 1 support the plea that the further cou T sideration of this item should be deferred until every aspect of it has been reconsidered. I do not agree with the contention that because it has appeared previously on the Estimates this Government and this Parliament are necessarily bound to complete the work. It might be better to lose the £16,000 which, according to a Minister in the last administration, has so far been expended, than to proceed with a proposal that will cost a very great, deal of money and will not make any keener the remembrance of the nation of the sacrifices that were made on its behalf. I cannot see any close connection between this item and the general question of unemployment, and I marvel at. the hardihood of the former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett), who would impeach the present Government for not having coped in some dramatic way with the grievous position that exists throughout the Commonwealth. The economic marasmus by which this country is afflicted is largely due to the ill nurture and undernourishment from which for seven years its industries have suffered, and for which the previous Government was to a very large extent responsible. The momentum of that economic policy persists; and it cannot be arrested by some dramatic action by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley) in connection with the construction of a war memorial, or diminished to any extent by increasing the expenditure department. Honourable members opposite who suggest that it is practicable for the administration to ease greatly the difficulties of those who are now out of work, ignore two important factors; first, that the previous administration left the Treasury empty; and, secondly, that the financing of the first five months of the present financial year prevented this administration from propounding a policy for the whole year, and compelled it to bridge the gap between the date of the election and the end of the financial year according to the general principles of Estimates that a previous Treasurer had already submitted to Parliament. I agree with those members on this side who would be prepared to disregard for the most part the Estimates formulated by the previous Government. So heartily was I opposed to the. policy of that Government that I should be happy to remove from the Estimates every vestige of that policy. But the wheel of Australian depression is still revolving, and the best that can be done at present is to put a brake upon it. I understand that, although Ministers are now being attacked because they are not increasing the number of employees who are engaged in activities promoted by the Government, they have suspended certain notices of dismissal which were issued by Ministers in the last administration. It appears to be characteristic of honourable members opposite to say one thing and to do another. When in power they threatened that there would be a considerable reduction in the volume of employment given by the Commonwealth to the people of Australia; yet they now attack their successors on the ground that the number of employees in the services of the Commonwealth has not been enormously increased! There is an obvious contradiction between their attitude then and now, and I feel confident that that will be obvious to the people, and that they will not be misled by speeches such as those of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. J. Francis). The recuperation of Australian industry, which would provide the remedy for unemployment will take sometime. It will not be an easy matter for industry to recover from the sickness that of any was brought upon it and developed by "" Dr Bruce"" and "" Dr Gullett,"" because not only is industry still suffering from the general condition of ill health that characterises industries in other countries, but the extraordinary prescriptions, which my honourable friends opposite compounded for relief, only added to the. misfortune of those most intimately concerned. Still the obligation upon this Government is not in any way lessened, because of the extraordinarily grave situation which it has inherited. I feel confident that we shall have light on the subject when an opportunity has been given for that complete investigation which the honourable member for New England- (Mr Thompson) regards as essential concerning the expenditure ' on the war memorial. A similar examination of the expenditure of several other departments is also required. This item suggests that £30,000 was expended last year, whereas a former minister assures us that the expenditure was only £16,000. A discrepancy of nearly 50 per cent, between the amount stated, and the actual expenditure is so extraordinary that it makes one wonder to what extent reliance can be placed upon the Estimates generally prepared by the former Treasurer.",37
152,Mr YATES,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Eve n that statement of expenditure is not true.,39
153,Mr CURTIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"If it is not accurate, how can Parliament ascertain definitely what is the financial position of the Commonwealth ?",39
154,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"If the honourable member will study the budget papers presented by the late Treasurer, he will find, at page 87, information showing exactly what was done with £20,000.",39
155,Mr CURTIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I have before me the Estimates of receipts and expenditure for the year ended 30th June, 1930, prepared by the late Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), and I am speaking upon the item as set out in that document.",39
156,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"But if the honourable member will turn to page 87 of the budget papers he will find that £20,000 was taken out of revenue and paid into a trust fund.",40
157,Mr BELL,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,That makes the matter still more confusing.,40
158,Mr CURTIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Of course it does. If , as the Leader of the Opposition states, £20,000 of the vote of £50,000 has been hypothecated to a trust fund where is the proposal for the utilization of that amount; and when is that item to be drawn upon? It is difficult to ascertain what is the actual position. Are we to understand that £30,000 is.to be appropriated from this year's revenue for the purpose of the. war memorial, while at the same time there is an unexpended balance of £20,000 previously voted, and that this may also be drawn upon this year?",40
159,Mr THOMPSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,The Minister should clear up the matter.,40
160,Mr CURTIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"We ought to have more information about the proposed vote. If the work on the site represents an expenditure of £20,000, and if we are asked now to vote another £30,000 this year, with the possibility that the total expenditure may be £50,000, including the unexpended balance of £20,000 from last year's vote, it appears to me trol of the public purse by this committee has become extremely difficult. I object to the manner in which the item has been presented. It is impossible for honourable members to understand the transaction, and I protest against the perplexities with which we are confronted when we are endeavouring to unravel the financial administration of the Commonwealth. This, I suggest, is a matter of the first importance to the people. If , because of the manner in which the finances are presented, honourable members are unable to ascertain what is being done with the revenues of the Commonwealth, how can there be an effective check by this Parliament ou the administration? I hope that in view of what has been said, the Minister will withdraw the item for the present, unless he is in a position to make a statement clearly setting out the position with regard to expenditure on the memorial. We should not pass the item until the situation has been explained.",40
161,Mr BLAKELEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Darling-Minister for Home Affairs) [3.47] - It is somewhat amusing to hear honourable members opposite entreating the Government to do something for the unemployed. This Government has been in office just one month and the Treasurer, in his financial statement, has informed-the people of the position of the finances when we took over control. The Nationalist administration was in office for thirteen years, and honourable members opposite expect this Government to clear up, in one month, all the financial aud other difficulties that were bequeathed to us. Without being unduly optimistic, I am confident that, as the result"" of Labour government, the people of the Commonwealth will be more prosperous in six months than they have been in the thirteen years of Nationalist administration.",40
162,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Why not say fourteen days instead of six months?,40
163,Mr BLAKELEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The Leader of the Opposition and his party had thirteen years of office and they left the affairs of this country in a scandalous condition. We cannot be expected immediately to straighten out the difficulties. Any government taken from the electorates could have administered the affairs of the Commonwealth infinitely better that con- than our friends on the Opposition benches did during their long term in office. Throughout Australia there are monuments to their incompetence and wanton wastefulness. It will take time to clear up these matters, but this Government is determined to do so, and to give some hope to the unfortunate persons who are unemployed in Australia. With regard to the subject before the Chair, the Australian War Memorial at Canberra is estimated to cost £270,000. Accessory services estimated to cost £99,000 increase the cost to £369,000, while further accessory services chargeable to commission amount to £43,000, making a grand total cost of £412,000. A sum of £20,000 has been put into a trust fund for expenditure on the war memorial. This sum is still usable, but is definitely allocated for the purposes of the war memorial. An amount of £5,000 has been advanced to the Federal Capital Commission, an architectural competition involved an expenditure of £2,582, while architects', fees amounted to £2,401. Miscellaneous expenditure added a further £130, making a total of £30,113.",40
164,Mr THOMPSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"""Will the Minister make it clear whether .the whole of this £30,000 has been already spent on construction work?",41
165,Mr BLAKELEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"No . Of the amount of £30,000 on the Estimates £20,000 has been placed to the credit of the war memorial fund. £10,000 has been spent on other items, but so far not one sod has been turned in connection with the actual construction of the war memorial. Mr THOMI'SON - Therefore , the expenditure to date is £10,000.",41
166,Mr BLAKELEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"That does not cover the whole of the expenditure because the commission, while it has been advanced only £5,000, has spent considerably more titan that amount. The extra expenditure is in respect of roads, water and sewerage reticulation, .&c, which, while necessary for the construction of the war memorial, cannot properly be deemed part of the war memorial ex-' penditure. The money spent out of commission funds upon engineering services in association with the war memorial site is made up as follows:Hoads .. 9,861 16 1 Storm water drainage including culverts .. 3,080 13 1 Sewerage reticulation .. 334 5 0 Total .. .. 13,275 14 1",41
167,Mr YATES,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"It was stated in reply to a question by me that £19,000 had been spent on the war memorial, but half that was spent in developmental works for the city.",41
168,Mr BLAKELEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The money was spent - in the course of city development, but the works serve the war memorial site. I cannot understand why any attempt should have been made to hide the fact. Tho figuros were available, and should have been given in their proper order.",41
169,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,They were given in their proper order.,41
170,Mr BLAKELEY,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member to whom the answer was given says not. The financial position of Australia has been outlined by the Treasurer, and honourable members can appreciate from that statement that the position is particularly bad. The Government is confronted with the question whether it can go on with the construction of the National War Memorial at the present time, and has come to the conclusion that it is impossible to find the necessary money to proceed immediately with the work. Therefore, expenditure on this work will have to be postponed for the time being. Progress reported. MIGRATION AGREEMENT: PAPER.",41
171,Mr SCULLIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [3.55],-Yesterday the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) asked me whether I would moke available a communication between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Great Britain on the subject of migration.

In view of the great im-. portance of this matter to every honourable member of the House, I am anxious to know what the intentions of the Prime Minister arc regarding it.",41
172,Mr LATHAM,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,Kooyong) [3.58] - I hope that the Prime Minister will be able to give honourable members some information this afternoon regarding the business which it is proposed to take on Tuesday next.,41
173,Mr THOMPSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"New England) [3.59] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Markets and Transport a news bulletin that has been circulated among honourable members this afternoon. It is a type-written document 6T a kind which haa frequently been sent round to honourable members, and now that the Government is seeking for means of effecting economies, will he institute inquiries as to the circulation usefulness of such publications with a view to determining whether the issue of them might not properly be discontinued? In my opinion the only valuable form of publicity for marketing purposes is printed matter disseminated among those engaged in the industry concerned. The class of publicity represented by this document is, in my opinion, practically valueless. The subjects embraced in this document include the statement that the Canadian Government provides seedcleaning plants and news about silage tem- printed ? peratures, peanut production, America's farm relief measures, liver-rot diseases sheep, Australia's export of sandalwood, killing whales by electricity, and Great Britain's wine exports. Perhaps the Minister can give the House some information on the matter.",41

Minister for Markets and Transport) [4.2] - Bulletin s such as that referred to by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) have been circulated for some years past.,42
175,Mr HILL,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"They are very useful.  have been of value particularly to primary producers. I agree with the honourable member that this bulletin contains some information that is not likely to be of much use to Australian producers; but, on the other hand, there is a good deal in it that has proved beneficial to them. During the short time. I have been in office I have made an effort to increase its usefulness. I understand that it is despatched to honourable members, and also to the principal newspaper proprietors of Australia, who have intimated from time to time that its contents are of value to sections of their readers.",42
176,Mr THOMPSON,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"Will the Minister make available the names of newspapers that are using it?  have been iuformed that it is of value to a large section of the community, and there does not appear to be any reason why its circulation should be stopped, particularly as we are attempting to improve it. Mr SCT/1LIN (Yarra-Prime Minister) [4.4] - The protocol referred to by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. R.

177,Mr SCULLIN,ALLEGED DEPARTMENTAL,"I cannot do so at in this stage. Unless the Government ie satisfied that it is essential to print such documents, it is our intention to avoid unnecessary expenditure in that direction. For the information of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), I may state that on Tuesday we propose to proceed with the discussion on the South Australian Grant Bill, the bill relating to Kyogle to South Brisbane railway, the additions, new works and buildings estimates, and also to introduce the Tas manian Grant Bill.
