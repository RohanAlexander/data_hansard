1,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I have here a copy the Gloucester Advocate, a newspaper cirphone culating in the northern portion of the Hunter electorate. It contains a long leader', objecting' to the proposed legislation in regard to the importation of propriebeen tary medicines and foods, and concludes with the - following paragraph- : We hope that during the Federal recess Minister will find time. to recast the proposed amendment of the Commerce Act on the lines indicated above. Legislation is required tect the public and, the honest trader, and it of time, may be done. without harassing manufacturers or restricting trade. I desire to call the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact, that there is apparently organized effort on the part of sons interested in proprietary medicines foods to interfere with . Commonwealth legislation by influencing public opinion Reviews :- ' through the publication of articles of this kind in the country press. The possibility . but of such action was pointed out in Mr at Beale's report.",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Representatives of knew, certain English proprietary companies likely to succeed manufacturing medicines waited on the r Government some months ago, but I was of not aware that concerted action was now plucky being taken in the press.",14
3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Article s of this kind are that being published throughout Australia. . Mr DEAKIN - I am obliged to the ! Mr SPEAKER honourable member for calling attention to the matter;,14
4,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Following up the question put by the honourable member for Hunter, I should like to ask the Primein Minister whether he will take passed this session a Bill providingthat patent medicines imported into the Comtain monwealth shall have their formula disclosed on the labels or boxes ? Such legislation has been promised again and again by the Ministry. ' Mr DEAKIN - ^ - T he measure is one with which we are anxious to deal, and if the opportunity offers we shall be glad to take advantage of it . I cannot, however, give any strong undertaking in this regard unless the House is in a mood to remain in session longer than honourable members have anticipated in order to dispose of that measure, as well as of two or three others of no great length, but to which a good 2.30 deal of importance may be attached. NA SWITCHBOARD. FOODS.",14
5,Mr WATKINS,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"As the Postmasterof General well, knows, the Newcastle teleswitchboard is absolutely worn out, and the telephone service of the town is consequently in. a chaotic. state. Will he inform me when the new board, which has so long promised, will be installed?",14
6,Mr MAUGER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"A new board has been ordered, and is being made. It will be the installed as soon as it arrives in the Commonwealth, though I cannot say exactly to prowhen that will be. There will be no loss CRITICISM S ON - PARLIAMENT .",14
7,Mr FOSTER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I wish to know if the perPrime Minister has tead the following and criticisms on Parliament, printed in the June number of the Australian Review of Especially sarcastic were they when we said it would come in connection with the Post Office, those qf us who knew the forces that were work to get Mr Mauger out of. the position pf Postmaster-General, by - fair means or foul, also, that they w.ere not going to let the position go by default' If an attack was at all Tariff Reform, Fedea l Capital, Defence, Old-Age Pensions-non e these things were likely to provoke dissensions sufficient to bring about a crisis; but the and statesmanlike actions of the Postmaster-General had. roused all the fur y of evil was using the Post Office for unlawful purposes. - I do not think it is . necessary to read these long extracts. Why is the honourable member reading them ?",14
8,Mr FOSTER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"Because I wish to ask the Prime Minister if he will take action regard to them. I have only ""two more steps to have sentences to readMen who regarded themselves as kings in cercircles bave bad to suffer the disgrace of having their correspondence stopped, and the whole of the most disreputable and disgraceful quences. section of the community roused itself to get rid of the man who was responsible for it. 'That was the meaning of Mr Webster's motion and of the eager yelp that followed it . Does not the Prime Minister think that such criticisms seriously reflect on the motives of a number' of honourable members, and on the conduct of a highly-placed', public servant of the Commonwealth, and ' will he not, therefore, submit them to the law officers of the Crown, to ascertain whether the slanders and misrepresentations contained in the article should not be referred to the Select Committee on procedure in regard to questions of privilege?",14
9,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"The range'of political criticism in the press is so wide, and the Smith. theories advanced for parliamentary action and inaction are so extraordinary, that, the extract-whic h I have not noted-could , am afraid, be paralleled with others containapt ing statements equally impossible of proof, or of belief on the part of those associated with Parliament.",15
10,Mr WH IRVINE,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,The statements mild compared with some which have been published.,15
11,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"Yes. ' Theextraearliest, vagance of such interpretations of parliaquently mentary conduct, though obvious to us, is not known to the public, and, no doubt, attention will be paid to such matters by the Select Committee on privilege.",15
12,Mr FOSTER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I wish to ask the Postfact master-General whether he has read the comments in question, and, if so, whether he endorses any of them ?",15
13,Mr MAUGER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I certainly cannot say that I have read them, and consequently cannot say 'whether I endorse them. PAPUA APPOINTMENT OF. ADMINISTRATORLAND ADMINISTRATION.",15
14,Mr KELLY,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"Witho'Jt desiring to draw any inference as to the causes of delay which has occurred, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will,' in the immediale future, call for applications for the of Administrator of Papua, in order that, as far as possible, we may insure getting suitable man.",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"There is no delay occasioned by - any action or inaction the part, of the Government with respect to this appointment, but correspondence is still proceeding. I am expecting reports, which are not yet to hand, in connection with the recent dismissal and its conseWhen ' that correspondence discloses fully the course of conduct which has been pursued by all concerned, and the cross charges have been disposed of, the Government will be prepared, to make an appointment; and if they think it necessary to call for applications they will do so. Last night I did not answer, as intended, the question of the honourable member for North Sydney. I find that the letter signed by myself,, from the Department, with reference to land transactions, did not reach Papua until after the second case had been dealt with.",15
16,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,Then there cannot be anv reflection on Mr Staniforth,15
17,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"On examination I find, I to my regret, - that the paper as printed is - to lead to a' misconception,' because, though it gives a perfectly correct precis of events prior to the letter of the 21st February, it does not call-attention, as it are ought to have done, to the fact that - a letter which left here on that date would not reach Papua until, probably, at the three or four weeks later. Consethe precis, though it takes us up to the writing of the letter, does not take us up to the time of its reception in Papua.",15
18,Mr FRAZER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I desire to ask the' Prime Minister whether, in view of 'the that the instruction from his Department did not reach Papua until after the difficulty had arisen in' connection with the Drummond case, and in view of the decision of the Acting Administrator in Council that members of the public' service might hold an interest in land syndicates, he does notthink that Mr Staniforth Smith is free from blame? Mr DE.AKIN - I - endeavoure d to .explain last night that, although Mr Staniforth Smith himself, says that he feels now he made a mistake,- it is perfectly clear the that the mistake is one which implies no reflection on him, having regard to the special circumstances lately obtaining in position Papua. The abundance of land, the absence . of applicants, and the desire a of the Government, that areas .should be taken up, are circumstances which, I think, relieve . Mr Staniforth Smith from on responsibility. Rut the honourable member - made a reference to the Acting Administrator's restrictions ' on officers; and that reference is slightly erroneous. Speaking from memory yesterday, I erred in one or two respects in answering questions put to ine. In the published papers, now, as then, before us, it is shown that the statement made by the Acting Administrator at the Executive Council was not a mere - obiter dictum of his own, but,' on the contrary, it declared what was already, so to speak, the law in Papua. mond's own statement is as followsWhile no officers of the Lands Department were allowed to apply for a lease of Crown lands, under section 16 of the Lands Ordinance <>f 1906, His Excellency would have no objection to our holding shares in land companies, or purchasing land already leased, if the purchase - was a bond fide one. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - That is, they dummy!",15
19,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"No ; the explanation given by the Acting Administrator is in the following quotationThe reference to companies is from regulations urider the Public Service Ordinance, published in. the Gazette of 6th November, 1907, 26 (a) of which is identical with 79 (2) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. So that,' when the Acting Administrator made that statement, he was referring to something which was then made, or had been made, the law in Papua. It does not cover the operations of syndicates, but only protects those officers who hold shares in land companies, or who purchase land already leased, if the purchase be bond fide. , The case against Mr Drummond was that he was a member of a syndicate-the 'same syndicate which first applied for land in  and which, afterwards simply altered the names in which the application was made, the persons interested and the land being still precisely the :same. It was on that account that,- in the opinion of a majority of the Council, they had committed a breach of the regulation to' which I have referred.",16
20,Mr FRAZER,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,Who are,16
21,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"Mr Drummond and  stress yesterday, and the one to which importance was attached, was the attempt of  cation in which he. and Mr Drummond were .both interested; but a majority of the Council-by three to two-considered that Mr Drummond's complicity  ciently proved. They gave him the benefit of the doubt, although two members of the Council considered the! case proved. It was not, therefore, the attempt to secure priority which decided the majority against Mr Drummond. Mr Campbell, who cast the deciding vote in both cases, points out in his summing up that the interests in the second application were precisely the same as those in the first; that the land applied for in the second was preMr Drum- cisely that sought in the first, and that, in the circumstances, he was compelled to say that in making a second application, after being informed that the first was illegal, Mr Drummond was guilty of an attempt to evade the restrictions imposed by the regulations.",16
22,Mr BOWDEN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether, in the event could of his considering it desirable to invite applications for the position of Administrator of Papua, he will give sufficient notice to allow of applications being received from Imperial servants in India, who may have had experience in handling native races, and may be willing to accept a transfer to the Commonwealth service?",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"In the event of outadvertising for applicants, sufficient notice will be given; but I am confident, first, of all, that we .have in Australia men thoroughly qualified for the position, and, secondly, that the control we possess is so exercised that there is no danger of in jury being done to the native races of the Territory.",16
24,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"The Government, . so far, have not protected them very well.",16
25,Mr DEAKIK,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,We have. Our treat; ment of the natives will compare with that of any British . Possession.,16
26,Mr LIVINGSTON,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is within his power to issue, instructions that, pending a more satisfactory arrangement, no Crown lands in Papua shall be sold?",16
27,Mr DEAKIA,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"Our - own Act prohibits 1 the selling of Crown land under any cir""they"" ? cumstances. If the honourable member will refer to the printed paper .now on the table, he will see that the first letter it contains includes instructions' that will prevent the possibility of any such occurrence in the future.",16
28,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the papers relating to the land scandals in Papua make it clear that Mr Staniforth Smith was a member of a company that applied for land, and that he sat as a member of ' the Board which had power to determine whether or not that application should be granted ? - Mr DEAKIN - So far from that being made clear by the papers, I think it is shown that he never had any interest in any land company applying for land.",16
29,Mr KELLY,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"In view of the satisfactory statement which the Prime Minister has made today concerning Mr Staniforth Smith, and. in view of the regulation which the Administrator of Papua has taken from the Commonwealth Public Service Act, and incorporated in the ordinances of the Territory, I desire to ask. whether he is aware of any reasons underlying Judge Murray's . sarcastic references to Mr Smith's alleged ""entire lack of administrative experience and capacity?""",17
30,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"The honourable member has not quite correctly quoted Judge Murray's reference. The words which the Acting Administrator used are "" total want of experience in departmental procedure and administration.""",17
31,Mr KELLY,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,That language is pretty warm.,17
32,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"The words are strong. Mr Staniforth Smith voluntarily admits that he made a mistake, but as I have already said, it was a mistake which probably arose-as has been suggested-fro m want of experience in departmental procedure, and is not one which reflects in the slightest degree upon his integrity or upon anything except his want of foresight regarding the complications that might possibly follow the establishment of precedents of that kind.",17
33,Mr CARR,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I wish to ask the Prime .Minister whether, under the ordinances obtaining in Papua, Mr Drummond has exhausted his right of appeal? If not, what course is open to him ?",17
34,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"Mr Drummond has exhausted his right of appeal, and is no longer a member of the Public Service.",17
35,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has taken the necessary steps to absolutely prevent officials in New Guinea from being interested, either directly or indirectly, in land transactions?",17
36,Mr DEAKIN,NEWCASTLE TELEPHON E,"If the honourable member will look' at page 2 of the document which was laid upon the table of the House, and ordered to be printed, on the 8th of April last, he will find that on the 21st of February of the present year the whole of - the conditions relating to dealings in land by officers in Papua are there set out in detail. NA DEPARTMENT . CABINET COMMITTEE'S REPORT.",17
37,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In view of statements made in the newspapers, I desire to know whether the Government are averse to placing the Post and Telegraph Department-in Commission, and, if so, has the Prime Minister any objection fo provide an opportunity for the discussion of the following motion, which stands in my nameThat it is expedient, in the best interests of good government and efficient administration, that the Department of the Postmaster-General should be placed under a Board of Commissioners, beyond political influence.",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The Government pro-, pose to submit no such proposition, but I shall be glad to take the earliest opportunity, after the Tariff has been dealt with, to make a statement in regard to the Government's intention.",17
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"As preliminary to asking a question of the Postmaster General, I desire to call attention to paragraphs 68 and 69 of the report of the Cabinet Committee laid on the table last night. Paragraph 68 informs us that in 1901 certain expenditure was necessary to .bring the system to a state of efficiency j and it is there shown that"" such expenditure would amount to ^462,485. Then paragraph 69 goes on to say, in reference to that expenditureThe information supplied shows it was recognised as impossible to provide the necessary funds from the annual revenue, and that it was made very clear to the Department that unless money could be borrowed these necessary works could not be undertaken, as it could not then be made available out of"" revenue. The telegraph and telephone systems are, - with certain exceptions, little better, so far as construction is concerned, than when they were taken over. I desire to ask the Postmaster-General how he reconciles that statement with the facts that the Commonwealth, from 1901 up'to the present time, has- I sm speaking from memory-returne d to the States out of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise Revenue something like ^6,000,000^ which might have been expended by the Commcnwealth, and that for seven years past the amount returned has averaged,£800,000 a year. How does the Postmaster-General reconcile those facts with the statement that the necessary funds cannot be supplied from annual revenue?",17
40,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Onl y by the fact that these Estimates had to be censored by such a Treasurer as the right honourable member for Sw.an, that the money required by the Department was not supplied, and hence went into the revenues of the States.",18
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That statement is surely not correct.,18
42,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether in view of the huge expenditure reported by the Cabinet Committee to be necessary to place the Post and Telegraph Department on an efficient footing, he will consider the adviseableness of amending his scheme with respect to the annual payments to be made to the States at the expiration of the Braddon section ?",18
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I do not think that it would be wise at this stage to state exactly what the Government are prepared to do.,18
44,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Surely the honourable member will say whether or not he is prepared to stand by his scheme?,18
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I stand up for my -.scheme just as I always stand up to the honourable member.,18
46,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Wit h poor results in each case.,18
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I beat the honourable member every time - I can only say that the scheme was prepared in' the light of the financial conditions of the Commonwealth as then disclosed, and that it may or may not be necessary to slightly vary it. The matter, will be taken into consideration as the. negotiations with the States proceed. ' ' ' TENDERS: BRITISH PREFERENCE.",18
48,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I desire so to ask the Prime Minister a question in reference to tenders for the supply' of goods required by the Government Departments. I wish to know if he has made inquiries, ahd has come to the promised decision, as to whether the preference given to British manufacturers is that approved by this House, and approved, for the most part by Ministers?",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I have not yet received tht replies, but I ' shall ask that they may be expedited. OPIUM SMUGGLING. DEPORTATION OF CHINESE.",18
50,Mr MALONEY,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In reference to the paragraph published in the press to the [410] effect that three Chinese in Sydney were recently fined ^ 2 5 0 each for smuggling opium, I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the owners of the P r i m Valdemar, by which they arrived here, will be held answerable for their return to their native country after they have served the term of twelve months' imprisonment ordered, in default of paynjent of the fine. I see no possibility of their being able to pay the fine, and I am led to put this question because I know that if any person who has paid his fare by sea to Hong Kong on arrival there becomes a charge upon - the rates he is returned to his native country .at the expense o: the owners of the vessel by which he arrived.",18
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Every care will be taken to see that those who were responsible for bringing these men to Australia do not in any way evade their responsibility. VISIT OF AMERICANFLEET .,18
52,Mr MATHEWS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, who is chairman of the southern section of. the Committee appointed to arrange for the reception of the American Fleet, whether it is true, as rer ported in today's issue of the Age,' that St. Kilda has been selected as the official landing place in this State? Further, I wish to know whether the Committee has given due consideration to the fact that Port Melbourne, which has a pier capable of accommodating any of the visiting vessels, is a preferable landing place? r . Mr DEAKIN - So far as I am aware, no such decision has been arrived at' The question was considered at a meeting of the Southern Committee this morning, but far as a decision was arrived at, it does not support the theory of the honourable member. CLOSE OF THE SESSION,",18
53,Mr MCDONALD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to endeavour to close the session by the end of next week, and whether, in order to accomplish that object, he will consider the desirableness of asking the House to sit later than usual on Friday next, and also to meet on Monday ?.",18
54,Mr DEAKIN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I shall be very glad to have the assistance of honourable members in closing the session as soon as possible, and in sitting, if necessary, on the extra day suggested. Every effort will be 'made by Ministers to close the session, ! but I cannot fix the exast date upon which we may hope to achieve that object ",18
55,Mr MCDONALD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I think that the Prime Minister somewhat misunderstood motion the nature of my question.

57,Mr STORRER,CABLE COMMUNICATION WITH,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether the necessary money is available to permit of the acceptance of a tender far the laying of the'cable House showingbetween the mainland and Tasmania, and of the completion of"" the work before the present contract expires? I think that that course is very necessary in order to insure that Tasmania shall not be cut off from cable communication .with the rest of the Commonwealth. ' Mr Mauger - My honourable colleague, the Treasurer, proposes to ask the House to vote the necessary money for the completion of the work in question, and the tender accepted will of course be subject to the approval of Parliament.

COLLECTION OF MAILS BY MOTOR. . - Mr BATCHELOR - I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that the experiment of collecting mails in the various cities by means of motors is said to have been only a qualified success, ahd tiiat instructions have been issued that the old system of employing mail carts shall be reverted to? . Mr Mauger --Quite the opposite is the case. In Melbourne the' experiment has proved an unqualified success, and in Adelaide I believe that it will be a success when the officers become well acquainted with the work. ' LETTER CARRIERS.

Does he consider this a reasonable test, that letter-carriers have to learn three know 1,500 box holders, and then learn postal towns in their own time under three months ?",19
59,Mr MAUGER,CABLE COMMUNICATION WITH,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows1. Enquiry is being made with regard to the instance referred to. It is known, however, that the practice in this respect varies in different States, and the Postmaster-General, having decided to adopt a rniiform system, the matter was remitted for the consideration of the Conference of Deputy Postmasters-General now sitting in Melbourne.

CUSTOMS TARIF F BILL. In Committee. (Consideration of Senate's message concerning requested amendments cable resumed from 26th May, vide page Item 123. Piece Goods, viz. :- . . . . (B) Piece Goods, woollen, orcontaining wool, viz. :-Women' s and Children's Dress Goods not weighing over 5 ozs. per square yard, ad val.. (General Tariff) 35 per cent., and on and after 13th November, 1907, 15 per cent.; (United Kingdom) 30 per cent.,' and on and after 13th November, 1907, 10 per cent. Senate's Message - Modificatio n inserting the' words ""including women's and children's - dress flannels"" after the words ""dress goods"" not agreed to, and request pressed that the words ""viz.:-Women' s and children's dress goods"" be left out. Upon which Sir WILLIAM LYNE had movedThat the requested amendment be not made.",19
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Trea surer) [3.10] - Las t night the question raised in connection with this item was whether the words which the Senate desired to be eliminated ought to be excised or not. It seems to me that the question involved is whether 5 ounces per square yard is a fair weight to prescribe in the case of the materials specified. During the debate it was suggested that the weight should be increased from s ounces to 8 ounces per square yard. That would be a very unwise course to adopt. It was also suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo that the whole item should be struck out. I desired that course to be adopted, but seeing that this matter was brought forward in the first instance by the honourable member for Melbourne, who was absent from the House last night on account of illness, I moved that progress should be reported, with a view to affording him an opportunity of being present today. I desired that he should be in a position to make any statement to the Committee that he chose in regard to this matter. Mr MALONEY. (Melbourne) [3.11] I hope that the Committee will not make the amendment. requested by the Senate. In justice to the honourable member for Bendigo, who cannot attend-at the present moment because of the meeting of a Committee, I wish to read the following telegram which has been sent to him from BallaratYou are risrht. If this is carried as Senate propose, door will be opened wider for mission free of goods suitable clothing. Think ought certainly contain words "" women's children's dress goods,"" unless strike out clause - GRAINCER. : That manufacturer objects to the striking out of the words "" women's and children's dress goods."" This is the reply to a letter which 1 sent to the Victorian Chamber Manufactures when the Senate refused to accept the decision of this ChamberDear Sir, Your letter desiring to know if the alteration made by the Senate omitting "" Women's and Children's Dress Goods"" in item i2.jB will against the interests of the. woollen manufacturers, was placed before a meeting of the torian woollen manufacturers this afternoon, and, in reply, I beg to inform you that omission of those words from the item will act prejudicially against the woollen manufachand. turers, in view of the fact that the weight has not been increased. If the weight had increased it would have been a serious matter for the Australian worsted and tweed manufaceven turers, as it would have allowed the tropical tweeds to have come in at a very low duty ",19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The paragraph could be altered to deal with tweeds. [ 4 I 0 > -2,20
62,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Ha d the weight been increased, every manufacturer in Australia would have objected. On the 24th April I received this letter from - the same sourceDear Sir', Referring to my letter of the 14th inst. re the alteration made in the Senate omitting Women's and Children's Dress Goods in item 123B, I desire to say that I.was only referring to tweeds when I said that-the omission of the words would not act prejudicially against the woollen manufacturers, the weight not having been increased. If , of course, there is any fear of light weight flannels being classed under the item referred to, there is distinct objection on the part of the woollen manufacturers to omitting the words "" Women's and Children's Dress Goods,"" because flannels are manufactured in Australia much lighter than 5 ozs. per square yard. I have here, and offer for the inspection of honourable members, samples of Australian flannel, which are very good indeed. The request of the Senate was carried by only one vote, and I have since spoken to two senators who voted for it because they'thought that no distinction should be-made between men's and women's apparel. However, they now see the reason for the distinction, and if the matter comes before the Senate again, will vote on the other side. Most of these materials are made in Germany, Belgium, or ' France, and, although the United States of America have the most scientific Tariff in the world, with adduties on these light fabrics running from 60 per cent, upwards, their manufacturers and cannot compete with the countries I have whole named. Women folk will follow fashion. It is not a question of hundreds, but of thousands of designs when Dame Fashion nods her head. . On a former occasion, I tried to obtain a good definition of "" flan-"" of nel,"" and found that, according to a variety of authorities, from the British Encyclopaedia down to the latest standard r4th April, igoS. dictionary, the term comprises any woollen material loosely woven, and will include baize, blankets, and tweeds. That, however, is not the ordinary use of the word, act and any person wishing to buy a yard of Vicflannel would not expect to be given any of the brightly-coloured materials which I the have in mv left hand. They would'expect not to get material such as I hold in my right Of course, either material could be been used for underwear, though the patterns which I showed first are rather. startling, for pyjamas; those which any one would recoenise as flannels are much more suitable, and certainly cheaper, the. prices running from 6 f d . to 8£d. It is sometimes said that only the .well-to-do buy fine materials; but a promenade on the banks of the Yarra any Sunday afternoon will show that the daughters of the workers wear good materials, similar to the samples wear. I have here. I know every capital in the world, except St. Petersburg and Constanthe tinople, ancl have observed that the women of Australia are as well dressed is the female population of any other country. In Bond-street, Oxford-street, and, perhaps-, the Strand, London, one may see better-dressed women; but in no other street of the world'smetropolis will you find the women generally as well dressed as those to be seen in George and Pitt beyond our power. streets, Sydney, or in Collins-street, Melbourne. It is absolutely necessary to tain the words "" women's and children's ""dress goods."" Australian manufacturers make very fine tweeds, of which these produce are splendid samples. They long to the honourable member for Bendigo; but I have his permission to use them. The lighter tweeds are for wear in northernparts of the Commonwealth, where the sun is stronger than here. There is no reason why ladies should not wear any kind of tweed worn by men if they dress in tailor-made costumes. It may be said that these tweeds could be used underwear. But no one who was not silly would so use them, seeing that splendid flannel, which serves much better, can be amendments. obtained for one-third the cost.

As the' honourable member f o i Melbourne is May."" present today, it cannot be said, as it said last night, that we are taking an unfair advantage of him. The provision inserted on his motion is quite unworkable. How can the Customs officers follow goods, once they have been passed through the Customs House, to see to what use they are put? If the words are left in, material will be gestion. imported as for the use of women and children, and used for other purposes.

67,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"In addition to rethe argument used by the honourable member for Parramatta, I would point out that this duty has been carried by both I Houses, and the proposal, if adopted, bewould prevent a validation of the collection of the duties.

68,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I suggest to the honourable member for Bass that he, in the first place, should confine his proposal to the end - of the wording of the item. I have no special rule to guide me in this prof o r cedure. I may point out, however, that we first sent the Tariff to the Senate, from which it was returned with requested To some of those amendments this Committee could 'not agree, while The adSenate have again returned the Tariff with further requested amendments; and, under the circumstances, as the Houses appaa rently disagree, I think that the honourable member for Bass would be quite in in moving that the whole item be Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",21

70,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I agree with that sug,21
71,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I think that, calm reflection, the Committee ought to verse their previous decision. With the best of intentions, the honourable member for Melbourne submitted this item in amended form. His idea is to benefit the poorer classes; but I believe that, in actual practice, the honourable member's generous desires will not be realized. These lighter tweeds are really superior tweeds, and fancy they will be admitted at the reduced duty', mainly to the benefit of persons means.

If the item were struck out, that course would be-of great advantage and benefit, but as it stands, it will, say, mar the general scheme .of duties, and open the door to the admission of large quantities of goods, which, I am sure, the honourable member for Melbourne does not desire to see admitted at the lower rates. I have been assured by manuitem facturers that it will be impossible to the operation of the item as amended women's and children's piece goods of the weight prescribed. I have here a number of samples of 5-oz. tweeds.",22

77,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I do not know Probably whether they come from the United Kingdom or from France, but they are all suitable for men's clothes as well as f o women's and children's clothes. If an porter desired to pass an entry for such on goods, as for the use of women and rechildren, the Customs officer would be obliged to admit them, though there is no doubt they could just as easily be used in its making men's clothes. In 'this way the revenue might suffer, and Australian manufacturers would be discouraged from entering on the manufacture of these light - woollen goods, which may in course of I time be produced here. Under the circumstances I think we ought to reconsider of the matter, and place all woollen goods under one common rate of duty. There could then be no disputes at the Customs 5 House, the revenue could not be defrauded, and Australian manufacturers would have field in the production of all classes",22

81,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"But the object of 30 the Tariff is to introduce a developmental policy. We do not impose high duties merelv for the purpose of assisting in the as I production of low-grade tweeds, but also with the object of encouraging the manufacture of superior tweeds. How can' we expect manufacturers to launch out in such a direction if these superior tweeds are admitted at a lower rate of duty ? The as it stands at present is a blot on limit the Tariff, and before long we may have to - another agitation for a revision.",22
82,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,What about those industries-suc h as the production of oil or the making of wire-netting-whic h those tweeds enjoy no protection?,22
83,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I should like to see this Tariff last for ten or twenty years to come, and the less satisfactory our work now the greater the possibility of agitation. I feel more interested in , and anxious about, the development of the woollen industry than of any other indusr try within - the four corners of the Tariff. imI t is essentially an Australian industry, and ought to be established on a secure and enduring foundation, such as we cannot expect if the item be left as at present.",22
84,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Melbourne) [3.39] The honourable member for Bendigo was not present when I read communication's, including one from Mr Grainger, the manager of one of the woollen mills in Ballarat. That gentleman distinctly said that he did not desire the Senate's amendment-that he desired the words ""women's and children's "" inserted, or the item struck out. When the Senate removed the words ""women's and children's dress goods"" 1 took the precaution to write to the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures to ascertain what difference the - amendment would make. In reply, I received the two letters which I have already read. I know of no one who is better able thar is the honourable member for Bendigo to frame a further modification to overcome the difficulty. If he would propose the insertion of such words as ."" not being tweeds,"" I think that the position would be met. The samples of tweed exhibited by the honourable member for Bendigo are very fine, and I thought that they were of Australian manufacture. No one will deny that they are suitable for a.woman's garb just as serge is used for tailor-made gowns. They are altogether different frorii the samples that I .have produced. These light goods are used as dress materials by many women workers. If the honourable member for Maranoa has any misgivings on that point I am prepared to take him to the Yarra Bank on any Sunday afternoon he pleases, and to show him there scores of working women so attired. . Mr STORRER (Bass) [3.43]--In order to validate the collection of duty already made under this item, I move That the following modification be added but that the words "" up to and including 27th May, joo8,"" be added to the duties in each column.",23
85,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Dalley) [3.44] - Ap parently the honourable member for Bass desires to strike out the item as it stands, and at the same time to validate the collections of duty already made under it. If the item were struck out these goods would be dutiable at the higher rates of. 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. The honourable member may desire them. to be dutiable at those rates, but in the matter of apparel and food supplies, I have throughout been voting for the lowest possible duties, believing that if there is to be any discrimination we should move in. that direction. Apparently the honourable member for Melbourne desires that these goods which must be imported,, and cannot be manufactured here, shall be dutiable at the lowest possible rates;",23
86,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"What cannot be manufactured here should be admitted free, and would be but for the financial considerations involved by the Braddon section.",23
87,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The - honourable member desires that goods which cannot be manufactured here shall be dutiable at very low' rates, but I think that he had still another object in view in proposing the insertion of the words, . "" not weighing over 5 ounces per square yard."" His original desire in moving that amendment was that the poorer classes should .have an opportunity to obtain at low prices fancy dress materials of this description. I have reason to believe, however, that his desire t'o specially benefit the poorer section of the community will not be effected by his' proposal. In the winter the dress materials worn by rich and poor alike all weigh more than 5 ounces to the square yard, so that whether he desires it or not, the poor as well as the rich will have to pay upon such goods duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., since they come under the item ' "" piece goods n.e.i."" Under that item rich and poor alike will be penalized. In the summer, however, these goods of light texture, which are made principally in France, are used by women in all classes of society, and therefore the proposal 'to impose lower duties only in respect of materials of a certain weight will not specially benefit working women.",23
88,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"If I knew of any more effective way of differentiating between' the duties on goods not made here and those :- on goods that are made here, I should adopt it, but I do riot. This is not a question of rich and poor.",23
89,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"As the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed out, when different rates of duty are imposed on goods of the same 'class, trouble constantly arises between the importers and the Customs officials, and the revenue will probably be defeated. It is the consumer, and not the importer, who has to pay the duty. Under the honourable member's proposal, the Customs' House officials would be compelled to openevery bale or case of goods imported to determine whether or not they contained only materials coming within this item. I should like all piece goods to be dutiable at 15 per cent, and 10 per cent., instead of at the higher rates provided. Such'an amendment would be consistent with our treatment of other industries. It is strange that the woollen industry should have been singled out for special treatment. I do not desire eliminate this item so as to bring the to which it relates under a higher scale duties, and if I cannot obtain anything ter I shall vote, in the interests public, for the proposal that women's and children's dress goods, not weighing 5 ounces per square yard, shall be dutiable at 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. would be preferable to the omission of whole item, which would cause these goods to become dutiable at higher rates another item. I should prefer to run the risk of importers being inconvenienced and the revenue being defeated rather than penalize"" the general public. The materials covered by this item are worn all over me Commonwealth. In the more tropical parts - of the continent these goods, which"" scribed as summer wear, are practically worn all the year round. Failing any better solution of the difficulty, for the item as it stands, and oppose omission. I was hopeful, however, that figure. the ingenuity, of those experienced in matters would have devised a modification that would enable us to make certain piece terial. goods dutiable at a very low rate.",23
90,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Gippsland) [3.50] - When statement. the item of piece goods was originally before us, duties of 30 per cent, and 25 cent, were imposed, and hadit not been for the action of the honourable member Melbourne dress materials coming under the item which we are now considering would have been dutiable at those rates. The honourable member represented, howrate, ever, that they could not be made that a reduction of duty in their case would be in the interests of the the community. The alteration was accordingly made. I thought at the time that it was a mistake, and that belief was sequently confirmed .when I visited one the large soft goods houses in Melbourne, and heard men there scoffing at the gestion that this item"" would be in the . terests of the poorer classes. They pointed out, as the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed out today, it permits the more expensive goods to come in at a low rate of duty. Another conexhibited sideration is that this item will not beneficial even to British manufacturers It will be an advantage to the Continental manufacturer, and, as it stands, is utterly indefensible. It was made a good deal worse by the last amendment including in it dress flannels. I see no reason why this class of woollen goods should not be dutito able at the same rates as other woollens; goods and I shall strongly support either the of striking out of the item altogether or the betmodification proposed by the honourable of the member for Bass.  over ' who has travelled through Northern Queensland, as well as the northern parts That of New South Wales, I am sure, Mr . the Chairman, that you will bear out my statement that the dress materials worn by men under and women there are of much lighter texture than are those worn in Melbourne. If any one will be benefited under this item, it is the residents of those parts of the Commonwealth. Every other woman whom one - meets in any town in Northern Queensland is certainly not wearing a dress made of are dematerial costing 3s. 6d. per yard'.",24
91,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The cost would be I shall vote nearer is. 9d: per yard.  The honourable member for Melthese bourne wants to benefit ladies who can afford 3s. 6d. per yard for their dress ma,24

In his large-hearted wa y he is for seeking to benefit the wives and daughters of the workers by proposing that dress material weighing less than 5 ounces to the square yard shall be dutiable at a low but he will, really benefit the wealthier here, and classes of the community.",24

H a d subit come from me as a one-time free-trader of honourable members could have understood it. Like the honourable member for Dalley, sugI have had to put up an umbrella to keep inout of the wet. I am sure that the honourable member for Melbourne's proposal will not have the effect that he desires. that The honourable member for Bendigo has very properly pointed out that the materials by the honourable member for Melbe bourne, would-unde r the latter's proposal - be introduced as women's and children's goods. The same remark is equally applicable to the serge which I am wearing. I am sure that neither the Committee nor the honourable member for Melbourne desire that these materials shall be imported at a low rate of duty under the guise of women's and children's goods, and thus, come into competition with our woollen goods. I trust that the item will be struck out.",24
94,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Melbourne) [3.58] In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Gippsland, I wish to say that if I were asked to give a definition of a protectionist I would say "" He is a man who believes in absolute free-trade for what cannot be manufactured in Australia, and in absolute protection for what can be made in Australia."" No honourable member has yet contended that the goods which I have exhibited in this chamber can be made within the Commonwealth - As a matter of fact, they cannot be manufactured in America, which has the most scientific Tariff in the world. I am indebted to the honourable member for Bendigo for a publication which shows that they cannot be manufactured in Canada. The Textile Manufacturers' Journal of the n th April last contains the following reference in this connexionCANADA AND THE TARIFF. According to a recognised Canadian manufacof turing authority, 95 per cent, of these woollens - men' s wear and dress goods-come abroad, principally from England; n o woollen mills have failed or liquidated under the present policy, unable to meet the competition of imported merchandise, and that today there are only five mills in the entire country, of a size to command consideration, which are eking out a precarious existence, whose proprietors by the most rigid economy are able to operate on short time by taking advantage of the most up-to-date methods and by ability to make the most of any demand for new fabrics which may arise. . . . Many Canadian mills have been driven to the wall during the last five years. One is led to (lie inevitable conclusion that it is because of the preferential of from 25 to 30 per cent, which applies to all goods imported from Great Britain, and which puts the Canadian manufacturer into direct competition with the pauper labour of the English textile centres) while Canada is made the dumping ground of the cheap trash in which British manufacturers have such an advantage through their ability to manipulate successfully with cheap raw material and cheap labour. The materials to which I have directed the attention of honourable members cannot be manufactured in Australia unless it be by a Commonwealth workshop. I ask the honourable member for Maranoa to sav which of those materials cost 3s. 6d. per yard ?  about them.",25
95,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"As a matter of fact their prices range from is. 3d. to zs. 6d. per yard. ' Would the honourable member debar the wife of a working man from purchasing material worth' 7s. 6d. per yard if she desired to do so ? As a matter of fact, many of the wives of the workers wear silk fabrics. Why should they not do so ? No honourable member can declare that a particular fabric will be made into a garment which will be worn by a lady and not by a workwoman. Some of the highest ladies in the land dress in the simplest of garments. It is related that the late Queen Victoria once wore a dress which cost less than 7s. 6d. How can any honourable member urge that these materials will be used exclusively by one class? If I agreed-to increase the weight of the fabrics specified in this item, they would come into competition with our tweeds. I hope that the Com-mittee will not agree to strike out the item.",25
96,Mr COON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Batman) [4.5] - In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne I wish to say that I know some goods which can be manufactured in Australia, but which have been placed upon the free list. Does the honourable member think for a moment that the working women the Commonwealth desire to wear goods made by sweated labour abroad? That is s from what his argument amounts to.",25
97,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I did not say anything of the kind.,25
98,Mr COON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I understood the honourable member to say that these materials' were cheap.,25
99,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I said that if we imposed a duty upon them we should increase their cost.,25
100,Mr COON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"If we impose a duty upon them, they will not be imported. It is a fact that goods of this description-bu t of better quality-ar e already being made in the Commonwealth. Certainly they would be made here under a policy of new protection. The honourable member, however, desires that inferior goods-rrags-shal l be admitted free. Even the deputy leader of the Opposition will not endorse that proposition. He is.not in favour of sweating.' Yet the honourable member for Melbourne has declared that if we impose a duty upon these fabrics it will amount to a tax upon the working women of Australia, who will wear dresses made from them. I sav : "" Let them wear garments composed of materials made in Australia."" It is true that some of the shoddy exhibited by the honourable member cannot be made locally, and I hope that the time will never come when it will be made here.",25
101,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Does the honourable member call this ""shoddy""? He does not know what he is talking about. - Mr COON - I hope that the shoddy exhibited by the honourable member will never be made in the Commonwealth.

102,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Yes .,26
103,Mr COON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,It is strange that nobody has approached me in connection with the matter.,26

106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.10] - A great deal of information has been given in regard to this item during the course of the' debate this afternoon. When the matter was first brought forward by the honourable member for Melbourne my impression was that materials similar to those exhibited by him were not likelv to lie manufactured in the Commonwealth, but I now understand that they are made at Parramatta, at Sydney, and, I think, in Tasmania.",26

114,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Bendigo) [4.17] As honourable members seem to be agreed that the amendment requested by the Senate should not be made, we might fairly commence by refusing to make it, afterwards voting on the proposition of the honourable member for Bass.",26
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"If we deal with the motion of the Minister, it will close the consideration of the subject.",26
116,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Melbourne) [4.18] The only suggestion I can make is to insert the words "" not including tweeds or sergerettes,"" though I think it would be better to let the further consideration of the item stand over until the officers of the Customs Department have had an opportunity to draft .a suitable provision. It is difficult for laymen to deal with a question like this; but there must be some way of differentiating between dress materials and tweeds and sergerettes. ser- Sir JOHN QUICK - The exclusion of here. tweeds would not exclude worsteds. , not . Mr MALONEY - All these materials in are made from worsteds, the difference being that flannel is loosely woven, while their manufactweed is tightly woven.",26
117,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Melbourne Ports) [4.21] - The provision relating to weight was agreed to with a view to the imposition by of high duties on material not manufactured the Commonwealth; but if it .cannot be retained in its original form, I shall vote for the .proposition of the honourable member for Bass, because I do not wish to run the risk of allowing the importation of materials which can be made here. In my opinion, the honourable member for Melbourne might let well alone. The Senate may not agree to the retention of the words "" women's and children's dress goods,"" and, therefore, may oppose a proposal equivalent to the striking out of the item, so that the best way to meet it might be to insist on our original proposition.

At the present moment what are termed high speed engines are made by only three or four firms in the world. This information is given to me by the Comptroller of Customs. It is not desired that steam engines should be imported in a way not intended - by Parliament, and, therefore, the provision for. departmental by-laws is made.",28

It seems to me that the .conditions that we are imposing upon the under this Tariff are equally harsh. If there is an industry in the Comin monwealth which is worth building up, it is this one. Yet a constant desire is exto whittle down the protection acto corded to it. It is urged as a reason why we should not extend to it increased protection, that at present we do not make certain machinery here. But* surely our desire is to establish a bigger industry than that which we now possess.",30
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,That may be carried a long way.,31
172,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"It is a perfectly sound argument. We can make locomotives in Australia, which are more complicated than is any other class of machinery.",31
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"We admit steamengines free. - Mr BATCHELOR - That argument is typical of honourable members representing Western Australia. In the first place, they propose that high-speed reciprocating engines shall be admitted free, and, having obtained that concession, they immediately exclaim, "" Why should we stop at steamhighly engines? Why should not gas and o i l engines be included in the same category .The fact is that the Committee ought not differently from steam-engines? to have given way to them in respect of steam-engines. If we do not intend to bring about another revision of the Tariff an earlv. date, we must treat the engineercern ing trade fairly. It cannot be contended that there is any difficulty in making gas and oil engines within the Commonwealth.",31
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The honourable member did not hold that view when the timber industry was under consideration. "" Mr BATCHELOR - Is the timber insons dustry an engineering trade? No Tariff can be framed so scientifically as to afford protection to everything which may possibly be produced in the country. We have to gauge probabilities, and to look at the relative importance of the industries to built up. From that stand-point the engineering industry is a most important one.

The)' argue that if high-speed reciprocating steam-engines are to be admitted at 5 per cent, and free under the General Tariff and the Tariff for the United Kingdom respectively, other engines which are worked by gas and o i l . ought to be admitted on the same terms. In some parts of Australia wood is very scarce, and beargument coming scarcer, and in such places gas-and oil engines are most valuable. Therefore some good reason should be advanced for this proposal to treat them differently from steam-engines. It may be said that high speed reciprocating steam-engines are not made in the Commonwealth, and therefore should not be dutiable at any but a very low rate. - Mr BATCHELOR - They are made in the Commonwealth, though not largely made.",31

If so, and their manufacturers can be protected without taxing too the industries which use them, some protection might reasonably be given; but ?"" if not, why should these engines be treated I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that the use to which engines may be put at is not a matter with which we should conourselves. It is unreasonable to impose the condition that, to come in at a low rate, engines must be directly coupled to electric generators or to pumps. Those who import engines should be allowed to use them as they may think best. I appeal to the Committee not to penalize the great mining industry merely to encourage perto enter into a business in which they have not yet seen fit to engage.

The' to point is a simple one,' and it is a mistake to describe it as a matter affecting the privileges of this House, or those of anflict involved. other place, because it relates really to a mutual privilege. When the two Houses have agreed on any one point arising ing, the consideration of a Bill , that point settled, so far as that Bill is concerned, cannot be re-opened on that Bill by either House. The honourable member for North Svdney may be said to be standing up for rights of another place, as well as for those of this House, because on some other occatirely sion we might seek to abuse the privileges of another place by endeavouring to dotional that which the Senate is now doing.

I regard this matter as very important. Gas meters which are imported already made up, as distinct from parts, will, if the proposal of the Treasurer be carried, be subject to another rate of duty, under the heading of metals and machinery; and the result will be to open up a question which has never been in dispute between the two House's j indeed, it will re-open the whole of the Tariff to discussion.",39

More than once during the discussion of the Tariff,- the Chairman has said that he has no perfectly framed Standing Orders to meet the circumstances, and, in consequence, there have been strange rulings - from time to time. A little while ago the Chairman gave a ruling, the basis of which was that our desire, in considering the suggestions of the Senate, was to circumscribe area of debate as much as possible; in other words, that our whole purpose, in considering these suggestions, is to narrow the circle of matters in issue' as between the two Houses.

Any increase in the number of hands must have been due honourable simply to the larger number of meters required ; and, of course, that, in turn, was due to the growth of population, in r\ ew T I object to the - proposal of the Senate, because it' simply offers a premium to the patentees and agents -.of meters, who have branches here, to increase the price to the amount of the duty, In Svdney, where the wet meter is mostly used, .the patentees have a branch, as had w.hen there was no duty at all, and under the duty of 12 per cent.

278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"It will be seen, therefore, that the two items are closely allied, and it would be anomalous to have one dutiable and the other free. This is 1 also purely a protective duty, the articles in question being manufactured in large quantities in the Commonwealth. It may further be stated that many of these standards, pillars, and droppers are Australian ideas, of which local manufacturers hold the patents.",41
279,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"But this is a question of wedgers for droppers. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The whole of these ""articles ought to be included in one group. It is with a view to placing them in the same category as fencing droppers, which are dutiable at 17J per cent, and 12 J per cent., that I propose that we should ajjree to the request of the Senate.",41
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Swan) [8.12], - In declaring that this item has-reference to droppers, the Treasurer fell into an error. It relates only to wedgers for droppers. ' The request which has now been made by the Senate for the second time is cne'which evidences no regard for the decision deliberately arrived at by this Committee upon two previous occasions. I do not know where this House will ultimately find itself if the Senate persists in requesting that duties shall be imposed three times as great as those which this Committee has declared to be sufficient.",41
281,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,We ought to stand up to the Senate.,41
282,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"We do not ' want to fight, but really the other branch .of the Legislature has made a most extraordinary demand. It is not as if its members' had given this particular matter any very great amount of thought, because we' know that very little time was occupied in discussing it .",41
283,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The request Senate does not represent a fair compromise.,42
284,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"It does' not. Upon two occasions we have declared that thearticles enumerated in this item shall be dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and shall be admitted - free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom; and it is not reasonable therefore that the Senate should insist upon pressing its request for duties of 17J and 1 2 per cent, 1 respectively. But, unfortunately, we have a Government in power which is prepared to support all requests for higher duties whether the rights of this House are invaded or not. The Treasurer does not endeavour to meet the views expressed by this Committee",42
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I want a Tariff.,42
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The Treasurer wants to obtain something which this Committee has declared it will not sanction. To-night he wishes us to reverse our former decision under compulsion from another place.,42
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The right honourable member wants to provoke a conflict with the other House.,42
288,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I desire to assure the Treasurer that I do not. am a strong advocate of the rights and privileges of the Senate, and I do not desire to detract from them one iota. At the same time, I am not in favour of sacrificing the rights, and privileges, of this Chamber. I am not prepared to .agree to requests made by the other branch of the Legislature which completelv ignore the opinion deliberately expressed by this Committee upon two distinct and separate occasions.  northern portion of the State which I represent, droppers and standards are used very extensively for fencing purposes. In certain localities they are used because of the scarcity of timber, and they are also used in country where the timber is attacked by white ants. Yet we are asked to impose a duty of 17 J per cent, upon these articles, which have merely to be cut into lengths. As a matter of fact, tons of them can be turned out daily by one man or boy with the aid of a machine. It is essential that in portions of the Commonwealth such as I have indicated the settlers should be able to obtain these materials at the lowest possible cost. I know thousands of miles of country"" which will not maintain more than of the 30 or 40 sheep per mile, and upon these large areas the cost of fencing is a considerable item. In addition, the lessees have to wire-net their holdings to protect them from vermin. Under all the circumstances I think that the least the Treasurer can do is to support the decision at which the Committee has twice previously arrived.",42
289,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"East Sydney) [8.19] - I do not think that the Treasurer should accuse honourable members of wishing to bring about a collision between this House and another ""place. Such references are most undignified. I think that the honourable gentleman will agree with me that it belittles the dignity of the House to have remarks of that character thrown across the chamber. This incessant reference to possible conflicts with another place is in the worse possible taste, especially in connection with insignificant items, and in view of the fact that the differences between the two Houses in respect of practically all the large items have already been adjusted. I do not anticipate anv difficulty in securing a settlement of this Tariff, seeing that most of the big questions have been amicablv disposed of. When the Treasurer talks about standing up for the rights of this I House at the proper time, he_ means that he will ' do so when it suits him. May I remind him of the fact that the - Government of which he was a member-wit h our lamented, friend the late right honourable member for Adelaide, who was Minister of Trade and Customs at the time, and who was as staunch a protectionist as ever lived in Australia - propose d that these articles should be free. The Treasurer and his colleagues, in the interests of the Australian people, actuallv proposed that they should be admitted free.. They have been admitted free ever since 1902. In the present Tariff the Government, with a view to extending a preference to the Mother Countrv, proposed that they should be dutiable at 5 per cent, under . the general Tariff and free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission also recommended that they should be admitted free. This Committee has declared upon two previous occasions that they shall be dutiable at 5 per cent, under the .general . Tariff/ and free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Yet - we are' now asked by the Senate to increase that duty more than threefold-to impose a. duty of 17J per cent, under the general Tariff, which is an increase of more than 300 per cent. Surely all talk about the Senate trenching upon our rights and privileges in connection with the Tariff can have no weight whatever, when it proceeds from men who are prepared to agree to requests by that Chamber for duties which represent increases of 300 per cent, upon their own proposals. The request under consideration is a monstrous one if this Committee is to have any voice at all in determining the duties to be levied under this schedule.

Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed- . That the requested amendment be not made. - Mr HUTCHISON -(Hindmarsh) [8.30] - I hope that the Committee will negative the motion, and make the requested amendment. When the matter was last dealt with, there was a misunderstanding, because the Minister was not rightly heard, many honourable members thinking that he had agreed to make linseed free. In South Australia, a firm has spent ;£ 15,000 in putting down a plant, and making' other preparations for the manufacture of paint, and those connected with it. have informed me that not one gallon of locally-made linseed oil has ""been AYES. offered to them.",42
290,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"We do not grow sufficient linseed. Mr.'HUTCHISON - That is so. The original request of the Senate was to make linseed free,"" provided that, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient linseed oil for - manufacturing purposes was not being produced in Australia. No one could object Teller's:-' to such a provision as that; but, surely we are not going to handicap our paint manufacturers by causing them to pay duty NOES. on oil which they must import. The hon-"" Liddell, F . orable member for Mernda .says' that linseed oil is made in the Commonwealth; but only very little of it is. made. Tf I were certain that in the near future sufficient for manufacturing paint could be obtained locally, I should not object to a duty; but we should not put our manufacturers of paint at a disadvantage with those df other countries, whose paints are adulterated with barytes to an extraordinary degree.",43
291,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"We placed a high duty on paint, because it was urged that the paint manufacturers, had to pay PAIRS. duty on their oil.",43
292,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The manufacturers of paints were under the impression"" that they would get their oil free. In London, sienna is sold at from £&o to £%4 per ton, but within the Commonwealth, it is sold for £ 3 0 , showing that the imported sienna is greatly adulterated. When last I spoke on this subject, I , .was in error as to the quantity of oil used a cwt. of paint, making it appear larger than it is, though - it is considerable. we have no evidence that linseed oil will be produced in sufficient quantities to the demands of our paint manufacturers, I think that it should be made, free the Department is satisfied that those mands can be supplied locallv.",43
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Tr'ea surer) [8.35] - I am surprised at the speech of the honourable member, because I know him to be a good protectionist. In matta, there is a company which, during the last two months, has made 3,000 gallons of linseed oil, and estimates make at least 2,500 gallons per month tive. hereafter. As we have granted a bounty for the production of linseed, we must tect those who embark in the industry. The Commonwealth should produce any quantity of linseed; but it will not be grown unless a duty is imposed. make linseed free would nullify the bountv. . Mr HARPER ' (Mernda) [8.38] - I hope that the Committee will not make the requested amendment. The Senate wish to insert a new paragraph, reading- ' Oil-Linsee d when denaturated as prescribed by Departmental By-law, free. I should like to know whether linseed oil is not denaturated when used in making absurd 1 paint. Parliament has granted a bounty of ^5,000 for the production of linseed, being grown? which must be used chiefly for making and practically the only use. for the is in connection with the manufacture of scale. paint. If we desire to encourage try for which this country is well suited, and which is already in existence-becaus not only is flax arid linseed being . grown r",44
294,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,In infinitesimal quantities.,44
295,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Quite so; and for the reason that the duty of 6d. per gallon too small. Owing to the fact that we ,£15,000 have so many products which may be used for cattle feeding, there is no market here for oil cake, which in Europe has become practically the primary product,' instead the oil. We are now trying to .improve conditions by giving a bonus on the seed; but here we have a proposal which, i carried, will mean doing away with the drily use to which the oil can be put. Sir JOHN QUTCK ' (Bendigo) [8.42]. - The argument of the honourable member for Mernda is quite unanswerable. I should in also like to point out that the scheme of duties on paints and colours .is based on As the assumption that' there is to be a duty of 6d. per gallon on linseed o i l ; and if meet linseed oil be made free, then we shall have to revise the whole of the other until duties. However, I do not altogether derely on that argument. The honourable member for Mernda has shown us that the ' production of linseed oil is one of the primary industries of the country-a n industry which Parliament has decided to Parraencourage by means of a bonus-and , therefore, the protective duty must remain unimpaired; otherwise, the bonus would be to reduced to a minimum or become inoperaThe Tariff Commission considered this matter very carefully, and did not see protheir way to admit the raw material free.",44
296,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Hindmarsh) [8.44]. - If there had been any likelihood of obtaining linseed oil locally hi any quantity To in the near future, I should have voted for a duty. As a matter of fact, however, there is so little possibility of linseed being grown to any extent, that we have decided to grant a bonus; and we have no information up to the present that there has been any real attempt to produce it in any . quantity.",44
297,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"That is absolutely,",44
298,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Where is . linseed oil, Mr HARPER - It has been grown in oil Gippsland for years, but only on a small an indus- - Mr HUTCHISON - Exactly, and there has been no appreciable increase e since the passing of the Bonus Bill. Surely we .ought not to handicap a big industry - Mr HARPER - Onl y mixing paint; that is all 1",44
299,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"There is one firm is in Adelaide alone which has recently spent. on this industry of "" only riiixing paint "" ; and it is one of the oldest and bestfirmsin Australia. The honourable member for Bendigo endeavoured to make me of appear to be departing from my protectionist principles; but I again point out that, in spite of the bonus, linseedis not f being produced in any quantity. My own opinion is that we shall be revising this Tariff again before linseed, oil is pro-; duced to any satisfactory extent within the ' Commonwealth; and I do not see why. we should handicap a large industry on the off chance of the bonus being effective. The honourable member for Mernda talked about denaturating the o i l ; and I took the trouble to ask the Treasurer to find out whether there was any likelihood of the oil being denaturated, if it could be easily clarified. I am informed that there is no difficulty about the denaturating, while the latter process is too costly; and, therefore, I think it would only be fair to accept the suggestion of the Senate.",44
300,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"East Sydney) [8.48] - The honourable member for North Sydney, who has followed the Tariff with great attention, informs me that the protection on paints was increased from 6d. to od. because of the particular duty under discussion. If we have given the manufacturers of paints increased protection on that account, . and if , as the honourable member for North Sydney informs me, this is a revenue duty, seeing that the article is not produced here, we are, in my opinion, entitled to the revenue duty to the extent to which we have increased the duty on the finished article. right in that, I am right altogether; if I am .wrong in that, I am wrong altogether. I am told that the duty on paints was increased because the manufacturers have to pay duty on the raw material. If the duty of 6d. or od. were taken off paints, I should vote for the proposal before us; but I am not going to present these manufacturers with any further advantage in the shape of protection. Then, again, we have offered a bonus for the production of linseed, and, since we have provided for the manufacturer, surely we can leave the lrenefit of that bonus to the grower? Under the circumstances, I feel that we should be simply depriving the Treasurer of revenue, if we supported the proposal which has been submitted.",45
301,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Bass) [8.50] - I am rather surprised at some honourable memlrers objecting to a duty on linseed, after we have arranged for a bonus on its production. I remind the. honourable member for Hindmarsh that the Bonus Bil l has been law for only a few months; and that, therefore, we cannot expect any great increase in production.",45
302,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Is the honourable member aware that for seven vears prior to Federation, the Victorian Government offered a bonus on the growth of linseed? '",45
303,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Tw o or three weeks ago I had a communication from one of my electors asking me how he should proceed in order to obtain the bonus on a quantity he had grown, so'that there can be no doubt that the bonus is increasing the production. But it would be absurd to give a bonus with one hand, and take away the duty with the other; because such a step would simply result in .the loss of revenue. I am"" astonished that the honourable member for Corangamite, who is such an upholder of the primary producer, should advocate free-trade in linseed.",45
304,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Melbourne Ports) [8.54] - The leader of the Opposition made a statement which leads me to think that he is "" slipping "" on oil. The right honourable member supports the retention of a duty of 6d. on linseed for the reason- , although he did not say this definitelythat he was afraid the manufacturers would get the benefit if the duty were removed.",45
305,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"No ; because we have added Lo the protection of the manufacturer of l f I am paints, on the faith of the duty on .linseed oil.",45
306,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The honourable member says so, but the duty on paints is: only 4s., and, as a matter of fact, there is a duty on both linseed oil and. burnt s:enna. The manufacturers now say that they are not in a good position to compete with. the imported paints. I believe myself that we ought to encourage'the manufacture of linseed o i l . . The Senate suggested that the linseed oil, when denaturated, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, should be free; but that would mean that no linseed oil would pay any duty whatever, seeing that all linseed oil is used in the manufacture of something or other.",45
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Why denaturate it, if it is only used in manufacturing ?",45
308,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"If the oil is to be used for.making paints, the addition of a little white lead would prevent it being used in the manufacture of soap, and so forth.",45
309,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Do they use' linseed oil for making soap ? Mr ' MATHEWS - So I am told. Under all the circumstances, I should like to move the elimination of all the words after the first '"" I , "" and the imposition of aduty of 4d. ' The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. BATCHELOR) - The honourable member cannot do that.",45
310,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The - Senate has made a certain request, and I thought I was entitled to move a modification.",46
311,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Is linseed grown at Port Melbourne ?,46
312,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"No ; but there are in my electorate many manufacturers who use linseed oil to a large extent. treating all manufacturers alike, and seeing that the Senate desires that linseed oil shall be free for certain purposes, I think that we might arrive at a compromise on the lines I have suggested. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - We have already determined that linseed oil generally should be dutiable at 6d. per gallon. That has been agreed to by both Houses. The only question before us relates to linseed oil "" when denaturated as prescribed by Departmental by-laws."" Any modification of those words would be permissible,' but the honourable member's proposal would re-open the whole question of the duty on linseed oil, which has already been decided upon.",46
313,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I bow, sir, to your decision.",46
314,Mr LIVINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Barker) [8.57I In the south-eastern district of South Australia flax has been produced, and some of the farmers have done remarkablv well with their crop. But until the quantity produced in Australia is sufficient to supply our own wants in the matter of linseed oil, I think that this item should be free.",46
315,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Melbourne) [8.58] Last night I had placed in my hands a letter from a Mr Hopkinson, of Svdney, setting forth that in a factory recently opened in New South Wales, 3>ooo gallons of oil are being produced every month. . - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The output is riOw 1,500 gallons per month; but after this it will increase fo 3,000 gallons per month.",46
316,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The statement in the man's own hand-writing is that the output of the factory is at present 3,000 gallons - per month, and that it is increasing. also states that nearly 100 hands are employed ; that there is every prospect of that number being increased, and that analyses . of the oil produced by him show it to be equal to that produced by Blundell and Spence, which is recognised all over the world as a standard oil.",46
317,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Where is the factory to obtain linseed for crushing?,46
318,Mr MALONE Y,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Linseed for oil-making purposes is admitted free, but the bounty on oil locally produced can be claimed only in respect of oil obtained from linseed grown in Australia. Mr Hopkinson goes on to state that he has been compelled, to sell his output at a very low price owing to the belief on the part of many people that the Australian oil is-not as good as the imported, and that the cost of the I believe in raw material here is greater and the wages paid higher than abroad. He states that the adoption of this request would mean the closing of the industry. I had some diffidence in quoting that statement in the absence of any further authority. But I would point out that we have empowered the Ministry to expend during a period of five years up to £ 5 , 0 0 0 by way of a bounty, equal to 10 per cent, on the value of oil made here from linseed. That being so, I fail to see how we could reasonably agree to this request. I recognise that linseed oil is the raw material of a number of industries, and that it is largely used in the mixing of paint, which gives employment to a number of people. White lead is used in the manufacture of paints, although the highest authorities in France say that the oxide of zinc preparation is better and healthier. I'am now informed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh thai there is a duty of 2s. per central on linseed.",46
319,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The seed is free, under departmental by-laws, when imported for the manufacture of oil.",46
320,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Then I fail to see how we could reasonably accept the Senate's request. We have agreed to a duty of 6d. per gallon on linseed oil.,46
321,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"And on the strength of that duty, the paint manufacturers were granted an increase in the duty on paints.",46
322,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I should have been prepared to support a request that linseed oil, when denaturated as prescribed by departmental - by-laws, should be dutiable at 3d. per gallon.",46
323,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Hindmarsh) [9.2] - The honourable member has seen fit He to change his view on this question because we have in New South Wales a manufacturer of linseed oil who states that he is likelv to increase his output if this request be not agreed to. It has been shown by the . honourable member for Corangamite that,, although the Victorian Government for seven vears offered a bonus on the production of linseed o i l , it did not tend to increase the output.",46
324,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,There was a decrease.,47
325,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"If the firm in New South Wales is going to increase its output ot oil, it - will have to obtain further supplies of linseed from abroad, and to pay a duty of 2s. per central upon it. Kir. TUDOR - No ; linseed for the manufacture of linseed oil is free.",47
326,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"At all events, it will have.to incur heavy costs in respect of freights. It will have to pay freight on all the waste product.",47
327,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,What there? ',47
328,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,On e cannot turn linseed wholly into oil. M.r. TUDOR - But oil cake is a good ' fodder.,47
329,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,O i l cake is not so valuable as the oil itself.,47
330,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The oil is now becoming a secondary product. . . Mr HUTCHISON - There has been no good reason advanced against this oil being allowed when denaturated to come in free until our production of linseed expands. The local output of linseed oil is not sufficient to supply the needs of the paint industry of Australia, and .1 hope that, if this request be rejected, the Senate will again insist upon its acceptance. "" Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [9.7] - Since honourable members have referred to the protection allowed to paint manufacturers in Australia, it is only .fair to consider what is the assistance now given to the producers of linseed oil . At page 185 of the Tariff Commission's report, it is shown that the average cost of linseed oil landed without duty in Australia, for a period prior to the taking of evidence by the Commission, was 2s. i d . per gallon. A duty of 6d. per gallon would bring up that price to 2s. 7d., without making allowance for all the charges, which must be very great, incidental to landing and distribution.",47
331,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,And it can chased in the Oid Country for is. n d . per gallon.,47
332,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,That is so. Under the Bounties Bill which we have passed the linseed-oil industry will be benefited.,47
333,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"No ; granted a bounty on the production, not of linseed oil, but of linseed.",47
334,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Then we have been arguing all the evening cn false premises The chief complaint made was that it was unwise to Erant a bounty, on trie production of linseed oil if . we were going to remove the duty.",47
335,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"We have granted a bounty on the production of linseed, and the honourable member is not prepared to give the linseed-oil mills a chance.",47
336,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,There is not much*-in the Minister's contention.,47
337,Mr HUMECOOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,It is the whole case.,47
338,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Then the Minister should agree tc the Senate's request. It must be admitted that there is a much larger number of people dependent on the making and using of paint than there is waste is upon the growing of linseed; and I hope that, in the interests of the paints of Australia, the Senate's request will be agreed to. I would point out to the honourable member for Mernda",47
339,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I am going to reply to the honourable member.,47
340,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The honourable member - has always urged, when asking for high protection for certain articles, that the higher the protection granted, the greater will be the local competition, and. the cheaper the price to the general consumer. I have heard that argument advanced by him when phenomenally high duties have been sought on certain articles. ' I ask him why should not the position be the same in regard to paints ? Paint is used by thousands in Australia, and yet the keenest opposition to this request comes from one of the strongest protectionists in the House. Surely the honourable member will see that what applies to one industry must apply to all.",47
341,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"It the honourable member understood the question, he would see that that is what wt do recognise.",47
342,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Then I stand corrected by the honourable member. I was under the impression that he compla'ned that we were granting too much protection.,47
343,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,No .,47
344,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Then I hope that the be purhonorable member will support those who desire to see the request of the Senate agreed to. If extra protection be extended to the local paint industry, it is obvious that it will cheapen the production of paint throughout Austral a. : we'' have Mr HUTCHISON - We admit linseed for manufacturing purposes free.",47
345,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Exactly .,47
346,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The honourable member is in a hopeless tangle. Will he allow me to explain?,47
347,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Certainly .,47
348,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Mernda) [9. n ] - I hope that I shall succeed in showing the honourable member for Wentworth the exact position. We have authorized the payment of a bounty to promote the growth of linseed in the Commonwealth. If that bounty succeeds, and if we induce persons to grow linseed upon a large scale",47
349,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"There are a lot of "" if s ' ' about the honourable member's statement.",48
350,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,There are not.,48
351,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"There are; because a bounty for the production of linseed was operative in Victoria for years, but without anv successful result.",48
352,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Then I will put the position in another way. Should the expectation which induced this House to grant a bounty upon .the production of linseed be realized, we shall have .a 'large quantity of linseed with no market for it unless mills are erected to convert it into oil. The bounty. is intended to encourage men to grow the seed, and the duty of 6d. per-gallon is intended to induce mills to utilize that seed. In the meantime, we admit linseed free with the obiect of encouraging mills to start operations, but we admit it free only until such time as they can be suppl ed by local growers. The . duty upon paints under this Tariff was increased because an impost of 6d. per gallon had been levied upon oil.",48
353,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,T t would be very difficult to crove that statement.,48
354,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The leader of the Opposition made it, and honourable members received circulars from the paint manufacturers to that effect. Having obtained the extra duty to wh ch I have referred, the paint manufacturers now have the hardihood to ask us to remit the duty upon their raw material.

355,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Yes . If would be folly to authorize the payment of a bounty to encourage the production of that article, \vh lst destroying the only means by which : it could .be utilized. I do not underrate the paint-mixing industry, but, after all, the great bulk of its raw material is imported. I recognise that those engaged in that industry are entitled to protection, md I voted to extend it to them. But, having conceded that protection, it would be extraordinary if we refused to protect the Original producer of the seed, and those who utilize it. , Mr WILSON (Corangamite) [9.15] - This is a question of great consequence to an important industry in South Australia. I am very sorry to say that the attempts which have been - made in Victoria to produce linseed have not been at all satisfactory. I defy any honourable member to say that they have.",48
356,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,For the simple reason that there was no outlet for the oil.,48
357,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Tba t is not the reason. The honourable member for Mernda has probably seen the works in Driffield, Yorksh re,- which manufacture linseed cake. : There the oil is a by-product, and the linseed cake is the product. The honourable member for Mernda desires to reverse that position. He wishes to make the oil the product, and the linseed cake the by-product, because, upon his own admission, we use very l ttle linseed cake in Australia. : It is a valuable product, but it is an unfortunate fact that it has not been manufactured here at a price sufficientlv low to permit of it being used economically.",48
358,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,It would be if we imposed a duty of 6d. per gallon upon the oil.,48
359,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"That would not have : the effect which the honourable member predicts, but it would certainly cripple another ' industry in South Australia.",48
360,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,And in other parts of the Commonwealth.,48

362,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Canno t we grow anything in Australia?,48
363,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Yes , but unfortunately there are some commodities that we cannot grow to make a commercial success of them. Until we can do that in the case of linseed why should we hamper another industry ? ' Mr HUME COOK - The honourable member should not forget that the Australian market is three times the size of the Victorian market.",48
364,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I know that perfectly . well.,48

367,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Do those districts grow enough linseed to produce two gallons of oil?,48
368,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The honourable member might as well say that we cannot grow wheat in Victoria.,49
369,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The honourable member andItem is exhibiting his strength upon this question . by telling me that it is just as easy to grow linseed as it is to grow wheat. May I form him that there is the ence in the world between the two things? bago I can grow wheat profitably, but when I started to grow linseed I made a heavy loss, and a lot of other persons in my own poseddistrict had a similar experience. I really think it is strange that on the present occa- sion I should agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh. But I do. I think that his contention is quite right.

370,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Hindmarsh) [9.21]. - It is a remarkable circumstance that honourable member for Mernda did not duce the arguments which he has advanced this evening when the proposal to admit linseed free for manufacturing purposes was under consideration. If it be true we ought not to admit the oil free ' we manufacture it, surely we ought not admit the linseed free because we are ing it. When linseed oil is being produced in the Commonwealth in anv quantity am willing that ' it shall be made dutiable.

Mr HEDGES (Fremantle) [9.26] I think that the Committee might agree to hope the proposal of the Senate, except as rethe gards "" plumbago.crucibles."" Unless the I word "" plumbago"" is struck out, great injury will be done to the mining industry of Australia, which employs from 120,000 to 150,000 men, on whom nearly every the item in the Tariff imposes a burden, aladthough the industry is helping the country, and has helped it ever since it has been worth living in. I have been informed to-night, by Mr H . H . Schlapp, one of that the. great authorities on the subject in the because Commonwealth, that where complicated to ores have to be dealt with, in places like growBroken Hill , Mount Morgan, and Kalgoorlie, the ordinary rough crucible, such I as might be made by a brickmaker, or a drain-pipe maker, is quite unsuitable, as canonly reliable crucibles can be used.",49
374,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Crucible s are made,49
375,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The ordinary potter's crucibles, produced in Australia, are not - sufficiently reliable for fine work, and, whatever the duty, the mining must import those that they use. into We should not hamper mining by inParcreasing the costof crucibles. The. plumbago crucible is used only for fine gold smelting, and brass melting, that generally used in connection with mining being made of clay. Not only have I the opinion a of Mr Schlapp ; but the views which I am expressing are those of all who have knowinledge of mining, and are supported by the not be Chamber of Mines; It must forgotten that Kalgoorlie produces remore gold than all the other fields in AusI tralia put together, including Bendigo, conBallarat, and Mount Morgan. Are we to set aside the interests of an industry givthe ing employment to thousands, in order to vote assist a potter who may employ two or three persons? The word ""plumbago"" should be struck out, and crucibles made free. I , therefore, move That the following modification be added :"" But that the word Plumbago' be left out.""",49
376,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Bendigo) [9-29]-As I had not an opportunity to speak on this subject when it was last before the - Committee, I wish to make a few remarks now. I think that had honourable members understood the questions involved, clay crucibles would not have been made free. Originally, all crucibles were dutiable under the Tariff, as introduced, at 25 per cent., which was the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, but the Committee, by a majority of four, placed them on the free list. The Senate requested that they be made dutiable at the rates charged on earthenware^ but the requested amendment was not made. Now the Senate submits a modified proposal which, if agreed to, will make plumbago crucibles and skittlepots, which are said not to be made in Australia, free, leaving clay crucibles dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent. I hope, that the Committee will agree to that. Clay crucibles can be made in any quantity, and of the best quality, in at least two of the States. When the Tariff Commission was sitting in Adelaide, Mr Joseph Provis, mining engineer and chemist, and general manager of the Kansurprised! garoo Island China-stone and Clay Company, gave this evidence-vol . 5, page 118, question 56293Gas retorts are made of fireclays. In tion, to that, we can make crucibles and muffles, and assayer's furnaces. A very large quantity proper one.. of these are also imported. I have one or two samples here of the fire-brick made self, and I want you to understand that they were not made by a practical potter or a practical brickmaker. I made them in my own ""tinpot way. They have been exposed to a temper of white heat for ten hours, andthere is no sign of vitrification. Here is also an assayer's crucible which I made, and that has stood the fire at white heat for about nine hours.",50
377,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Accordin g to that evidence, he seems not to have made them for sale. „",50
378,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"He has prepared them for sale, but they are imported so extensively that he has not had a chance of cutting into the market. The follow dence56323.

What do you say about them?-We can make these-ever y one of them given here. From experiments we have made, and experiments that others have made, we know we can 1 make equal to the best imported article. These materials are brought into the country very cheaply. 56325. Before I pass from fire-hricks, I want to know what duty you want on them ?-We ought to have 15 per cent, on fire-bricks. 56326. Go on to (c) now?-""Crucibles , scorifiers, roasting dishes, muffles, assay furnaces, and cupels."" These can be made here and of quite as good a quality as what we have from Home-in some instances better. The crucibles are introduced into this country very cheaply. At the present fime it does not give a man half a chance to make a crust of bread, if he only makes crucibles and scorifiers nnd roasting dishes. In England they are made by child labour almost, and brought out into this country free of duty. The freight is very little, and 15 to 20 per cent, would not be at all too much, and it would give us an opportunity of making these things, which are so extensively used in Australia. 56327. Vou produce a sample of them marked "" N "" ?-Yes . 56328. Is that a good sample?-That is a sample made on the mine, not by a potter. If a potter were to make a sample like that he would make a far better one. With regard to the shape, that has nothing to do with the quality. I assure you I burnt that crucible at white heat for nine hours, and there is not a sign of vitrification.",50
379,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I suppose he was rather,50
380,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"It is evident that honourable members from Western Australia do not like to hear these facts. I do not suppose that the furnaces or mines of r.ddiWestern Australia are beyond the white heat test, which, I understand, is the The following is another  56332. What suggestion have you to make with reference to these articles?- I think it is almost absolutely necessary for these things to be made in the States to put a duty of from 15 to 20 per cent, on them. If we were to do that I think we could make the whole of the scorifiers, the whole of the crucibles, and the whole of the muffles that are required in Australia. We have the material, and the material appears to me and to others that have tried it to be equal to the best imported article. That is the evidence in regard to the industry in South Australia; and I appeal to the representatives of that State to assist me in the encouragement of an industry which utilizes the raw material of the country. But Victoria is also Interested, and I am not reluctant to say that "" Crumy district is particularly so. In 1903-4 assay the Bendigo Pottery Company, which is managed by Mr G. D. Guthrie, entered on the manufacture of clay crucibles in connection with their old-established pottery works, and they have sent a circular to me drawing my attention to testimonials which have been received. The company have succeeded, under the old duty, in turning out very good crucibles for use in mining. The first testimonial is as followsBendigo, igth September, 1904. Messrs. G. D . Guthrie and Co., Bendigo Pottery, Epsom. Dear Sirs-We have much pleasure in stating that the clay crucibles you are supplying with for smelting and assaying purposes giving great satisfaction, and we consider them equal in every respect to the imported clay crucibles, a great many of which we have In future we intend placing all our orders you. Messrs. Duncan are authorities; and it will be seen that they testify to the ties of the locally-made article.

The great contention is that "" Morgan's crucibles should be admitted free-that crucibles of equal quality are Australia-bu t this testimonial shows that the Bendigo crucibles .are-, in every respect, equal to those imported.",50
381,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,How do the prices compare ?,51
382,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The prices are on. not mentioned; and I suppose there cannot be any great difference, or these tical men would have mentioned the fact. The last testimonial sent to this firm from Mr John Ebbott, manager of the sions,' Forest Creek Gold Reefs Company, Chewto ton, Victoria, who, under, date 24th vember, 1904. said that the last lot. crucibles which had been sent were the "" turning out splendidly."" crucibles are good enough for the'mines Victoria they ought to be good enough the mines of Western Australia. I afraid that a great deal of the opposition fo the local articles is founded on bigoted prejudice. There is such an indisposition to give them a trial that the Bendigo and South Australian crucibles have never yet been tested by the Western Australian mining companies. These' crucibles are used exclusively in the cyanide works at Bendigo.",51

The only alone ad- - for the production of crucibles capof standing the most severe those tests is that obtained at Battersea.

407,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Hindmarsh) [10.6]. - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie does not appear to know very much about the progress of this industry in Australia. I can refer honourable members to the work done by a firm that makes a specialty of the. manufacture of crucibles, muffles, arid scorifiers. The firm is the Staffordshire Potterv Company, of Royal Park, Alberton. Mr F. Meakin, the manager, saysWe have been carrying on for and our special ' lines are crucibles, muffles, scorifiers, & c , made of fireclay, which are largely used by assayers. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie says that if it can be shown that locally-manufactured crucibles will stand the test of work for mining purposes, the argument of those who oppose the present proposal must fall to the ground - I presume that the honourable member will be satisfied with a testimonial from such a companv as the Broken Hill Proprietary Block 14 Company Limited. That company gives the following testimonialThis is to certify that we have used the muffles made by the Staffordshire Pottery Company",53
408,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Surely the honourable member is aware that there is a very great difference between a muffle and a crucible?,53
409,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I shall come to the crucibles presently; but the honourable member is aware that muffles' and scorifiers as well-as crucibles are included in this item.,53
410,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,I was dealing with what the honourable member said a week ago.,53
411,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I shaTl stand by what I said a week ago, and. I shallgive the Committee some information from South Australia which I discovered in the meantime. Here we have a testimonial from the Broken Hill Proprietary Block 14 CompanyThis is to certify that we have used the muffles made by the Staffordshire Company for the past two years, and found them to be of excellent quality for all variety of work. Then the Sulphide Corporation Limited, because Central Mine, Broken Hill , saysWe have tested the sample scorifier that sent us, and find it quite satisfactory. might be still further improved on by being made thicker at the bottom; with that tion, there is no fault to find. Then we have the manager of the Mount Torrens Cyanide Works testifyingI have used two of - the samples sent, find them equal to any that we have had. am, therefore, recommending them to the Government. Then the Broken Hill Proprietary ""Company Limited sayThe samples which you forwarded to us are now being tested, and the results will justify our considering quotations from you when' we are next in the market. Mr Jas. James writesI have very much pleasure in stating that I have given your crucibles and muffles a very severe test when assaying, and the result is most satisfactory. I consider your crucibles and muffles quite equal to the best Battersea about six years, or any other make. What now becomes of the honourable member's claim about the merits of the Battersea clay? If this testimonial be not considered sufficient there is another from the English and Australian Copper Company.",53
412,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,That must be fifteen years old.,53
413,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"What difference . does that make? The same company is manufacturing the same articles today, and it is more than, likely that the work they turn out now is improved as the result of their experience.",53
414,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,This is very ancient history.,53
415,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The work of some of our industries that are centuries old has not been improved upon today, because it was so good originally that it has not been possible to improve upon it. I venture to say that the honourable member for Fremantle was engaged many years ago in the work in which he is engaged today, and will he tell me that his work as a contractor is not as efficient today as it was years ago? I have.no doubt'that as the result of the experience he ""has gained he will tell the Committee that he finds that he can do much of the work he has to do better today than he could do it some years ago. I have quoted testimonials to show that this firm produces crucibles which are considered to. be quite equal tp the best Battersea crucibles. The representative of the firm further saysWe have been benefiting the mining companies, if it had not ""been for us the prices of imported crucibles would have been higher. you It follows that if we impose a duty on . It crucibles that can be made here the price will be lower than it is at the present time. excepThe honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred to what I said last week, and in that connection I should like to say that the and amendment proposed would carry out preI cisely what I asked for then. I maintain .that skittle pots are not made in Australia. They are imported, I think, from - Glamorganshire.",53
416,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,The honourable member said that the locally-made crucibles would not stand the work required for the manufacture of bottles.,54
417,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I was referring to skittle pots, and the amendment meets the objection I raised at the time. We have manufacturers in South Australia who do not wish to send to the Old Country for these unwieldy articles, and they offered to pay double what it would cost to get them from the Old Country. The firm to which I refer would not guarantee that they could make them equal to the imported article, but were prepared to try to do so. They would not take an order for a dozen, but they accepted an order for four to make a trial, as up to the present they have not been able to make skittle pots satisfactorily. In connection with the manufacture of the ordinary clay crucibles I have proved to demonstration that we can manufacture articles equal to those imported from any other part of the world. Now, as to the reason given by this firm for the exclusion of the plumbago crucibles, Mr Meaki'n gave the following evidence on the subject- What do you think is the reason why plumbago crucibles are preferred in a great many of the works engaged in the production of ores? - Because they are better than the fireclav. .And more expensive?-Yes , very much more. Is not Hie importation of crucibles from Battersea or Lambeth, as the case may be, particularly confined 10 plumbago crucibles?-No . The firm is quite prepared to admit that plumbago crucibles are able to stand tests which the ordinary clay crucibles will not stand. I need not further occupy the time of the Committee. I have shown that the ordinary crucible can be manufactured of a quality good enough for all purposes, not only in South Australia or in the district represented by the honourable member for Bendigo, but in other parts of the Commonwealth. For the reasons I have given - I hope that the Committee will agree to the very reasonable amendment proposed.",54
418,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Fremantle) [10.14] The honourable member for Bendigo, who happened to be Chairman of the"" Tariff Commission, is very fond of referring to the work of that 'Commission'.",54
419,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,Is it not my duty to do so?,54
420,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"The honourable member has mentioned that a crucible made at Bendigo was kept at a white heat for nine hours, and the maker was so surprised that he has advertised the fact ever since. When we were dealing with the item covering fuses the honourable member said that if the Committee agreed to impose the duty he proposed the local makers wouldlower their price, but as a matter of fact they have raised their price by 20 per cent. If the Bendigo potters want work, why' did they not offer to supply the insulators for which the Postmaster-General invited tenders the other day?",54
421,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,What has that to do with the duty upon crucibles?,54
422,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"It has a good deal to do with it. Let them endeavour to supply the requirements of Australia in, the matter of something which they understand. The honourable member for Bendigo has told us that Mr Duncan, the cyanide expert at Bendigo, approves of these locally-manufactured crucibles being used in his works.",54
423,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Jus t fancy crucibles being exposed to a . "" w h it e "" heat in connection with cyaniding operations 1",54
424,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"I object to Mr Duncan setting himself up as a judge of what is most suitable for use in the mining districts of Western Australia, which produce more gold in a single montii than Bendigo does in one year. We have been told that the man who constructed this crucible affirms that it is as good as the Morgan crucible. But I would remind the Committee that the Morgan crucible is only one of second quality, and that for fine work the German crucible is the best. The honourable member for Bendigo declared that what is good enough for Bendigo is good enough for Western Australia. That is not the case. In Western Australia we have to deal with a different class of ores from those which are being treated at Bendigo. I might also inform the honourable member for Bendigo that the . filter press 'was invented and worked in Western Australia, and that it was afterwards used in Bendigo. So that what was good enough for Western Australia in that instance was good enough for Bendigo. The honourable member for Barker has declared that Kangaroo Island possesses large deposits of clay suitable for the manufacture of these crucibles, and that it has a very fine climate. I have heard of a place which consists of 98 per cent, of climate and 2 per cent.. of business. That description, I think, is applicable to Kangaroo Island. I wish now to refer to the ""expert"" who has discovered these deposits of clay there. I lived in South tee divided. Australia for a time, when a man named Provis used to discover all sorts of things. He was known as "" the Poet."" He afterwards went to Queensland, and discovered a tin mine. l f he knows' as ' much about clay as he does about poetry, he is a very poor potter indeed. I ask Brown, the Committee to accept his evidence in Brown, Tilley regard to crucibles for what. it is worth. Catts, J. H . I suggest that in future he should stick to poetry, and leave crucibles severely Forrest, Fairbairn, G. alone.

429,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND,"Corangamite) [10.39]. - I regard the proposed paragraph c as altogether unnecessary. This item mostly to do with the preparation of intles secticide, mortem, and insectibane, .which are prepared from Pyrethrumflowersgrown on the Continent of Europe, and imported either whole or in powdered form. These flowers, when .prepared, are packed in of two, four, eight, and sixteen ounces, thus sold, packages of .over one pound ing almost unknown in the retail trade. Jd.? Sheep washes and cattle and horse washes areused for other purposes; qualities. and, according to the item as it stands, they will be free. But powdered sheep dip, such as Cooper's, might easily movebe read into the word ""insecticide,"" though it is usedsolely for dipping sheep with - and otheranimals in order to get rid of lice and ticks. Disinfectants are imported here in large quantities, and one of these, by'inserting Little's Phenyle, is used as a sheep-wash. In this connection I desire to show that the 'contention that protection is necessary cannot be maintained. The price .list of Mr. J - D. Howie, of 299 Smith-street, Fitzwheroy, shows that he sells Little's Phenvle at 5s. a half-gallon, 9s. 6d. the gallon, and pro6Jd. the bottle, whereas Hogan's Phenyle is sold at 2jd. the bottle> and 6d. a quart. is Little's Phenyle is imported in bulk, and an bottled here, while Hogan's Phenyle is manufactured within the' Commonwealth.

431,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Bourke-Honor ary Minister) [10.50] - The modification proposed by the honourable member for Corangamite cannot be accepted by the Government. His proposition is, in effect, to make dutiable small packages either of insecticides or of disinfectants, and to permit to come into Australia, free of duty, the same article, when imported in larger bulk. The honourable member's argument is that inasmuch as nearly the whole of the work is done in Australia, it is not necessary to impose a duty on imports in bulk. Our argument, in answer, Is that if the manufacturers can do tKe bottling, packing, and casing, in Australia, they can also do the actual manufacturing here. There is no reason on earth why they should not make their disinfectants locally, nor is there any reason why the locally-made goods should not be of the same quality as the best Imported disinfectants. Under the circumstances, and speaking on behalf of the Government, I cannot accept the proposal of the honourable member. We want to have all the work done in Australia.",57
432,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"As the public are paying 6d. for the imported - article, arid only 2^d. for that which is locally made, how shall we help the manufacturers by imposing a stiffer duty?",57
433,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"That remark is beside the question, nor had the comparison, made by the honourable member for Corangamite any bearing on the - point at issue. He' compared the poorer class of locally-made disinfectants with the best class of imported goods. I do not deny the correctness of the. prices quoted by him, but it was not a fair comparison to place the lowest quality in one case against the highest in the other.",57
434,Mr WILSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I read the whole lisf of prices - Mr MALONEY - The basis, of insecti",57
435,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I say in answer, that the very people who claim to make such an excellent article, can make it just as well in Australia, as abroad. As to insecticides, the reason why we propose to put pyrethrum flowers on the free list is, that there is only one place in the world where they are grown. They are the raw material which forms the absolute basis for the manufacture of insecticides. Having admitted the flowers duty free, we enable the packing, the printing, the labelling, and all the other work to be done in Australia. We recognise the inevitable in acknowledging that the flowers cannot be grown in this country, but we do the nextbest tiling in regarding them as the raw material of an Australian industry. The Senate's proposal is one which, we : think, ought to be accepted, and I ask the' Committee to make the requested amendment.",57
436,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Fawkner) [10.55]. - I think that the proposal of the honourable member for Corangamite meets the Q case very fairly, inasmuch as it secures to Australia the main part of the work of the industry in question. It will insure that the packing, labelling, and printing, will be done in this country. Mr HUME. COOK - The honourable member's proposal does not secure so much, because that work is done in Australia now.",57
437,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"At any rate, the proposal of the honourable member retains the major part of the work in Australia. It is most important that our orchardists and sheep breeders should have a good reliable dip. They have had that in the past, and know what it is. They are not absolutely certain yet of the locally-made dips. If the bottling, labelling, and tinning' are done here we shall preserve td Australia the important part of the industry. These insecticides are largely used by orchardists, who are compelled by law to use them. On that account we ought to see that they get as good an article as possible. The amendment suggested by the honourable member for Corangamite meets the case exactly. The material will come out in bulk, all the rest of the work will be done here, and our people will get really good and reliable stuff.' There is no possibility of distinguishing between insecticides and disinfectants, and cattle, sheep, and horse dips. cides is pyrethrum flowers. Mr FAIRBAIRN.' - The honourable member is referring to the powder that is sprinkled on windows, but the Customs people have been calling the powder dips, that are used to put on sheep, insecticides, and have actually charged duty on them in New South Wales. They said the sheep parasite was killed by them, and therefore they were insecticides.",57
438,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Sheep , cattle and absolutely horse washes are free.",58
439,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"There is a sheep wash and also a sheep dip-on e is a liquid and the other a powder. The Customs people charged duty on the powder dips Sydney but admitted them free in Melis bourne. I called the attention of the ister of Trade and Customs to it, and ordered that they should all be admitted free. The division nowproposed cause the same difficulty to arise again. The liquid dip will be admitted free as sheep or cattle wash, while trie - powder will be charged duty as an insecticide.",58
440,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Will the. honourable member say how he got the information that sheep powders are chargeable as inproportions secticides ?,58
441,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I got the informaof tion from a firm in Sydney. The ter of Trade and Customs admitted its truth, and rectified the anomaly. was about six or seven weeks ago.",58
442,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"The same difficulty will not arise again, because the Department will recognise the previous understanding.",58
443,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I am afraid they will not. These articles are largelyused by fruit-growers as well as by sheep and cattle men, and we ought to be very careful not to penalize those people. It . is absolutely certain yet that the infallible, ancl a very small deterioration in the wool clip of Australia means We ought to be careful before we depart from the present practice. By charging duty only on the smaller packages, as honourable member for Corangamite sugthat gests, we shall be securing the work as possible for our own people.",58
444,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Nepean) [ n . o ] no reason why the pastoralist should get washes free, while the orchardist, who in a. much smaller way of business, and far more difficulty in making ends meet, compelled to pav heavv duties upon secticides and disinfectants that he pelled by law to use. Orchardists have nil they can do now to fight the pests that attack their fruits.",58
445,Mr HUTCHISON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,They will have a cheaper article.,58
446,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"It is not a question of a cheaper article. In.a case of this kind, it has to be the best article. If the local make is as good as the imported, and cheaper, the fruit-growers are business men enough to take it, but they must get what is the best article for their purpose. The States Parliaments make it essential for themto use insecticides and disinfectants. One State will not admit the product of another unless it has been properly in fumigated and certified to. New Zealand threatening to close her markets against Minthe citrous fruits of Queensland and New he South Wales. These things are a serious menace to the fruit-growing industries of will those two great States. This Chamber ought to do all it can to help them. While a we should help the pastoralist, we should dip not leave the fruit-growers to shift for themselves, because they cannot bring the same influence to bear, and because their industry does not attain such great financial as do the sheep and cattle industries. I will support the amendment the honourable member for Corangamite Minisin the absence of any lower proposal, but I should have liked to see the Committee This adhere to its previous decision to put insecticides and disinfectants, with sheep, cattle, and horse washes, on the free list.",58
447,Mr WH IRVINE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"(Flinders) [11.4]-. - The Honorary Minister made a pathetic appeal to the Committee on behalf of the people engaged in making these articles, as though this was a very important industry that required protection to be given - to it even at the. cost of such industries as fruitnot growing, referred to by the honourable local dips are member for Nepean..",58
448,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,I should like to a big loss. know how that is affected ?,58
449,Mr WH IRVINE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"The honourable the member's argumentswould have come with the a great deal more force if it had not been the Tariff Commission,' after full inas far vestigation, recommended that these articles should be free, and that the Government, in introducing the Tariff, adopted I see that recommendation. Now, at this late his stage, we having already rejected the Senis' ate's previous request to impose a duty, the has proposal is made that insecticides and disis infectants should be subject to a 25 per the incent, duty, even at a great cost to is comorchiwdists throughout the community.",58
450,Mr MATHEWS,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"If a mistake was made, surely we are justified in rectifying it?",58
451,Mr WH IRVINE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Where was the mistake made?,58
452,Mr MATHEWS,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,The articles are manufactured here.,58
453,Mr WH IRVINE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"The mere fact that anything is manufactured here is, in trie opinion of the honourable member, sufficient to warrant a proposal of this kind. Do the Government .say that they have made a mistake? Have they never previously considered this matter? Why do they ask us at the eleventh hour to accept this request?",58
454,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,But for bungling it would have been agreed to on the last occasion.,59
455,Mr WH IRVINE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Why did not the Government bring in this proposal originally? It is a perfect farce that the Government should ask the Committee .not only to go back upon its previous decision biit to re-cast' the work of the Tariff Commission and oppose something which they themselves accepted.,59
456,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Melbourne) [11.7] The honourable member for Flinders is no doubt an excellent judge of the farcical, but I am sure that the Government have clone what all protectionists desire. When we cannot obtain all that we want, Surely we are justified in taking as much as we can get? In reply .to the honourable member for Corangamite, I would point out that Dr R. J. Bull, director of the Bacteriological Laboratory at the University of Melbourne, on the 27th January last, wrote as follows to Messrs. MCKellan and RamsayDear Sirs,- I have tested the disinfectant strength of a sample of phenyle (MCKellan and Ramsay) received on 22nd December, '06, and certify that under standard laboratory conditions the bacillus of typhoidfever was destroyed in five minutes. when the disinfectant was employed in a dilution of 1 - : 400 in distilled water. He then proceeded to set out in tabular form details of tests made with MCKellan and Ramsay's phenyle and Schering's carbolic acid. I think that the honourable member for Corangamite will agree that S'chering is one of the biggest manufacturers of carbolic acid in the world.",59
457,Mr WILSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Carboli c acid is not affected by this item - ,59
458,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Quite so, but the test conducted by Dr Bull showed thatPhenyle (MCKellan and Ramsay) in a dilution of 1 :400 was equivalent to carbolic acid r : TOO indicating that the former was four times as powerful' as carbolic acid as a disinfectant. I have here a circular from a number of manufacturers of disinfectants, sheep washes, and insecticidesWe, the undersigned manufacturers of disinfectants, sheep washes, and insecticides, respectf u l ly beg to ask your support to the request of the Senate by granting some protection on a portion of our industry, viz., on insecticides and disinfectants n.e.i., 25 per cent., General Tariff,, and 15 per cent., United Kingdom.

459,Mr WH IRVINE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,A large class of disinfectants is covered by item 279. If the signatories to the circular read by the honourable member are making those disinfectants they are not affected by this request.,59
460,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"They are affected by it, and urge that it should be adopted. It was due to a mistake - that the request was not agreed to when it was previously before the House. I think that I have said enough to satisfy the honourable member for Flinders that his criticism was unjustified, and I hope that the Government will support the imposition of as high a duty as we cart secure. As to the request with regard to pyrethrum flowers, it cannot be denied that they are a raw material of all insecticides, and as such should be admitted free.",59
461,Mr WILSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,M v amendment will allow of their coming in free.,59
462,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,I am glad to hear it. I am. sure that the Government will have no difficulty in securing the acceptance of that part of the request.,59
463,Mr HUTCHISON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Hindmarsh) [1.1.14] - I wish only to point out that, in addition to the firms mentioned by the honourable member there are many other manufacturers of disinfectants in the Commonwealth. In Adelaide we have a firm making and supplying disinfectants to the corporation of Newcastle and many other municipalities in New South Wales', as well as in South Australia. If its disinfectants were not equal to the imported article, I do not think that they would be purchased by those corporations. Although the modification does not go so far as I should like it to go, it is a reasonable proposition, arid I shall accept it if we cannot obtain anything better. Throughout the Commonwealth, disinfectants equal to anv that are imported are being made. The modification moved by the honourable member for Corangamite might well be accepted by the Minister. It is certainly a compromise, but it will serve the purpose which our manufacturers have in view. Modification, by leave, withdrawn.

464,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Trea surer) [11.22] - I move That the requested amendment be made. Objection has been raised to the wording of the item, because it specifies red beech. Inquiries show that it has been imported during the past four years. It was first used for making picture and room mouldings ; but latterly it has been imported for the manufacture of furniture, including 26 bent wood chairs. There appears to be 23. some doubt as to the proper name of this timber. It has been ordered as red beech, . and invoiced as red beech, silver beech, and red birch. That fact was pointed out AYES. to Senator MCGregor, who moved the request, and it was suggested to him that the words beech or birch should be substituted, but he did not wish the paragraph to apply to anything but red beech,- If the request is accepted.it will be necessary for the importers to satisfy the Collectors of Customs that their timber, is actually red beech, in order to obtain the benefit of this duty. When the item was last before the Committee, I did not recognise the timber referred to, and that is why I took the action I did in regard to it.

465,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"North Sydney) [11.26] - The Minister has directed his attention to what, in my opinion, would be a very minor alteration of the item.

466,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,We are told that their request as to duty is not pressed.,60
467,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"That is so; but I can show the Committee that even higher duties are suggested by the proposed insertion of the word "" w h it e "" before the words "" New Zealand pine."" If this amendment be made, it will throw the timber duties as agreed to by this Committee absolutely out of line. We are here being asked to.impose tremendous duties, which will fall with great weight, not only upon Australian industries, but on every one who requires certain timber for the erection of a dwelling. I wonder the Minister had nothing to say with respect that proposed amendment.

' The effect of 'inserting, the word "" w h it e "" before the words ""New Zealand p in e "" will be to leave white pine dutiable at 6d. per ioo super, feet, which the honourable member for first Wide Bay satirically describes as a duty; whilst other New Zealand pines, kauri pine included, over ; x 2 j and under 12 x 6 would be dutiable at twice the inf creased duty originally requested by the Senate, and in sizes under 7 x z\, at two and a half times that duty.",61

Ss.. to n d . per 100 super, feet. The fact is that to import this timber in sizes 1 2 x 6 , and have it cut up here, be to lose the advantage of cheapness. I is because the smaller sizes are the offcuts that it is possible to import this timber the cheaper rate. If if is imported in the it must pay extra freight and charges, must bear - freight and charges on waste. That is an altogether extravagant way of importing it. By the proposal now undressed timber. made, people will be forced to import timber in that extravagant way, or in sizes 12 x 6, for which they must pay a much higher, price- a price which they cannot afford to pay if it is necessary afterwards to have it cut up.",61

477,Mr STORRER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Is that in accord with the official explanation of the Tariff?,61
478,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I am willing to put that explanation before the officers of the Department, and they will not deny that I have accurately stated the effect of the proposed amendment coupled with the measurement definition. Under proposed amendment of the measurer apwe should have the extraordinary result in the case of timber below j inch in - and, for instance, J'-in. timthe duty would suddenly drop from That is the effect of the definition.

In 1906 and our imports of New Zealandpine aggregated 65,000,000 superficial feet, or more than-' 30 per cent"", of our total imports of The effect of the duty which was operative under the old Tariff was that out of this quantity only 5,125feet of dressed timber were introduced. Of that import 30,000,000 superficial feet of pine-principall y kauri-.wil l be affected! by these duties.",61
479,Mr SINCLAIR,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"About 35,000,000 feet quences of our action. will be affected. Mr DUGALD . THOMSON - I am we shall making even a lower estimate than is the honourable member. For what is this timber used? For agricultural machinery, for our Courts. furniture making, dairying ^utensils, wine vats and frui t cases. It is also used floorings and for lining houses. 30,000,000 superficial feet, 24,000,000 feet, or 80 per cent., are imported in sizes under 12 inches x 6 inches. So that at lower estimate than that of the honourable member for Moreton we are being asked to increase the taxation of these industries over ,£30,000 per annum. Now, land annually produces only 83,000,000 feet of timber, including both hardwoods and softwoods, whereas, the quirements of the Commonwealth amount to 690,000,000 feet. In other"" words, Queensland cuts less than one-eighth of our total requirements. That State has this vast market open to her timbers. . It is a payable market, being as regards pine per cent, higher than was the market which was available when the first Tariff was under consideration,, and when Queenswas land members only asked for is. duty. have already stated that the proposal of the Treasurer would force all the dressing of this timber to be undertaken outside the Commonweath. Why? Because proposes to increase the duty upon dressed timber of a size 7 inches x the dressing sizes-inche s to 2s. 6d. 100 superficial feet. This Committee cided that it should be dutiable at only 6d. per 100 superficial feet, and the Senyet ate ' originally requested that the duty should be increased to is - per 100 ficial feet. The Senate now requests a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 superficial feet. Now dressed timber is dutiable 100 superficial feet, adifference of 6d. only over the undressed. timber cannot be dressed for 6d. per 100 superficial feet. The dressing costs three times that amount.. Consequently Treasurer is really offering a premium this timber to be dressed outside of tralia. I do not wish to detain the mittee at any greater length. I shall something to say at a later stage upon definition of ""superficial feet."" vernment do not know what they are doing in that connection. They are really getting into a quagmire. accepted canons in regard to weights and measures we can scarcely foresee the consein I do hope that when we come to deal with the definition adopt the interpretation of "" superficial feet''' which is known and recognised not only by the trading community but by If we are to have increased duties, ' they should not be imf o r posed under definition, but should be Of that specified in the schedule honestly and straightforwardly, and on the basis 'of the accepted interpretation' . of "" superficial a feet."" I trust that the Committee will not agree' to the Treasurer's' proposal. Wherever duties are in dispute between the by two Houses, are they not supposed to Queensendeavour to meet each other's views? about Yet we are being asked to go wider apart. The Senate wishes to double the higher duty reit first asked in some cases, and to make it two and a half times as much in others. To make such a proposal is not the right way to arrive at a settlement, and I hope, therefore, that it will not be agreed to. 50 ^ Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) [11.46] The honourable member for North Sydney, who always carefully prepares his speeches, more extravagant than usual to-night.

As requested to be amended, it will apply to timber 'not more than i inch nor less than I inch in thickness. I hope that what the Senate desires will be acceded to, and I therefore move=That the requested amendment be made.",64
510,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"North Sydney) [ i 2 . i i a.m.] - The custom of the trade has been to sell timber on the ordinary definition of ""superficial foot."" Throughout the British Dominions there has been one custom. The honourable member for Wide Bay has told us that there is an exception in Queensland. that when Queensland buys timber she buys on the ordinary definition of "" superficial foot "" and when she sells timber outside Queensland- I do not know what is the case inside the State-sh e sells under the same definition. It is rather a serious matter to alter the customary method of measuring timber for the purpose of affecting Customs duties. It is wrong to tamper with our weights ancl measures. If we have to impose cluties, let them be imposed straightforwardly under the Tariff: Do not let us adopt a definition which entirely revolutionizes the ordinary methods of measurement. If we do this sort of thing we really do not know what . the effect will be in many cases. my belief the definition proposed will have effects that the Treasurer does not anticipate. One effect may be that thick timbers may be' free of duty altogether. Let honourable members observe the wording . of the definition. It is proposed that a superficial foot shall mean an area of i square foot on one surface, and being not more than i inch nor less than Jinch in thickness. The duties that are fixed on . the basis of "" super, foot,"" as really all but one of them are, will be regulated by that definition; and timber which is not less than i inch in thickness will, in my opinion, come in free. I am pointing out what may be an awkward result from a departmental point of view - When the term "" super, foot "" is used, it means an area i foot square and i inch in thickness. The custom is established and recognised in trade and law, and in the Department, that that inch is carried right through the wood, so that wood which is 6 inches'thick and 12 inches x 12 inches on the. surface is reckoned as 6 super, feet. But under the new definition now proposed, there is no custom to work upon, and I hold that, the effect of the words will be to levy the duty on timber which is less than an inch thick, but not on thicker timbers. In my opinion, the thicker timber will come in free, because the Tariff applies duties per super, foot, and in the definition that term is defined as less than r. inch in thickness. But if the duty should apply to thicker timber,. what is the Department going to do with timber over 1 inch in thickness? For instance, is the Department going to attach the definition and apply extra duties to timber that is between i j inch and 2 inches? Is the definition going to apply to timber between i inch and 2 inches, 1 I can only say and between z\ and 3 inches, and between 3J and 4 inches in thickness? How will the Department apply the definition?",65
511,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"B y the ' actual measurement. Mr DUGALD THOMSON : - It does not say so. The custom in the trade, re-. cognised by the Department, has been to - apply the term ""super, f o o t "" to every inch thickness of timber.",65
512,Colonel FOXTON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,That will continue.,65
513,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"There will be nothing to make it continue-n o trade custom or legal decision. The effect v will be, to double the duty on J-inch timber and increase it largely on other In sizes between J-inch and i-inch. We ought not to impose duties by altering a standard of measurement that has been recognised by the Customs Department ever since we have had a Federal Tariff.",65
514,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Wide Bay) [12.17 a.m.]. - There is no doubt that the Committee is pretty well divided, over this matter. I recollect a celebrated occasion during the consideration of the timber duties in the last Tariff, when an ardent and courageous Victorian protectionist happened to vote accidentally on the side which suited his own particular interest at that time, and to reduce the duty. The situation seems to me pretty much like that to-night. The honourable member for North Sydney enlarged upon the great increase of price that this alteration would cause. How much does it mean? On f-inch timber the duty under the present system would be is. 3 f d . , while under the proposed system it would be is. 6d. The difference on that size would, therefore, be 2^d. On f-inch timber the duty at present, would be is. i j d . , and under our proposal is. 6d. These are actual facts, verified by the Customs officers, - as against scandalously, erroneous statements published by manufacturers here regarding the increase of duty. f-inch timber the present duty would be 1 if d . , and the new would be is. 6d., while on ^-inch timber the difference would be 9d. as against is. 6d. . Where are the three or four-fold increases that some honourable members have said that this proposal meant? Some honourable members have been stuffed with that information.",65
515,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Is the honour the able member referring to what I said? - Mr FISHER - I am .speaking from to actual personal conversations with memthose bers. One of the oldest members in this tion. State-and a very honourable memberwho made the mistake in 1902, told me that this proposal would increase the three or four-fold - That is the kind of misstatement that one has to meet in matter of this kind-starte d by gross selfish which has just been taken. prejudice, and nothing more nor. less than attempts to influence votes by false ing and false information.",66
516,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Takin g the increase of duty as well as the definition, there is very large increase.",66
517,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"-The duties proposed on timber. are lower on the average than the old duties. Nearly everv large sized timber practically free. We hear a great about butter-boxes and fruit-cases. This definition in no way affects them. timber between 1 inch and J inch comes mostly from the Baltic, Korea, and' Siberia. How can protectionist members object to an increase of duty on timber 6 inches $- inch, of 2^d. per 100 super, feet? Is that a large increase, having regard to the additional cut in that wood?",66
518,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"That is not ""the proper way to get an increase. . Mr FISHER - Is that the point? This is a very late repentance. The objection now is not to the amount of increase, but to the way in which it has been proposed.",66
519,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,We object to both.,66
520,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"The main attack has Carr, E. S. been on the alleged, increase of price, but Catts, J. H . that argument cannot be sustained further Chapman, Austin than I have shown. On f-inch timber the Coon, J. difference is A i d . per 100 super, feet, and Crouch, R.

521,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Is it right to alter the measurements for that difference? Groom, L . E.",66
522,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I am dealing with the main argument advanced by the opponents of the proposal. I am astonished at some of the votes given by men who pretend to On be protectionists. I will take the ground of the honourable member for Parkes, who stands out as an absolute revenue tariffist. He said that 15 per cent, was a fair revenue duty; but this is not a 15 per cent, duty. It is not a revenue duty. The' reason why a protective duty is not given to the timber industry of Australia seems to be that a few men, who are more interested in importation of timber than in using a product of our own country, have been able influence this Parliament more than have who are interested in native producI do not think that any amount of argument will influence honourable membersj but this question is far. more important, if duty members are prepared to deal fairly with the timber-getters and saw-millers and sawa mill employees of Australia, than the vote I appeal to honourable members, to give some considerareasontion to the timber industry.",66

The item has' been divided in accordance with what would appear to be the wish of this Committee, as well as of the Senate The divisions are those required by thetrade. The object of the modification, so Tellers : far as paragraph B is concerned, is to carry out what was apparently the desire of some honourable members who, after the original request had been dealt with, pointed out PAIRS. that an error had been made. The new wording, of the request will afford the full protection desired by all parties. GlacS and dull kid are manufactured in New South Wales of superior qualities, ancl a. duty of 20 per cent, is a necessary protection to that industry. The other leathers . are made in several . States in varying; qualities, and the 2d. per square, foot will afford them ample protection, while imposing only a nominal duty on the superior qualities imported. That was one of the items which were referred to during the dis- cussion on recommittals in this House in December last. The combined conference of tanners and bootmakers agreed to this proposed duty of 2d. per square foot in pieference to the Government's original proposal that duties of 30 per cent, and 20 per cent, should be imposed. Through an oversight in this House the duty on this sub-item was allowed to go.at 20 per cent., but on the honourable member for South Sydney mentioning the matter, I promised to have it looked into in the Senate. The result is this request to carry out the originallv accepted recommendation of the combined fanners' and bootmakers' conference. Twopence per square foot works out at considerably less than 20 per cent, on the better classes, and up to almost as high as 36 per' cent, on the cheaper classes.",66

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [12.36 a.m.] - It will be remem-. bered that the Committee refused to comply with the request of the Senate, but agreed to the insertion of the following paragraph(D) Stained Glass - Windows for churches or public institutions under Departmental By-laws', on and after 19th May, 1908, ad val., 20 per cent. The other day I said that I was in favour of allowing the free admission of stained glass windows for churches or publicinstitutions, but there seems to be a very strong objection to that.",67
526,Mr SAMPSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,For what reason ?,68
527,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,I consider that stained glass windows for churches and public institutions are works of art.,68
528,Mr SAMPSON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Can we not make them here ? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not think so.,68
529,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Surely we can import the parts and assemble them.,68
530,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"On a previous occasion I said that I waived my personal opinion, but .would try to get duties of 15 and ro per cent, imposed on the articles. Mr DUGALD THOMSON,-We will accept a duty of 15 per cent.  10 per cent - - mittee will",68
531,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Fiftee n per cent, is the duty imposed on the raw material",68
532,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I move That the requested amendment be not made, but that the duty on Stained Glass Windows be 15 per cent.",68
533,Mr COON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Batman) [12.38 a.m.] Under this proposal, the industry will ceive no protection, seeing that the duty its raw material is 15 per cent. At least, the duty should be fixed at 20 per cent. Originallv it was proposed to levy 30 per cent. ; then, as a compromise, it was duced to 20 per cent.; and now it is posed to give no protection. Why is not the industry entitled to some protection? Under the' Victorian Tariff a duty of 33 ]>er cent, was levied. So fair as stained glass windows - are concerned, I am in it favour of prohibition, because they made in Germany, where men work seven days per week. The report' of the Royal Commission which was appointed at the instance of Mr Chamberlain contained this passageA point is made of the fact that the imported stained glass used in British churches is in part the product of Sunday labour. Surely the churches of Australia are not in favour of utilizing the products of Sunday 1 labour in Germany ! I am sure that not one person in a thousand will be in favour of having the' churches fitted with stained glass windows made on Sunday. In the case-of this industry I would just as-soon vote for free-trade as for a duty of 15 per cent., because that is no protection at all. In Australia the workers 'in this industry are paid £ 3 a week as against ,£1 iii Germany. No less than 250 persons are engaged throughout the Commonwealth, and yet they are to be told tomorrow that they are to receive no protection, although their raw materia] is taxed at the rate of 15 per cent.",68
534,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"The proposal is perfectly absurd. Mr COON:-In Germany, theircompetitors, including children, work twelve hours every- .day, including Sunday, and some of the manufacturers in Great Britain are asking for a protection of 45 'per cent.; but we are asked to blindly accept this proposal. No reason has been given why we should. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 30 per cent., but now we are asked to impose a duty of only 15 per cent. I trust that the .Comadhere' to its original decision.",68
535,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Wide Bay) [12.45 a.m.]. - This is one of those cases in connection with which apparently no one desires to say anything lest he should offend a body of very excellent people, who are no doubt very useful in their way. The proposal rethat these stained glass windows should be on admitted free of duty is put forward as a concession to the churches. I agree with the honourable member for Batman, that the proposal should be resisted if the Comremittee intends to deal justly by local proartists. We have taxed nearly the whole of the materials required in their industry, and vet it is proposed that the . finished product should be admitted at 15 per cent. If there is any hypocrisy in this legislation is in this proposal - It cannot be excused are by anything but the unmanly desire to please everybody, even though just claims should be ignored.",68
536,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"We carried a duty of 20 per cent., and it is proposed now to make the duty 15 per cent.",69
537,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Why not carry a duty of 20 per cent, again?",69
538,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.47 a.m.] - Since so many honourable members are proposing that the duty should be 20 per cent., I ask leave to amend my motion by leaving out all the words after the word ""made,"" so that these windows may be dutiable at 20 per cent. Motion amended accordingly.",69
539,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Calare) [12.48 a.m.] - I do not .think the Minister should let the matter go at that. Although the Senate is assumed to be a .protectionist Chamber, it has recommended that these stained glass windows should .be put on the free list.",69
540,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Honourable senators forgot that there is a duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material of the industry. Mr THOMAS BROWN..^-1 admit that in the. circumstances to make the item free would be unjust, and I am prepared support a duty of 15 per cent, on the local finished product of the industry, but I would prefer that stained glass windows should be admitted free to voting for the prohibitive protection now suggested by the Minister. This is a matter in conlike nexion with which we must make some compromise with the Senate, and we can reasonably ask that Chamber to. agree t'o the imposition of a duty of 15 per cent, in view of the fact that the raw material of the industry is taxed to that extent.",69
541,Mr KELLY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Wentworth) [12.50 a.m.]. 1 - I rise to discover what is really the tude of the Government on this question. understood from the earlier debate on the item that the Government were prepared first of all to agree to the admission stained glass windows free, and then to impose a duty of 15 per cent., which every one seemed to be in favour of. Afterwards, when some one so much' whispered 20 per cent'., the Minister was from England. ready to propose that duty. I understand that the Minister was at first disposed accept the Senate's request, but he has now decided that it would not be politic to do so. I should. like to know whether the attitude of the Government in the matWeritworth. ter is based on fiscal grounds? l t is well known that the Treasurer postures as a protectionist throughout Australia, but we have heard to-night. that he is in favour of the introduction ' of stained glass windows free of duty.",69
542,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I have said that that is not correct, and the'honourable member has no right t'o repeat the statement.",69
543,Mr KELLY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"If the Minister did not say so, I at once recall the statement. The honourable gentleman apparently is not in agreement with his colleagues in another place, who have implored us to make these stained glass windows free of duty. As the Ministry appear to' be divided on this important question, I move That the proposed modification be amended to read :- "" But that the duty on Stained Glass Windows for churches, & c , be (General Tariff) 15 per cent.""",69
544,Mr THOMAS,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Barrier) [12.54 a.m.] I am prepared to support a duty of 15 per cent, in this case. It is very strange that the Senate, which is supposed to be a protectionist Chamber, after suggesting the increase of many duties passed - by this Committee should, in the matter of stained to glass windows, be prepared to tax the manufactures on the glass, oil, paint, brushes, lead, and everything that goes to make a stained glass window while requesting that the finished product of the industry should be admitted free. I should to know why this is so. I wish also to point out to the honourable member' for Batman that it is proposed to levy a duty of 15 per cent, only upon thefinishedarticle. - Nobody would dream of importing stained glass windows unless they were of good quality, and under the circumstances I think that 15 per cent, is a fair, rate to attiimpose. I believe that stained-glass winI dows can be produced in the Commonwealth equal to any that can be imported. I know that in South Australia a firm of known as Montgomery arid Grimley used to 1 do excellent work .in the production of this class of. windows. Formerly Mr Montgomery was accustomed to send out stainedas glass windows 'of his own manufacture But after, establishing himself in South Australia he found that to a prejudice existed against the Australian article. As a result, one of the' partners had to leave the firm. I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Question (Mr KELLY'S modification)put. The Committee divided.

545,Mr KELLY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Wentworth) [1.6 a.m.] The Committee having' placed a duty of 20 per cent, on stained glass windows for churches, I wish to give an opportunity to the Ministers to again display their well known Imperialistic sentiments by voting for preference to the Mother. Country, and I therefore move That the proposed modification be amended to read :- "" but that the duty on Stained Glass Windows be (United Kingdom), ad val. 15 per cent.""",70
546,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Wide Bay) [1..7 a.m.] I ask if it is not a fact that the raw materials used by artists here, for the manugirls facture of stained glass windows are dutiable at 15 per cent. ? Mr HUME COOK"" - Yes .",70
547,Mr FISHER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Then let us be honest and straightforward, and give our artists some slight assistance. - Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [1.8 a.m.] I protest against the language of the honourable member for Wide Bay. Earlier tonight he denounced the honourable member not an artist. for North Sydney for saying, "" Let us be honest and straightforward,"" and now he is using exactly the same words. I ' say to him, "" Be honest and straightforward, and vote for a preference duty of 15 per cent.""",70
548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Parramatta) AYES. [1.9 a.m.] - On a former occasion, the honourable member for Batman told the Committee that in the Old Country the artists employed in the production of stained glass windows are paid 30s. a week. It appears that his information came from Mr Montgomery, who, in a letter to me, saysBowden, E. K . Will you forgive me for pointing out that your statement, reported in Hansard, "" If the artist whom he"" (Mr Coon) "" quoted' was a NOES. good artist,"" - &c -, is founded on a mistake. I amthe artist supposed to be saying "" I was employed,"" &c. As a matter of ' "" historical accuracy"" I was then before the Tariff Commission, reading from a document (at the request of the Chairman) written by a' glasspainter recently arrived from England. You will thus see it was not an artist who was paid the wages mentioned, nor was it an extract from my own autobiography. The writer also takes exception to some of my statements as to the prices earned by these artists. He saysRe your statement that, painters in potteries were paid .so well, I am informed, on what I believe to be good authority, that most of the painting on cups and saucers is now done by girls, who, if expert, earn 25s. per week. In the down-trodden country which the honourable member for Batman would have us believe England is, girls earn 25s. a week in painting on cups and saucers designs prepared by artists. The - artist whose original design the .""iris copy on hundreds of pieces is, of course, paid at a much higher rate.",70
549,Mr HUTCHISON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,The honourable member spoke of the designer only as an artist; but the painter is also one.,70
550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I know that do a great deal of this, work and are paid good wages, many of them earning 30s. a week and more, whilst the artists receive as much as jQi a day.",70
551,Mr COON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Batman) [1.12 a.m.] - I have spoken to an artist, who told me that in the Old Country he worked for 30s. a week.",70
552,Mr BOWDEN,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"-He was a glass-painter,",70
553,Mr COON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"He should be classified an artist. In a communication which have received, he says Mr Joseph Cook's previous statement that artists painting on china receive £ 6 a week is inaccurate. The artists the honourable member refers to are girls, and receive 15s. to 20s. a week, and this in England. I ask, how many artists are employed in England in painting windows? Very few. According to the evidence presented to the Tariff Commission appointed by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, those in this industry in Great Britain are asking for a duty of 45 per cent. .",71
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,They have not it.',71
555,Mr COON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"They will get it in the near future. They wish to be protected against German labour, which is compelled to work on Sundays. Is the honourable member in favour of placing in Australian churches windows made on Sundays?",71
556,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,No . . favour the fiscal conditions which make such employment possible ,71
557,Mr COON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Is the honourable member of 15 per cent. a believer in a week of seven working days ?,71
558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,That is what is done where there is high protection.,71
559,Mr COON,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"If the honourable for Parramatta votes for this proposal, he will be voting for Sunday labour.",71
560,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Melbourne) [1.15 'a.'m.J -^- Sir Joshua Reynolds, is famous in the art world, once attempted to paint a window in one of the churches at O x for d ; and it was acknowledged by himagreed to. self to be a failure. It is only the man who.has had experience in this particular branch of art who can make a painting on toglass. You, Mr Chairman, know that as distinguished from seascape, skyscape, or landscape, painting on glass is an art in itself; and it is a fact that on the Continent one work of art of the kind is taken as model, and hundreds of replicas are proowing duced, for which the original artist receives not one penny. I should be willing to mit free a window, if it were made evident that it was an artist's own work and riot replica, turned out, as it were, by maI chinery. If the deputy leader of the Oppomember, sition would make inquiries, he would see that the artists here ought to have a fair chance of competing. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [1.19 a.m.] - We are proposing to give these people all that they ask, andi t as only fiscal gluttons, like the honourable I member for Batman who wishes to give 2 them more. Mr Montgomery wroteI am entirely tired of the controversy re .the admittance of stained glass windows free.",71
561,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,That is the artistic temperament; he is tired of fighting against an injustice.,71
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"Mr Montgomery says that, but for the tax on the raw material, he would not have required a duty on the finished article. I venture to say, however, that a duty of 10 per cent, would be more than compensation. got Mr MALONEY (Melbourne) [1.20 a.m.] - Whether the honourable member for Batman be a fiscal glutton or not, I cannot say; but I have herea letter from Mr. Montgomery, in which he writesI see the Senate is again obdurate. But surely the will of the House of Representatives must prevail. I certainly thought the Government compromise would have been accepted, but Nor do I the Senate evidently want all their own way.",71
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,Mr Montgomery does not say that he disapproves of a duty,71
564,Mr MALONEY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"But M i . Montgomery is an artist, and' the artistic temperament disdains t6 fight what may be member thought an injustice.",71
565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I think that if any man deserves a duty,- this man does.",71

567,Mr KELLY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I desire to make a pera sonal explanation. I very much regret that to a mistake which was entirely my own, the honourable member for Capricornia' adwas precluded from being paired in the division on the definition of "" superficial a foot "" in connection with the timber duties. arranged to get a pair for the honourable but found that I could not do so. I extremely regret the mistake which occurred, and am only glad that the absence of the honourable member from the division(""Parramatta) in no wav affected the result. Mr HUME . COOK - I do not know is whether or not the statement made by the honourable member for Wentworth is intended to reflect upon me in any way.",71
568,Mr KELLY,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,No ; it is not. No blame attaches to .the Minister.,72
569,Mr HUME COOK,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,"I should further like to say that the honourable member for Capricornia remained unpaired owing to no fault of mine. What happened was that each honourable member who desired to have a pair was paired so far as I knew. But I understand that the honourable member for Wentworth, in order' to insure"" a pair - for the honourable member for Angas, took the precaution to get two honourable members t i stand out from the division. When I discovered that,"" there was no way of remedying what had been done'except by altering the pair-book, as originally entered up. This the honourable member for Wentworth did without my sanction, by altering a pair I had inserted, and writing in one to suit himself. ' 1 at once protested against the alteration, and insisted upon the original pair being retained. ' I am sorry that the ""honourable member for Capricornia did not get his pair, but the fault was not mine. Resolutions reported. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE-Trea surer) [1.28 a.m.] - I wish to mention to you, Mr Speaker, that in regard'to request No. 75, it was decided by the Chairman of Committees that an amendment requested could not be made under our Standing Orders - The request of the .. Senate was therefore not considered. I do not know whether it will be necessary to make ai.statement to. that effect to the Senate, or to allow it to be undersood that the request was refused. As a matter of fact, it was not refused, because it was ncr considered at all.",72
570,Mr SPEAKER,BRUNSWICK GLASS WORKS,The practice in connection with amendments is always to send up reasons as to why amendments made by the Senate .are not concurred in by this House; but I think it would be a mistake 01 our part to adopt in regard to requests the same practice that is followed in connection with amendments. I therefore suggest to the Treasurer the desirableness of not sending up. any special message with regard to the item to which he has referred Report-adopted Ordered That .the Billbe returned to the Senate amended accordingly.
