2,Mr SCHULTZ,Unknown,"I rise more specifically, the Appropriation Bill come into this place after a budget has been a great deal of apprehension and hope to see that we represent. Invariably, every year people. If there is no increase, very rarely-that there a decrease in a particular area. In most cific projects: for example, from 1 July 2003 care providers as part of an extra $311 million announced in this budget, a $17 million funding deliver personal care to people in their own years for the 65 Commonwealth Carelink Centres about aged care services.

Over the years when we have brought down, we have looked to the budget with what benefits have flowed to the communities when a budget comes down there is good news for I have seen in my lifetime in politics-is cases, there is an increase in the budget for spethere will be $51 million for residential aged in new money for aged care homes which was boost to community aged care packages that homes, and a further $65 million for the next four across Australia that provide information over $31 billion on health.

Nevertheless, the point that I am making under successive governments treasurers of thing that the government is doing in terms that oppositions of the day are there to criticise ernment should have done in terms of further budget, we never seem to get to the point where coming from and what influences it. That Quite obviously, when you see all of the budget and during the budget process, you tend mand from those self-interest groups for governments sues and/or projects that they believe governments ronment where there does not seem to be much from and who makes a contribution in the way government. The point that I am making here to time that the people who are supporting there earning a living. They have other pressures such as the one that I am talking about. Let me go back in history and then come up about what I am concerned about. I do this taking there are significant pressures and contingencies over the years which create pressure on the about natural disasters and things like that. employed in this country. In the latest figures figure had been reduced to 622,700 people, 300,000-300,000 people going back into the cause it does a number of things: it takes and, more importantly, it puts people back taxes. The unemployment rate had a very significant 6.1 per cent. That is a very significant contribution who have been given the opportunity to find the economy of this country and, more I would also like to point out that personal about $73 billion.

I have said something I commented on the way in which the within that particular system probably need is that, every year when we come into this place, the Crown get up and talk about the wonderful of increasing expenditure. But, despite the fact the government and talk about what the govincreasing funding for specific areas of the we talk or think about where all this money is is something I want to talk about today. self-interest groups that pop up leading up to a to be concerned about the ever increasing deto spend more and more money on isshould be spending money on in an envithought given to where that money is coming of the taxes which then become revenue of the is that it is conveniently overlooked from time the government's revenue are those people out placed on them following on from a budget to the present day so I can tell you a few things into consideration that things do change and that we have to adjust to and accommodate government and thereby the taxpayer. I am talking In June 1991-92, there were 917,000 people unwhich I have, which are from April 2003, that a net lowering of the number of unemployed by work force. That is a very positive thing bean enormous amount of pressure off the taxpayer into the work force earning money and paying reduction, from 10.7 per cent down to by the government-and indeed by people work and who have gone and found work-to importantly, to the revenue for the budget. income tax revenue in this country in 1999 was it is about $88 billion. That is a pretty signifiNA cant contribution to the revenue and the coffers income tax, pay-as-you-earn people That is another indication of the sort of think about from time to time when we are calling more money for all of the projects of all of lieve they have a right for government to support do. They have forgotten the fact that they also munity to do something about supporting themselves. With regard to those social security recipients, state-which developed mainly after World War ties following the ravages and dislocations of features was a system of social security payments disadvantage. They were financed either by contributions as in Australia's case, from general taxation integral part of society and the function wealth government's outlays. Since then the desire for society to remain inclusive following population; social changes, which include changes, for example, the massive increases alluded to before. Thus, the safety net providing assistance of people, particularly those not in receipt and low income families-and also to accommodate in already existing groups, for example, the sioner issue is going to be an ongoing problem because our population is ageing very rapidly boom era are now in their late 50s or mid 60s. Whilst all of us would agree that there are through remuneration and services, we should and the amount of money we are spending budget whether we are managing that money as efficiently my time in this place, through some of the significant evidence that we are not addressing sional accounting requirements of the money various groups in the community. I say this-and I know many of my parliamentary to what I am saying, would probably agree-because money goes, at the social security and welfare have changed and created some pressure on that in 1995 to $71.3 billion in 2003. That, to me, an area of the budget that made up 37 per cent to a portfolio which has now resulted in 48 per is a very serious issue and it is something of government for the budget by the personal out there in the community. thing that I am talking about and that we need to on and squealing to the government to find the groups of people in the community who bethem in anything and everything that they have responsibility as individuals in the comin most democracies the modern welfare II-was driven by the need to stabilise societhe Depression and wars, and one of its essential for people in various situations of relative to a separate social security fund or, collections.

The age penfor governments of all political persuasions and those people that came through the baby sections of the community that need assistance look not only at the system we operate in today to budget but also, more importantly, at and as professionally as we should do. In committees I have been involved in, I have seen as efficiently as we ought to be the profesthat we allocate, on behalf of the taxpayer, to colleagues, having given some thought if you look at one example of where our budget, you will see that, whilst the mix might over the years, it has gone form $46.7 billion is very disturbing, because we are talking about of the total budget revenue outcomes in 1995 cent of the total budget being allocated to it. It that we really should be looking at. NA Those comments are made in the context of which in 1970 were 779,000 Australians. In have, it was 1.73 million. It really makes you of pressure on the government. It does not Labor government. Those are my reasons for raising it. It is also true to say that we have to not sources through the budget in the various portfolios the people who are dudding the taxpayer by using ing taxes. The most recent classic example is of corporate companies throughout the country. requisite tax penalties and thereby make a significant try and take the pressure off the hard working earning an income to try and stay alive in It is interesting to note that there have tion and people on our side of politics to tives are being paid-most of them in an environment When are we going to address the issue and corporations and companies or by themselves more needy sections of our community, which I have painted a bleak picture.

My concern is that HECS fees have always higher than national average mature-age students ney, it is reasonable to presuppose that they straight from school to university.
