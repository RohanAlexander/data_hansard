11,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY RAIDS ON BUSINESS,"Is the Minister of Home Affairs aware that, since I put my question to him, separate statements regarding conditions of employment at Cockburn Sound have appeared in the newspapers from the secretary of the Trades Hall in Perth?

37,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY RAIDS ON BUSINESS,"I have not looked into the matter, but shall do so, and will answer the honourable member's question PUBLICATION OF WARNEWS . SYDNEY E v m m g News REPOBT.",6
38,Mr BRUCESMITH,MILITARY RAIDS ON BUSINESS,"A b o u t midLonday on Sunday last the Evening News, of is Sydney, published a very sensational placard, in letters 6 inches long, setting out that there had been a great British disaster, and that 15,000 British soldiers had been drowned. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether that message was censored. I i it was, will the censor be reprimanded; and if it was not, will the Evening News be called to account for the publication of such a statement, which caused a great sensation in Sydney ?",6
39,Mr FISHER,MILITARY RAIDS ON BUSINESS,"The question, I think, is a very proper one. I do not know whether the message in question was seen by the censor; but if it was, and was passed by him in the form mentioned, then I should view his conduct as does the honourable member for Parkes. W it h all due respect to the proprietors of the newspaper in question, I consider that their action in publishing such a statement, which I do not think is true, was reprehensible. I shall make inquiries into the matter. NA",7

Mr JEjNSEN - The Defence Department has been blamed by the Age for purchasing a motor lorry made by the enemy. The allegation, however, is not true. Ifc appears that the motor lorry in question was purchased by the Government of Victoria. The Commonwealth Government has had nothing whatever to do with the transaction. NA ADMINISTRATION.",7

Has any quiry been made; and, if not, will in quiries be instituted as to the t r u th or otherwise of these allegations?",7
42,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not read the statements to which the honourable member refers. The newspaper in question is printed and published in a building which the Health Department has condemned, several accidents having occurred there, and I apprehend that fchere is some connection between the condemnation of the building and the attack made on Dr Gilruth.

ADJOURNMENT (Formal). WHEA T CROP : ACTION BY NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT.",8
50,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Wannon that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" Th© proposed action of the New South Wales Government to acquire by legislation the entire wheat crop in that State, and its effect upon the Inter-State trade and commerce of Australia."" Five lionorable members having risen in their ?>laces, Question proposed.",8
51,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wannon) [3.24] - For the benefit of the House I shall read a statement by the Premier of New South Wales in the Legislature of that State, as reported in the newspapers of Tuesday of last weekIn the Legislative Assembly today the Premier said he would ask the House to pass an urgency Bill, giving effect to the proposals, through all stages on the following day. Mr. Holman further announced that, from information collected by the Minister of Agriculture, it appeared that the forthcoming wheat harvest Holman) would be insufficient by an amount roughly of Customs estimated at 1,000,000 bags for consumption in should be taken the Commonwealth. Exact information on authorities on the wheat that point would be available later Minister. While there would be a surplus offered, and it was decided totlie within the area of New South Wales, there the consideration of the Premiers'submit would be a shortage in other parts of the which meets in Melbourne on Monday Commonwealth. It would therefore become necessary to import a quantity of wheat, sumably from Canada, in order to make np that shortage, and apparently the ruling price throughout the Commonwealth would be determined, not as in former years by the surplus they had for export and by the price ruling in the London market, but by the price of the 1,000,000 bags which they brought to supply local markets, and as that would be a high price, probably 6s. or 6s. 3d. per bushel, there was a probability of a increase in the price of flour and bread unless adequate steps were taken to protect the interests of the people of the State. What the Government proposed to do, Mr. Holman said, was to protect the situation of the Commonwealth as far as it was able to do. Clearly, any step they might take would leave the situation in other States in the Commonwealth unaffected where there was actual shortage, and where wheat at 6s. 3d. or"" 6s. 6d. per bushel had to be imported. Mark the Premier's use of the word "" urgency."" The Minister of Trade and. Customs long ago relieved this country from any doubt as to there being sufficient protection of the foodstuffs of Australia, by his declaration which has the effect of preventing the export of flour, wheat, and other commodities of the k in d ; and, therefore, it is to be hoped that the responsibility of providing the people of New South Wales with a cheap loaf will not be covered up under the cloak of protecting the people of Australia. This Parliament is clothed with ample author it y , and the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs has my complete approval. I am not now speaking of an ex-Minister of External Affairs, who reminds me of my "" two blades of grass""; his popularity has vanished, and his persistent remarks make me feel that the effort of his life has been rather to make "" one blade of grass"" grow where two grew before. The "" urgency "" referred to by the Premier of New South Wales is based, we are led to understand, on negotiations between Commonwealth Ministers and himself, and I shall, at a later stage, ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to lay on the table SYDNEY, Tuesday. the whole of the correspondence that has taken place regarding the wheat question. In both the Age and the Argus of today we are toldThe Premier of New South Wales _ [ Mr. made a suggestion to the Minister yesterday that collective action by the Federal and State question. Mr Tudor by the was not prepared to adopt suggestion it for Conference, next. preObserve the timorous "" urgency "" of this Premier, who is not prepared to take the responsibility himself for his action, and also observe the sagacity of the Minister then of Trade and Customs, who-and I commend him for it - will not touch the in question with a 40-foot pole.",8
52,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"So far as I am concerned, heavy that statement is not authoritative.",8
53,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What has all this to do with the question ?,8
54,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is just the point to which I am coming. The question assumes two aspects, with both of which I am vitally concerned. is the constitutional aspect, and the next is the effect of the action taken on one of the great industries of Australia. I shall not dwell long on the constitutional aspect, because there are others in the House better qualified to speak in that regard than I am myself. I feel it my - duty, however, to point out that this Parliament derives its authority in connection with trade and commerce from sect i o n 51 of the Constitution, and that section 92 seems to show the position very - clearly, so far as a layman is concerned. Section 92 readsOn the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among - the States, whether by means of internal age or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely - free. ""We have from the Premier of New South ""Wales an absolute declaration that the - estimated wheat supply in that State will be more than adequate for tTfe require-ments of the people there. We are.aware that there are certain policing powers, as we may call them, which may be put into operation for the preservation of life, and for the protection and the well-being and health, and so forth , of the citizens, under which a State may operate. W it h total disregard of the Constitution, Western Australia acted in the restriction of the importation of produce from one 'State to another. Western Australia, by an over-exercise of these policing powers, attempted to restrain trade in this way. Now we have the first attempt made in the Commonwealth to assert, at any rate the first declaration by any State, that the foodstuffs in that State shall be the property of the State and disposed of by the Government as they may think proper. It matters little to me that the New South Wales Bill may provide thab, if there be surplus wheat after New South Wales requirements are met, that surplus will be at the disposal of the other States. If the Federal Parliament has the right to act as the guardian - of freedom of trade between the States, in order to insure free and unfettered commercial intercourse, it little matters, I say, that a Government, while temporarily holding up that trade, may promise to ultimately make available the surplus for distribution amongst the other States. The action of New South Wales seems to be the converse of the action of Western Australia, when that State, The first by an overcautious system of inspection, prevented Victorian potatoes from finding their natural market under a condition of Inter-State Free Trade. Here we have an avowed declaration by the Premier of New South Wales that it is his intention to prevent the wheat crop of that State, and the surplus of the previous years-and that must be borne in mind, because a surplus did exist-findin g its natural market in the other States. Western Australia by its inspection system attempted to prevent foodstuffs getting into the State, and now we have the converse action of an attempt to prevent foodstuffs leaving a State. I can well understand the attempt of the Precarrimier of New South Wales to secure uniform action on the part of the various States. There is a very old and impressive story told of the fox that had its tail cut off, and that story seems apposite to the present circumstances. I believe that from a constitutional standpoint, and also having regard to the effecfc which his action will have on the agricultural interests of New South Wales, the Premier of that State has blundered badly. Whatever the constitutional aspect of this matter may be, the question arises as to who is to decide regarding the legality of the action which has been taken. Is New South Wales itself to determine the justice or injustice of an action which we believe to be wrong? Or is the Federal Parliament to be the arbiter? If so, I hope that fchis House will today show itself a jealous custodian of the rights of the whole of the States.",9
55,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you contend that it is beyond the power of a State t'o do what the New South Wales Government propose to do?,9
56,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes . Particularly when the Government make an open declaration that they have more foodstuffs in New South Wales than the people of that State require.,9
57,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Y o u will have to support the referendum on the next occasion.,9
58,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The referendum is the honourable member's pet nostrum for everything. If the action of the New South Wales Government in acquiring the entire wheat crop of that State and preventing freedom of trade between the States is correct, how does Australia stand i u respect of its many great natural industries ? Suppose the Queensland Government were to similarly acquire and control the sugar crop, what would become of the true Federal spirit under which the States federated? A p parently we are to have the doctrine laid down that in times of plenty the Federal spirit is to be observed, but in lean years the opponents of the true Federal spirit are going to take the recoil action of asserting State rights in order, as they think, to produce a cheaper loaf for the people within their own particular State. If this action be right in respect of wheat, would it not be permissible in respect of New South Wales coal, Queensland sugar, and Western Australian timber? Let us glance at the position of the Riverina territory. Geographically and otherwise, Melbourne is the market for Riverina, bufc by the action of the New South Wales Government Riverina will be deprived of its natural market, and its produce will be forced to take a more costly and circuitous route.",9
59,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is not the New South Wales Governmenb building a railway to carry that produce into its own State?,10
60,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My honourable friend will be in ashes before that railway is available for the carriage of wheat. Having dealt with the constitutional aspect, let me now refer to the effect of the New South Wales Government's action on the wheat industry. The total wheat harvest in '1913-14 throughout the Commonwealth, including the Federal territories, was 103,517,000 bushels.",10
61,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was a record.,10
62,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . The estimate for this year is that the wheat harvest for the entire Commonwealth will be only 30,000,000 bushels. That estimate is nob made by the Federal Statistician, but it is based on the best information I was able to get in the time at my disposal. I have also the estimate of the New .South Wales Statistician for his own State, and I shall put that on record. The 1913-14 harvest in that State yielded 38,028,000 bushels, and the estimated yield for this year is 15,000,000 bushels. ",10
63,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am satisfied that the figure I have given will be the limit. This further fact has to be borne in mind : that the officials who have collected this information, though they have taken into consideration all the area under wheat, and the possible yield, have not f u l ly appreciated the fact that this year there will be an enormous additional area cut for hay. The farmers will be influenced to fchis step by the fact that a greater area will be required this year to produce the amount of fodder that must be consumed, and also by the action of the Government of New South Wales in declaring that they propose to acquire the whole of the harvest, which action I can characterize as nothing but a piratical invasion of the rural industry of New South Wales by the State Government.",10
64,Mr SHARPE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Do you say that, on account of the action of the State Government, the farmers will cut their wheat crops for hay?",10
65,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I say it most emphatically. Hay at £ 8 per ton, and wheat at 5s. a bushel! The honourable member showed very little practical knowledge about a subject he dealt with at considerable length not long since.",10
66,Mr SHARPE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You have not too much yourself.,10
67,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am interested in this matter as a wheat-grower in Victoria, and in New South Wales also. I have been interested in wheat growing in New South Wales during this year.",10
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do not take notice of his bovine interjections.,10
69,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Accordin g to the figures supplied in connection with a Commission which sat in New South Wales, that State carried over 2,600,000 bushels from the last harvest; and, estimating the crop this year at 13,000,000 bushels, there will be altogether 15,600,000 bushels in New South Wales with which to meet the needs of that State and the rest of Australia. According to the press report of a deputation of Victorian farmers which waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs, it is estimated that this season there will be a shortage in Victoria of 1,500,000 bushels.",10
70,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is what they said.,10
71,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I dare say that they have underestimated the shortage. In the matter of yields, there is an inclination to overestimate rather than to underestimate. My point is that Australia will undoubtedly be short by several million bushels. Mr Holman anticipated that the shortage would be 3,000,000 bushels, and that .it would be necessary to go to other countries in order to make it up. The average wheat yield in Australia is from 11 to 12 bushels per acre; last year the average in New South Wales was 11.86; we may call it 12 bushels. That return, at the price of 3s. 4d. per bushel prevailing when the harvest was declared, would have yielded a gross return of £2 per acre. Now, cost of production must always bear a certain relationship to the fixation of prices' doctrines; and I have estimates of the cost of production in various States which show that the cost of producing a wheat crop runs from 30s. to £2 per acre. In some parts of Victoria it is fully £ 2 . In the more settled where the land is heavier, and where the methods are better than in other districts, the cost is liigher than it is where there is light, free soil, and where the methods employed are not so good as in the other districts. According to the estimate of the New South Wales Statistician, the average yield of the State this season will be 4 or 4$ bushels per acre, which, at the fixed price of 5s. per bushel, will mean a return of £ 1 2s. 6d. per acre, or 7s. 6d. per acre less than the cost of production on the lowest basis I allow for the cost of growing an acre of wheat. Thus, assuming that the wheat yield of New South Wales is 15,000,000 bushels, the State Government propose to levy upon the drought-stricken farmers of the State, on Mr Holman's figures, a direct tax of £1,125,000; and if he is successful in bringing about uniformity of action, and a fixed price of 5s. per bushel throughout the various States, affecting a total Commonwealth yield of 30,000,000 bushels, there will be a levy of £2,250,000 on the drought-stricken farmers of the Commonwealth in order to provide a cheap loaf for the people of Mr Holman, and for every legislator whose affairs are not affected by the action of fixing the price of wheat.",10
72,Mr SHARPE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What would be a fair price ?,11
73,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Undoubtedly , on the admission of the Premier of New South Wales, 6s.. 6d. per bushel would be about the price. The gentlemen who waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs today said that 7s. per bushel would be about the import price. The drought-stricken farmer who is unable to provide for the necessities of himself and family, and unable to prevent his stock from starving, is to be the person of all others at this period who is to be called on for a direct levy of £1,125,000 by the Government of New South Wales, very nearly double the Eederal land tax paid in that State. The Federal land tax paid by New South Wales landowners is £771,000. Surely the action of the Federal Government is not to connive at such a levy! Do our Government propose to assist the Government of New South Wales by financing the purchase of the wheat crop of the State, which, even at Mr Holman's figures, will mean an districts, expenditure of £3,750,000?",11
74,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was not the price fixed in the Mallee. by a Royal Commission?,11
75,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The price is fixed by the New South Wales BilL However, as I have only a few more minutes, I shall not answer any further questions from honourable members. Apparently, the position is, that the Federal Government are financing another Labour Government which has for its avowed object the purchase of the wheat crop of its State at a cost of £3,750,000. The State Government has, by its appeal to the Federal Government, proved its utter inability to conduct its own financial arrangements, and place at the disposal of the people the ordinary facilities of government, enabling public works to bo proceeded with. Yet here is a monstrous proposal on the part of the Federal Government to lend money to a State Government in order that it may exact an enforced levy of £1,125,000 from its drought-stricken farmers. I am very much mistaken if the country will stand such an action. Public conscience must be stirred up. Industry would not be safe under sueh conditions. We have the Premier of the State appealing to the farmers to spread out their areas and fallow more land, and telling them that if they do so they will get 4s. per bushel for their wheat. Is it the proper thing for the trustees of the money of the people of New South Wales to buy in advance the whole of next year's wheat crop for 4s. a bushel? Let there be no more talk in this House against the speculator when the Premier of New South Wales is permitted to do a thing like that. The proposition of the New South Wales Government is not a practical one. It requires two years' cultivation to make land ready for wheat growing. On ""the one hand, the Premier of New South Wales levies the sum of £1,125,000 from droughtstricken farmers, and, on the other, he tries to encourage the cultivation of an area double that now cultivated.",11
76,Mr SHABFE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How long is it since the farmers got a price like that which they are now offered ?,12
77,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members fail to appreciate the difference between the position of the farmer in the year when the harvest is good and his position in the year of drought, when the yield will not average 3 bushels an acre throughout the Commonwealth. question reveals a lack of practical knowledge.",12
78,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member's time has expired.,12
79,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There was one other point to which I wished to refer, but there are, no doubt, many other members to speak who will deal with the matters that I have omitted to mention.  port the motion. The matter which it has been moved to discuss may be considered from two stand-points, from that of the consumer, or bread-eater, and from that of the producer or farmer. The Government must have regard to the interests of both classes, and in the discussion of this subject there should be no intrusion of ironical interjections, or of party feeling. On both sides there are honourable members who represent farming constituencies. New South Wales is the only State which this year will have a surplus of wheat; the other States will harvest enough grain to provide seed only for next season, certainly not enough to provide their people with bread. Therefore, it is the duty of this - Government to see that no action is taken by the Government of New South Wales which will in jure the rest of the Commonwealth. If it were an individual, or a company, or a syndicate, that proposed to corner the New South Wales wheat crop, the howls of indignation would prevent us from hearing one another speak. Many of those who interjected during the speech of the honourable member for Wannon would be the loudest in their complaint.",12
80,Mr TTJDOB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Do the New South Wales Government propose to make anything out of the transaction ?  has been arbitrarily fixed, and, though a Bill has not yet been passed through the State Parliament, no dealer in wheat dare offer any other price, and no farmer dare expect more than 5s. a bushel at the nearest railway station.",12
81,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member's complaint is that the farmers cannot get more for their wheat.  honourable member has not practical experience of wheat growing. If he had, he would be less hypercritical. Even in New South Wales there are many places where, during the last three or four years, farmers have been growing wheat The at a loss. Remembering these losses, it it not too much for them to expect to be recouped by higher prices this season. Even 5s. a bushel is not a paying price. As a practical wheat grower, I say that, if every item is taken into consideration, from 5s. 6d. to 6s. a bushel would be only a paying price, even in the most favoured districts. Por what other than speculative purposes has the New South Wales Government arbitrarily fixed the price of wheat? What is it going to do with the surplus ? Is it going to act as a philanthropist, and say to the people of the other States, ' ' You can have wheat at the price that we gave for it "" ? That is the last thing that should be expected of that Government. Y e t it speaks of encouraging wheat-growing by the fixing of a minimum price for next year! The action of the New South Wales Government, if this Government does not intervene, will be to retard production. Inasmuch as the other States have not sufficient wheat to meet their requirements, this Government should declare that the action of the Government of New South Wales in cornering the wheat crop of that State is prejudicial to the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. The consideration of this matter by the State Parliament has been postponed.",12
82,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it not to be considered by a Conference next Monday ?  to be brought before the Conference of Premiers which is to meet .next week. I was in the Legislative Assembly chamber in Sydney yesterday afternoon, when in reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition it was stated that action was to be deferred pending some arrange"" tnenb. Before that statement was made it was thought that the Standing Orders would be suspended to enable a Bill authorizing the Government's action to be passed through in one sitting. I hope that before anything definite is done the Minister of Trade and Customs will strongly protest against the proposed cornering of wheat by the Government of New South Wales.",12
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parramatta) [4.0] - The honourable member for Wannon has done a distinct public service in bringing this matter forward for discussion at the present time. Nothing more serious can the attention of the Legislature than the prices of primarv commodities which are the source of life to us all . Like many other honourable members, I represent consumers, and my chief and primary interest is to see that the staple of life is made as cheap as possible consistently with the interests of the producers. No one desires a dear loaf in Australia, nor a condition of things which would make bread dear fco those who toil. Therefore, we are not wasting the time of Parliament in discussing these matters affecting our daily bread. I do not quite see what function the Commonwealth Government has in the regulation of these things. Ifc may, of course, interpose to preserve that freedom of intercourse which is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and one of the chief purposes of Federation, but whether the time has arrived when it can intervene I do not pretend to say. I understand that a Conference with the Premiers is to be held next Monday, at which this matter, among others, will be dealt with. Members of the Government have spoken of these Conferences as an excrescence on the Constitution, but the present Ministers have multiplied their number. am glad that they show such good sense, and I am pleased that this most serious question is to be considered by a Conference. What are the facts? This year New South Wales, alone of all the States, has a small surplus of wheat. But let it not be thought that therefore the farmers of the State are doing well. Nothing could be further from the t r u t The official statistics are eloquent testi[38] mony to their hardships. Last year, 3,205,000 acres were under wheat in New South Wales, and this year nearly 3,500,000 acres will be put under wheat. The estimated yield is 15,000,000 bushels- a high estimate-o r about 4 bushels an acre.",13
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a great deal more than many farmers are getting in this State.,13
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Exactly . I am considering the position of a farmer in what afc the present time is the best situated of all the States.,13
86,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable gentleman does not take into account the quanoccupy tity of wheat cut for hay.,13
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,13
88,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member for Wannon said that a great deal had been cut for hay.,13
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That , I think, must be so; otherwise, the cost would be very shocking. But take the case of wheat alone. Ifc is that which I wish to im press on lionorable members. I read in a country newspaper a few days ago a detailed estimate, supplied by a farmer in New South Wales, of what it cost to put in his crop and to fake it out. His estimate amounted to about 32s. per acre.",13
90,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He must have had very hard ground to work. I can do it for £ 1 an acre, and pay good wages.",13
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I congratulate the honourable member. He must be very expert.,13
92,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He is a practical farmer.,13
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bu the is not in this respect a typical farmer. I defy him, practical farmer that he is, to show that it is costing only £ 1 an acre over all Australia to put in a wheat crop and take it out. Is he allowing for interest on the cost of his land ?",13
94,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am allowing for everything except seed and manure. I Mr. JOSEPH COOK - See d and manure represent nearly a third of £ 1 . In the detailed estimate to which I have referred, interest is put down at 6s. per acre, while ploughing is set down at 7s. per acre-the exact cost given altogether being £ 1 l is . l i d . per acre. I should like to know if the honourable member allowed for interest in his calculation?",13
95,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The right honourable memh . ber was talking about the cost of putting in a crop and taking it oufc.,13
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was speaking of an estimate supplied by a farmer in New South Wales of the total cost of farming his land per acre. that it cost him £ 1 l is . l i d . per acre, allowing for seed wheat, manure, and in terest. W it h a yield of only 4 bushels per acre, that man would want 8s. per bushel to pay him.",14
97,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is that what the right honourable member says should be the price of wheat today ?,14
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; I do not say what it ought to be. these broad figures, I say that they ought to make men like the Attorney-General and myself careful how we interfere in this matter.",14
99,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Werriwa is, so far as I am aware, the only practical farmer in the House. There are other honourable members who started to grow wheat, but came out of the industry because they could not make a success of it . The honourable member for Werriwa, however, continues to grow wheat. The Leader of the Opposition commenced wheat cultivation, but gave it up because he could not grow any wheat.",14
100,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Order ! constant interjections take place, I shall be compelled to ask that the right honourable member be allowed an extension of time.",14
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Le t me put this matter in another way. At page 27 of the Commonwealth Statistical Bulletin, it is stated that, in 1904, in New South Wales, the total production of crops amounted to £12,372,000. These figures include hay, sugar-cane, vines, and winemaking, potatoes, and all other highly profitable crops, and that represents what was gained from 4,568,000 acres. have, therefore, an average return of ahout £2 14s. per acre. The farmers elearly have not been having a good time for many years past",14
102,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They have been having during the last few years the best times they have ever experienced, and the right honourable member knows it .",14
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think so, in one State.",14
104,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The official figures prove my statement.,14
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thes e returns do not. If , as the honourable member says, the farmers have been having a good time, it is a p it y that that fact cannot be expressed in figures. The returns I have been quoting have been He showed prepared by the Government Statistician from figures supplied by farmers.",14
106,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where does the unfortunate consumer come in ? Is he not to be considered?,14

109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A gentleman who buys and sells wheat on commission - wh o does a large business, but does not speculate, and never has done so-tell s me that since the Government began to fix the price of wheat speculators have been doing a roaring business. They have been going into the country and "" scooping the pools,"" with the result that those who sell on commission-sellin g honestly and doing what they can for the farmers - fin d themselves without an occupation. These speculators are reaping rich harI f these vests, and making fortunes out of the fixing of prices.",14
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And some of them get inside knowledge, too.",14
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is alleged that some of them get inside information and make use of it to their own advantage. All that I suggest to the Government is that they should discuss this matter very seriously with the Government of New South Wales. If they can bring any moderating influence to bear I hope it will be in the direction of preWe venting interference except where wrong is being done. There is no justification for the Government interfering with these matters except where a wrong is being perpetrated upon the people of this country. ' To put the matter in its best aspect, what is happening in New South Wales is that, in order to prevent the man who has a bountiful crop getting a littl e more, the Government are running the risk of jeopardizing the very income of the man who has only a small crop, and whom the drought has hit very heavily. I do not say that the Government have no right to interfere in time of war; but it is not the war-it is the drought that is causing the present trouble. The war has nothing to do .Will this time of pinching poverty through which some people are passing; the drought alone is responsible, and honourable members opposite should be very chary how they step in to prevent the primary industries taking advantage of a little higher prices in order to recoup them for a tremendously lower production. I do not know what the Commonwealth Government can do, but they should consider whether they ought not to do something.",14
112,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What are we to,15
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I understand that the Government propose to consider this matter with the Premiers of the States.,15
114,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But what are we to here and now ?,15
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I suggest that the Government should try to persuade the State Premiers to let these things alone for the present.,15
116,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And abolish the Prices Boards ?,15
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am talking, not of Prices Boards, but of the action of State Governments which are their own Prices Boards, so to speak, and are passing Bills to regulate the prices of these commodities.",15
118,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The fixation of prices is within the power of the States.,15
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not clear as to that. I suggesfc that the Commonwealth Government should acfc if they find the States going beyond the mark in this respect. We read, for instance, today fchafc the South Australian Government are prohibiting their own people from sanding fco Tasmania corn which has been purchased there. That, surely, an interference with Infcer-Stafce Pree Trade. I am not quite clear as to whether this action on the part of the New South Wales Governmenfc is not a direct interference with the principle of Interstate Pree Trade. What is their action in commandeering all the produce of their own State and declining to allow it to be sent into any other State, except upon certain terms and conditions, but the placing of a restriction-the placing of a bar sinister-upo n trade between the States? I hope the Commonwealth Government will step in , if need be, to prevent injustice being done to the consumer, on the one hand, and the producer on the other. [ 3 8 ] -* Both are entitled to consideration in these times, and one is jusfc as much entitled to consideration as is the other.",15
120,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Werriwa) [4.19] Whilst I hold that the honourable member who has submitted this motion and those who support his action are wholly mistaken, and that their energy and talent are being misdirected, I feel that the fact that fchey express concern for the poor farmer who is being robbed today give3 us some little reason to hope that eventually they may turn their attention to the point at which the great robbery is being perpetrated, and which lies at the do? beginning of the work of production itself. I have followed wheat-growing for twenty-five years. I started in a very small way, and, like every one else, I follow my personal interests very keenly. In New do South Wales, the bulk of the wheat produced in the big wheat-growing districts is raised by very poor men under the share-farming system. We have, it is true, a large number of very small holders cultivating their own land, but, except for the middle-class holder, in very few instances are men of considerable means operating under a wages system. Ifc has become a common practice, especially among share-farmers and very small holders-tk e poor and the needy-to make advance sales of their wheat; but I have not heard on the part of the Opposition any expression of solicitation for the welfare of these men. I have not heard the Opposition express any desire that they should be relieved of the absurd contracts - absur d because of the war which subsequently broke out-entere d into by them to sell their new season's wheat at 3s. and 3s. 3d. a bushel.",15
121,Mr BODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Would you relieve the is wheat-growers by such an action as that taken by the New South Wales Government ?,15
122,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I would relieve the wheat-growers by some such means as I sketched the other night, when I said that if the State would guarantee a price, not only in time of war, bufc at all times, ib would result in making the industry permanent, instead of a sort of gamble in which one or two bad years may beggar a man. We find no relief foreshadowed for those people who have made contracts, and are really suffering. But the question arises whether we, as a farming class in New South Wales, should raise a dust over what has been described as the "" robbery"" of the producer, and make accusations against the powers that be, when they are called upon to pass extraordinary legislation, not only throughout the Commonwealth, but throughout the Empire. I have been twenty-five years a wheat-grower, and I never yet received 5s. a bushel; and are we to permit the statement to go forth to the world that, when the Empire is in danger, and there is dearth of employment in every direction, those in the wheat industry are determined to take advantage of their more needy fellow-creatures? A r e the wheat growers going to allow it to be known that they insist on their ' ' pound of flesh ""-that they insist on a price they have never been able to exact before? The bulk of us who are engaged in the wheat industry have, in the past, sold our produce for a trifle, and, though we were staggering under debt, no one came forward specially to assist us. As one who is more solicitous for the development of the wheat industry than of any other, it seems to me that the opportunity is being taken to nip in the bud what might turn out to be a very dangerous thing to tbose large numbers of people who are able to live as expensive idlers under our present system of production. It will no doubt, in the opinion of some, furnish a most dangerous precedent if we allow any Government to calmly fix the distribution price in the hour of t r i a cause this fixing is, in its results, satisfactory to the community as a whole; then, when the socialistic agitators come forward with a proposal to regulate the monstrous robbery in the form of rents and shares that are being exacted from the blood and toil of those actively engaged in the industry, there may be a danger of the conclusion that, as the system has worked so well in the case of distribution, it may work quite as well in the case of production. I have some wheat, though not a great deal, to sell this year, and I am pleased to say that I could, as a member of this House, face every farming centre in my constituency without, I think, losing a single vote, except, perhaps, in the case of a few interested commission agents and others, who may be afraid of finding their occupation gone.",15
123,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member approve of the action of the New South Wales Government?,16
124,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainl y I do; and if the New South Wales Government will follow up their present step with others they have already adumbrated in connection with a supertax and the fixing of rentals, there will be given to the wheat growing industry an impetus that could not be attained by any other means. I have heard it.said that the price of 5s. a bushel at the railway siding will so affront wheat farmers that they will put in less wheat; indeed, it has been said that some of them are cutting for hay some crop that might be turned to grain.",16
125,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is no doubt about that.,16
126,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All I can say is that, if there are such farmers, they do not live in the huge wheat-growing area that I represent. Practical men must recognise that, in view of the drought, the hay this year is, at best, of inferior quality. We know that, as a rule, a drought such aa we experienced in 1902 and are experiencing now is very apt to break up in November or December, and that, with what may be found in the stubble paddocks, the quantity of hay used on the farms this year may be reduced to, perhaps, one-half; at any rate, the chances are that growth will take place, and a small quant it y of hay will 3ee us through. The class of hay which we harvest in such a bad year is of inferior quality, and, of course, it brings inferior prices. The l, be- cost of bagging and handling hay is so high, unless the land is close fco a railway station, that the majority of farmers would prefer to fill their bags with anything else, and very few cut more hay than they require for their own consumption.",16
127,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Are there not hay districts and wheat districts ? "" Mr LYNCH - E x a c t l y ; but mostly hay-growing districts are oat-growing ones, and I am speaking of whafc I know. Farmers have lived through past years without getting the price now offered; and, in 1902, they saw a worse drought than the present, as the figures show. A few good years, however, relieved most of us, on our own holdings, from debt; and why should we ask for special exemption from a sysfcem of fixing prices that is now universal all over the world ? We bave heard no howl from the wool-growers, although it has been stated in the newspapers that it is the intention' of the British Government to buy up the Argentine and other foreign wools to prevent the enemy getting supplies, thus leaving Australian wool looked up. I should be sorry to think that the patriotism of the pastoralists is of a higher quality than Miat of the farmers; indeed, I am sure that that is not so. As I said before, when State interference will guarantee us 3s. 4d. or 3s. 6d. a bushel, the in dustry will become permanent, and it may become desirable to regulate, not only the terms of distribution, but also the terms under which men engage in production. Nothing is so productive of a number of worthless idlers than the attaining of a permanent title to large areas of fertile land; aud it is those idlers that the farming community is called upon to support today. I know what it is to start from nothing on the land; and what little headway I have made has been by means of wheat farming. It has been said by some honourable gentleman that it costs from 32s. to £ 2 an acre to put in a crop and take it out again; but in the Riverina district any number of men could be found to plough new ground at 6s. an acre, while old ground can be profitably dealt with for 4s. An y man knows that it is cheaper to harvest a poor crop than a good one.",16
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What would honourable member pay a ploughman?,17
129,Mr LYNCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"M o s t ploughmen get from 25s. to 30s. a week and keep. If it is old ground, and the ploughing is consecutive, it can be done profitably from 4s. to 4s. 6d., and the land can be ploughed once and harrowed twice for 10s. an acre by good capable men with an up-to-date plant. have harvested with an harvester, on an average, 10 acres per day of about ten hours, over a term of six weeks. Of course, if one is harvesting a 10-bag crop he naturally cannot do more than, perhaps, two-thirds of what he would if it toms, were a poor crop; and today many procarriage ducers are not hiring men at all . Only lutely free. today I have received a letter from engaged in the industry who tell me they are not employing any hands, beStates cause the harvest is so small that they can do the work themselves; and in the farming industry, as in other industries, we do not pay men when they are not wanted.",17
130,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Franklin) [4.33]The honourable member for Werriwa New speaks as the practical farmer on his side-as the hope of his party.,17
131,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And you are the "" practical far m e r "" on that side, I suppose? '",17
132,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have yet to learn that the honourable member for I l lawarra is a practical man at anything. I , of course, accept the figures given by the honourable member for Werriwa as to the part of the country in which he is particularly interested, but I can imagine no greater fallacy than to lay down a rule that shall apply to land generally. Everything depends on the nature of the land; some lands cost twice as much as others to crop, and some produce twice as much as others. Owing to the excitement of the war, the conditions at present prevailing in Australia have not received that consideration they would have secured under ordinarycircumstances. I solemnly believe that the four southern States, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, are in a worse condition today than in any previous year since they have been settled and cultivated. I know that in the State of Tasmania there have never been conditions equal in severity to those which prevail today. Tasmania is, as a rule, the immune from droughts; but today that State is drought stricken from one end to the other, with the exception of a small portion on the north-west coast. Who can say what price will pay a farmer who is getting practically no yield at all?_ I do say that the attempt which is being made by the New South Wales Government to commandeer, or buccaneer, the I whole wheat surplus of that State is a direct infringement of the Constitution. If there is one section of the Constitution which is clearer than another, it is section 92On the imposition of uniform duties of Custrade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal or ocean navigation, shall be absomen The Government of Tasmania applied to that the Governments of some of the other for wheat, pointing out thai there was a shortage in the harvest there, and that a further supply was necessary, in order that the people might be' fed. Those States replied that they had no wheat surplus. Is it in accordance with the Constitution that the Government of South Wales may say, "" A l t h o u g h we have a surplus in our State, the other States may starve for bread "" ?",17
133,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They have uot said that.,18
134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is exactly what they are doing today; and it is time that the Federal Government considered whether the action of the New South Wales Government is not a direct and open violation of the Constitution. Is it not a prevention of free trade, interchange, and intercourse between the States when a Government deliberately lock up the surplus of any product, and say to other States, which are in need of that surplus, "" Y o u shall not have it "" ? Wlien Western Australia, by means of prohibitive inspection fees, placed a high protective duty on imports from Tasmania and Victoria, I held that it was the duty of the Federal Government to intervene, and they did intervene. TJnited States, from the Constitution of which section 92 is taken, the Federal Government adhere to that section so strongly that when a strike has occurred which has interfered with Inter-State trade they have intervened, and said, "" Y o u may fight these squabbles out among yourselves in your States; but the moment you infringe the Constitution by preventing free intercourse between the States, we, as the custodian of the rights and privileges of the people, musfc intervene."" In New South Wales, however, an open violation of the Constitution has taken place, and the State Government glory in throwing the gauntlet in the face of the Federal Government, and saying, "" No matter what your Constitution provides, we admit that we have more wheat than we require, but the other States may starve.""",18
135,Mr HANNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They have not said that.,18
136,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They have said so. I am under the impression, but am not sure, that the Government of Tasmania have applied to the Government of New South Wales for wheat.",18
137,Mr HANNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Have they been refused ?,18
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I believe they have.,18
139,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you say that the South Wales Government refused to supply Tasmania with wheat?,18
140,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think they have. I cannot speak with absolute certainty, but I know that the Tasmanian Government applied to other States, and they were unable to get supplies. As I have said, the four southern States are more drought stricken this year than they have been at any time since they have been settled. The coming year is going to be the worse time that the farmer and the far m labourer have ever experienced. The farmer may get credit for his fertilizers, and the Government may supply him with seed wheat, but wages have to be paid in cash, and I know that there are scores and scores of farmers all over the southern States who are not able to pay cash TO their labourers. Therefore, the hardship will rest particularly on the small farmer in those States, and on the farm labourers, whom I regard as one of the most deserving classes in Australia, and I In the believe that in the coming season hundreds of these men will be thrown out of employment through no fault of either themselves or their employers. The thanks of the House are due to the honourable member for Wannon for having brought this matter under our attention. I know that honourable members from New South Wales do not realise the extent of the drought prevailing in the other States. In Victoria one may travel for miles and miles without seeing any wheat:",18
141,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We are not so badly off as we were in 1902.,18
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I believe that i u many places in Victoria the conditions are worse thanfcheywere in 1902. I know on good authority that South Australia is in an infinitely worse condition than it has ever been in .,18
143,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Australia has sufficient, wheat to supply its own requirements.",18
144,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that South Australia has not sufficient for its own requirements. When the Tasmanian Government applied to the South Australian Government for wheat, they were refused on the ground that South Australia had not enough for its own people.",18
145,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They will not say that today. They have about enough wheat to keep them going. New Mr MCWILLIAMS - I am informed that this is the worse year that Western Australia has ever experienced. No price we can fix for wlieat will give the man a drought-stricken area an adequate reto turn for the labour he has put in know men who are getting practically nothing for tlieir crops. I know of others to the wheat crop in that State. who, instead of having £700 or £800 worth of chaff, will not have more enough to feed their own horses through the year. So far as Tasmania is cerned, the harvest is practically n i l .",18
146,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It has the best any of the States so far .,19
147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have pointed 5s. as a minimum? out that, whilst in ordinary years the yield in Tasmania may be very much members larger than that in other States, the of ploughing, sowing, and garnering is infinitely greater, because the farmers there never use the harvester at all. believe that the fixing of the price of wheat this year is going to have the effect of enormously reducing the area planted next year.",19
148,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Do you refer to the fixing of prices by the Boards? M i \ MCWILLIAMS - Whether the price is fixed by a Government or by a average yield? Board, the result is the same. I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa that there is a considerable element of gambling in wheat growing. Unless the him. farmer knows that afc certain times he is going to get a very considerable price for his wheat he will cease wheat growing altogether.",19

150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"E x a c t l y . we can regulate the elements we regulate the pricesto be paid to the farmer for his wheat. Are we going to say to the farmer, as the Governments of nearly all the States are saying, "" P ut all the wheat you can for the sake of the Empire ""-at the same time we will allow one bushel of wheat to be sent away Government in Australia. to help the Empire- "" and if you get bountiful harvest you must face the comduct petition of the world, and take what you can get for your grain, but if the country is drought-stricken, and your yield is small that no price will repay you, we will fix a price which cannot possibly repay you.""",19
151,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member's time has expired.,19
152,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [ 4 . 4 7 ] - I am in that many honourable members are tryin g make political cajiital out of the fact . T lhat the Government of New South Wales propose to take certain action with regard I feel confident that if the persons who are enthan gaged in wheat-growing in Australia could be guaranteed anything like 5s. per conbushel for the next couple of seasons the number of acres under wheat would proaverage of bably be doubled or trebled.,19
153,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He a r , hear! Y o u mean",19
154,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I take it that honourable are objecting to the action cf the cost Boards who have fixed the prices of wheat, but I would point out that in at least two States those Boards were apI pointed by anti-Labour Governments. What is the true position in regard to the wheat supply today, and what has been the experience in past years? The average price of wheat in Australia during the last fifteen or twenty years has been less than 3s. 8d. per bushel.",19
155,Mr EODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But what has been the,19
156,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members opposite are anxious to know why Mr H o l man saw me, what he said to me, and E to Let me say at onee that the statement published in the newspapers today was not based on any information given by me. Mr Holman did see me, as many Premiers visiting Melbourne do sea the Federal Ministers on various matters, but"" no communication has gone from the Unless Federal Government to any other Governcannot ment on the wlieat question.",19
157,Mr EODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear , hear!",19
158,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I feel confident that any in State Government may please themselves as to what they do in regard to this quesnot tion, without reference to any other The Vica torian Government could buy up any proi n Australia, absolutely the whole of it, and decide afterwards what to do with it : they oould please themselves whether so they sold it again or gave it away.",19
159,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,A r e you sure about that? I hope you have been advised on the point. Mr TUDOR : - I notice that all the able constitutional lawyers opposite,19
160,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I mean that as a M in afraid ister you ought not to give a final pronouncement on a matter of that sort unless you have been so advised.,19
161,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am informed that the New South Wales Government can do as they please on this question, and that the only bearing any action on the part of the Commonwealth Government could have would be if afterwards we seized the wheat the State has secured.",20
162,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Subjec t to the Constitution, of course.",20
163,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Of course, the Eederal Government have no power to buy and sell things.",20
164,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I agree with the Minister, except that the State Governments are subject to the Australian Constitution.",20
165,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Government of New South Wales will have to answer to the people of the State for their action in taking the wheat. While estimates have been given as to the probable harvest this season very few people can say how much has been held over from last season by speculators. Speaking from memory, I believe that one gentieman informed the Commission in Melbourne, when an inquiry was being held, that he held 900,000 bushels of wheat.",20
166,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did not the States pass measures in order to get the information ?,20
167,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Some States passed Bills, but others did not. South Australia did not.",20
168,Mr RICHABD POSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,South Austral i a got a return from every individual in the State.,20
169,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But the State did not appoint a Board to deal with the matter. The Government, by their action, practically said, "" We shall gefc the i nformation, but allow those who have the produce to do whafc they like with it . "" I suppose that the 1914-15 crop can be fairly accurately estimated; at any rate, we are all unanimous on the point that it will be a very small crop, bufc apparently some honourable members think that in these circumstances it is their duty to get the highest possible price for the producer and let the consumer "" go hang.""",20
170,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The producer drought-stricken.,20
171,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And many consumers are poverty-stricken. Owing to the'drought and unfortunate circumstances existing throughout the world today, many consumers have not the opportunity of working, as they would like to do, and therefore, even though the loaf be dearer, they will have less with which to pay for it .",20
172,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why should not the consumer be taxed as well as the producer ?,20
173,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The consumer is being taxed, even with the price of wheat at 5s. a bushel, which is much higher than tha price obtained last year, or the year before. In Australia, for a number of years, the price of wheat has been less than 4s. per bushel, and that figure has governed the price of the loaf of bread.",20
174,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That was on an average of 12 bushels, whereas the average is only 3 bushels today.",20
175,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member contend that the purchaser should now pay four times the price that was paid for wheat when the yield was fou r times as great as the present; because that is where the honourable member's argument will lead him. Apparently the honourable member's attitude is that the producer must get the best possible price so that the honourable member may go to the farmers and say, "" I argued in Parliament for you to get the highest possible price for your wheat produced in this year of drought.""",20
176,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I want to see that the consumer is affected as well as the farmer.,20
177,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Independentl y of any action taken by a State Government, the consumers will have to pay fair l y highly. I understand that the proposal of the New South Wales Government is to buy the wheat crop of New South Wales at a fixed price, and, if there is any surplus over the State's requirements, to sell that surplus to the other States at that fixed price. Honourable members have contended that if the action taken had been taken by a syndicate, or by speculators, or a ring, it would be denounced by honourable members on the Government side. That would be the case if the Government of New South Wales proposed to do what a r in g or speculators would do; is but what would any ring or speculator who cornered the wheat supply, or the supply of any other foodstuff, do? Put up the price of the article to the highest possible point, and compel the consumers to pay it . As I understand it , the proposal of the New South Wales Government is to purchase the whole of the wheat at the fixed price of 5s., and, in the event of any other State being so short as to necessitate its purchasing outside the State, if not outside Australia, they are willing to sell to that State at cost price.",20
178,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where does the Minister get that information?,21
179,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Fro m the press.,21
180,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not gather it from the utterances that have been published.,21
181,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was in an article published in the Age, which time will not permit me to read.",21
182,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If it appeared in the Age that would account for my missing it.,21
183,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In the event of New South Wales having a surplus, it is the intention of the Government of that State to hand over that surplus to the other States at the price paid by the State of New South Wales for the wheat- I cannot see that any other State has any room for complaint on that score-and I believe that they intend to go further. The suggestion, I gather from the press, is that, in the event of a shortage of wheat, they are willing to co-operate with the other Governments, and do exactly as the New Zealand Government have done, namely, import from overseas, thereby saving commission and the expenses of the middlemen, which ordinarily have to be paid by the consumer and the producer. I think that is the attitude the State Government have taken up on this question.",21
184,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the price of wheat in America today?,21
185,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In Chicago two days ago the price of wheat was 1 dollar 12 cents to 1 dollar 15 cents, or 4s. 8d. to 4s. 9§d. Mr Mc WILLIAMS - What would be the cost of landing that wheat in Australia?",21
186,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"About Is. a bushel, which is, roughly, the cost of sending wheat from Australia to Great Britain.",21
187,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That figure includes selling charges and everything.,21
188,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes . I understand that everything is included.,21
189,Mr RODGERS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is also a duty of Is. per bushel.,21
190,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member had asked the cost of landing wheat here and paying all the charges, plus the duty, I would, of course, have added l i d . , which is roughly the duty. The Tariff is Is. 6d. per central, which is about l i d . or l l j d . per bushel. Of course, in the case of importation, that duty would need to be considered. The honourable member f6r Wannon spoke of a deputation which waited on me. I gave the paragraph to the press. The deputation asked that the duty be waived, and that they should be informed of it, so that they might be prepared to import; but I told them that any alteration to the duty must first be announced in Parliament, so that every one would be on the same footing, and so that no one could get inside information, which some honourable members, apparently, consider they have in regard to this matter.

202,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"Darling Downs) [5.7] I move That the Bill be now recommitted to a Committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 3, 10, and 13. I desire to raise two issues; the question of the application of legislation to actions pending at the time in the Courts, and the inclusion in industrial organizations of employees of persons not employees. Clauses 3 and 13 deal with registration. Section 19 of the principal Act gives the Court cognisance, for the prevention and In addi- settlement of disputes, of certain specific industrial disputes. They are these : A dispute certified to by the Registrar; all industrial disputes submitted to the Court by an organization by plaint; all industrial disputes which any State in dustrial authority refers to the Court; and all industrial disputes in regard to which the President has held a compulsory conference. Clause 3 amends section 19 by inserting. after the word "" organization "" the words "" o r by an association registered for the time being as an organization."" According to the definition section of the Act , an organiza1,966 tion means any organization registered 93 pursuant to the Act. Clause 13 provides, 21 however, that258 Every association which at the commence2,338 ment of this Act is registered as an association, shall be deemed to have been duly registered. I dasire the recommittal of these provisions, because we require from the At torney-General an assurance that they are not intended to affect any proceedings that may now be taking place in any Court of justice.",23
203,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AN D,Why ?,23
204,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"Unde r the civil law all sorts of safeguards are provided to prevent interference with the hearing of a case by a properly constituted tribunal. without No person dare tamper with a witness nor with a jury . The general rule is that, while a case is pending, there shall PAPERS. be no interference with the tribunal which is to deal with it . It is highly dangerous Parliament to interfere with the rights of parties in cases being heard by the Judiciary. I wish to know, there(Provifore, whether the provisions to which I have referred will , if passed into law, v Rules interfere with any litigation now pend1914, ing. It would be exceedingly dangerous for the Legislature to interfere in such a way. I do not suggest that anything personally improper is intended, but what is a right principle may be infringed. I suggest the insertion of a provision to this effectNothing in this Act contained shall affect any proceedings pending whereby the matter of the registration of any organization is questioned. We ought not, and may not, discuss the pros and cons in any case that is pending, but we are entitled to know whether the Bill , if passed as it stands, would or would not affect existing rights. It would not be just to pass it without the usual saving clause.",23
205,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AN D,Why was not this proposal made last week ?,24
206,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,The Government would not permit it to be done. Ministers tried to force the Bill through.,24
207,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AN D,It could have been moved last week.,24
208,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"Eve n so, does that affect the justness of the proposal 1 If a wrong is being done, we can deal with it now. The Bill is still in the possession of the House and can be amended at this stage.",24
209,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,We are entitled to bring forward these matters for discussion when honourable members are present.,24
210,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"I do not wish to discuss in any way the merits of any case; but we know from the public press that a. case is pending, and I want the House to definitely assert the principle that legislation shall not apply to any pending litigation. Had the Bill been intended to apply to pending litigation, I presume that the Attorney-General would have told us so. My knowledge of him leads me to think that he would not w i l full y have kept us in ignorance of the fact. The Bill as it stands may be open to the interpretation that it excludes from the consideration of the Court in the determination of a case now pending the question of the cancellation of the registration of an organization, because it declares that an association which is registered shall be deemed to have been duly registered. As regards the second issue I desire to raise, clause 10 strikes at the foundation of industrial organization. The object of our arbitration law is to provide for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. An industrial dispute is a dispute between employers and employees in an industry or industries with respect to remuneration and conditions of employment. Clause 10 permits the enrolment in an organization of persons who are neither employers nor employees in the industry with which that organization is connected.",24
211,Mr BURNS,CONCILIATION AN D,What about'the officers of an organization who have been connected with an industry?,24
212,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"An officer who is a bond fide worker in an industry is properly a member of an organization connected with that industry, but a railway engineer cannot properly be a member of the Wharf Labourers Union.",24
213,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AN D,Does the honourable member know of a case of that kind?,24
214,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"I know of a case in which a lawyer who practises his profession, and who is not a wharf labourer, is a member of a wharf labourers union, and I say that it is not a sound principle to permit the enrolment in an organization of persons who are not employers or employees in the industry with which it is connected. To permit such enrolment is contrary to the principle of our law. It would enable disputes to be created in an industry by persons in no way connected with that industry. All these matters that I have mentioned affect vital prin ciples, and honourable members should have an opportunity to discuss them in detail in Committee.",24
215,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"Flinders) [5.19] - I make no apology for occupying time in the discussion of the motionfcorecommit; the Bill for the reconsideration of certain cl.auses in it . When I spoke on the motion for the second reading I was not full y aware of the immense reach and extraordinary effect of these clauses in regard to, not merely pending litigation, but also the whole operation of the arbitration law. We were told by the Attorney-General that the particular urgency on account of which the Bill was pressed forward last week had nothing to do with a case then pending, and now partly heard, in which the Australian Workers Union is concerned; that the urgency arose oufc of some conferences which were being held, or were about to be held, the members of which desired to know where they stood.",24
216,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"I said that the urgency arose from the position in which the Court found itself, including that under section 60.",24
217,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"If language means anything, I venture to say that honourable members on both sides of the House understood the Attorney-General to say, in answer to a question put by me at the time, that this Bill was not introduced for the purpose of affecting litigation now pending before Mr Justice Powers.",25
218,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,- I did nothing of sort.,25
219,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"If the At torney-General says that this Bill was introduced for that n-urpose, so much the better.",25
220,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"- I was asked to insert a clause declaring that the Bill did not refer to that litigation, and I refused.",25

224,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Affec t the decision on the merits? No.,25
225,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,I obliged to accept the Attorney-General's statement.,25
226,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AN D,Do not say that.,25
227,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"I obliged by parliamentary etinuette to accept it , but I am not obliged to refrain from conimenting on an extraordinary coincidence, and I shall do so. This is a matter concerning which it does not do for any of us to be mealy-mouthed. We must conform to the usages of Parliament, but we are not bound to covei up facts which seem to me, afc all events, to be very shocking. One of these facts is that, whilst a certain case is pending in the Courts, we have introduced into this House a Bill , the effect of certain clauses of which is to deal directly with the merits and the decision of that dispute. As the honourable member for Darling Downs has pufc it , this is the adoption of a principle which not only this Parliament, but, I believe, every British Parliament, has entirely refrained from following-the principle of interference, by amending legislation, with actions brought by citizens to test their rights before the Court? of the country.",25
228,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AN D,Are we always to stick to precedent?,25
229,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,No ; but I should have hoped that the honourable member would adhere to precedents that are based upon principles of honesty and public honour.,25
230,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AN D,The honourable member wishes to create industrial warfare.,25
231,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"I am not. the concerned with the honourable member.. His interjections are as unimportant as; he himself is. On the motion to recommit, these particular clauses, I am going t a show what we are asked to do. There is a powerful association or combine- I venture to say that it is .the most active and powerful combine at present existing in Australia-whic h is known as the Australian Workers Dnion. That combine is powerful, not only in the immense number of its members, but in the enormous political influence that it wields both in side and outside this Parliament. I do not exaggerate the facts one iota when I say fchafc the political lives of auite a number of honourable members opposite affect, lie. so to speak, in the hollow of the hands of this union. That being so, let us look afc what is happening. This association-the Australian Workers Union am - abou t the constitution of which I am going to speak in a moment, has registered itself under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I need hardly do more than remind honourable members of the an. principles under which that Act permits the registration of associations. Those principles were fought out before the High Court many years ago in what is known as the Jumbunna case. I hope the reference does not awaken any painful recollections in the mind of the honourable member for Henty.",25
232,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AN D,Not at all.,25
233,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"The whole question was then threshed oufc. It waa disputed by those opposed to the Jumbunna branch of the association that there was any constitutional power in this Parliament to enable the organizations to be created and registered under the Act . That argument was not accepted. The Court unanimously came to the conclusion that associations consisting exclusively of employees on the one side, or of employers on the other, could be registered. It held that, although there is no power directly given under the Constitution to create or register a corporation of that kind, yet the power given to the Parliament to legislate for the settlement of in dustrial disputes necessarily implied the power to enable associations of employers on the one hand, and of employees on the other, to meet together, to come to collective agreements, or to appear jointly instead of separately before the Courts which had to settle their disputes. power was declared by the united decision of the Court to be confined to the creation or registration of associations limited strictly to the employees of an industry on the one side, and to the employers of an industry on the other. But what has taken place ? As is well known, the Australian Workers Union has, for a long time, purported to be a very wide one. No one will question that, if it chooses to embrace a very large number of correlated industries, it has a right to do so, provided that it brings in the employees only for the legitimate purpose of arbitration. But whafc has it done ? Either by persuasion or force-by that kind of persuasion which is exercised, as we all know, by these powerful associations-it has compelled hundreds of persons, who uot only axe not employees in the particular industries with which it is connected, but who are not employees in any industry, to join its ranks. Instead, of being a legitimate association for the purpose of obtaining industrial peace, or to enter into industrial agreements, it has become a huge political, octopus-like organization.",25
234,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AN D,That is the trouble.,26
235,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"The trouble is that such an association should claim registration under the Act. That is the particular claim, which in the Courts of this country, and under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is being challenged by people who have a right to challenge it . I am going to point out what sort of an association this is which claims to be registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as representative of employees. In the Australian Worker of 19th September, 1904, there appeared, on the inside of the red page, an advertisement containing a list of local agents. They are all members-unde r the rules of the association, they must be members - of the Australian Workers Union.",26
236,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AN D,Not necessarily.,26
237,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AN D,There is no doubt about that.,26
238,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"The r e can be no doubt that the rules require it . I will show honourable members the sort of people whom it includes within its ranks as independent employees in the industry. There are storekeepers, publicans, cycle agents",26
239,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AN D,Lawyers .,26
240,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,I dare say bhere are; but they would be a very poor That class of lawyers who would be forced into it.,26
241,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"I rise to a point of order. I do not wish to prevent the honourable member discussing the general question, but, as he well knows, it is neither usual nor proper to deal in the House with matters that are awaiting decision by a Court after the evidence has been heard. . The honourable member proposes, however, to do that. He proposes to go into a question that is awaiting decision by a Judge tomorrow. That is not only improper, but indecent.",26
242,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"On the point of order. I am perfectly aware that it is contrary to the practice of Parliament to debate the merits of any matters pending before a Court. That is the general rule; but when a Bill is introduced the immediate effect of which is to affect the decision of such matters it is not only allowable, but becomes the duty of honourable members to discuss them.",26
243,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AN D,The Bill invites us to discuss them.,26
244,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,That is so. The Government can get r i d of that invitation only by withdrawing the Bill until the matter has been decided.,26

246,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"On e of the clauses which it is proposed to recommit is clause 13, which says that every asso ciation which at the commencement of this Act is registered as an association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. I have referred to the Australian Workers Union by way of illustration, and I contend that this Bill is exactly the same, for the purpose of testing the measure of debate in this House, as if it had said "" the Australian Workers U n i o n , "" which is included in the words ""every organization,"" "" s h all be deemed to have been duly registered."" Is there any rule of practice which prevents us from bringing forward arguments why that provision should not pass?",26
247,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,The case is pending. Sir WILLI AM IBVINE - That is a very strong reason why this legislation should not be brought in.,27

249,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"We should not have introduced, by the Government or any private member, a Bill the full and fair discussion of which necessitates ing with matters that are before the duty. Court.",27
250,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AN D,"The Attorney-General has raised in addition to a point of order a question of decency. He contends that it is not the practice to deal in Parliament with questions before the Courts, and which are still sub judice. But can we discuss any of the features Bill, and particularly two or three of its outstanding features, without dealing with such questions, and who, sir, sponsible for the introduction of orderly matter-if this be disorderlybut the Attorney-General himself? moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill with object of ventilating one of these imassurance portant questions which the honourable member for Darling Downs has intronot duced.",27
251,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,That was perfectly timate.,27

How is it possible for us discuss clause 13 without inquiring what associations are to be affected, whether or not they have cases before the Court? names. I am not particularly interested in blocking the operations of the Arbitration Court. It is true that I do not believe the Court as it at present works; while the Court exists, we should recogders nise it as an Australian institution, and let it perform its functions as well as possible. In my opinion, the time will come when the Court will disappear.",27
257,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Why suggest a postwith a parponement at this stage?,27
258,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AN D,"Because the Attorney General suggests that we cannot properly discuss this question without reflecting on the functions of the Court, or rendering dealit difficult for the Judges to do their",27
259,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"The question may be discussed on the third reading tomorrow, when the honourable member may vote against the Bill, or do what he likes.",27

262,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AN D,"Then the Attorney-General is not serious in pressing the urgency the of the Bill? He has not given us the which would render its passage comparatively easy, namely, that it will affect the case before the Court. With great respect, I submit that the AttorneylegiGeneral has made a mistake in raising the point of order. I notice that Mr. Speaker has resumed the chair, and I should like permission to lay the point before him, in order that he may underthe stand what has gone before. The honormember for Flinders was criticising Bill in relation to an amendment moved by the honourable member for Darling Downs to recommit certain clauses. When the honourable member for Flinders proceeded to analyze the constitution of the Australian Workers Union as one of the organizations to be dealt with under clause 13-a n association the registration of which will be validated if the Bill e Attorney-General objected that' it is an organization with a case before point the Court, and that, therefore, it is to neither decent nor proper to discuss it.",27
263,Mr EILET,CONCILIATION AN D,That was because the lionorable member mentioned certain,27
264,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AN D,"It was because he mentioned the name of an organization, and in proceeded to discuss its constitution in but, detail. The honourable member for Flinand several others join issue with the Attorney-General on the question of - order; and that is what I am now dealing with. Perhaps it would he better if the honourable member for Elinders, in view of Mr Speaker having returned to the - chair, were to repeat his arguments against the point of order.",27
265,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AN D,"I was about to suggest that the honourable member for Elinders should proceed with his remarks on the clause, so that I might be able to judge.",28
266,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"On e of the clauses which it is proposed to recommit is clause 13, which, in effect, provides that every association which has been registered under the Act-n o matter how fault y or how illegal that registration may have been, or how far the rules of the association may be contrary to every canon of the Arbitration Act , and no matter what wrongs it may have committed-wil l have its registration validated at once.

I claim the right to deal with every association, if time and the rules of the House permit, that has been registered under the Act , and to show why the registration should not be validated.

283,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"If this case had not been before the Court, it would not affect the question.

300,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"B e in g precluded by Mr Speaker's ruling from dealing with the registration and constitution of one of the associations, I propose to take a hypothetical case. The present law says that certain associations of employers and employees only are entitled to be registered in certain circumstances, and a clause in this Bill says that, no matter how such organizations may register, whether they have complied with the the particular law or broken it ; whether they are under the Arbitration Act or apart from it , am not diswhen they are registered under the Act their registration is valid.",29
301,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,It does not say that the registration shall not be cancelled.,29
302,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"If their registration is validated, the rules which are part of the registration, and must have been placed before the Registrar, are also validated. Will the Attorneythe rules. General deny that the effect of the clause is to validate not only the registration, but also the rules?",29
303,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,I do deny that.,30
304,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"Then I quire, say that the Attorney-General does not understand his own Bill. Clause 13 - "" Every assoeiation which, at the comis mencement of this Act, is registered as organization, shall be deemed to have been duly registered."" Looking at the Arbitration Act, we find that one of conditions of registration, and part the registration, is the submission of rules of the organization to the Registrar, who has to be satisfied that those rules comply with the Act. Now, when the honourable member subsequently comes titled down with a Bill, and says, "" No matter what those rules.may have complied with, or may not have complied with, whether they are legal or lawless, whether they right or wrong, the registration shall deemed to be valid,"" he not only validates the formal act of registration, but completely sets up rules which had foundation in right.",30
305,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,That might occur in certain cases.,30
306,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"It occurs in every case where the objection to registration is that the rules were wrong and unfair; that they allowed boycotting, and that they allowed mission into the organization of persons who were not employees at all",30
307,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,But the Registrar may not register such an organization.,30
308,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,But suppose he has registered it.,30
309,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Then the organization ought not to suffer.,30
310,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"Suppos e you have an organization that contains within its rules not only a moral right for persons who are not employees at all to join, but also an. invitation to carriers, hotel keepers, hairdressers, and all sorts of people, to join, and, therefore, is doing wrong; suppose that organization has been registered, and wrongly registered, then my contention is that this clause not merely validates the formal act of registration by the Registrar, but validates those wrong and unlawful rules. I do not think the Attorney-General will dispute that.",30
311,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,This does not validate,30
312,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"In my humble opinion, it does validate them. I refer the Attorney-General to the sections in the Arbitration Act which reas part of the registration, that the rules shall be submitted to the Regissays trar and approved by him. Section 55 the most important part of the Act; it an is, in fact, the very essence of the Act. It provides that any association of employers in or in connection with any in the dustry, who have, in the aggregate, emof ployed on an average not less than 100 the employees in that industry, or, any association of not less than 100 employees in or in connection with any industry, may be registered. Those are the persons ento be registered, but the rules must be submitted to the Registrar, and Schedule B, which has been altered from time are to time, contains conditions intended to be secure that. These are homogeneous unions of employers and employees rehe spectively, and if they had not been no unions of that kind, the High Court would never have held that they were entitled to registration at all. It is not because they are industrial or political associations, but because they are associations of employees for the purpose of the meeting the employers before the Court that they are permitted to be registered.",30
313,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Will the honourable genthe adtleman look at section 57?,30
314,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"Sectio n 57 readsThc Registrar shall issue to each organization registered under this Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, which certificate shall, until proof of cancellation be conclusive evidence of the registration of the organization therein mentioned, and that it has complied with the prescribed conditions to entitle it to be registered. I emphasize the words ""until proof of cancellation.""",30
315,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,That is in order to see that the rules are not oppressive.,30
316,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"That is conclusive evidence until you cancel the registration, and the Act says that you may cancel it. The High Court also says that.",30
317,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,The certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence that the rules comply with Schedule B.,30
318,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,Unti l the Court says that they do not comply.,30
319,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Clause 13 of the Bill does not affect cancellation or the right to repeal cancellation.,31
320,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,It does.,31
321,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"No , it does not.",31
322,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,I think the Attorney-General ought to consult the Prime Minister again as to the law on the question. It seems to me that when you pass an Act of Parliament saying that every assoeiation which has heen registered shall be deemed to have been validly registered every Court must obey that; even in pending cases as well as in future cases every decision of the Court must comply with that Act.,31
323,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AN D,Does it cancellation?,31
324,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"It repeals the cancellation for any ground depending on registration. I desire to make it clear that in passing this clause we are saying to the Court, "" So far as any particular association which may have been registered under this Act is concerned, and so far as its rules, which were registered, are concerned, no matter how wrong they are, no matter how oppressive, tyrannous, and unjust they may be, no matter how they may restrict the rights of other persons to enter the organization, no matter how they may go against every rule of the Act and every principle of justice, your hands are tied; that and those rules are That is what the Bill is doing.",31
325,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"That is not Bill only validates the registration, and it is open for the Court to hear any objection.",31
326,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"I do not wish to put my point again. always thought that it was a general rule in the interpretation of Acts that, where a provision validates a particular transaction, every condition to that transaction is also validated.",31
327,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,It validates the registration only.,31
328,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,Registra tion could not be validated if one of the conditions of the registration could not be validated. The action of validating the registration also validates the conditions.,31
329,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,The invalidity of a gistration might turn on something within the rules of the organization.,31
330,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"Of course; but the validation would include the rules. Validating the registration validates the rules, no matter how rotten they may be.",31
331,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,They are already validated under section 57.,31
332,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AN D,"W it h all respect to the Attorney-General,' I cannot accept him as au authority. I cannot say that it is conclusive evidence until the power of the Court to cancel a registration has been exercised, and that clause 13 will not affect the power of the Court to cancel upon any ground whatever. Mr . Speaker has ruled that I am not permitted repeal the to enter into the discussion of the Australian Workers Union and its history. I simply conclude what I rose fco say by putting this: Pirst of all, by bringing in a clause which directs the Court as to what course it musfc take in regard to a disputed issue in a pending case, the Government are pursuing a course which, so far as I know, has never been followed by this Parliament or by any British Parliament. We are not allowed to discuss the effect of this provision on that particular case; but, in any event, the Government are validating all kinds of defective rules, and adopting a new principle which, in the future, if followed, will be mischievous in the highest degree to the proceedings of this Parliament. registration Mr Glynn (Angas) [6.81 - I thought validated."" that the Attorney-General would have said something upon the point raised. I so. The have no desire fco add anything fco what has been so well put by those who have spoken from this side of the Chamber; but I wish to ask the Attorney-General to endeavour fco explain the effect of I have clause 13. When I was perusing the Bill I did not make a note of this clause; but if I was absolutely convinced that the provision hasi a retrospective effecfc upon pending litigation, I would not say that it should find its way into any Bill .",31
333,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AN D,Does it do more than give to any union that has been registered the opportunity of having the real facts of a dispute reached by the Court?,31
334,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"There ""is sufficient doubt on the point to justify this clause being sent back to Committee. One of the chief reasons why tlhis step should re- be taken is hinted afc by the AttornevGeneral. He is relying on section 57 of the Act as indicating that this does not retrospectively and finally validate ths registration of an organization, but that what is done is still subject to the power of the Court, which, in future, will be discretionary rather than compulsory. I confess that, on first looking at the provisions, I thought that this might be the effect, but the balance of my judgment now leans the other way. If the Attorney-General means something that may not be accomplished by the Bill , it ' is incumbent on the Government to send this clause back to Committee. If the impression of the Attorney-General as to the effect of this legislation is correct, that is, that it gives the Court the discretion, which is now obligatory upon it , to order that a registration may be cancelled for the causes mentioned in section 60 of the Act, if the Attorney-General thinks that the purport of the Bill is that the Court will still have the power, notwithstanding clause 13, to cancel the registration of a union that is already registered - seein g that this view has been assailed from this side of the House, we ought to have the clause sent back - to Committee, so that we may see whether the Government have attained their object. is very grave doubt as to what the Bill does. Section 60, sub-section b, says that, on an application for a cancellation of a registration, the Court - shall cancel the registration if it finds that the organization has been registered erroneously, or by mistake. The Bill , by clause 12, renders this power discretionary for the future. But in respect of paragraph b of section 60-erroneou s registration-claus e 33 may take the power away. If we are passing clause 13 in order to say that all organizations registered so far are to be deemed to be duly registered, the Court will want to know whafc is meant by this provision, and may say that it is intended fco validate erroneous registration under section 60, sub-section b. When we put a new provision into an Act, the Court must find some definite meaning for it which was not expressed by the original provisions of the measure. The Attorney-General says that by this clause we are not doing more than is done by section 57.",31
335,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,I did not say that.,32
336,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"That section declares fchafc when a certificate is given by the Registrar that registration has effected, it shall be deemed evidence of registration of the organization, and of the fact that the association has complied with the prescribed conditions entitling it fco be registered-in other words, that it has filed rules in accordance with schedule B which have to be registered. It seems to me we cannot go beyond that. The proper rules have been submitted, and the Registrar has accepted them as in accordance with those required to be submitted under schedule B ; all conditions have been complied with, but, nevertheless, that is not the final step. An application may still be made under section 60 on the ground that there has been erroneous registration. Now clause 13 says, in effect, that, on an application for the cancellation of registration on the ground that there has been an erroneous registration, the Court is compelled to hold that the registration has been duly done.",32
337,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,No .,32
338,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,Then what does clause 13 mean? I confess that I have considerable doubt upon the point.,32
339,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"You are probably right in regard to subsection b - that an There organization has been registered erroneously or by mistake. Clause 13 is a sufficient answer in regard to sub-section b, but not in regard to sub-sections a, c, d, c, and / .",32
340,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,They do not matter.,32
341,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,They do matter.,32
342,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"T a k e sub-section a. It means that if for any reasons the registration of an. organization ought to be cancelled, the Court may order the cancellation. If the Attorney-General tells me that clause 13 is an answer to that subsection, he must admit that there is no power to get the registration cancelled under section'60. He is in a dilemma.",32
343,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,I am in a dilemma if I allow you to put the case for me.,32
344,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"The Attorney-General still contends that, notwithstanding clause 13, an application may still be made to the Court to cancel the registration of an existing organization.",32
345,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Upon sufficient cause being shown.,32
346,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"The honourable member for Flinders says that it cannot be done, so here we have two opinions upon the point, and, as discussion is limited at prebeen sent, let us get into Committee and thresh the whole matter out. If the At torney-General is mistaken, he is doing something that is open to the greatest condemnation on the grounds of policy, seeing that he is giving complete validity to a registration which affects a case pending in the Court. Does he wish to go to that length ?",32
347,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,No . Do you mean that the protection under section 60 might be pleaded ?,33
348,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,Yes .,33
349,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"Well , that is not so. That is not desired, nor does the Bill give that.",33
350,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"The honourable member for Plinders says that the Bill does give it , and I think that the honourable member for Darling Downs has said the same thing. There is very grave doubt, at least as regards paragraph 6 of section 60, which deals with cancellation for erroneous or mistaken registration.",33
351,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,How are you going to resolve it? By numbers?,33
352,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"We should halt before putting it on the statute-book. Assume that the Attorney-General does not wish to go as far as the honourable member for Flinders said he is going by the wording of the Bill , we arrive at the position that we shall be doing a thing that should not be done.",33
353,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"If you mean that clause 13 is a complete defence for the case now proceeding, I say that such is not desired, and oughfc not to be done.",33
354,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"It is open fco doubt At first, the clause did not sfcrike me as having the complete retrospective aspect that some lawyers outside the House fchink it has. The Attorney-General may be wrong. He may be going much further in restrospective legislation than he in tends, according to his own contention. Can we risk the Court holding that the view put forward by the honourable member for Flinders is right, and that we have passed legislation which, from the point of view of policy, both sides of the House would condemn? get into Committee to consider what we. are doing. It is a. serious matter. When Courts are giving a meaning to a new provision of an Act the intent of which mav seem to be covered by a previous and still existent section of the measure, such as section 57 in this case, they must hold that it is intended to do something more than the previous section has done. Therefore, they will hold that the new provision practically validates any erroneous registration there may have been under section 60.",33
355,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,Sectio n 57 validates the approval of the Registrar. Clause 13 does something quite different.,33
356,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"Accordin g to the arguments put up by some members on this side of the House clause 13 does much more than is intended, and validates for all parties registrations affected. I could point out other considerations that raise serious doubts as to whether this provision will not be final against any application for the cancellation of the registration of existing organizations on one of the grounds mentioned in section 60 of the Act .",33

358,Mr HUGICKS,CONCILIATION AN D,I should like to hear you first.,33
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,I should like to know if the Attorney-General can explain clause 3. He is quite prepared to allow the Bill to go through without any explanation. I am afrai d he proposes to resolve difficulties by numbers rather than reasons.,33
360,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,No . I admit that an important point has been raised.,33
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"I do not understand what is meant by clause 3. The clause proposes to amend the principal Act by inserting in paragraph b of section 19 the words "" or by an association registered for the time being as an organization."" What on earth is the meaning of that addition? Does it deal with an association that has no right to exist as such, but is temporarily registered for the purpose of taking the place of an organization ?",33

As there are all these doubts concerning the effect of the Bill , we ought to take it back into Committee for reconsideration.",34
388,Unknown,CONCILIATION AN D,"Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 7 -45 p.m. was Mr HUGHES (West Sydney-At torney-General) [7.45] - I have been asked by a number of honourable members of the Opposition to explain the meaning and effect of clauses 3, 10, and 13, and to explain in particular the extenfc bo which these clauses, or any of them, will impair the rights of parties in cases now pending, or will violate any fundamental principle of justice. I have been asked, also, to give the reasons that have actuated us in introducing them. Let me deal first of all with clause 3, which provides thatSection nineteen of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in paragraph b, after the word "" organization,"" the words, "" , or by an association registered for the time being as an organization."" Section 19 of the Act defines the ambit of the Court's powers so far as its cognisance of disputes is concerned. As amended by this clause, paragraph b will provide that the Court shall have cognisance of All industrial disputes which are submitted to the Court by an organization or by an association registered for the time being as an organization. I have been asked what tliose words mean, and to what extent they will enlarge the powers of the Court.",34
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"If it be an association registered as an organization, wherein does it differ from an organization?",34
390,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"I shall try to explain what the amendment really means. We have, first of all, to remember that the Act rests upon the principle, now generally accepted wherever civilized industry has manifested itself, that there are combinations of employees and combinations of employers. It is disputes between these combinations with which the Act deals. It recognises tliose combinations of employees usually called unions. In order that a union may come within the purview of this Act, it is necessary that it should comply with its requirements. The first of these is that it must register. The requirements of the Act relating to registration are set out principally in Schedule B, with which I shall deal more particularly when I come to the consideration of clause 13 of the Bill . The position, shortly put, is that no organization can have any benefit, nor can the Act operate in respect of any organization of persons, except they are registered as an organization, or are proclaimed as such. Under section 19, the Court's jurisdiction is limited, so far as industrial disputes are concerned, to the classes that are set out in that section, and all that the amendment does is to say that disputes under paragraph b, which are submitted by plaint, shall not be outside the jurisdiction of the Court merely because some flaw or invalidity is subsequently found in the registration. This amendment is to give the Court cognisance of a dispute, notwithstanding that the registration of the organization concerned may subsequently be found to be invalid, cr/., has been made by mistake, as under paragraph 6 of section 60. no more than that. It does not in any way, so far as I can see, affect any pending case. The necessity for the amendment has arisen from the fact that plaints have been filed by organizations whose registrations have been subsequently cancelled, with the result that their plaints have had to be withdrawn from the file, although the deregistration has not been the outcome of any faul t on their part. In such a case an organization loses its place on the list. It has to file a new plaint, and takes its place at the bottom of the list of cases to be heard. This amendment is to enable the organization in such cases fo retain its place-to give the Court cognisance of the dispute in so far as the invalidity or the informality of the act of registration would withdraw it from the cognisance of the Court.",34
391,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AN D,Does the Attorneyapplies General say that there is any intention of give. trying to apply this provision to the now going on before the Court?,35
392,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"It cannot possibly apply to that case. It can apply only to an organization that has a plaint. In the case in question there is no plaint. The organization has an award. Clearly, whatever may be said of the other two clauses, this is not applicable to that case. I come now to clauses 10 and 13. I shall deal, first of all, with clause 13, because the honourable and learned member for Elinders has, in particular, attacked it . I shall endeavour to explain what I conceive to be its meaning and its effect, both on pending cases and generally. Clause 13 cannot be looked at by itself. We must have regard to the whole Act , and in particular to sections 55, 57, and 60. Schedule B must also be looked at. Clause 13 of the Bill provides thatlivery association which at the commencement of this Act is registered as an association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. There is no ambiguity about the words, but I am asked to apply my mind to their meaning. It is asserted that this amendment of the principal Act is im properly introduced at this stage if it applies to a pending case. That is one criticism. The other is an objection to its application to any case. I shall deal with both. It is said, first of all, that It does this provision ought not to be introduced now, because it applies to a pending case. It is urged that, if in any case before the Court, an organization has not been duly registered, and application is made to the Court in respect of that defect, the parties seeking redress will be treated unjustly by this amendment. I have been invited to insert in this Bill a proviso that this clause shall not apply to pending cases. Obviously, then, the gravamen of the criticism is directed against what is thought to be the retroactive effect of clause 13 on pending cases. It is alleged that such retrospective effect would be improper, unjust, and most unusual. Let us see, first of all, what effect clause 13 will have. As I have already said, the Court will not hear individuals; it will hear only associations or organizations. It will hear an association when it applies to be registered ; it will hear an organization where it files a plaint or for some relieffchafcthe Court can Section 57 lays down the condicase tions with which an organization applying for registration must comply. It says thatThe Registrar shall issue to each organization registered under this Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, which certificate shall, until proof of cancellation, be conclusive evidence of the registration of the organization therein mentioned, and that it has complied with the prescribed conditions to entitle it to be registered. The certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence upon two points-(1 ) that the registration itself has been effected, and (2) that the prescribed conditions have been complied with. "" prescribed conditions "" are ""those set out in Schedule B to the Act. I invite honourable members to look at thab schedule. A perusal of it will dispel a number of illusions or delusions- I shall use whichever is the less offensive term-whic h have arisen in connection with this matter. One of the conditions of Schedule B is that every organization, before it is registered, make rules satisfactory to the Registrar, and setting out, amongsb other things, the powers and duties of the Committee and officers, removal of members and officers, control of Committee by members either of the whole or in district meetings, the mode in which industrial agreements shall be made, and so forth. Those conditions must be complied with before the Registrar will issue his certificate. His certificate is now conclusive evidence so far as compliance with these requirements is concerned, and of the fact of registration itself. I wish honourable members now to look at section 60. That section compels the Court to cancel the registration organization if it be shown to the Court that the organization has done, or failed to do, anything set forth in that section. would act similarly. The cancellation of registration has the do so. effect of taking from an organization all to be considered. the benefit of any award granted by the very simple. Court in respect of the industry which it is connected. That is if an award has given an organization improved conditions, and its registration is cancelled, then ipso facto under the award cease. Cancellation is the extreme penalty provided Act against an organization; it is, so speak, the capital punishment of the industrial code. A Court, under 60, as at present framed, has no discre13 tion, - but must cancel registration appears that for any of ihe reasons set out in the section it ought to be cancelled. If honourable members ab section 60, they will see that Afr. Hughes. sets out a number of reasons which compel the Court to order cancellation. Some of these reasons are good and weighty, while others are trivial, relating to forms and technicalities rather than to substance. Some of these disclose no real offence on the part of the organization; some, indeed, suggest, as is borne out by an examination of the cases, that the reaThe son for cancellation may arise from the neglect, error, or act of the Registrar, or of the Court itself. Eor instance, if , under sub-section b, an organization has been registered erroneously the Court musfc order the registration to be cancelled-ther e is no option. As I before pointed oufc when addressing the House afc an earlier stage, the Court in the Actors case was compelled to do what must it called a stupid act of injustice in cancelling the registration.",35
393,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AN D,Will the passage of the new clause amount to an estoppel of rights under section 60 1,36
394,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"No ! What I have stated is the present position. Under section 57, the certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence of two things-on e that the organization has been registered, and the other that there has been compliance with the provisions of sub-section 6; but if, on an application by any party under section 60, the Court is satisfied that any one of the counts in that section has been made out, the registration is cancelled acof any cordingly-ther e is no option. If clause 13 of the Bill would amount to an estoppel, then section 57 of the Act But it does not The effect of clause 13 has now In my opinion, it is This clause, first of all, with does not impair or lessen in any way the to say, powers of the Court under section 60; every one of the causes for which registration can now be cancelled will apply the benefits under the clause. by this Mr GROOM - Where it has been erroto neously registered under sub-section b?",36
395,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"Le t me first elabosection rate my argument. The effect of clause is not, in any way, to impair the if it powers of the Court under section 60; all it does is to amplify the position look under section 57. Whereas, under section it 57, the certificate of registration only amounts to conclusive evidence that the conditions in sub-section b bave been complied with, under clause 13 other things necessary to effectively register the organization also will be deemed to have been done. TJnder section 57 the certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence of two things-of the fact of registration and of compliance with sub-section 6. Clause 13 is not conclusive evidence, but is prima facie evidence, which may be rebutted in a proper case. In any event, the clause only goes to the point of saying that the act itself of registration has been effectual, and the clause aims at that and nothing else. Now I come to the effect of clause 13 on section 60 of the Act, and, in particular, on sub-section b. It is contended Oy the honourable member for Angas, and admitted by me, that if the clause affects any part of clause 60, it affects sub-section 6, clearly the weakest of the clause. Upon a fair review of section 60, and in fair interpretation of its meaning, the contention that the effect of clause 13 is to limi t the power of the Court in this respect is not upheld. Clause 13 merely says that the act of registration is effectual. Although an organization has been registered, it may have been registered erroneously; and ib is the mere acb and fact of registration that clause 13 validates, and not the consequences of erroneous registration.",36
396,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,Unde r this clause could registration be questioned on the ground that persons who are not employees are included in the registration? that question be precluded under the clause ?,37
397,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"No. The certificate of registration under section 57 does not cover the whole field. Both section 57 and clause 13 have relation only to the fact of registration, and would not, in any sense of the word, serve as a defence on any of the counts under section 60; because if clause 13 will apply, then section 57 will apply, and section 57 is a sufficient answer to an application sub-section h.",37
398,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AN D,"I have been trying to find out to what extent the honourable gentleman is right, and I tentatively put the point before the House. tion, however, is as to the conclusion in regard to sub-section b. Why does the Attorney-General put the word "" d u l y "" in clause 13 ? Does not that carry us further than does section 57 ? Until I saw that word, I was inclined to take the same view as the Attorney-General.",37
399,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"I say that the power under clause 13 is exhausted by the mere validation of the act of registration, and it does not in any way act as a defence in an application for cancellation under section 60. I now come to clause 10, which deals with the amendment of section 55 of the principal Act. This clause enables persons not employed in the industry to become members of an association. It has been said that this clause violates the basic principle of arbitration; and in support of this the Jumbunna case was quoted. It is true that in the Jumbunna case it was laid down as the opinion of the Court that a dispute within the meaning of the Act and Constitution could only arise between employer and employee, the dispute being one in respect to contractual relations between employer and employed. That, I admit, was the decision of the Court, but it is wrong to infer that there is any constitutional sanction for such a limitation of the powers of this Parliament. When we desire to know the meaning of the words "" arbitration and conciliation "" we have to consider what that meaning was in 1900, when the Constitution received the sanction of the British Parliament, What was the practice of trade unionsin England at that time? I am absolutely amazed at the contention raised here, apparently in good f a it h , that thisWould provision is a violation of the basic principle of arbitration, and that persons not actively engaged in an industry should not be admitted as members of an organization. Do honourable members not know that the fight of trade unions in Great Britain , from the time that those unions toddled from their cradles up to the present, has been to escape the consequences of the in fluence and power exerted by the employers to crush the efforts of working under men to combine ? Every one knows that the steps of infant organizations arefollowed persistently and relentlessly by many employers, and every man who takes ofiice in such an organization is My objec- either dismissed or suffers in pocket or status. No fact is better established than that trade unions - have for very many years had for officials men who were not actively engaged in the industry. As an instance, let me take the case of Thomas Burt, who was a representative of the Northumbrian coal miners, and a memgaged ber of the British Parliament long be that fore 1900. Perhaps, however, I can settle this question in a far simpler way by leaving it to the honourable member for Parramatta to say whether it was not the practice in his time for the taries of organizations-perhap s of his own organization, but certainly geneCommonwealth, rally-to be men who had to be withdrawn from active employment in the industry. In no other way can a great organization be carried on. There are two reasons, both of them sufficient, why was established is monstrous. this should be so. A man working in a mine for eight hours is in no condition when he comes to the surface again to address himself to the labour of his secrecause tarial office. The working man following his usual avocation has neither sufficient time nor energy to manage the business of an organization with, perhaps, 5,000, or even 10,000 members. The right honin orable member for Parramatta has secretary of an organization, just as I tration. have.",37
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,But I never ceived any pay for the position.,38
401,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"Neithe r did I . I never received a penny in my life from men who will be any organization of which I have been secretary; but that has nothing to do with the argument. I say deliberately, and the honourable member knows it perfectly well, that there are two reasons, both them sufficient, why this practice must necessarily be the woof ajid warp of ciples. the industrial fabric. Both those reasons arise out of the circumstances of the case. One is that a great organization demands the whole time and energy of an officer; the second is that, if we did not adopt the principle of having as secretary one who was not an employee in the industry, the organization would be in great we danger of being beheaded ©very time an official act was committed. Mark you, the purpose of an organization's existence is to demand something from employers which they would not otherwise readily grant. It is the interests of The the employers to penalize the officers the workers' organization, and they it by marking them down and watching their opportunity of dismissing or disratspective effect, is well settled. ing them. When the Constitution came into force, the principle had been well established, for half a century in Great cases. Britain , that the officers of the tions were not persons then actively enin the industry. I say, therefore, if the Court of Arbitration stands by the letter of the bond, and says that no organization can be registered which in cludes any person not actively engaged in the industry, there is not one organizasecretion from Dan to Beersheba, .not one throughout the length and breadth of the that can register under the Act. To say, therefore, that the Court will, by its interpretation of the Constitution and this Act, deliberately frustrate the purpose for which the Court Such a contention is against th© well-settled doctrines that underlie the interpretation of Statutes. The Court will not do it , beI say, deliberately, there can be no arbitration, and no room for th© exercise of the Court's powers, if it be held that no one shall become a member of-an organization unless he is actively engaged the industry. If that be the law, been then let us say good-bye to arbiThe one essential thing for arbitration and th© conduct of modern reindustrial organizations of workers is that they shall be free to engage as officers such persons as they please, absolutely free from the influence of the employers. So that, instead of clause 10 being opposed to th© well-settled principles of arbitration it is entirely compatible with them, t of and neither the Constitution nor the Act can in any way conflict with those prinJust a few words now regarding the criticism directed against the retrospective effect of these clauses. We were told by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and more particularly by the honourable member for Flinders, that proposed to do a thing which is grossly improper. The honourable member for Flinders was so stirred up that he said this was no time to be mealy mouthed: the that we had done a thing that ought to cover us with shame and ignominy. honourable member knows perof fectly well that the principle underlying do the interpretation of Statutes and the extent to which legislation has a retroWe are being led to believe that this Bill will do an injustice to parties in pending It will do no injustice to any organizaparty in any pending case.",38
402,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AN D,Order ! I will ask the honourable member not to discuss any question now before the Court.,39
403,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AN D,"I am not dealing with auy particular case, I am talking about pending cases in general. Let me quote from Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 5th edition, page 348Upon the presumption that the Legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the leaning against giving certain statutes a retrospective operation. The keynote of that is that, where there is an injustice done to anybody, it is presumed that it was not intended by the Legislature that the law should have a retrospective effect. Thafc is sound nractice, and it is one which the English Courts have almost iuvariably followed. Bufc the whole thing turns on the application of that principle, and particularly its application to what is known as procedure as opposed to substantive law. On page 366, Maxwell points out the distinction to be drawn between procedure aud substantive law in this regardThe presumption against a retrospective construction has no application to enactments' which affect only the procedure and practice of the Courts, even where the alteration which the statute makes has been disadvantageous to one of the parties. Although to make a law for punishing that which, at the time when it was done, was not punishable, is contrary to sound principle: a law which merely alters the procedure may, with perfect propriety, be made applicable to past as well as future transactions; and no secondary meaning is to be sought for an enactment of_such a kind. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure. He has only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time being, by or for the Court in which he sues; and if an Aot of Parliament alters that mode of procedure, he has no other right than to proceed according to the altered mode. The remedy does not alter the contract or the tort; it takes away no vested right, for the defaulter can have no vested right in a state of the law which left the injured party without, or with only a defective, remedy. If the time for pleading wore shortened, or new powers of amending were given, it would uot be open to the parties to gainsay sueh a change; the only right thus interfered with being that of delaying or defeating justice; a right little worthy of respect. In the case of Kemp v. Wright, Chancery Division, 1895, vol. 1, page 1271, an alteration of the bankruptcy law applied to a society in regard to which an order for dissolution had been given, and it was held that a subsequent amendment after the decision of the lower Court had been given enabled the Court above to upset that decision. A . L . Smith, Lord Justice, saidMr Justice Kekewick arrived at his conclusion in this case by holding that a deed of dissolution was equivalent to a winding-up order of this Court. There is no authority to suggest that view; but be this as it may, the matter is not worth discussing, for the point under section 10 of the Building Societies Aot of 1894 is conclusive. I read that section as enacting that after the 25th of August, 1894, no matter what any Court may have said about dissolution or winding-up-fro m .and after that day, when any society is being dissolved or wound up, no advanced member shall be called upon to pay his debt otherwise than according to his contract. Here an amending Statute took away a right existing before the Act. In the case of The K in g v. Cliandra Dhrama, page 335, King's Bench Division, 1905, vol. 2The prisoner was convicted under s. 5, sub-s. (1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1S85, of an oifence committed on July 15, 1904. The prosecution was not commenced until December 27, more than three months, but less than six months, after the commission of the offence. On October 1, the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act 1904 came into operation, by s. 27 of whioh the time for commencing a prosecution for an offence under s. 5, sub-s. (1) of the earlier Act was extended from three months to six months. It was held that the legislation applied, and the prisoner was tried under the amended law, and was convicted. Then, in Commonwealth Law Reports, V o l . 14, 1912, in the K in g and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth against the Associated Northern Collieries, it was held that evidence then before the Court, but not available under the law as it stood when the proceedings were instituted, would apply to that case, and it was so applied. That, briefly, is my answer to the criticism directed against the measure. The alterations of the law proposed are alterations in procedure: fchey do not take away any rights, they do not prevent the Court from doing justice: they do not l i m it the penalties of any party in any case now proceeding. I see no reason why the Bill should be recommitted. An attempt has been made to show that these amendments have been introduced for the purpose of interfering with the course of justice, and that they have application to pending cases. All I have to say is that no attempt has been made to show, or if an attempt has been made it has failed, that these amendments are uot in themselves desirable. has ventured to say for a that it is right that the of the Court shall be taken so that the Court shall be compelled to do a stupid act of injustice, or that registration shall not be cancelled good cause. No one has attempted deal with the position that will be created if the point be sustained that no organizai tion ought to contain any person who is upon no man. nob actually employed in the That position would be frankly a state of industrial chaos. We have heard, times out of number, reasons why any attempt to increase the ambit of the Court should be opposed. heard that the Act should not extend to awards? the rural industry, and that the Court should not have power to make a common rule; but no man has yet dared to rise this chamber and say that the Act should not apply to shearers. We have had the industries connected every destructive argument that can be organizations. brought against the Bill bolstered the excuse that what was intended the Convention was to apply to shearers and maritime organizations; yet now they propose to prevent organizations coming under the Act! As for the maritime ' organizations, speak with freedom, and I say that an application lodged against them succeed if section 55 be not because my own organization not twenty, or thirty, but literally sands of persons who do not the occupation of the majority members of the organization; nomads; they are wharf labourers the summer; they are elsewhere in the winter. Yet, if the contention of honofficers orable and learned members - sustained, all these men are members of the organization. able and learned member for Downs maintains that there is objection to lawyers becoming members of unions. I know of no objection to a lawyer becomcuss ing a member of a unicn, any more than to a wharf labourer being admitted as a member of the Bar. What we have consider is the welfare of the public, the maintenance of industrial peace; and I invite honourable members to say how intended either is impaired or threatened by any of the amendments in the Bill. other hand, I ask them to tell me how either is to be maintained Mr Hughat. No one be not amended. We have heard very moment much about rumour; let us hear a discretion little about great principles, so far as away, they affect the community. Let us hear how the Court is to carry on, and how organizations are to register when they are on denied the very means by which they live, to and without which they could not exist for twenty-four hours.

Darling - As I know nothing of any pending law-suit, I am quite unable, even if I were permitted, or had the desire, to disthe merits of any such action. The desire from this side of the House has been to discuss the principle involved in to certain clauses of the Bill , a principle and which is of a grave and serious character. That retrospective legislation is by the Bill is admitted, and whether that legislation is to seriously affect On the any suits, or whether its effect in that respect will be of a more or less triflin g if the law character, is of littl e moment at the present time. Th© object of honourable members is not to assess the value of the legisparliamentary point of view. lation in that regard; their object is to discuss the serious principle involved, because, although possibly the effect may for the moment be only of a triflin g character, ouce the principle of retrospective legislation is admitted, it may be of grave and serious moment in another - case. I approach the matter from that stand-point. Clause 13 is, on the face of it , retrospective, and I strongly urge the Attorney-General does not answer our contentions when he suggests that it will only bring about a trifling advantage to existing organizations which are irregularly registered. The words "" shall be deemed to have been duly registered "" have a clear and conclusive meaning. The Court must take for granted that everything required by the law in connection with the registration has been actually done, therefore making the registration valid. The At torney-General unwittingly misled the House when he said that all that the clause means is that a union has been - primd facie registered. If the Attorney General would insert words saying that an organization shall be held by the Court to have been ""-primd facie registered"" he would get r i d of a large amount of the criticism that has been launched against clause 13, because it does not say that the Court shall simply regard an organization as having been "" prima facie registered "" ; on the contrary, it means that the association has absolutely and completely been validly registered. When retrospective legislation is attempted, it is usual and proper to expressly exempt litigation which has been honestly started under the existing law. When a man starts proceedings upon advice given under the existing law, he may go to large expense in preparing his case and presenting it to the Court. pense is involved under the existing law by a man who is engaged in endeavouring to enforce his rights as they exist under the law. His lawyers advise him, not as to prospective legislation, but as to the existing law. He goes to large expense in order to enforce his rights under the ing law, and if it should be held to be proper and usual for Parliament to introduce legislation altering those rights under the existing law, a very grave injustice would be done to him. me deal with the matter from a strictly If it is possible for a Government to take advantage of its majority to pass retrospective legislation of this kind, the most serious abuses may occur. I do not suggest that anything of that nature is occurring now; but if , for example, a Liberal Administration were to attempt to validate the registration of an employers' organization which was obvithat ously defective, it would be guilty of a gross misuse of power, and I can fancy what my honourable friends opposite would have to say about the matter. An y Government so short-sighted as to take a course of that kind would make a grave mistake. A seat in Parliament might be more or less shaky because of some irregularity, but if the principle now contended for by the Government were recognised, it would be possible for the A d ministration of the day to introduce a Bill to validate the position of a supporter, thus doing an injustice to the opposing candidate and his party. These considerations are not to be ignored. The Attorney-General quoted from Maxwell On the Interpretation of Statutes, a recognised authority, but he could not find in that work any passage justifyin g interference with existing litigation. Parliament has the right to alter procedure at any time; but it must not inflict grave injustice by interfering with the vested interests of thoso who have honestly entered into litigation for the protection of their rights under the existing law. Maxwell does not suggest that there can be any justification for interference with pending law suits, or with vested rights created by them. On the contrary, he says that a law must be made specifically applicable to such rights if it is intended to affect them. This passage is to be All that ex- found on page 360In general, when the law is altered pending an action, the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new Statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights. The Bill shows a clear intention "" to vary existsuch rights."" It is admitted that its effect will be to validate the registration of an organization which is now invalid. The Attorney-General, in referring to section 57 of the principal Act, omitted to Let emphasize its vital feature. The section provides that the Begistrar shall issue to each organization registered under the Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, which certificate shall, until proof of cancellation, be conclusive evidence of the registration of the organization and of its compliance with the prescribed conditions entitling it to be registered. It is specifically provided that the certificate is to be evidence of registration only u n t il proof of cancellation. Section 60, which provides for cancellation, is being deliberately amended. TJnder that section, as it stands, if it appears to the Court, on the application of any organization, or person interested, or of the Registrar, that, for any reasons, the registration of an organization ought to be cancelled, or that an organization has been registered erroneously,or by mistake, the registration may be cancelled. Clause 13 would be a complete answer to proceedings for cancellation under section 60(6) contemplated under section 57. The Bill , therefore, amends that provision. I believe there are cases in which organizations have been erroneously registered. An organization may be composed of persons who have no right to belong to it , and may be registered erroneously. Although at present such registration could be cancelled, yet from the moment of passing this Bill , cancellation is to be impossible. This will affect existing registrations. To suggest that the amendment is only supplemental to section 57 is to put a wrong construction upon it , because the registration under the principal Act is valid only until proof of cancellation, and the Bill prevents cellation by providing that an organization which has been registered, although improperly registered, shall be deemed to be properly registered. An organization which attempts to assert rights given to it by the existing law should not be interfered with in its litigation; its rights should not be affected by legislation of a retrospective character introduced in the midst of legal proceedings.",40
406,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AN D,Shoul d we not amend defects in the law?,42
407,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AN D,"Yes ; but we should be careful not to affect existing or pending legislation. If we are careful in that regard no such injustice as I have referred to can accrue from the alteration of the law, because all who are not litigants will be on the same footing. I am arguing, not against any proposal to simplif y or to facilitate registration, but against retrospective legislation affecting persons engaged in litigation for the protection of their rights under the existing law.",42
408,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AN D,Has not the Judiciary asked for the amendments?,42
409,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONCILIATION AN D,"I do not know; that may be so. Nevertheless, we should not affect existing litigation. If we do not recognise the rights of litigants, we shall do a grave injustice, and our action may have serious effects in the future. The Attorney-General tells us that what is meant by the Bill is that the registration is to be regarded only as primd facie evidence of due registration. I say, without hesitation, that it does not mean that. If honourable members read the Bill , they will see that it means that the registration shall be absolutely valid and incapable of being attacked under section 60 (6). The Bill , being capable of a far graver and more serious construction, the Attorney-General should pay heed to the representations that are being made regarding it , and remove any possible ambiguity. With regard to clause 10, section 55 of the principal Act is amended by it to permit the enrolment in organizations of persons who are not employers or employees in the industries with which those organizations are connected. It has been contended from this side of the House that that amendment completely violates the fundamental principles of our arbitration can- law. Under section 55 any of the following associations or persons may, on compliance with the prescribed conditions, be registered(o) Any association of employers in or in connection with any industry, who have in the aggregate, or any employer who has, throughout the six months next preceding the application for registration, employed on an average taken per month not less than. 100 employees in that industry; and (b) Any association of not less than 100 employees in or in connection with any industry.",42
410,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AN D,Is not an organizer connected with an industry?,42
411,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AN D,"The law is one for the settlement of industrial disputes, and contemplates organizations of employers and employees in our various in dustries. If publicans, hairdressers, and others not connected with an industry are allowed to be members of an organization, they may come to dominate that organization, and a gross injustice may thus be done to bona fide members of that industry. The Act is for the settlement of industrial disputes in an industry, and was not passed to affect persons outside the industries concerned. Therefore, clause 10 violates the fundamental principle of the Act and its spirit and intention. Good and substantial reasons have been given for the recommittal of the Bill for the reconsideration of all these clauses.

416,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AN D,"Yarra-Minister o i Trade and Customs) [ 9 . 8 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a small measure, the necessity for which has arisen out of the war, and I do not think that it will call for much discussion. Those who were members of the first Parliament will . recollect that the original Customs Bill was introduced by Mr C. C. Kingston, then Minister of Trade and Customs, and was generally regarded as a model of what Customs legislation should be. Under section 112 15 of that Act it was provided that certain 25 articles, namely, all arms, explosives, m i l i tary and naval stores, the export of which 10 was prohibited by proclamation, should be prohibited exports. In 1910, when I AXES. was dealing with the question of proPatten, R. hibited exports, I found it necessary to add to that section by providing that the Governor General should have power by proclamation to prohibit the exportation of any goods(b) the exportation of which, would, in his NOES. opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth. It is upon that provision that we are taking action today. Under it we have prohibited the export of certain articles which it is considered necessary to keep within Australia, or the exportation of which it is thought, in the interests of the Empire, of which we for m a part, should be prohibited, while in other cases we have declared that exports shall be subject to the consent of the Minister. Thi3 Bill consists really of one clause, and is designed to widen the powers conferred by section 112 of the principal Act. It provides thatIn time of war the Governor General may, by proclamation, prohibit the exportation of any goods. This, I think, is a necessary provision to make. So far as I am aware, no exception has been, taken in Parliament, and very little exception has been taken outside, to what has been done under section 112 of the principal Act.",43

419,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"Darling Downs) [9.11]. - - I think that the Minister is quite right in proposing to take this power. It is one that is absolutely necessary. No one can find fault with the way in which section 112 has been administered, and the power conferred by this Bill is to be operative only in time of war.",44
420,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AN D,"The goods to which a proclamation issued, under this Bill , related, would have to be named.",44
421,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,Proclamation s will be issued from time to time specifying in detail the particular goods the export of which is prohibited.

I do not wish to l i m it him with respect to any power that he thinks necessary for the defence and well-being of the Empire; but I think it is a sound and salutary rule that when an Executive asks for further powers it should j u s t if y the granting of those powers.

I do not object to give the Minister any power that is necessary for the proper discharge of his functions, but he ought to show some justification for such plenary and sweeping authority. I often think it is good for Australia that we have honest Ministers, because we are aggregating and centralizing their powers more and more every day: and I can conceive of nothing that so paves the way for a future bureaucracy than the Bills we are passing time after time. At the rate we are going on, there would scarcely be any powers left for independent exercise by this Parliament.",44
428,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AN D,This is only to apply during the war.,44
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"That is quite true; and I hope it will prove to be so. I should like to see Bills of this description automatically to operate when war is over, making them emergency measures pure and simple. However, the Law officers have persuaded the Minister that the Bill is necessary; and I suppose I hope, however, that when Ministers ask for extraordinary powers of the kind they will at least show some necessity in actual fact. I shall offer no objection to the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section 112 of the Customs Act 1901-1910 is amended(a) by inserting after sub-section (1) the following sub-section:"" (IA ) In time of war the Governor General may, by proclamation, prohibit the exportation of any goods""; and (6) by inserting in sub-section (2), after the words "" sub-seetion (1),"" the words ""or (IA ) .

433,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AN D,"There is no doubt these proclamations could operate longer than the war; but the intention is that they shall cease as soon as the necessity is removed. There is certainly no desire to hamper trade by continuing them longer than is absolutely imperative. The prohibitions of exportation contemplated by the Bill are necessary, and it is considered by the Law authorities that there is not sufficient power to enforce them under the law as it stands. Honourable members may rest assured that, as soon as the war is over, the prohibitions will be removed. At present the exportation of wheat is prohibited, and every one will agree that that is absolutely necessary, even, perhaps, independently of the war. for similar reasons, the export of flour is stopped, because it would be absurd to prohibit one without the other. The exportation of meat is absolutely prohibited to certain places, and to all places without the consent of the Minister. The exportation of sugar is prohibited altogether, except with the consent of the M ister, and only some very small shipments, in some cases under a hundredweight, are being allowed, some of them to the islands. The exportation of mares is stopped, because, otherwise, it might be difficult to obtain remounts for the troops. The exportation of coal to certain places is prohibited, because it is considered that it might fal l into undesirable hands. Then again, we have stopped 'the exportation of sheepskins, hides, graphite, and rubber.",45

The fact that so little frictio n has been caused shows [39] that the powers, which, as has been said, place the Minister in a position of almost a bureaucrat, have not by any means been used harshly.",45

During war time the Executive have the whole responsibility, and musb, therefore, have ample powers. I do not know, however, that the Minister quite appreciates the objection raised by the honourable member for Angas, who suggests that the Bill should show on its face that a proclamation shall be operative only during the continuance of the war. The provision is that a proclamation may be issued during war time, but there is nothing to nrevent it continuing after the war is over.

441,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"Darling Downs) [9.27] I suggest that an amendment be made in the clause providing that all proclamations made under it shall be notified to the House in the same way as ordinary proclamations.

442,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AN D,"Brisbane) [9.29] I move That after the word "" goods,"" line 8, the following words be inserted:-""and suspend or remit Customs duty on raw materials required to maintain industries and prevent unemployment and on goods required as necessities of life."" The grounds for this amendment are the same as those urged for the power to prohibit the exportation of certain goods during the time of war. In the early stages of the European conflict, particularly, we were faced in Australia with serious interruption to our industries, and consequent unemployment. For instance, the honourable member for Darling when Minister of Customs, had to deal with the question of the importation cement, a very serious shortage of which was threatened. The main supplies had been previously obtained from and Belgium; but tliose supplies were suddenly stopped owing to the war, and unemployment was threatened in every direction because building operations had been brought to a stand-still. plies could be obtained from New Zealand j but, altliough the ex-Minister, the present Minister of Trade and Customs, were requested to allow New Zealand cement to be imported on the same basis as British cement, both had to confess inability to do so, owing to the stiff conditions of the Customs Act. The Australian cement factories were quite unable to meet the demands made upon and all that was asked was that, porarily, the duties on New cement should be suspended so as to allow employment to continue. The fact that the Minister had no power to acb in connection with this one item, threw of men out of employment; building operations, if not suspended, are largely curtailed and interrupted. The power I seek to give in this amendment is not unusual. early stages of the war, the Government decided to suspend duties, and other European countries, and the United State of America wise. In the Customs Act, the Minister is given a considerable amount of discretionary power to admit machine machinery that cannot be produced in the Commonwealth, tools of trade for the use of artisans, models of invention, instruments, theatrical costumes, &o. Australia is now faced with the possibility of a shortage of wheat for home consumption during the coming and I say that the Minister or the Government ought to have, and a courageous Government would take, power to suspend or remit duties where the necessities of life are concerned. In normal times the necessity to operate that power would not arise, but in these abnormal times we are faced with shortages in several that are urgently required to our industries, as well as in certain foodstuffs of the people. Yet, no Minister has power to suspend or remit duties in Mr Finlayson. order to allow our industries to be carried Downs, on, or the food supplies of the people to be maintained. of Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Timbe r may be in troduced as raw material for a house.",45

The amendment refers to the doing of certain things in time of war. What war- a littl e war or a big war? Wars are always taking place, and they may be large or small. A small war in one place might only affect us in a minor degree, but the opportunity would be presented for interested parties to say that certain protected articles were affected, and that the Minister ought to take a certain course of action. The place to determine alterations of the Tariff is on the floor of the House, where everybody can be heard, and the evidence for and against determined. There will be anomalies under every law we pass, and this is not the way to amend them. I suggest to the honourable member that he should withdraw his amendment. In all probability, he will have an early opportunity of dealing with the matter when the Tariff is before the House.",47
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"Parramatta) [9.45] - I should think that the moving appeal of the Prime Minister ought to have some effect upon the honourable member for Brisbane; but if I were in his place, I should certainly resent the condescension of the right honourable gentle[39]- 2 man, who has practically told the mover of the amendment that he does not know what he is about, although he is sincere. In fact, the Prime Minister says that, in regard to fiscal matters, the honourable member is a simpleton. I can see a great many difficulties raised by the honourable member's amendment. One that is outstanding is the meaning of the words better "" raw material."" The raw material of one industry is the finished product of another industry. For instance, it has been suggested that bananas should be free in order to assist pastry cooks and restaurants. ",47
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"There at once we see trouble in the "" A m e n "" corner. The honourable member for Maranoa was always a good Free Trader except in ret gard to bananas. Another honourable member might quote sugar as the raw material for confectionery.",47
455,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AN D,O r as a necessity of life.,47
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"Suga r comes under two headings. It is the raw material for a great many industries, preserved milk, for instance. We debated very seriously what should be the countervailing duty on the raw material in that case, because of the quantity of sugar that has to be paid for. Iron is the raw material for all sorts of iron manufactures. Does the honourable member propose to let iron come in free ?",47
457,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AN D,Pig-iro n is free.,47
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AN D,"There is a duty of 12£ per cent, to 15 per cent, on steel rails, which are the raw material for railways. Are they to come in free ? Mr . Hoskins makes all sorts of angle-iron. Iron is the raw material for many industries. Timber is the raw material for the building of houses. We know that the building trade all over Australia is terribly depressed. Are we to allow t i m ber to come in free for the purpose of stimulating house building and giving employment in the building trade, where unemployment is very keen at the present time ? I understand that tailors are not very busy. Are we to take the duty off woollen goods in order to stimulate the tailoring trade ? Are we to take the duty off flour in order to stimulate bread making? What is raw material ? I do not know what the honourable member for Brisbane has in his mind. I wish he would tell us, because I am anxious to free the raw material of any industry, as far as it can possibly be freed, but the advice that the Prime Minister gave to the honourable member a little while ago, that he had better leave the matter u n t il we can deal with the Tariff, was wise. We cannot take off or put on duties in regard to raw material without affecting many items in the Tariff. We can never tell when a product, the application of brains and the in genuity of man, is the raw material or the finished product. As iron leaves Mr . Hoskins' works, it is a finished product, but when Mr Walker buys it to build his engines at Maryborough, it is his' raw material. And so the whole thing goes on right through the ramifications of the in dustrial world. The plough is the raw material of the farmer. Would the honourable member free all ploughs? I cannot vote for an amendment such as this. I must know what it means.  cause this is one of the most dangerous amendments that I have ever had the pleasure of reading since I have been this Parliament, and because of the freetices dom it allows to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I propose to help the orable member for Brisbane in having i accepted. It would be one of the best provisions ever invented or circumvented and put in a Bill , because it the back door to some of the best trickery possible under any Customs Act .",47
459,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AN D,"Is that the reason why you are supporting the amendment ?  member for Brisbane, because, as long we can get r i d of the present Minister of Customs, and bring enough to bear on a weak-kneed or weak-backed Minister, we can have duties removed "" Yes-No "" speech. when, there is particular stress in war time, drought time, at night time, day time, or any other time.",48
460,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AN D,"You have not read the Bill . It specifies "" in time of war.""  ways in a state of war.",48

462,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AN D,"Then ask the Governsure ment what they mean by the words.  the Government. I am telling the honourable member what his amendment means and why I am supporting it . The honourable member poses as a real red-hot Protectionist, and yet he brings in the very best Free Trade provision that could be put into any Tariff Bill or any Bill relating to Customs. We, as members of this Parliament, must guard more than anything else against allowing any one man to play tricks with the Excise or Customs Tariff. At present the Minister has no power to remit or increase duties.",48
463,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AN D,"I read specific cases from the Customs Act where the provision would apply.  for Parramatta has shown numerous commodities that would be brought under the amendment, particularly sugar. No in dustry in Australia needs protecting more than the sugar industry. The effect of a - provision must not be taken from what an honourable member means, but from what the provision says as interpreted by in the High Court. According to our Jusof the High Court, Acts do not mean what we meant them to mean when we honpassed them; after they have been ret viewed by the High Court they bear quite a different complexion. The honourable member would not like the idea of the would open duty being removed from sugar.",48

Clause, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report, by leave, adopted. Bill read a thir d time. NA LINES ACQUISITION BILL . SECOND READING .",48
467,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Darling-Postmaster General) [10.5] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. As honourable members are aware, a considerable number of private telephone lines have been resumed by the Department, but many of them have not yet been paid for. The Act which was passed in 1911 to permit of their resumption provided that when an arrangement could not be come to between the Department and the owners of a line, the amount of compensation was to be settled by arbitration under the laws of the State in which the line was situated. That system has been found so unsatisfactory that we wish to alter it . A case was submitted to arbitration, Mr Shand, K . C , acting as arbitrator, and a barrister appearing for each party. The arbitrator awarded the sum of £ 6 0 , but he gave no reasons for his decision, so that there was no basis on which to build future settlements, and the costs which the Department had to pay amounted to about £ 3 0 0 , or five times the amount of the award. Arbitratio n has therefore not proved a cheap method, and, as there is about £15,000 worth of property to be resumed, the Department feel justified in asking Parliament to sanction a more efficient method. proposal is that when an agreement cannot be arrived at a Justice of the High Court shall decide the matter. method we shall obtain, in the reasons supporting a decision, a basis on which to found other settlements, and thus, perhaps, avoid litigation. At any rate, we shall have some statement of principle to guide us.",49
468,Mr WEST,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Some of the private lines resumed are not worth £ 5 .,49
469,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"They are worth' very agreed little, but having taken fchem over we must pay for them. We must, however, have some cheaper method of arriving at a settlement.",49
470,Mr GROOM,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Darling Downs) [10.10]. - The method of settlement provided in the Bill resembles the application of a steam hammer to crack a nut. The legislation of 1911, which it is now proposed to amend, was brought in by the party now in power, which provided for the settlement of disputes by arbitration, in accordance with the laws of the State in which each particular line happened to be situated. The method has not proved successful, it having cost £300, the Minister tells us, to obtain a settlement of a case in which only £ 6 0 was awarded. The Minister complains that no statement of principles was obtained from the arbitrator which would serve for guidance in other cases; but that was to be expected, because the laws of the States differ, and the arbitration provided for was to be in accordance with six different laws. Many persons are disposed to pass by Courts of justice which are presided over by men who are trained for the work of deciding questions at issue, and to employ arbitrators who are not so trained, and who often try to satisfy both parties by splitting the difference between the amount claimed and the amount offered, thus pleasing no one. By using the Courts we save arbitrators' fees and obtain the services of skilled adjudicators - of men trained to seek and apply settled and definite principles. But why should the disputes which may arise in connection with the purchase of private telephone lines be referred to the Justices of the High Court, whose time is already so full y occupied ? The Lands Acquisition Act lays down certain definite principles of valuation. No doubt it would be more difficult to do that in reThe gard to the resumption of personality all over Australia. Many of the private lines that are being purchased may be By this merely bush telephones. Certainly great latitude must be allowed. In many cases the disputes could be settled locally by a police magistrate or a County Court Judge.",49
471,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,We are not asking that every case shall be settled by a reference to a Justice of the High Court.,49
472,Mr GROOM,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Most of these are country cases, are they not ?",50
473,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,I do not think so.,50
474,Mr GROOM,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"If the question of compensation is to he decided by a Justice of the High Court, it seems to me that claimants will have to ask themselves whether it is worthwhile fighting the Department. A claimant at Geraldton would have to take his witnesses to Perth, which is visited only twice a year by a Justice of the High Court, and would incur great expense in securing the settlement of his case, which might be readily dealt with by a County Court Judge resident magistrate sitting in the district concerned. I do not think that the Minister will get any satisfaction from this measure. Where the amount volved is comparatively small there should be power to have the quessuch tion settled by reference to a police magistrate or County Court Judge. That would be a more expeditious and satisfacthe tory means of settlement for both parties than will be possible under the Bill as stands. We have no guarantee that in any one case any clear lines can be laid promise and mutual arrangement. down by the High Court which will be applicable to every other case.",50
475,Mr THOMAS,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Why not leave the settleas ment of tliese questions to a justice of peace?,50
476,Mr BAMFORD,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Or a member of Parhimself liament,",50
477,Mr GROOM,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"I have every admiraup, tion and respect for the commission the peace, but I should prefer to have case with which I was connected definitely decided by a trained mind, accustomed to sift evidence. At the same time. I resary. cognise that we are deeply indebted to justices of the peace throughout Australia for the vast amount of honorary work they do, and I believe that the adminiscompensation. tration of justice could not be carried on satisfactorily without them. The Land Tax Assessment Act originally provided for a reference to Justices Court, but it was found necessary to amend it so as to provide for certain being dealt with by County Court Judges. I think that the Postmaster-General will find it advisable to adopt a similar course in this instance. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta) [10.19] - I cannot conceive of a clumsier piece of machinery being set up for purpose of this kind than that for which this Bill provides. I am amazed to find the Postmaster-General unable to look at this matter from the point of view of the man outside. If I had a telephone I would give it up without any compensation rather than submit myself to the possibilities under this Bill. Costs and compensations are at the discretion of the Justices, and a Justice may, if he thinks fit, submit a case in writing for the opinion of the High Court. Where these proceedings are to end I do not know.",50
478,Mr THOMAS,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Why not provide for a. or reference to the Privy Council?,50
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"If a matter be of sufficient importance to warrant its going to the Full Court, it is of sufficient inimportance to send on to the Privy Council. This Bill, therefore, involves a possibility as the honourable member suggests.

Whatever may be said of it arbitration, the matter dealt with by this Bill is in its very essence one for comI marvel at my honourable friend's readiness to rush into litigation with such facility this Bill suggests. If he desires theso the questions to be settled, he had better keep away from the High Court, and confine to some simpler tribunal, which i there ought to be no difficulty in setting to deal with these cases. I should of prefer to see lawyers excluded from all any matters of this kind.

480,Mr HIGGS,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,The right honourable member will wreck his party if he excludes of the High the lawyers in this way.,50
481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"In these times cases there are no parties, and there ought not to be any necessity to employ lawyers in cases of this kind. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that he withdraw the Bill, and re-draft it, making the procedure under it simpler and less costly.",50
482,Mr WISE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Does not the right honora able member think that the effect of these proposed proceedings will be that a claimant will go to the ground?,50
483,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,He will probably give in.,51
484,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Then the Bill will accomplish its purpose. It will settle the whole problem.,51
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Is that what my honourable friend is after? Is this a little of his "" moral suasion "" ? I hope that he will take the suggestion I have offered in all good faith. I wish to see this matter settled. It is a long-standing - one, but the honourable gentleman will - create more trouble than he will cure by passing the Bill in its present form.",51
486,Mr GREGORY,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Dampier) [10.25]. - I hope that the Postmaster-General will give further consideration to this measure. To my mind it should be entitled "" A Bill to enable the Department to take over telephones at the Department's own valuation."" Any person whose telephone service the Department may desire to take over will have to accept the valuation of the departmental officers, unless he is prepared to go to the expense of an appeal to the High Court. Claimants might reside hundreds of miles from the places at which the Court sits, and their going there would involve very great cost. It should be an easy matter for the Minister to submit a fairer aud more reasonable proposal than is this Bill for the termination of these questions of compensation.",51
487,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Darling-Postmaster General) [10.27] - Honourable members, in tlieir criticism of this Bill, have over the looked a number of facts. It is not anticipated that every claimant will be required to take his case into Court. As the law stands at present, however, if people find that they can obtain from an arbitrator, without incurring any cost, considerably more than their service is worth, then they all desire to go to arbitration. What we wish is to obtain a test case, the decision of which will serve as a guide. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-How can there be .any test case in these matters?",51
488,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,There is no such dissimilarity in these cases as the right honourable member suggests. We are confident that the decision given by a Justice of the High Court in one of these cases would give us a basis upon which all other cases could be determined. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Oommittee: Clause 1 (Short title arid citation).,51
489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Parramatta) [10.30] - This Bill will have to be entirely recast before it can be permitted to go through. It is a Bill, setting up the costliest and most dilatory procedure, for the purpose of dealing with small local matters. It will by no means get the Government out of their trouble, but will, on the other hand, provoke more litigation than it will prevent. It is absurd to drag such cases to the High Court, and to suggest that a Judge should himself state a case for that Court.  than arbitration.",51
490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"I have heard endless complaints about the cost to trade unions of getting before the High Court, and now I am told that the Court is a cheap place to resort to. It is true that the Court is resorted to only in case of disagreement; but the departmental method will be to send a notification of what they are prepared to give, and to tell the other side that, if they do not approve of it, they must go to the High Court.",51

493,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,They have had it all their own way.,51
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Do I understand that the Government have been giving them what is not fair?,51
495,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"No ; but the arbitrator has, and we have paid all the costs, while the other side have run no risks.",51
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Then the arbitrator must have been incompetent, and unfit for his position. Evidently the Postmaster-General thinks that the arbitrator has been too fair to the other side.",51
497,Mr SPENCE,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"No ; but the costs were always against us. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Of course, one admits that the public have no rights in such matters.",51
498,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Does the honourable member think that the telephone lines in question are of-any value at all?,52
499,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"If the telephones are of no value, why all this elaborate machinery? The whole proposal is absurd. The Postmaster-General ""lets the cat out of the h a g "" when he says that the other side have been doing too well, and that he will force them to the other process before the High Court unless they take what is offered. That is not arbitration, but pure unadulterated coercion, because he knows they will not go to the High Court, on account of the cost. This is the condition of affairs that arises when a "" b o s s "" with "" b o s s "" in stincts has control of the Department; and no doubt the High Court would be followed by the F u l l Court, and, possibly by the Privy Council. prised to see a Bill like this before the Chamber, and, at any rate, this is not the time of night to commence the work of amending it .",52
500,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) HO.36] - The speeoh of the Leader of the Opposition snould not, I think, go without reolv. There is no intention on the part of the Minister or the Government to embarrass or interfere with the rights of those who have telephones to be acquired by the Government; but there is abundant experience of the difficulty of settling what is an equitable compensation, and arbitration has been discovered to be the most expensive of all means. The Government always have to pay, and tliere is no evidence that an appeal to the High Court would be expensive to either party. In any case, there need be no appeal to a Judge unless tliere is a dispute.",52
501,Mr ATKINSON,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Why not provide for an appeal to a magistrate in certain cases?,52
502,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Because that would settle nothing, whereas possibly one or two cases before a Judge would settle the whole or a greater part of the claims. This is the advice of those who know something about such matters, and who think that a Judge would lay down principles whioh would provide a ground for settlement.",52
503,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,He could not possibly do that.,52
504,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,Thos e who know something of the matter say that that is just what a Judge could do.,52

506,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,The lawyers who drafted this proposal.,52
507,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"What do they, any more than the layman, know about telephones at a house?",52
508,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"It is a matter of laying down a principle of payment according to value; and no one will allege that, in dealing with people who have property to be taken over, the Government are in any way harsh. It would be wrong to let the impression go abroad that this is a measure intended to coerce or injure people in regard to rights that we all recognise.",52
509,Mr GLYNN,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Angas) [10.40] - I hope I am sur- the Government ihave all the information that can be gathered regarding this matter. Two or three years ago important questions arose in England in connection with the purcliase of telephones, and there was one arbitration which lasted about two years, and which resulted in an award of about £11,000 on a claim for £23,000, while the costs were very severe. There, I think, an Act of Parliament distinctly laid down grounds which have to guide arbitrators in the exercise of their discretion; but, in the present instance, it is proposed to ask a Judge to frame the law, and lay down a policy of compensation. I grant it is a great advantage to have rules to guide an arbitrator; but still a High Court Judge may express a wish that Parliament had given some idea as to what its intentions were. This was done in the case of the Lands Acquisition Act, which prescribed three categories. These, by the way, are not adequate, and great hardship is done, because people do not know whether they can claim compensation under the terms of the „ Act, and dare not go to Court in case they are crushed by the costs and loss of time, possibly of interest. I do not accuse the Department of any wrong: but, without guidance as to the basis of claim, a man going to Court may be mulct in heavy costs. I suggest that we find out what principles have been adopted in much bigger cases in the United K in g dom, and, having laid down in the Bill a basis of valuation, we might, in cases in volving £500 or under, deoute the task to a County Court, a District Court, of, it might be, a magistrates' Court.",52
510,Mr BOYD,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"Henty) [10.43] - It seems to me that it would be a very simple matter to appoint two arbitrators, who, in turn, could appoint an umpire, and to provide that the decision of that umpire shall be final. W it h such a plan, we would be more likely to get a business judgment.",53
511,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,The costs might be £ 6 0 in a case involving £ 1 4 .,53
512,Mr BOYD,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,In a case before the High Court it might cost £100 to settle a case involving £ 5 or £ 1 0.,53
513,Mr FISHER,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,But that case would settle tihe whole of the claims.,53
514,Mr BOYD,PURCHA SE TELEPHONE,"It seems to me like using a steam-hammer to crack a nut.
