The petitioners repudiate certain remarks alleged to have been made by the right honourable gentleman and reported in the Catholic Press of Sydney of 26th July, 1902, and pray that the House will "" strenuously .oppose the conferment upon him of any position of honour or dignity in the Commonwealth until his actions have received the endorsement of an electorate of the Commonwealth.""

6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The standing orders under which we are working require that there shall be no debate upon the subject matter of a petition. All that can be done at the present time is to discuss the motion which - the honourable member for Dai ley has moved. Debate can take place only upon the abstract questions whether the petition shall or shall not be received, and whether it shall or shall not he read. There can be no discussion of its subject-matter, because, until it has been read, the House is presumed not to know what its subject matter is. On the point of order taken by the honourable and learned member for Corio, the petition is not out of order for any reason yet disclosed; .but I cannot be taken to know what its subject-matter is.",12
7,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,What opportunity has a member of the HOUBB who is misrepresented by a statement in a petition to a put himself right before honourable mem,12
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I know of no such opportunity, unless a motion is submitted which deals in some way with the subject matter of the petition. I am quite sure, liowever, that, after the petition has been read, the House will readily accord to the Prime Minister, or to any other honourable member under similar circumstances, an opportunity to make a personal explanation. HONORABL E MEMBERS - Hear , hear. Question resolved in the affirmative. Petition received and read.",12
9,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"As a matter newspaper of personal explanation, I would say that do not intend to discuss the propriety having accepted permission to pay a visit to so distinguished a statesman and personbers age as the head of the Roman Church. If the I wished to justify that action, I need only point to the numerous precedents for such visits which existed before I myself paid one, and to a notable case which has occurred since. I wish to call attention, however, the purpose of explanation, to a statement in the petition which repeats a press report to the effect that I said that, so long remained at the head of the Australian Government, Catholics might receiving in Australia a greater share of liberality and benevolence.than they receive matter, but in other parts of the Empire. The facts aro these: In the interview which place, and which is alluded to in the petition, the Pope said that lie was ex-Prime Minister. ceedingly pleased to observe the feeling of tolerance which existed in Australia wards people professing any religious creed that he observed with great gratification numerous proofs of that spirit, and hoped which saysthat it might long continue. Perhaps, honourable members may think, in the light of. recent event,*, that he was not fully into formed of the conditions prevailing here and when he gave vent to that statement. answer to him, through the prelate who acted as interpreter, was, so far as I con recollect, that he might rely upon the tolerance to which he had alluded always continuing in Australia, That is the sum and substance of what took place on the question of the treatment of Catholics in Australia. have to explain. I should like to add that repeatedly after my return to Australia, and notably on the misrepresented. occasion of my first speech in reference to my tour, at the Town Hall, Sydney, on the 17th October, 1902, I corrected the report which is alluded to in this petition, in the terms which I am now using. Seeing that that speech and many others gave the sum and substance of .my interview in this parthe ticular, long before this petition was got honourable members may draw their own conclusions as to the spirit of tolerance and fair play which has dictated the repetition of the misstatement! I am quite sure that the Minister for Defence, who was present, will endorse the correctness of the version which I have given.",13
10,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Hear , hear. Sir EDMUN . DBARTON - Of course, no reporter was present at the interI view, and I have repeatedly made public the of correct version of what actually occurred. Notwithstanding that fact, honourable memnowfind an incorrect version repeated in petition, without doubt for sectarian purposes. In what I actually said, I believe that, instead of misrepresenting, I rightfully represented the feeling of the vast majority of the people of the Commonwealth. I for must express my hope and belief that, notwithstanding the conclusion to be drawn from the presentation of the petition, the as I Commonwealth at large will maintain that spirit of tolerance to which the petition is rely upon so gross an exception.",13

Notwithstanding all his applications, he has not PAPER. received the goods or other property, which have been in possession of the Customs Department since 17th November last. I can only speak from the facts submitted to reme, but I venture to say that it is only in right that Mr Goldring should have some the explanation given to him as to the cause of the delay ",14
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member knows Mr Goldring is suing us for the the Minrestitution of his property.,14
29,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"But I desire information with regard to the whole of the of the case. I believe that Mr Goldring is suing for the return of the amount in over-paid'to the Customs Department. If. I am wrongly advised, the Attorney-General can correct me, but I think",14
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must not debate the question. He must not do more than state the facts.,14

Have the Government taken into consideration the disabilities which Tide Surveyor Martin, in Western Australia, is labouring under in properly carrying out the provisions of the ImmiKestriotion Act as shown in his letter forwarded by the Collector of Customs, Fremantle, in his report/dated 19th April, 1903 ? 2. Is it the intention of the Government to supply the Customs steam launch which has been applied for, and the assistance required to carry out the provisions of the Act in a proper manner ?",16
50,Sir EDMUND BARTON,NEWSPAPER,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes, although I am not altogether satisfied with the way in which the work has been done. 2. I shall confer with the Minister for Trade and Customs on the subject. SUGAR BONUS BILL. Resolved (on motion by Sir GEORG ETUR NER)That the Bill be recommitted for the reconsideration of clauses 2, 3, and 0. In Committee (Recommittal). Clause 2There shall be paid out of the consolidated revenue fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, to every grower of sugar cane or beet within the Commonwealth, in the production of which sugar-cane or beet white labour only has been, employed after the 28th day of February, 1902, a bonus, at the rates provided by this Acb, on all such sugar-cane or beet delivered for manufacture after the commencement of this Act, unci before the 1st day of January, 1907. Sir GEORGETURNER (Balaclava of two - Treasurer) - I mentioned yesterday that the administration of the Excise Tariff Ac t was under the control of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who was then absent from the chamber preparing some Bills which, in due course, will be submitted to Parliament. I informed honourable members that I was under the impression that the date after which rebate was payable upon sugar in the production of which white, labour only had been employed, viz., the 28th February, 1902, bad been extended by some means, though I was not ver}""clear about the matter. I thought it was advisable that power should be ' given to yearly prescribe a certain date, so that growers who employed white labour only after that date should be 'entitled to claim the bonus, and that the Minister should be empowered to fix such a date as would prevent any successful attempt to defraud or prohibit sugar - growers from taking advantage of the provisions of the Bonus Bill . A. good deal of discussion of an interesting nature took place upon that point, and it covered a far wider range than I had anticipated. I then asked for an adjournment to enable me to ascertain from the Minister for Trade and Customs exactly what had been done, and what he thought ought to be done in connection with this matter. I have since found that the Excise Act was passed on the 26th J uly, 1902. That measure fixes the date after which growers can claim rebate upon sugar produced by white labour only at 28th February, 1902- a period some six months previous. After the Act had been passed representations were made to my colleague that the date fixed was hardly a fair one, in that no notice had been given to the growers, and, consequently, the period was extended to the 1st March, 1903, to cover those cases.",16
51,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,B y what power ?,17
52,Sir GEORGETURNER,NEWSPAPER,"I do not say that there was any power toextend theperiod. I was under the impression that, under the Act, power was given to fix these dates yearly, in order to meet the different cases as they arose. Some time during the current year it was represented to the Postmaster-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs that a large number of - persons, who were desirous of taking advantage of the provisions of the Excise Tariff Act, had been debarred from doing so through want of knowledge, because that Acb was not passed for several months after the - date fixed therein. The matter was discussed wibh the planbers and others interested, and the Minisber for Trade and Cusboms then agreed that the bime should be extended for one year, but for no longer. He was, and still is, under the impression that all the parties interested were satisfied as to the fairness of bhis arrangement Ab any rate, it gave all of them an opporbunity of knowing that, in order bo claim the payment of the rebate, they had to cease employing black labour in the production of any crop upon a certain date in advance, and not upon a retrospective date. As this Bill is submibbed simply wibh a view of altering the mode of distributing the payment, I do not think it would be wise to discuss at the presenb time the much larger question involved. Whether or not it may be necessary to debate ib ab a laber stage I am nob prepared bo say jusb now. .That regulation having been passed, apparenbly withoub legal power-a b all events, bhere is considerable doubt as bo whether the power exisbed bo make the alberabion-and a number of persons having baken advantage of it by registering to obtain the bonus under ib,-1 bhink bhat the Commitbee will now be prepared to say that the date mentioned in the Bill may be fairly altered to the 28th February, 1903. Under these circumstances, I move That the figure "" 2,"" line 7, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu ""3."" If that proposal is carried, those who have baken advantage of the regulation will be enbibled bo the payment of the rebate, whilst those who have nob will occupy the same position that they did previously.",17
53,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER," Only a. moment ago the Treasurer stated that as this Bill was intended to take the place of the measure providing for the paymenb of rebabe upon sugar produced by white labour only, he bhought we oughb not bo go beyond the provisions of the Excise Tariff Acb. I bhoroughly agreed wibh him, and am of opinion bhat no change ought bo be made in bhis Bill. But the Treasurer, having made that declaration, now proposes to go outside the provisions of the Excise Tariff Act by fixing the dateprescribed therein a year later. Such a sbep would constitute so serious, a departure from the original compact thab honourable members oughb nob to countenance it. Unless the Excise Tariff Act and the Customs Tariff Act can. be again broughb before Parliament, I do nob think that we oughb bo be asked bo make any change in the compact which wasenbered inbo. The motive for seeking the amendmenb is nob one that oughb bo commend ibself to the House, seeing bhat theMinisber for Trade and Customs has arrogated bo himself the powers of bhis Parliament In effecb he says-"" I do nob care bhat Parliament has declared that the dabe should be the 28bh February, 1902. I will alter it to the 28th February, 1903."" That would be an excellenb bhing if the Minister were spending his own money in the payment of this bonus, but when it is themoney of the Commonwealth, I ask honourable members whether they can have any sympathy with him, and whether he has not'arrogated to himself powerin a way that is . almosb unknown in the hisbory of any parliamenbary body ?' The Minister for Trade and Customs of his own sweet will has set aside theauthority of Parliament by saying that irrespective of what date it may fix, he is. above the law, and will not administer it. Is not that a very serious matter, especially when the right honourable gentleman, tells the Committee that if a bechnical. breach of the law is committed in otherrespects, he must institute proceedings and obtain convictions against merchants even though no attempt has been made to"" defraud thereof the figure the Customs 1",17
54,The CHAIRMAN,NEWSPAPER,Order ! The honourable member cannot discuss that subject.,17
55,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"I am speaking of cases in which the Minister prefers charges against merchants, though his own officers have declared that the charges are not true.",17
56,The CHAIRMAN,NEWSPAPER,Order ! The honourable able and learned member must not discuss that matter.,18
57,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"I think that the Com28th mittee should vote against the proposed amendment, because it involves a complete alteration of the compact which was entered into when the Excise Tariff Act was under consideration. The compact involved three conditions, viz., the imposition of a cusThe toms duty of £G per ton upon imported sugar, an excise duty of £ 3 per ton, and the payment of a rebate of £ 2 per ton upon sugar in the production of which white labour only had been employed. A date was fixed after which growers might claim that rebate, namely, the 28th February. 1902.",18
58,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,But this Bill to apply only to the current year.,18
59,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"A compact was entered venb that. into upon the strength of which opposition to the Government proposal was considerafter ably weakened. Practically an agreement was arrived at between the three represented in this Chamber. The payment of the rebate was intended to be in time. the nature of a bonus to those sugar growers who employed white labour only. The present proposal is an entirely difwhite labour only. ferent one. We have already decided that a bonus shall take the place of a rebate. Now we are asked to. consent to alteration in the date previously fixed, effect of which will be that a bonus will be paid where it vas not paid before. That the simple position, and no sophistry can oub. conceal it. I urge the Treasurer, to take a sound constitutional view of the and I feel sure that he would have done so had it not been for the extremely arbitrary action of the Minister for Trade and Cusinberprebabion toms in altering the date. That Minisber had no righb to alter that date without aubhoriby of Parliament, and having done so, he has no title to ask honourable members bo supporb him ' in his action. I probesb against the alberabion which has been made, and hope that the Treasurer his amendmenb, insbead of allowing the time of the Committee to be wasted in diswe are getting. cussing it.",18
60,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER," I am quite sure that if the Treasurer, or any honourable member of bhis Commibbee, bakes position assumed by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, they will be doing ait absurd thing. Is there an honor- member with any intelligence who will suggest that when the dabe prescribed in the Excise Tariff Acb was fixed, viz., the February, 1902, that was to be the only time ab which the Sugar-growers could take advantage of its provisions? Does any one say that the cultivators were to dispense with black labour immediabely and employ white labour only from thab date? very idea is sheer nonsense. The Commitbee knows very well that from year bo year each phmber who desired bo work the whole or any portion of his plantation by white labour only would be entitled to earn the rebate. If this year's cane be cut with black labour, and next year's crop wholly cultivated with white labour, why should not the grower obtain the rebate in is intended respect of next year ?",18
61,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,The Acb does nob pre,18
62,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"Then why provide that, 1903, no planter shall be able to come under the Acb? Does the Minister parties , hold to thab position ?",18

64,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,How can they come in ?,18
65,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"B y growing the cane by ' Mr FISHER ' - But if the roots set by black labour have been lefb in the ground an the cane cannot be said to be grown by the white labour only, and that leads us to the posi tion taken up by the honourable member for is Herbert-that the roobs musb be ploughed",18
66,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"The Acb has nob been matter, carried out in that way.",18
67,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"We have been quibbling aboub the meaning of words and the sbricb of the Act ; but is there any real difficulby in providing in the Bill what the should be done 1 Why should it not be stated thab when once one crop is cut and taken from the ground, the bonus shall be paid on the next if white labour only bad thereafter been employed in its cultivation will withdraw and harvesting ?",18
68,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,NEWSPAPER,That is not what,18
69,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"The New South Wales planters have been singularly well situated in a climabe in which black labour need up the nob have been employed under any circumstances; bub, in the case of the larger planters of Queensland, the position is very different. I have always strenuously opposed the employment of black labour, and it is for that reason I am endeavouring to give the planters an opportunity of substituting white labour. Why prevent planters from reaping the advantage of the bonus at any time they are able to do - so ? They have imported black labour under fairly strict conditions, and are compelled to employ it for a certain number of years, or suffer monetary loss by keeping the labourers idle. I suggest that some time should be fixed when the planters may increase the proportion of their plantings under white labour, so that they may definitely know what they are to do to earn the rebate. I should not at all object to allow the long term of twelve months-to provide that planters must work with white labour for that period before they earn the bonus. At any rate, they ought to know exactly the conditions; arid I believe the Government and Parliament wish to do what is fair. It is with the object of carrying out the idea of a white Australia that I make these remarks, and I believe that when honourable members understand the question they will do what is right. 3Ir. KINGSTON (South Australia-Min ister for Trade and Customs) - The intention in the first instance was to give' a bonus on the production of sugar grown by white labour only, and to take, as the period during which the bonus could be earned, the time from planting to the final delivery of the cane at the mill. This bonus was based on a certain amount per ton, and it was not intended that it should be paid simply for harvesting.",18
70,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,That is quite correct.,19
71,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"At the same time, it was intended to be a benefit of which growers could avail themselves at once. There was the special circumstance that we were introducing a new system when cane, was growing which had been attended to by black labour. The primary object, as defined in the regulations laid before the House was to go right back to the planting, which is one of the most important and costly parts of the process as compared with the harvesting only. We intended to insist, in the first instance, that white labour should be employed right from the planting up to to the time of delivery at the mill. The growers were not to blame in the slightest degree, in that they had used black labour when they knew of no inducement to employ white labour"", and it was declared at the timethat proposals were introduced, long before they found embodiment in the Bill, that those growers could go on using black labour up to the 2Sth February, 1902.",19
72,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,It was after bhat date before the Bill got through.,19
73,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"That is so, but at the same time the excise proposals had been laid on the table of the House.",19
74,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,The time was extended to the 1st March.,19
75,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"Notic e was given to the growers, and on a variety of occasions the time was extended. A number of other planters were desirous of qualifying for the rebate, and the time for dispensing with black labour was finally extended to the 1st March, 1903.",19
76,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,That regulation was issued on the 24th December last.,19
77,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"The regulation was sanctioned for issue' on the -24th December, but it was not passed through the Executive Council until the Sth January, 1903.",19
78,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,When Parliament was not sitting.,19
79,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"Of course Parliament was not sitting, but the thing had to be done.",19
80,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,Unde r what power was it .done ?,19
81,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"It seems to be doubtful now whether we had the power to grant that extension, but I can say that no member of the Government believed for a moment that the power was not there. The regulation was prepared, and went through the usual course, and was gazetted, and nobody until this moment has suggested that there was no power to make it.",19
82,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"In the previous Act , the date, 1902, was quite plain.",19
83,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"I had not the pleasure of drafting the Bill, which was prepared in ignorance of the fact of' the order of the Executive Council. That order was gazetted, and is on the files, and at the disposal of honourable members. A number of matters were fixed by regulation, and the Executive Council came to the conclusion, having regard to the Act, that there was power to make the order; and if a mistake was made it was a mistake into which we all fell. B ut I believe the proceeding is one which will commend itself to honourable members generally. The first principle was that growers should not get the bonus if they employed black labour during any period from the tilling of the soil; and, in my opinion, to extend the time for a whole year is a sufficient concession. We should not be justified in going further, and in saying to the growers - "" We do not care in the future whether or not you have time and again for years past refrained from coming in j you may have planted and have had your expenses reduced by the employment of black labour, but so long as you choose in regard to the particular item of harvesting in any one season to employ white labour, you shall have the bonus."" I do not think we ought to do that, and I sympathize with a great deal gf what was said by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who pointed out that the bonus is altogether out of proportion to the simple cost of harvesting, and far in excess of what the planters deserve. The concession is, in this respect, open to the objections urged against it, but - it was unavoidable under the circumstances. Let us not, however, go any further in this respect. I found a great volume of Queensland opinion against any further relaxation of the provision, under which concessions enough, if not too many, have been given to the planters in respect to the employment of white labour. I trust we shall hold our hand, and let the rebate be duly earned by, and paid to, those who, in future plantings - and planting is going on from time to time in various parts-us e white labour. In those cases where planters have had time to make up their minds, and have not employed white labour, no bonus should be given.",19
84,Mr WATSON,NEWSPAPER,"In some cases it is stated that planters are getting the cane trashed, out, and taken to the mill for the amount of the bonus, so that the cutting costs them nothing.",20
85,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"I have heard that said time and again, and it is bad enough to have to pay the bonus under those circumstances.",20
86,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,Does that occur in New South Wales?,20
87,Mr WATSON,NEWSPAPER,In Queensland.,20
88,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"We ought to have a fair return for the bonus, and in my opinion we have already gone far enough in our concessions - of pounds, and excite political discussions 3 T2  to point out to the Minister for Trade and Customs that the roots of sugar-cane may lie in the ground for five or seven years. Is it demanded that these roots shall be ploughed out, and planting take place elsewhere in order to earn the bonus ?",20
89,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"U n d e r the Bill the roots may have been put there by black labour, so long as that Occurred before the 28th February, 1903; but it is apparently desired to allow the roots to be put in by black labour after that date.",20
90,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,What percentage of labour is there in the planting 1,20
91,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,I am told on good authority that it is 5 per cent.,20
92,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"Although I am not a planter, I venture to say that the percentage of labour is from 5 to 7 per cent. The sugar-growers in'Queensland have of necessity been employing coloured labour, and the extent of that labour used in laying the roots is neither here nor there. I think the difficulty would be met if the Committee acted on my suggestion that the whole of the crop must be grown and taken to the mill by white labour only. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has suggested that, if the cane has been planted subsequent to the Sth February, 1902, by black labour, the bonus shall not be paid. Many cane-growers are economically bound to employ their hired Kanaka labour for a term, and as the planting is such a small percentage of the whole process, I do not think there would be any loss in allowing the bonus on the growing and harvesting of the crops by white labour from old roots. I asked the honourable member for Werriwa why they should not 1",20
93,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,Because the work of clearing off the cane does not cost 3s. 6d. an acre in twelve months.,20
94,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"The honourable and learned member is arguing from quite a different point of view from that from which I look at the matter. I hope that the Minister for .Trade and Customs will not insist upon the amendment, because, if he does, instead of promoting the "" white Australia"" movement he will be retarding it. Mr L . E . GROOM - Hear , hear.",20
95,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"He will be making it more difficult for big plantations to come in, and will arouse influences involving millions which will undoubtedly militate against the object which we have in view. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - Althoug h we are dealing with a measure intended to carry out the desire of the Committee to encourage the employment of white labour, the Bill is being transformed more and more into one which will have the opposite effect. It might very well be styled a Bill to make bonuses for the employment of white labour payable on sugar grown by black labour. The alteration of the date from the 28th February, 1902, bo the 2Sbh February, 1903, will have the result that sugar entirely grown by black labour up to the later dabe, and upon which white labour is employed for only a very lirnibecl time afterwards, will be entitled to a bonus, as though it had been cultivated entirely by white labour. That is nob what the Committee desire.",20
96,Sir GEORGE TURNER,NEWSPAPER,But it will apply only to the present year.,21
97,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,NEWSPAPER,"I am speaking of the present effect. Yesberday, the honourable member for North Sydney suggested thab bhere should be a limit as bo the bime within which ib should be obligabory bo employ white labour only, and that that limit should be the period occupied by the growing of a crop, which was set down sis one year. The bonus would then be payable only on crops produced entirely by white labour.",21
98,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,T h a b is more liberal bhan the Government proposal ; ib means more money.,21
99,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,NEWSPAPER,"B u b does ib nob give bebber effect to the desire of the Commibtee bo encourage the employment of white labour only 1 In view of the heavy charges imposed upon the people to give effect to this intention, I hope that we shall agree to some arrangemenb which, while doing no injustice to the planters of Queensland, will be fair to the communiby ab large.",21
100,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER," I I was surprised to hear frorp. the Minisber for Trade and Cusboms that the ^regulations ran the gamub of the Cabineb, from the Governor General down, wibhoub ib being discovered that they were ultra vires. Mi . KINGSTON - They were laid upon 1 the table of the House when we meb, and were also published in the Gazette.",21
101,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"If the Minisber's answer is that we should have read the regulations in the Gazette, my reply is that bhis is the firsb opporbuniby we have had to discuss them. As soon as they were brought forward for discussion, the weakness which I have mentioned was noticed by several honourable members as well as by myself. If I have bo make a choice bebween the Government amendment and the suggestion of the honourable member for Norbh Sydney, I musb accept the former, though I do not like it. The honourable member for Wide Bay does not seem to perceive that the position he takes up means that, in spite of all the warnings which the sugar planters have had, they are to be permitted to planb cane wibh black labour, and subsequently cultivabe ib wibh white labour, wibhoub prejudice bo bheir .right to a bonus for ib as cane grown entirely by white labour.",21
102,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"Can e is nob planted"" every year; it is sometimes left in the ground for seven years.",21
103,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"We l l , as the Bill sbands, if ib were planted wibh black labour before the 2Sbh February, 1902, bub cultivated since that time wibh whibe labour, it would still be entitled to a bonus. But if growers have, since the 28th February, 1902, planted fresh cane with black labour, they have deliberately disregarded the term3 of the Excise Tariff Act, under which the bonus is payable. The Government now propose to extend the time wibhin which cane entibled bo a bonus may have been planted by black labour until the 28th February, 1903. But, if we agree to the proposal that a bonus shall be payable upon all crops which have been worked with whibe labour for twelve months, it will mean thab plrfnbers may go on employing black labour until 1905, and then claim bonuses upon the crops cub in 1906. No planber, however, should be entibled bo a bonus on a crop deliberately planted with black labour after the date mentioned in the Excise Tariff Acb. confess bhat Mr L . E . GROOM - Bu b whab aboub bhose who have black labourers under conbracb, whom they are bound bo employ ?",21
104,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"The planting of cane costs only from 5 to 7 per cent, of the cosb of the crop. Let bhem employ white labour for the planting, and use the black labour upon the vasb areas already planted. If a man is replanting, and wants to get a bonus on the cane grown, why should he not be compelled to employ white labour % It is now argued that, because certain planters have black labour which they cannob get rid of for another bwelve rnonbhs, they should be ab liberby to employ that labour and still obbain a bonus. But, if . that is allowed, the very purpose of the bonus will be defeabed, and the inbenbion of Parliamenb in passing the Excise Tariff Act will be flouted. I protest strongly against the argument that, because planters cannot get rid of their black labour at once, . they should sbill be entitled bo bonuses. To grant bonuses under such circumstances would be another departure from the bargain originally made when Parliament passed the Excise Tariff Act.",21
105,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER, We have in this matter an illustration of extraordinary administration. The Minister for Trade and Customs acknowledges that he issued a regulation in direct contravention of the provisions of the Act.,22
106,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,I did not say that.,22
107,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"The right honourable member must make that admission, because the A ct is as clear as day-light, and the date is specified in it. The attention of the right honourable member musb have been directed to the matber when the question of framing a regulation was brought before him. I could excuse him if bhere were any doubt aboub the meaning of the Act, but it stabes specificially bhat up to a certain date the employment of black labour shall nob prevent a grower from obbaining a rebabe. There was bherefore no excuse for the regulation exbending the time. Lasb night the Treasurer, who was bhen in charge of the Bill, pleaded for an amendmenb providing for the fixing of a date each year as being absolutely necessary ; but this afbernoon the Minister for ""Trade and Customs sbates just, as emphatically thab he does nob approve of such a proposal, and regards ib as unnecessary and wholly undesirable. Surely the Committee have a right to expect uni: fornuty of opinion and action from Ministers. It cannot be a mabber for wonder that considerable confusion exists in the Committee when there is such a difference of opinion among Ministers. I had no idea when the Excise Tariff Act was passed thab ib was intended thab in dealing with the production of a cane crop we should go back bo the original planting of the roots. If I were told thab a bonus would apply bo the crops coming from a cerbain bree-and Sugar-cane is really a species of tree- I should expecb ib bo apply bo each crop, and I see no reason why the sugar bonus should nob be so regarded. I agree wibh the honourable member for Wide Bay, and I bhink we should be committing an absolute absurdiby if we did not deal with this mabber in the manner suggested by him. The planters cannot jump aboub from one kind of labour to another, because, if they once embark in the cultivation of a large area by means of white labour, the black labour will go from them, and they will not be able to reverb to ib. We should be led into an absurd position if the proposal of the M in ister were agreed to. Many of the planters have entered into Kanaka labour contracts, which we have specifically recognised under the legislation we have passed. We. know that these agreements extend over a term of years, and that the planters cannot at once get rid of the Kanakas however much some of them may desire to do so. Manj' of them have, no doubt, already debermined that, when the Kanakas can be dispensed wibh, they will avail themselves of the opportunity to claim the bonus given for the production of white-grown sugar. In the meantime, many planters can do nothing but utilize the services of the black labourers whose term of engagement does not expire for some time to come. In some cases planters may have set out their crops one or two years before they are able to get rid of their black labour, and, according to the Minister, when such men desire to come under the provisions of this Act, and employ white labour, they are to be told that they must uproot all the cane that has been planted by means of black labour and starb afresh. Are we bo impose such an absurd condition upon the planters ? If it is held thab the planters have sinned by employing black labour- I do not agree with that view, myself-the sin has been already committed, and there is no reason why the planters should be practically compelled to go on sinning by being precluded from the benefibs offered by our legislation. Mr KiNGSTON.^-The planters need nob uproob their cane, but they cannot expect to get the bonus.",22
108,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,Bu b the planters will have to uproot their plantations if they desire bo comply with the conditions laid down by the Minisber.,22
109,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"Canno t the planters get rid of the black labourer as quickly as he puts in their crops? Mr THOMSON"" - No , they cannot get rid of the Kanakas who are under engagement to them.",22
110,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,But the labourers are going off every year because they have been engaged for terms which expire at different dates.,23
111,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"That all depends upon the size of the plantations and the periods for which they have been under cultivation. If a planter has a large area, which has been gradually brought under cultivation, his labourers will probably have been engaged from time to time as the work has increased. Therefore he may be in a position to gradually substitute white labour for black. W it h smaller men, however, who would probably have engaged the whole of their labourers in one batch, the process of conversion would not be so easy. I see no reason wh}"" the bonus should not be given to the man who takes off his crop from start to finish by means of white labour.",23
112,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,Fro m the planting.,23
113,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,No ; I mean for the whole period occupied in bringing the crop to maturity after the previous crop was gathered. The one planting may suffice for half-a-dozen crops. Would the Minister say that the production of a crop of fruit is to be regarded as commencing with the planting of the trees ?,23
114,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,If you do trees you do not get fruit.,23
115,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"I admit that the crop is the result of the planting of the trees and of the soil in which the trees are planted. But it would be ridiculous to say that a man should be compelled to go back to the planting operation in connection with the production of any one crop out of several crops which the one planting will yield. We should allow those who genuinely desire to employ white labour to obtain the benefits conferred by the Act without compelling them to ""uproot their crops. One planting of cane will last, perhaps, as long as seven years, and several crops may be gathered; and I think, therefore, that the full purpose of Parliament will be served if the crop of cane from one harvesting to the next is handled entirely by white labour. Sometimes from sixteen to 24 months are occupied in maturing a crop of cane. It was astonishing to me to hear the Treasurer pleading so strongly yesterday for something more than I am now advocating. It was the something more that I objected to. I disliked the proposal to give the Minister power year by year to fix the date in such a way that the bonus might be given in respect to crops upon which white labour might have been employed for only three or four months.",23
116,Mr SALMON,NEWSPAPER,Is the honourable member in favour of giving the bonus to those who planted their crops by means of black labour since 19021,23
117,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,I am in favour of any crop which from the previous cutting has been entirely handled by white labour receiving the benefit of the bonus.,23
118,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,That would cover a period of only six months.,23
119,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"No ; crops occupy more than six months in coming to maturity. A little less time may be taken in northern . Queensland; but, in the larger sugar districts, sixteen or eighteen months, or sometimes two years is required.",23
120,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"That is by what is called "" stand over "" cane ",23
121,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,No ; it is planting cane to which the honourable member is referring.,23
122,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"Yes . I am prepared to support the honourable member for Wide Bay in his contention that the bonus should be paid upon any crop that has been wholly not plant cultivated by means of white labour. As to the other proposal of the Minister which is really intended to absolve him from the consequences of a breach of the Act, I need only say that if we come to the conclusion that the bonus is to apply to all cane from the original planting right onwards, that is what we decided long ago, and there is no reason to alter it.",23
123,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER," I do not regard the alteration of the date for registration as practically material, because nothing is material in politics when it is done, and cannot be undone. Whatever may be said with regard to the administration of the Minister for Trade and Customs, Parliament must condone his action. I do not speak on this occasion simply because the sugar growers in my electorate are specially interested in this question. It is generally believed that sugar-growers are rather more selfish than other producers, but the planters in New South Wales, although they had as large a work to perform, in comI parison with the area under cane, as those in Queensland, took advantage of the offer of the Federal Government almost at once. I do not claim any special credit for them, because they had the command of more white labour than could be secured immediately by the growers of Queensland.",23
124,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,That is an open question.,24
125,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"Perhaps so. Further, the Queensland sugar-growers were more hampered by the legal and binding obligations into which they had entered in connection with the employment of coloured labourers. These facts made it more difficult for them to secure immediately the benefits offered under our legislation, and therefore I hope they will be treated fairly and honestly. Some honourable members may have no interest in the sugar industry, but every one on this side of the Chamber is concerned in the intelligent administration of the Government which he supports. We are interested in seeing that the Minister acts in accordance with what we believe to be the spirit and intention of the legislation we have passed, and therefore every man who desires to bring into existence as speedily as possible a white Australia will vote against the Minister for Trade and Customs on this occasion. The honourable member for Herbert acted indiscreetly, although I am sure with perfect honesty, when he stated yesterday that .some dishonest practices had been followed in connection with the sugar rebates. We know that some people who should have known better acted in a %yay that, although perhaps within the law, was morally wrong. That might be a serious charge to make against the administration if it could not be made with equal truth in connection with every law. There has never been a law passed that has not carried in its train the certainty that some one would evade it. AVe are continually amending our laws,- because men succeed in evading their provisions, and the law regarding the sugar rebates has suffered only in the same way. Only a small amount was involved in the frauds, which may be regarded as the natural outcome of the enactment of such legislation. It might have been better if those honourable members who have a full knowledge of the industry had accepted the suggestion made last evening by the honourable member for North Sydney, to make the bonus applicable to the crop; the term crop being subsequently defined by regulation.",24
126,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,NEWSPAPER,B y definition in the Bill .,24
127,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"The right honourable member says- "" B y definition in the Bill . "" To that there can be no objection. The whole matter has originated in a want of political rectitude on the part of the Opposition. I make' that statement because vice discovers kindred vice, and if the Opposition had not been inclined to many acts of evil administration",24
128,The CHAIRMAN,NEWSPAPER,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,24
129,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"B y his ruling, the Chairman says in effect that, to be in order, it is not sufficient for a statement to be true, so I will not discuss that aspect of the case. Under our Constitution, it is presumed that a man who obtains high office in a Government is worthy of public trust. If he be not fit to administer an Act of this description, he is not .fit for his position. This debate had its origin in a declaration by the Opposition that they would not trust any Minister for Trade and Customs to administer the payment of this rebate. But if a Minister is not to be trusted in that respect, how can he be trusted with the control of the vast trade of Australia ? Is a man who might within twelve months make a fortune which would place him beyond any financial danger for the period of his natural lifeand that is the position of any Minister for Trade and Customs-no t to be trusted ? It is much to the honour of the Minister that his pockets are not bubbling over with coin. Similarly it is to the credit of our public men that very few of them have made anything out of politics. ",24
130,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"It is not "" skite."" The honourable member for Maranoa may think it is, because I have employed language which he may not appreciate. My vocabulary does not permit of the use of the word ""skite,"" though I possibly may have a vague idea of what it means. The honourable member for North Sydney was absolutely wrong in his contention, and that is the root of the whole trouble. He knows very well that a man who is fit to control the administration of the Customs Department of Australia, who is honest enough to deal openly and fairly-as I believe every occupant of that office will-wit h the whole trading community, is surely competent",24
131,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,No one has said anything to the contrary.,25
132,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,The honourable' member declared that we should always be careful to incorporate in our laws exactly the procedure intended.,25
133,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"I said that when we could express our meaning we should do so. I was not alluding to the Minister for Trade and Customs in that connection, but to Ministers generally.",25
134,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"The honourable member knows that we cannot put such a provision in our law. We must leave the honest administration of any Act to the Ministerial head of the particular Department concerned. The ramifications of the matter under discussion are so great, and the incidental difficulties so certain to recur year after year, that no one, save a trusted Minister, and one who is fully seized of the whole circumstances of the case, can possibly deal with it.",25
135,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,I'wa s replying to the proposal of the'Treasurer to place certain options in the hands of the Minister. Now the Minister says that he objects to those options.,25
136,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"I quite agree that the Minister for Trade and Customs is a little worse than is the honourable member at this particular juncture. We were able to convert the honourable member last night, but we have to start afresh today with the Minister, for Trade and Customs. With regard to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, I admit at once the difficulties of the situation. When once a cane crop has been placed in the ground, it will last for a considerable period. If that crop has been once touched by black labour, after the date specified in the Excise Tariff Act, it is tabooed for all time.",25
137,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,But the growers have had .full warning given to them.,25
138,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"That is so. But suppose that a man has 100 acres of cane planted, and is employing a certain number of coloured labourers under contract. It may not be possible for him to immediately dispense with their services. Even though he may be anxious to obtain the bonus which is offered, he cannot get rid of them. Therefore we - must either be absolutely unjust to him, even though he desires to subsequently take advantage of the provisions of the Act, or the people of Australia must do a little more than they are legally entitled to do. I believe that, in the interests of a white Australia, it is better that they should go a little further than they are technically bound to rather than delay the opportunity for the employment of white labour. If we do not allow any sugar-grower to participate in the bonus granted under this Bill who has used black labour after the specified date, what will be the result? At the end of 1907 we probably shall have as many coloured aliens working in Queensland as there are today. Of course, a man could deal with an ordinary crop, such as wheat.",25
139,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,O r with beet.,25
140,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"Yes , there would be no trouble in that ""case. There are at least 8,000 Kanakas in Queensland today. If a grower is employing 80 of these Pacific Islanders under contract he is absolutely powerless. I believe that this Parliament desires to be perfectly fair. It might suit me as a New South Welshman to selfishly hamper the Queenslander, but as a representative of the Australian people it is my duty to see that justice is done to the Queensland grower. I believe that the honourable and learned member for Corinella takes up a similar position.",25
141,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,It does not affect my constituency.,25
142,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"I am sure that it does not. When the honourable and learned member appears before his constituents and tells them that he believes it was necessary to grant the Minister certain powers in order to expedite the advent of a white Australia, even though it was certain that some growers might thereby obtain rebate upon some crops which had been previously cultivated by black"" labour, I am sure that they will justify his action. Let me suppose that the honourable and learned mem- . ber was a sugar-grower in Northern Queensland, and had in his employ coloured labour under contract. If next year, or this 'year, he cut ' and trashed his cane with black labour,. so long as that cane lasted he would, under this Bill, be prevented from participating in the bonus offered upon white-grown sugar. Does the honourable and learned member or the Committee desire that ? I grant that, in many instances, the cane crops will be cut by black labour. But I hold that we can fashion this Bill in such a way that, 1 by - reasonably intelligent administration, we can overcome the difficulty thus presented. Let me suppose that some rascal in the north in an electorate other than my own made a claim for the payment of a bonus to which he was not entitled. What does it mean to the people of Australia 1 What would it amount to in any honourable member's electorate? The sum involved would be an infinitesimal one. I am convinced that the desire of the Committee is to insure the Bill being effective. I tell the Minister for Trade and Customs that if it passes in its present form he will be seeking an alteration of its provisions within twelve months, because we shall still have the coloured labour with us, and the reduction cannot be other than gradual. The end in view is not the payment of a small bonus. Our real object is to make it clear to the world that no black labour is to be employed in the production of sugar in Australia. The work in our industries is for our own workmen. If we have to pay a little more to secure that desirable end who will be heard to complain ? I shall vote for the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney. Mr L . E . GROOM - It has been withdrawn.",25
143,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,"I am satisfied that if the honourable member is convinced that it will be supported he will submit it again. Failing the adoption of that proposal, I shall be prepared to accept any period rather than that the door shall be shut in the face of the Northern Queensland sugar growers. I know their troubles, and that flesh and blood are involved in that industry. The abolition of the employment of black labour will be a burden for them; but keep the door open for their regeneration. Every individual possessed of a particle of manhood should make it possible for the sugar planters of Northern Queensland to aid in creating a "" white Australia.""",26
144,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER, I am convinced that the amendment submitted by the Treasurer does not place us in a more forward position than that which we - formerly occupied. Mr L . E . GROOM - It only validates what has been done by the Minister for Trade and Customs.,26
145,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,But I understand that the regulations which have been gazetted were intended to provide'for the cases of fresh applicants for the bonus from year to year.,26
146,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,Onl y up to the specified time.,26
147,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,Does the Minister hold the view that no sugar-grower who is not already registered can take advantage of the provisions of the Bonus Bill 1,26
148,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"No sugar-grower who employs black labour after the 28th February, 1903, can obtain the bonus by substituting white labour upon the same cane.",26
149,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,He is shut out for all time.,26
150,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"No ; but he cannot par-. ticipate in the payment of the bonus in respect, of that CEtne.",26
151,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,I do not think that was the intention of honourable members when the Excise Tariff Act or the Pacific Islands Labourers Act was under consideration.,26
152,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"Yes . I will prove that point by quoting from a speech whish was delivered on 11th of February, 1902.",26
153,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,There was a date fixed in 1902.,26
154,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,There was a date fixed subsequent to the 28th February of that year.,26
155,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,"The honourable and learned member refers to a date after which advantage could be taken of the bonus provided - It was never suggested that planters who desired to substitute white for black labour subsequent to 1902, and who employed coloured labour for two or three years, say, up to 1904, should be ineligible to claim the rebate.",26
156,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"The Minister for Trade and Customs put the matter very clearly, as will be seen by reference to Eansa/rd.",26
157,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,"That never entered my mind, and I listened attentively to the whole discussion. I never thought for one moment that a planter who employed black labour during 1902, and who, when the conditions under which he was compelled to use that labour ceased to operate, substituted white labour, would be debarred from taking advantage of the rebate. I always understood that the regulations were simply provided to enable planters to come under the provisions from year to year - but now we are told that they are debarred unless they are practically registered as growers of sugar with white labour prior to February, 1903.",26
158,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"They need not necessarily be registered, but they must be growers with white labour.",26
159,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,"I understand the contention to be that, if they do not come under the provisions of the Bill by that date, they cannot take advantage of the rebate at any subsequent period.",27
160,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,Not while the old roots last.,27
161,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,The roots will last beyond the period of 1907.,27
162,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"All roots, however planted, are clear up to the 1st March, 1903.",27
163,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,I do not think it was ever contemplated that such conditions would be imposed.,27
164,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,Yes ; that was specially mentioned.',27
165,Mr MCCAY,NEWSPAPER,"I understand the roots are safe to the 1st March, 1903, and-that only the subsequent planting of fresh roots by black labour would debar growers from the advantage of the bonus.",27
166,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,"The planting of roots subsequent to February, 1903, may perhaps be on!}' a minor matter.",27
167,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"Supposin g a Kanaka be employed today on any cane, that cane cannot under any circumstances earn the bonus under the Bill .",27
168,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,"Supposing black labour is employed during the seasonsof 1903 and 1904 on cane planted' prior to 1903, and that in 1904 the planter, by reason of the expiration of the contract with the Kanakas, proposes to utilize 'White labour, is he to be debarred from taking advantage of the bonus?",27
169,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,He is so debarred under this Bill .,27
170,Mr KENNEDY,NEWSPAPER,"I do not think that was ever contemplated. Planters have contracts with black labourers, and when the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill was before us, an extension for a considerable number of years was provided, in order to allow those contracts to expire. I can quite understand that for many reasons planters could not dispense satisfactorily with Kanaka labour while those contracts existed; but it was never argued that planters so circumstanced should be denied privileges granted to other planters. I still adhere to the idea which I put forward yesterday, and which has been elaborated by the honourable member for North Sydney today, that, provided ali the business of cultivation of one season's crop, and the cutting and carrying to the mill, be done by white labour, the bonus should be paid. It is simply [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bonus Bill. making an absurdity of the Bill if we exclude from its advantages planters who are - compelled to retain black labour for some time after 1903, but who, when circumstances permit, propose to have their work done by white labour.",27
171,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER," When I referred to the danger of making an alteration in the legislation already passed, I referred to two other Acts closely allied. I find, on reference to Mansard, that the Prime Minister, in speaking on the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill, said. . . . that the question of the treatment of the sugar industry was so closely interwoven with the fiscal question that I could not ask honourable members to go on to debate a Bill which dealt, however . com prehensively, with only one part of the questou, and that I must ask them to suspend their judgment until they knew what the Tariff provisions were, as well as the proposals with regard to the employment of Kanakas. . . . Therefore I ask honourable members to form their own judgment upon what I shall lay before them, and to form their own judgment upon this Bill with only one reservation - namely, that the Bill stands not alone, but the Bill and the support to the industry which must inevitably be given by the Tariff must be taken and must be read together. I read this extract in order to show that the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill was incorporated with the Excise Tariff Act ; and when we find three other measures were also involved, I do not think it right on the part of Parliament to attempt to make any alteration in the arrangement then entered into. The Bonus Bill ought to be simply what it was intended to be in the first place-merel y an alteration in the method of paying the excise; and it would be far better, no matter what the views of honourable members may be, to keep to the original arrangement. Some honourable members have stated that it was not the intention of this House at the time that there should be any such difference as has now been made'; and I need only refer to the honourable member for Herbert, who, in speaking on the Tariff in February, 1902, saidThe Minister for Trade and Customs has already affirmed the principle that after this month there will be no possibility oE its being increased to any great extent. He has said that those desiring to grow cane by white labour only must register this month, and that if they do not they will not be entitled to claim a rebate.",27
172,Mr EJNOSTON,NEWSPAPER,That is not quite so-if they Start fresh.,27
173,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,For this 3'ear.,27
174,Mr KTNCSTOX,NEWSPAPER,Certainly .,27
175,Sir GEORGE TURNER,NEWSPAPER,Do ' the last interjections not alter the whole effect ?,28
176,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"I think not. The honourable member, continuing, saidThat was the impression conveyed to me by the Minister, and I am pleased to hear that he does not adhere to that opinion. My reading of those extracts is that the Minister for Trade and Customs stated then to the crops. what he states now-that it was not his intention, except where the planting-whic is the most important pari of the workwas done by white labour, to allow the rebate. We are not proposing to interfere with people who choose to employ black labour; we only say that if the cane has not been planted by white labour the bonus cannot be claimed. The honourable member for Herbert will bear me out that the chief the cane. work lies in the planting, and that some time has to elapse before there is any return, planting. so that there are many reasons why a rebate of £ 2 per ton should be asked for. If it had been proposed that a bonus should be given merely on the growing crop, I am sure it would not have been fixed at £ 2 per ton, or at 4s. per ton of cane, the latter which actually amounts to more than cost of cultivating, cutting, and crushing.",28
177,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,Does the honourable and learned member really believe that ?,28
178,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"The honourable member for Richmond knows that it does not cost £ 2 per acre, taking the average yield ten tons of cane, to pay the cost of the I have indicated.",28
179,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,What does it cost to the cane only ? Mi'. CONROY - I have known it to as much as 5s. and as little as 2s.,28
180,Mr EWING,NEWSPAPER,What is the average t,28
181,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"That depends upon the crop. I have known 70 tons of cane to acre, and in other cases only 15 tons, and surely the latter would the same rate as the former. My statements in these respects are borne by the statistics of Mr Coghlan. During the Tariff debate, in February, 1902, the Minister for Trade and Customs saidIt is difficult to differentiate in regard ditions, and ascertain whether black labour been employed. We solve the question as liberally as we can, and say- "" Go on ; there the rebate after bhis time, and so long as rid of the black labour before the Isb March, will be equally entitled to it ; we shall againsb you whab you have done in the transition stage."" two The right honourable gentleman had previously saidWhat we say to a grower is- -"" If you do not 1 employ black labour after the 28th February, we will nob coitnb the employment of black labour before that date againsb you in considering the question of rebate.""",28
182,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,I thought that referred,28
183,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"No ; taken in conjunch tion with what he said to the honourable member for Herbert, it is clear that the Minister for Trade and Customs meant that if the planters started afresh they were entitled to the rebate, and he says so now.",28
184,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,When ?,28
185,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,On the production of,28
186,Mr CAMERON,NEWSPAPER,That must include the,28
187,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"Quite so, or otherwise the bonus would not have been as high as £2 per ton. The period is extended to the 2Sth of February of this year, and if white labour then is substituted for black labour, of it is contended that the planter in the case the of crops, the cutting of which may even now have started, shall be paid the bonus although white labour will be utilized for only some four months 1 If the proposed alteration is made, such a state of things would be possible ; and this shows the undesirability of departing from the original at compact. The Pacific Islands Labourers work Act, the Excise Tariff Act, and this Bonus 1 Bill are all interwoven, and no one cut of them should be altered unless honourable members are given an opporcost tunity of dealing with the remainder. It is impossible to say exactly what influenced honourable, members in supporting those measures, but, as they were passed as the a whole, no one of them should be amended without an opportunity being given to renot be cut at consider the others ",28
188,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,Does the honourable memout ber believe in ploughing out ?,28
189,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,No ; bub I do not believe in a man who has not grown his cane wholly with white labour getting a bonus of £ 2 to conper ton for it. The statement of the M i nhas ister for Trade and Customs in regard to is the provision in the Excise Tariff Act was you geb clear and emphatic. He said that no grower you would be entitled to a bonus unless he emnot cast ployed white labour only after the date i therein specified. Mr A. PATERSOX - What are the who have lost all their Kanakas to do in regard to the next crop 1,28
190,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,"It may be that no provision \jraa made to meet' their case. It seems to be forgotten, however, that there is a difference of £ 3 per ton between the excise and import duties on sugar. In one year the production of sugar in Queensland reached .194,000 tons, but, taking the average production at 120,000 tons, that difference means a loss of £360,000 a year to the Commonwealth. If the payment of such a sum annually does not offer sufficient inducement for the employment of white labour only in the cane-fields, it is almost a pity that we have any rich sugar lands at all. We should be better off if the land was barren, because then we should not have to pay the planters the .amount I have named. Even if I were a supporter of the Ministry, I should oppose any amendment of the measure in the manner suggested. All we were asked to do when the Bill . was introduced was to agree to the substitution of one manner of payment for another. .Had I known, when the second reading was moved, that the alteration now suggested would be proposed, I would have raised the question then, and no doubt there would hove been a long discussion upon it. The position would be different if the Ministry came forward and said- "" The Minister for Trade and Customs, who does not allow any one else to make a mistake without fining him for it, has made a mistake himself, and as certain men have been misled by that mistake, and have altered their methods of cultivation, we ask honourable members to agree to an alteration of the original arrangement."" But, even in that case, I should have opposed the alteration. I ask if it is fair that growers who from the first have employed white labour only, in order to obtain the concession granted by the Excise Tariff Act, should now' be put on the same footing as those who have hitherto utilized black labour? I cannot conceive of anything more unfair. The Ministry are fast becomingadvocates for theemployment of black labour. They virtually tell the House that they intend to take advantage of their majority to place growers who employ black labour upon a level with those' who employ white labour only. If we agree to the proposed alteration of the compact contained in the measures to which I have alluded, our action may in some future Parliament be planters taken as a precedent. 1 know that the protectionist party do not want to see any alteration of the Tariff / and, no' doubt, if it were proposed to alter the sugar duties, the members of that party would say that we should not break a compact which was solemnly entered into by members on both sides of the House. But the force of that argument would disappear if it could be shown that an alteration was made in the compact by the very Parliament whose members passed the Acts originally creating it. I hope that no change will be made.",29
191,Mr GB EDWARDS,NEWSPAPER,"South Sydney). - The Government, are undoubtedly to blame for .this lengthy discussion, because of the manner in which they have brought the subject before us. 'The Minister forTradeandCustomsseemstohave been very much in the dark about the whole question from the very first. Last night the Treasurer pleaded hard with the Committee to empower the Minister to fix a date each year after which only white labour could be employed in the production of sugar-cane entitled to a bonus. H is proposed amendment practically empowered the Government, as was pointed but by the honourable member for North Sydney and others, to grant bonuses to growers who employed white labour for only a few months in the production of a crop. But that was not the original intention of Parliament, nor was it the desire of the people. Now, however, the Minister for Trade and Customs takes a different attitude, and telis us that he will not depart from the original arrangement, beyond altering the date specified in the Excise Tariff Act to the 28th February, 1903. The Act 'fixed the date as the 28th February, 1902, and the Minister issued a regulation which was ultra vires, altering it to the 28th February, 1903. Now he tells us, in a perfectly nonchalant manner, that the mistake was a mere nothing, and that he was not aware that he was acting ultra vires. What should we say to him for such a confession, after his attitude towards the public in connection - with the mistakes which have occurred under the administration of another A ct ? Shall we tell him, as he has told others,.that he had a right to know what was in the Act, and should not make mistakes ? That if the officers of his department are not competent to advise him better, he should employ men who are competent ? That he should not sweat his officers or use boys ' in knickerbockers who might be expected to make mistakes, but should avail himself 'of the services of men who are sufficiently well paid to be able to perform the work required of them '(If no excuse could be made for the mistakes which have been committed by others in connection with the administration of the Customs Act, what excuse can be made for the Minister in this instance ? It only shows how fallible - human nature is. The question with which we have to deal is, how far shall we go in offering inducements to planters to abandon black labour and to use white labour 1 I am willing, as I have been from the first, to make considerable concessions to effect that object. I still think that we should give all the inducement and assistance we can to planters to secure the substitution of white for black labour. But having thought the matter over very carefully, I cannot offer anything better than the suggestion which I made last night for an amendment of the clause, providing that a planter who intends to apply for a bonus shall register his intention twelve months before. That would give the Department an opportunity to instruct its officers to watch his plantation to see that no black labour is employed o n ' it . If a man does' not register, the Department is not asked to exercise any supervision, but whenever a planter registers he will intimate to the Department that for twelve months before the delivery of his crop he intends to use white labour only, and its officers will then have to see that he carries out his promise. From what I have learned about the cultivation of sugar cane, the season during which the cane is cut lasts for five or six months-fro m July to December. If we adopt the crop to crop principle, we shall extend the period, which might range from six to perhaps eighteen months. B y accepting the twelve months' period, however, we shall call upon the planters who have decided to employ white labour to register, and then the organization of the Department will be brought into operation, and safeguards may be taken against any evasion of the Act. .1 hope that honourable members will show that they are ready to afford every opportunity to the planters to effect the change from black to white labour, and that they will frame the necessary provisions in a liberal spirit. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa said that some planters had given up black labour and had employed nothing but white labour from 'the very outset, and that, therefore, it would be unjust to such men to offer special facilities to those who had delayed making the change. But those who gave up black labour immediately our legislation came into force were, in 99 cases out of 100, in such a position that they could get along with white labour as well as with black. That applies very largely to the New South Wales planters, who had not entered into any contracts for the supply of black labour, and did not require to keep the Kanakas for any specified time. As we go further north the black labour trouble is intensified, as was well known to honourable members when the Bills relating to the employment of Kanaka labour upon the sugar plantations were under discussion. We knew then thab many of the planters had entered into contracts for the employment of Kanaka labourers in numbers varying from perhaps ten to 200 or 300, and that they could not get rid of them for some considerable time, the unexpired period of engagement ranging from perhaps six months to three years. As our object is to replace black labour with white as soon as possible,' I think we should allow planters, whenever their contracts for black labour expire, to take advantage of the inducements offered for the employment of white labour. If we make it necessary for planters to register when they desire to start the employment of white labour, and we at the same time prevent them from obtaining a bonus until twelve months after the date of registration, we shall provide all the necessary safeguards. I can see no reason why, if a man has planted his fields with black labour and has tilled them with black labour, we should say to him "" No ; you must plough out all you have done, and plant over again."" That would involve a needless and wasteful destruction of national wealth. In dealing with this very difficult matter of policy, I think we can afford to treat with justice, if not with liberality, those planters who are willing under the policy we have adopted to get rid of the Kanakas at the earliest possible moment.",29
192,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER," In discussing this question last night, I said I would adhere closely to clause 2 as it was then printed. I meant to include the regulation under which the time had been extended until the 1st March, 1903. I had no desire to nullify anything done in that regard. As I was instrumental in bringing about that extension under the regulations, I should have stultified myself if I had taken up any other attitude. The honourable member for Richmond has taken some credit to himself for being able to speak from a disinterested point of view. I stand in an even stronger position than does the honourable member in that regard, because I represent the whole of the North Queensland sugar districts. I think that the electors in my district are more interested than are the sugar planters in the northern districts of New South Wales; therefore the attitude I take up is simply and solely in support of the white Australia policy. I think that, perhaps, the honourable and learned member for Werriwa was right when he stated that the regulations adopted in the first instance should have been adhered to. At that time, however, I thought some extension should have been granted, and one that was conceded from the 28th February to 31st March, 1902, was subsequently extended to the following September, and again until March of this year. Therefore every opportunity has been given to those who wished to avail themselves of the provisions of the Act. Mr KINGSTON' - That extension was more as regards the registration of claims. It was not an extension of the period for employing black labour, but an extension of the time for registrations.",30
193,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,"Exactly. When Federal legislation was contemplated in regard to the employment of Kanakas in Queensland, a number of planters immediately sent away to the islands, and obtained all the recruits they could absorb, their object being to render nugatory, as far as possible, the legislation passed by us. Many of the planters considered they were very smart, but now they are sorry, because they say it is difficult to get rid of their black labour. It has been stated that this position was never contemplated when the Act was passed, but the contrary may be proved by a reference to Hansard, because provision was made that Kanakas might be retained upon one part of a plantation, whilst another portion was being worked by white labour. The argument to which I have referred was raised in opposition to what was considered a drastic regulation, and it was then stated that the division of the plantations would be allowed. As a matter of fact, a number of plantations are being worked partly by white labour and partly by black labour, the operations of each class of labour being restricted to different portions of the same plantation. A number of the Kanakas now working on the plantations of Queensland were got rid of by their original employers, but they have remained there for many years and have been re-engaged. The Polynesian Labourers Act provides that when the Kanakas have served for three years they may be re-engaged for a period of not less than six months, but many of the islanders who now find employment on the plantations are not under any engagement. This is in violation of the State Acts, because, with the exception of 600 or 700 to whom exemption tickets were granted, all of them should be under engagement to some one occupied in tropical agriculture. As a matter of fact, some of the planters have done everything they could to defeat the object of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act. If we adopt .the proposal to grant the bonus for cane produced by white labour employed for the whole of any season- I am not speaking about the proposal to fix a period of twelve months-it will be possible for planters to carry on their work with Kanakas right up to the cutting of the cane and then register, employing white labour for the canecutting. It would be possible for the same planter to again revert to black labour, and once more register his plantation under the Act. The weakness of that proposal lies in the fact that it contains no provision that a man who once registers as an employer of white labour, and afterwards reverts to black labour, shall not be allowed to again register so that he may become entitled to the bonus.",31
194,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,That would not apply if a twelve months' period were fixed.,31
195,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,"Yes it would. If the twelve months' period is adopteda stipulation should be made that in all cases where black labour has been reverted to the planter shall not be allowed to again register as an employer of white labour. If the Minister is willing to accept a suggestion of that kind I shall not oppose the adoption of the twelve months' period, although, if the Committee divides, I shall certainly support the clause as it stands. I do not know whether the honourable member for Wide Bay has been approached by the fanners in his dis' tricb, but the question of affording further facilities for claiming the rebate has never been raised in my electorate. The farmers there were perfectly satisfied. In the first place they did not expect any bonus, and in the second place they did not expect an extension of the time for nearly thirteen months. That came to them as something in the shape of a boon that was never contemplated. them to understand, when I interceded on their behalf - with the Minister, that I would not do so upon any future occasion, and I think it will be a mistake for the Government to go any further. . The position taken up by the opponents of the clause appear to me somewhat illogical. They say that some of the planters cannot get rid of their Kanakas, but if all the planters registered, what would become of the Kanakas ? As a matter of fact, many of the Kanakas have expressed a desire to be sent back to the islands, and I believe the Queensland Government is willing to allow their agreements to be cancelled if the Kanakas and employers are alike agreeable, but the planters have stood in the way. They have obstructed the operation of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act all the time. One notable instance of this is to be found in the case of the Mulgrave Central Mill, the capital outlay in connection with which was met by the Government. At the time the Pacific Islands Labourers Act was passing through this House, the 'proprietors of the mill indented 250 boys, and are now, in contravention of the State Act, hiring them out to the farmers in the district. This was done with the intention of obstructing the white Australian movementas far as possible. I do not think that I need say any more upon this question. If the Government accept the amendment which the honourable member for North Sydney has outlined, I shall not oppose it. Ab the same time. I certainly think that a good deal of consideration is required before it is accepted. To my mind, its adoption will be tantamount to taking a step in the dark, and, upon the whole, I think it would be better if the clause were accepted with the extension to 1903 proposed by the Treasurer.",31
196,Mr WILKINSON,NEWSPAPER," I should not have spoken upon this matter but for the remarks of the honourable member for Herbert. It seems to me that he is inclined to punish those who are endeavouring to carry out the desire of the people to secure a white Australia. Ib would be very hard indeed if persons who are loyally assisting in the accomplishment of that great object are to be punished because those interested in the Mulgrave Central M ill , and others, who for 20 or 30 years past have been strenuously opposed to that policy, are to be allowed to defeat it. A good deal has been said by the honourable I gave and learned member for Werriwa in favour of the payment of the bonus being limited to cane which has not been handled by other than white labour since 28th February, 1902. I think that his arguments in that connection have been well refuted by the honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Richmond, and the honourable member for Wide Bay, and their contentions have not been confounded by the quotations made from the speech delivered by the Minister for Trade and Customs last session, in which he informed the House that, after the date mentioned, the rebate should be payable only upon sugar which had been grown by white labour from the commencement. The point in dispute is as to what constitutes that commencement. Are we to regard it as the period when-afte r the harvesting of one cropthe next crop shows above the ground, or are we to calculate it from the planting of the cane ? I hold that the contention of the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Richmond is correct, and that the beginning of the production of a crop, so far as the provisions of this Act are concerned",32
197,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,Can the honourable member plant a crop of cane in cleared ground for less than £ 5 per acre ?,32
198,Mr WILKINSON,NEWSPAPER,"The contention of those who are opposed to the employment of white labour on the Queensland sugar plantations has always been that the work, which the honourable and learned member for Werriwa declares constitutes the great bulk of the labour there can be doneby white men. The opponents of the adoption of a white Australia policy have ever argued that white men could plough the land and plant the cane, but that when ib grew up into a jungle and the breezes were shut out from it white labour was unsuitable. But the little experience which we have had of the opera- tion of the Excise Tariff Act demonstrates that white men have gone into the cane, cut it, and earned the rebate for the planters. We shall be doing an injustice to growers who are employing Kanakas under contract for a term of years if we prevent them from participating in the payment of the bonus proposed under this Bill . In the position occupied by some of them, they are unable to get rid of the Kanakas, although they may be very willing to take advantage of the provisions of the Act at a later stage.",32
199,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,The honourable member desires to give them a bonus for the employment of black labour when there is no occasion for it.,33
200,Mr WILKINSON,NEWSPAPER,"The honourable and learned member for Werriwa is distorting the facts. The honourable member for Richmond put the position very fairly. Let us take the case of a man who employed black labour for two years prior to the passing of the Excise Tariff Act. In the firm belief that the industry cannot be carried on without the aid of black labour, he may have sold his plantation to an individual who entertains quite an opposite belief. The latter may evidence his belief by employing white labour only from the moment that he assumes control of the plantation. Is it fair to shut him out from the bonus provisions of this Bill ? The feeling of the House at the time the antialien legislation was under consideration was that there should be a gradual change in the conditions offered to the sugarplanters. It was known that under the Polynesian Labourers Act of Queensland, the engagements of the Kanakas would not terminate for a number of years. Con-' sequently we allowed a certain proportion of those who were deported from the Commonwealth to be re-introduced up till 1904. From that period onward, no more are to be permitted to enter the Commonwealth, and after 1906, those who can be deported without cruelty or injustice are to be sodeported. show clearly that the Legislature contemplated bringing about the new conditions without inflicting hardship upon the Kanakas and without doing injury to the industry itself. I do not think that any honourable member has a higher opinion of the desire of the Minister for Trade and Customs to do justice to every industry in Australia than I have, but at the same time he seems to me to be not acting generously in this matter. Having regard to the great object to be achieved, namely, the cultivation of sugar by white labour only, I shall be obliged to support an amendment on the lines of that suggested by the honourable member, for North Svdney.",33
201,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER," May I ask the Treasurer as an act of courtesy to withdraw his amendment, in order that I may move a prior one ?",33
202,Sir GEORGE TURNER,NEWSPAPER,"Certainly . Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",33
203,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER," I move That, after the word "" employed,"" line 4, subclause (2), the following words be inserted:- "" For a period of twelve months immediately preceding the delivery thereof for manufacture."" I think that this proposal will overcome the difficulties which have been pointed out by honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber. It will get rid of the absurdity of requiring cane to be rooted up for no earthly reason whatever. It will also offer an inducement to the planters to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill so soon as their present engagements with the Kanakas permit. Further, it will definitely settle the intentions of Parliament so that there will be no necessity for the framing of regulations antagonistic to the measure, in order to effect what the Minister thinks is desirable. For these reasons and for others which have been given during the course of the debate, I hold that it would be onty fair and just to allow .planters who are anxious to fulfil the conditions which we impose an opportunity of doing so. Surely we are not going to make the mere touching of sugar cane by black labour at some previous period a bar to a bonus upon every crop from that root. Such a proceeding would be ridiculous. It would constitute an injustice to the growers, besides tending to discourage them. In some instances the roots of the cane have necessarily""been planted by black labour, and under the Government proposal, These facts to enable the grower to claim the bonus, he would have to deliberately destroy those roots-destro y the value attached to previous planting, simply to replant.",33
204,Mr CAMERON,NEWSPAPER,For the sake of getting the bonus.,33
205,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,Yes .,33
206,Mr CAMERON,NEWSPAPER,But - the Excise Tariff Act was passed subsequent to the planting.,33
207,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"I agree with the honourable member that there should be no alteration in the Act. If there is to be no alteration, it is undesirable to re-open a question which has previously been settled. But when an alteration is proposed-as it has been-w e should see that a reasonable and fair provision is' substituted and that an amendment is not made which is less satisfactory than the amendment that is now submitted. The honourable member for Herbert has said that he is quite willing to accept that amendment as a compromise. That honourable member represents a northern sugar district, and he, together with the honourable member for Wide Bay and other representatives of Queensland, have spoken in favour of the amendment. The same remark may be made of the honoraole member for Richmond, who also represents a sugar district, and I think there are other honourable members who, like myself, are not, as members, interested in this industry, but who see reason, when we are making an alteration, of doing what is fair and reasonable, so as not to prejudice the intention of the Act we are seeking to amend.",33
208,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER," I trust the amendment will not be carried. I have listened with a good deal of interest to what has been said, especially to what has fallen from the honourable member for Herbert. I speak in some degree from my own experience recently when I say that an alteration of the basis of the payment of the rebate is not to any extent expected or desired by the people of Queensland. I venture to think that the House of Representatives has already dealt very generously with Queensland in the matter of the sugar rebate ; and I am not speaking without my book, because, time and again, I have been thanked for the action of the Government in this respect. As to the fixing of the amounts to be allowed per ton of cane, and as to the latest concession to which I referred, I say that the Government have fully anticipated the wishes of Queensland. Let us keep to the basis of the purchase of a white Australia. There is a good deal to be said in favour of that position. We dealt with this matter comprehensively in the earlier stages of our Federal history, when we had before us the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill, and we dealt with each measure separately, but with each from the point of view of the other. Is it fair, when a Bill is introduced simply for the purpose of taking the money from another source, and removing a slight disability to which 3o the States were previously subject-bu t which was fixed plainly enough-to ask that the basis should be further altered to the detriment of other States which were parties to the bargain ? - Mr THOMSON - That is what the Minister himself is asking for.",34
209,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"Surely not. The Government are asking that the B i U as amended in-the way we have indicated may be passed ; and to seize this opportunity for altering the basis is not, in my opinion, fair. We provided as clearly as possible that the way in which to earn the bonus was to employ white labour from the very first. We had the regulation before us long ago, and it provides in the clearest possible language that white-grown cane means cane, in respect of which white labour has been employed from and including the preparation of the ground for planting, up to and including the delivery at the mill for manufacture. Honourable members know perfectly well a - that the understanding was that black labour must have nothing to do with the cane wherever it was possible to dispense with it. We simply made an express provision which we believed to be fair and right under existing conditions. We were legislating in 1901 for something to happen in 1902, and-we told the planters that so long as they did not employ black labour after Eebruary or March, 1902, they could earn the rebate. We have now extended the period to 1903.",34
210,Mr CAMERON,NEWSPAPER,The Government were wrong in doing that.,34
211,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"I think the action then taken was justified, there being .a number of hard cases in which it was represented there had been no time to make arrangements. When the honourable member for North Sydney talks about it being necessary to up-root cane planted by black labour, he knows well that if the Bill be carried in the form proposed by the Government, not one root planted prior to March last will be affected. All such cane is protected, and in respect of it a rebate can be earned. What more is wanted? It is only in regard to cane which has been planted within the last three months, or since March last, that the Bill does not make provision for a bonus. If a planter has not employed black labour during the last three months he is qualified to earn the bonus, so that there is not the slightest necessity to talk about uprooting the cane. It is admitted that the great cost is in connection with the preparation of the ground for tilling and planting-that the cost of cutting and carbing at the annual harvesting is comparatively small. I do not care to remind honourable' members of utterances on the other side, but it was poinbed out by the'honourable and learned'member for Parkes-and I know his words are sufficiently well founded-that the cost of the harvesting is little comparedwith the initial .cost.",34
212,Mr THOMSON,NEWSPAPER,"What does the Minister call the ""initial cost?""",35
213,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,"The cost of preparing the ground for the tilling and planting of the cane. The resulb of the proposed amendment, if carried, will be .that instead of having white labour, employed, as we desire, on the most important part of the work-that of the planting, with which it is not disputed white labour is perfectly competent to deal-w e shall have black labour, and the planter at his own sweet will and pleasure, when little or nothing remains to be done, will substitute white men and collect the bonus. There is no question of liberality involved now ; the people of Queensland admit that 'the Government have been liberal, and they desire no more. Let us now be just and pay some attention to the requirements of the other States. The Government are proposing what is fairly justified by the circumstances. B y the provisions of the Excise Bill it was found that the cost was falling on the consuming States; and we are now baking the burden on ourselves willingly and freely enough, and. Queensland does not demand any further concessions. Of course it is difficult for some honourable members to resist voting for the amendment, but, as I say, the generosity to Queensland has. surely gone far enough. Let us be just to other States, and not depart from the principle of the Bill . If we do make the departure proposed, it will be possible for a planter to have black labour today and white labour tomorrow ; and where is the consistency of such a position ? The amendment proposes a change from a sj'stem which can be defended, and under which white labour is necessary from the first to the last-with , merely the exceptions rendered necessary by existing circumstances, and inseparable from the initiatory stages-to a system of a hybrid character, which I hope will not be accepted.",35
214,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER," There is no doubt that the Government, and especially the Minister for Trade and Customs, have been thanked for the action taken by them in reference to the sugar industry in Queensland and New South Wales. The honourable member for Herbert this afternoon said that the large planters in Queensland expected nothing and got something; but that is no reason, or at any rate not a good reason, for our doing something which would militate against the purpose we have in view, f am sure the wish of every one here is to promote the settlement of white men where black men are now employed, and I submit respectfully to the Minister that his proposal does not facilitate that change in the way that the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney would do. I rather regret the last sentence or two of the Minister - for Trade and Customs, who in them conveyed the - idea that the rest of Australia is doing a great thing for Queensland. We ought to remember that QueensT land, knowing that it would lose a good deal, generously came into the Commonwealth.",35
215,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,All I can say is that we are losing a good deal by this sugar business.,35
216,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"As to the preparation of the ground, it ought to be known that it is against the State law of Queensland for Kanakas.to plough land.",35
217,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,A good many things are done against the law.,35
218,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"That may be; but, at any rate, the argument about the ploughing of the land falls to the ground. I am not in the least influenced by the strenuous and bitter opposition of the big planters; my object is to carry out what I believe to be a sound policy. If the wishes of Parliament are carried out the planters must substitute white labour for black, and the contention is that to this end planters ought to be allowed to qualify for the bonus from year to year. I am not in favour of any labour or capital in the land being destroyed for a mere sentimental reason; and I am sorry that the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Cameron, should suggest that roots planted by black labour should be uprooted and planted afresh by white labour.",35
219,Mr CAMERON,NEWSPAPER,I never made that suggestion ; I merely said that the planters must stand by what they had done.,35
220,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"It is quite evident that all honourable members had not the same idea in their minds when the original Act was passed. It never occurred to me that we were providing permanently that all registration should be made by the 28th February, 1902. I regard it as absurd to provide that all' those who intend to earn the bonus should be required to register by that time.",36
221,Mr WATSON,NEWSPAPER,"Exceptin g those who had - cultivated cane from the jump by white labour-that is, had started fresh planting in the old plantations.",36
222,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"That brings us back to the old point, that the roots must be pulled out and planting commenced de novo.",36
223,Mr CAMERON,NEWSPAPER,All cane planted prior to the date mentioned is exempt.,36
224,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"But the planting does not cover the whole difficulty. If a single Kanaka has been employed on or about the cane, the planter can receive no bonus; and there are large plantations in Northern Queensland where there is no cane grown by white labour.",36
225,Mr BAMFORD,NEWSPAPER,And there never will be j the planters will get Chinamen as soon as the Kanakas go.,36
226,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,There should be no coloured labour at all if the Commonwealth law be carried out. It is for that reason that the larger plantations should have the opportunity to begin to earn the bonus by employing white labour at the earliest moment they think convenient. What injury will be done to the Commonwealth by allowing them a bonus for cultivating and delivering for manufacture a crop grown absolutely by white labour ?,36
227,Mr KINGSTON,NEWSPAPER,They do not earn a bonus offered as an inducement for employing white labour if they employ black labour.,36
228,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"The point the Minister relies upon is that black labour may have been employed to plant the crop-that, to speak, there is a small proportion of black labour in the roots. It would be a pity if this legislation, which I believe to be sound and generous, were partially destroyed by a blunder now. I hope, therefore, the Committee will vote for the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney. 3 u i",36
229,Mr WATSON,NEWSPAPER,And vary a compromise which was arrived at only a few months ago!,36
230,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"As I said before, honourable members have different facts in their minds. It never occurred to those who know something about sugar-growing that all cane-growers could register before 28th February, 1902.",36
231,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER,Then the honourable member would not object to the amendment at some future time of the other two Acts which were passed in conformity with it.,36
232,Mr FISHER,NEWSPAPER,"I know that the honourable and learned member will follow whatever course he thinks is high policy, irrespective of the possibility of interfering with a compact. I do not lean heavily upon any understanding or compromise which may besaid to have been arrived at. I advocate the adoption of a course which I believe to be a just one, and which will do no injury bp the Commonwealth. If honourable members who represent other States fear that too much will have to be spent in bonuses, they should say so; but I do not believe that the great body of electors object to pay the price required to carry out the white Australia idea. What they are anxious for is that the carrying out of that idea shall not be endangered by the employment of a large body of Kanakas in any State. I am not one of those who say that the employment of white labour will make sugar cheaper. Sugar growing is not an industry in which any man can make a fortune. A great many of those who have embarked in it have lost fortunes, and those now in it have to face difficulties as formidable as those which confront persons in any other industry. While I have a great regard for. the opinions of the Minister, I firmly believe that in this instance my views are better than his, and I hope that the amendment will be carried.",36
233,Mr CONROY,NEWSPAPER," The difficulty I see is this : If the Ministry stand so by their Bill , and merely provide for the substitution of a bonus for a rebate, I shall support them, and vote against the amendment. Bub if they are willing to depart from the sound position that no alteration that at all should be made, I am placed between two fires. One honourable member has estimated that at least 30,000 acres may be affected by an alteration such as that which has been proposed by the Government, and the Treasurer estimates that the area will not be less than 10,000 acres. Rut, taking it ab 20,000 acres, the Government alteration will cosb the country at least £40,000. The financial side of this question has not been put before us. The Ministry are charged with the task of seeing thab the expenditure of the Commonwealth is kept as low as possible; but now they are proposing an alteration in the law which they admit will increase their expenditure by £10,000, and may increase it by £40,000, and even by as much as £60,000. That is a very serious matter. The reasons given by the Minister for Trade and Customs why the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney should not be accepted were extremely sound, though they tell quite as strongly against his own proposal, and we cannot consider him so stupid as not to know that. But while I am opposed to any alteration, I think that if an alteration is made, the whole matter must be fully reconsidered. Therefore, although, if the Government are prepared to stand by the Bill as it was introduced, I shall vote against the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney, I shall feel compelled, if an altera- Mauger, S. tion is to be made in any case, bo vobe for that amendment. Because ib must be .remembered that after 1904 the importation of Kanakas must cease; and many of the planters will then be compelled to employ white labour because they will be unable to obtain black labour. It would be rather hard, therefore, if no provision were made for them. If an alteration is to be made, extending the period within which a bonus can be obtained, at a cost to the Commonwealth of at least £10,000, and possibly of £40,000 or even £60,000, we might as well agree to an alteration which would deal with the whole case, and adopt the amendmenb of the honourable member for North Sydney. But despite the fact thab that amendment would meeb the case if the matter had to be opened up again, I would rather see things left as they are. Still if the Government are determined to extend the period fixed in the Excise Tariff Act, I shall feel bound to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. JUDICIARY BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 16th June, vide page 967) : Clause 31In addition to the matters in respect whereof - original jurisdiction is conferred on the High Court by the Constitution, the Court shall have original jurisdiction in respect of all matters(a) arising under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation ; (6) arising under any laws made by the Parliament ; (c) of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; (d) relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. Provided that, with respect to matters which - are by the laws of the Commonwealbh required to be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction or other courts of inferior jurisdiction, the original jurisdiction of the High Court shall not be exercised except by way of removal of the matter from the Court in which it is pending inbo the High Courb and thereafter hearing and determining it in the High Courb.",38
237,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION," I was one of the minority who voted against the second reading of bhis Bill, and I very much regret the. apparent determination of the Government to persevere with ib in the face of the very strong volume of protest in this House as - well as the opposition in the country. Having done my best bo secure the defeat of the Bill, I shall now co-operabe wibh bhose honourable members who desiie to desire bo reduce the dimensions of the High Court scheme, and bo keep it within reasonable and constitutional limits as regards expense and jurisdiction. One of the strong arguments used in favour of the Bill was that a constitutional mandate was imposed upon Parliament to vest the j udicial power in a High Court, and we were reminded of the necessiby of having an Australian Federal Court to harmonize the various possibly conflicting BILL. decisions of the States Courbs invested with Federal jurisdiction. Now ib appears that bhat was not the sole objecb sought bo be achieved, because the measure on the face of ib goes further than the creation of a High Courb of Appeal as delineated in - the Consbibubion. The arguments against a court of appeal pure and simple could not be so sbrong as against a court having original and primary jurisdiction. This Bill goes much further than could be justified by any arguments based upon urgency or upon the constitutional mandate. It is not necessary in order to create a court of appeal that we should erect a tribunal clobhed wibh original jurisdiction. I need not remind the Attorney-General of the two great model courts of appeal which are not vested with primary or original jurisdicdiction such as contemplated in this Bill . The Supreme Court of the United States is not vested with primary jurisdiction except in two cases, namely, cases practically of sovereignty, in which States are parties, and actions in which the Ambassadors or representatives of foreign powers are parties. The rest of its powers and functions are exclusively bhose of an Appellabe Courb. As such, bliat greab Courb holds aloof from the preliminary conbesbs which bake place in courbs of first insbance. Ib is therefore far more competent to fulfil the functions of a Court of Appeal than is a tribunal composed of Judges who are from time to time required to engage in preliminary investigations, such as take place in courbs of first insbance. A Courb of Appeal, pure and simple, should hold itself aloof from these preliminary contests. Then cases would come before it with the freshness and originality of a suit in which its members had taken no part. Bub in addition to the court in the United States we have the Canadian Court of Appeal, to which reference has been made. That is a Court of Appeal only, and does not even possess the power bo deal wibh suits to which the provinces are parties, unless the provincial Legislatures first pass certain Acts assigning it jurisdiction. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Canada-lik e thab of the United States - is a court of appeal pure and simple. These courts are held up to us as models, and as such they are entitled to our admiration. I hold that we ought to be quite content in erecting the High Court - if we are to have that tribunal at allto limit its functious as far as possible to those of a Court of Appeal, and not to invest it with original jurisdiction such as is proposed. I admit that under the Constitution the High Courb is ipso facto invested with a certain amount of original jurisdiction with which we are powerless to interfere.",38
238,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Unfortunately , those provisions were never discussed in the Convention. Sir JOHN QUICK. - Lookin g back at the proceedings of the Convention, I can see thab a misbake was made in thab respect Of course many of us were new bo the work of Consbibution making, and bhese poinbs were nob so thoroughly considered as they might have been in the after light of experience. I say now it is to be regretted that under secbion 75 of the Constitution, powers were conferred upon the High Courb , of which we cannob divest it. Bub albhough. we cannot take away from that tribunal ibs powers of original jurisdiction in respecb of mabters relating to treaties, foreign consuls, States, and the issue of writs; we can insert in this Bill a clause declaring that the High Courb may remit such of these cases as ib thinks fib to the Stabes Courbs. This measure conbains a clause for remitter in connection with the removal of causes, and I suggest that that provision might be utilized to indicate to the High Court that except in very extraordinary cases coming within its grant of power, it should not exercise original jurisdiction. I submit that if we desire to erect a court of appeal there is no constitutional necessity to give it additional jurisdiction, such as is proposed under this clause. I believe that the additional jurisdiction proposed can be properly exercised by the States Courts. Undoubtedly the exercise of this original jurisdiction will involve a large amount of machinery as well as a large outlay, which will make the whole tribunal loom in the eyes of the people of Australia as a tremendous expense consequent upon federation. I am anxious that at the next election the enemies of federation shall not be able to attack our institutions by pointing to an unnecessary expansion of departments or their expenditure. That is my sole desire. I am afraid that if this Bill be passed in ibs present form it will go forth to Australia that regardless of expense we are enacting legislation the full meaning and burden of which they will one day realise. It may be that in some Stabes the people do nob appreciate the possibilities of increased expenditure as much as they do in Victoria, which is the present seat of Government, and where naturally public criticism is more acute than it is in some of the disbant Sbabes. That fact may accounb for greater sensitiveness to expenditure in Victoria than is to be found in some of the other States. If the Government are determined to proceed with the creation of this Court, why cannot they be satisfied with a Court limited to appellate functions 1",39
239,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,And the original jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution.,39
240,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Yes ; a jurisdiction of which I regret we cannot divest it. I hope that litigation in respect of matters upon which the Court has original jurisdiction will be of a limited characber, bhough if the view taken by the honourable and learned member for Indi last night be correct, namely, that every case to which the Commonwealth is a party, whether civil or criminal, may be brought before this tribunal, its functions will be vastly extended. I was not aware that ib was intended to confer criminal jurisdiction upon the High Courb in actions bo which the Commonwealbh may be a parby. The words ""suing or being sued,"" I should have thought had reference to civil cases only. But according to the honourable and learned member for Indi they extend also to criminal cases.",39
241,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Othe r honourable members have taken the same view.,39
242,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,But is not that view wrong t Look at sub-section (3) of section 75 of the Constitution.,39
243,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Certainl y this Bill is drawn upon lines inconsistent with the view which is entertained by the honourable and learned member for Indi. I was under the impression that the words used in subsection (3) of section 75 had reference to cases in which a person was suing' the Commonwealth or being sued by it in a civil suit. If the view expressed by the honourable and learned member for Indi be correct, the High Court could entertain any criminal case against the Commonwealth. Mr L . E . GROOM - Agains t the Commonwealth law.",40
244,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,I do not think it is desirable to invest a court of appeal with criminal jurisdiction. Such a thing is unparalleled in the - history of similar tribunals.,40
245,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The honourable and learned member does not object to the appeal in criminal cases'?,40
246,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Certainl y not. I support that appeal. Mr L . E . GROOM - A State Supreme Court sits as a court of first instance.,40
247,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"We are dealing now with the Federal system. The Federal Appellate Court should not be bothered or embarrassed by the exercise of criminal jurisdiction. Last night the Attorney General suggested that the mere addition of these optional powers to the original jurisdiction of the High Court which is contemplated under section 76 of the Constitution would not increase the expense of its organization. It seems to me that it would do so; becauseif weconferupon thecourt general jurisdiction to deal with all classes of Federal cases in the first instance, it necessarily follows that we must have a certain amount of organization to carry out that jurisdiction.",40
248,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,We have that already.,40
249,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"No . We shall not require to have in each State district registrars', sheriff's officers, marshalls, and deputies, if we do not confer this original jurisdiction. Bub if we invest the court with this primary jurisdiction, we must make provision in every State for the issue of writs, we must esbablish offices and appoinb officers bo issue wribs and conducb all the processes of the courts. That cannob be done wibhoub expense. We musb also provide officers to carry out the various decrees of the court, whereas if we constitute merely a court of appeal there will be no occasion to provide all these outlying branches. Take the case of the Privy Council as an example. That is the highest court of appeal in the Empire. It has none of the numerous officers who are necessarily associated wibh courts exercising primary jurisdiction. It has no marshal], no sheriff, and no district registrars. Its expense is comparatively light, because its functions are confined bo those of a court of appeal. If we extend the functions of the High Courb to cases arising under Federal laws, what will be the result ? We may have one class of litigant demanding that it has a right to issue writs in any part of Australia, in matbars relating to every Federal law that has been passed, and if we grant the jurisdiction, we must provide facilities for its exercise. It is also true that if we concede this primary jurisdiction, we must provide for the Federal Judge or Judges travelling about to exercise that jurisdiction. This primary jurisdiction cannot be exercised at the seat of Government. As already mentioned, the court must be brought to the doors of the people, and bo that end there must be a Judge travelling to the various centres of population throughoub the Commonwealth. We should require to have one or two Judges always on circuit to get even a very limited service in the way of judicial administration in the first instance. I would remind the Attorney General that to grant this primary or original jurisdiction as contemplated, we should not only have to provide a Judge who would not be required for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, but also to provide for his expenses in travelling, and for the expenses of the officers associated with him; and thus the cost would be enormous. I feel quite confident that the estimate which is submitted, and which might be sufficient to cover the expenses connected wibh a Court of Appeal will be absolutely insufficient if we have to provide for the exercise of primary courts throughout Australia. As an illustration of what the circuib system means, I have obtained from the accountant of the Law Department of Victoria a return showing the approximate cost of circuit courbs in bhat Sbabe for the financial year 1901-2.",40
250,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,A Judge goes on circuit only once a year in Vicboria.,40
251,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"But one Judge is always on circuit, each Judge in burn undertaking the duty.",40
252,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Then.the honourable and learned member is not referring to one particular Judge?,41
253,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,No ; every month one of the Judges goes' on circuit. As a matter of practice one Judge is told off month by month to do the circuit work.,41
254,Mr SALMON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,That is not every month in the year.,41
255,Sir JOHNQUCK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"E very month in the year, except January, there is a Judge on circuit. The return furnished to me by the accountant, whom I asked to pick out the circuit expenses, shows that the salary of one Judge is £3,000, and his travelling expenses £ 8 0 0 ; that the salary of one associate is £ 3 5 0 ; the salaries of three Crown prosecutors always on circuit, £ 1 , 9 6 0 ; salary of a circuit clerk, £ 3 5 0 ; cost of railway passes for sheriff, circuit clerk,. Judge's associate and three Crown prosecutors, at £ 5 4 , is £ 3 2 4 ; travelling expenses of Crown prosecutors, £ 2 5 0 '; travelling expenses of circuit clerk, £ 7 0 ; travelling expenses of sheriff and deputy sheriff, £ 9 6 ; expenses of witness and jurors, £4,250; and incidental expenses, £100- a total of £11,550. I understand that the railway passes purchased for the officers cost £ 5 4 per annum, but now cost £80, though, for the purposes of this calculation, I have taken the former sum. Mr L . E . GROOM - The expenses of witnesses and jurors ought not to be included, because they would have to be paid where ever the trial took place.",41
256,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That is quite so, and I observe that the accountant has not discriminated between the expenses of witnesses and jurors. . But if a Federal Judge went to Western Australia to try a civil case, and he decided to take the trial of a letter-sorter who might be charged with letter-stealing, there would have to be a special panel of 45 jurors subptenaed. If such a case were tried by the ordinary States tribunals, that item would form an infinitesimal part of the total expenses, whereas, with a Federal J udge on circuit, all the expense of this special panel of jurors would have to be incurred in connection with one Court.",41
257,Mr BAMFORD,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"If such a case were tried in a State Court, would the cost be charged to the Commonwealth ?",41
258,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"No ; if the States Courts exercised Federal jurisdiction, they would do it at their own expense, so that such a trial would not tend to swell the' expense under the Constitution. In the States there are already Crown prosecutors, with all the requisite machinery for taking trials on circuit, and the duplication of Courts seems to me uhwise and impoliticunwise, because it interferes with the arrangements for the administration of justice, arrangements which are satisfactory with the machinery already in existence, and impolitic and injudicious because it tends to incur unnecessary expense. I trust that the Government will do their best to keep down expenses. If they are going to push this Bill through, let the expense be reduced to reasonable limits, so that it may not be thrown in our teeth that we are squandering the public money by the duplication of courts in which justice may be administered in the first instance. The Supreme Courts of the States are quite capable of doing the judicial work of hearing trial by juries, and disposing of the preliminary stages of cases. Let the High Court deal with questions of law, pure and simple, as a Court of Appeal. Mr L . E . GROOM - But honourable and learned members oppose the creation of even a Court of Appeal.",41
259,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I do, because at the present stage I think such a court unnecessary ; but I am endeavouring to assist in making the proposed High Court the least objectionable, so that, when we go to the countrj', we 'shall be able to explain that so far as this House was concerned, we did not incur unnecessary expense-that some honourable members, whilst they thought there was a constitutional obligation to establish a Court of Appeal, felt that there was no obligation to increase the jurisdiction of that Court by the addition of jurisdiction in the first instance, which can be exercised by the existing Courts and officers. How can we justify the duplication of all the existing legal machinery ?",41
260,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,That is not proposed.,41
261,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"It is undoubtedly proposed that there shall be duplication both in the criminal and civil jurisdiction. In - the criminal, jurisdiction contemplated provision will have to be made for such officers as I have mentioned.",41
262,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"As I have already explained, it is proposed to use the State officers everywhere. - Sir JOHN QUICK - But if additional - functions be imposed on State officers, those - officers, must be paid. . Mr DEAKIN - A relatively small sum.",41
263,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I am afraid it will not be a relatively small sum. the extension of the jurisdiction will largely swell the expenses of the Federation, which will have to bear all the obloquy attending an immense expenditure of the kind. Those - of us who go to the country will have to help to bear tqe burden of responsibility, and that is the reason I am anxious to keep down the expenses. Even now, at this late hour, I urge on the Attorney-General to agree to the elimination of all surplus provisions, .and not to over-burden this new organ with work and functions which can be dispensed with at the present time.",42
264,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION," Like the honourable and learned member for Ben-digo, I did all I could to prevent the second reading of this Bill, and having, .failed in that, the next best thing is to make the measure as little oppressive as we possibly can on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. If we are to look for any consistency in public life, I think we are entitled to claim the votes of the AttorneyGeneraland the honourable and learned member for Indi in confining the jurisdiction of this Court to appellate work. During the second reading of the Bill those honourable and learned gentlemen spoke in very forcible and eloquent terms, and almost persuaded us-in fact I think they did persuade some honourable members-that they were bound in conscience to obey the Constitution. Their interpretation of the Constitution was that they should create this Court, not when, it was absolutely required, but on the earliest possible occasion on which we were afforded an opportunity of voting on the question. I am sorry to observe from the subsequent speeches of those honourable and learned geutlemen that their conscience must have been considerably seared and cauterized, because last night it certainly appeared to me that they wanted to depart from the letter of the Constitution, and from the manifest intention of those who framed it. The Attorney-General knows that the Constitution states specifically that the number of Judges shall not be less than three, and he has told us that the High Court is the very keystone of the Constitution. Surely it is reasonable to assume that the gentlemen who were intrusted with the framing of the Constitution would give some attention to what we .are told is the keystone of the arch. Are we to assume for a moment that the framers of the Constitution mentioned three At any rate, Judges, knowing perfectly well that such a number could not do the work? They either mentioned three Judges in good faith, believing that they could do the work which was to be intrusted to the High Court, or they deliberately intended to mislead the people of the Commonwealth, by naming a number which they knew to be inadequate I am sure the Attorney-General will not contend for a moment that, if the Constitution intended to vest this Court with general original jurisdiction, the framers of the Constitution would have been guilty of the farce of naming three Judges to do the whole of the work. We know that to do similar work in any one State would take at least three Judges, 'and certainly more than three in some of the States; and, surely, to do the work of the whole Commonwealth would require a great many more. The Attorney-General, when he was speaking of the expenses of the proposed Federation, and advising people to adopt the Constitution, always spoke of three Judges for the High Court. If any further proof "" were needed of the intention of the Convention in this direction, I think it is furnished by the estimate of expenses set down for the High Court. Is it to be imagined for a moment that the members of the Convention could seriously assume that a court invested with original, as well as with appellate jurisdiction for the whole of the Commonwealth, :;ould be conducted at an annual expenditure of £23,000 1 I am sure that no one would seriously contend that that could be done. The Attorney-General tells us now that he believes, the High Court could be conducted at something like that expense, by transferring a large portion of the work to the States. But that is only a recent thought on the part of the Attorney-General.",42
265,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,No .,42
266,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The Attorney General had no such thought in his mind when he intioduced the Bill last session.,42
267,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Yes ; it all appears in Hansard, and I can show the honourable member the passage.",42
268,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Not only did the members of the Convention contemplate the appointment of only three Judges in the first instance, but the estimate of the cost of the High Court was based upon the assumption that only three Judges would be appointed. Surely the members of the Convention would not have contemplated the appointment of only three Judges, in the first instance, if they had intended that the Court should be vested with jurisdiction which three men could not satisfactorily exercise. It is clear - to me, therefore, that the intention of the Constitution is that we shall commence with a Court of three Judges : and as - the second reading was carried largely because of the argument that the Constitution requires the establishment of a High Court at the earliest moment possible, it is not desirable or necessary that we should go beyond our immediate needs. If we commence with an elaborate - court and a large number of Judges, and give an extensive original jurisdiction, we cannot, if we afterwards find that we have gone too far, retrace our steps; but if we commence on a moderate scale, with a court of only appellate jurisdiction and the original jurisdiction given by the Constitution, and appoint only three Judges, we can at any time that we think necessary extend the jurisdiction of the court, and increase * the number of the Judges. I know that the Attorney-General is not indifferent to the condition of the people, and therefore I ask him to take the present circumstances of the Commonwealth into his consideration We have just passed through a drought which is unparalleled in the history of Australia, and because of extravagance in administration the credit of the Australian States has been reduced to a level of which we should be ashamed. When I speak of extravagance in'this connection, I do not refer to Commonwealth extravagance. I do not, however, assert that the Commonwealth administration has not been extravagant, because I regard this proposal as an extravagant one. It must be remembered that we have not yet done anything to improve the condition of any one person in the Commonwealth, with the exception of those for whom we have provided remunerative positions. We have done nothing to develop the resources of the country, or to increase the expansion of our industries. Mr L . E . GROOM - Hav e we not im' posed duties to protect Australian tries ? Mr A. MCLean.",42
269,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"We had higher duties, and a much larger degree of protection under the Tariffs of the States - -' Mr L . E . GROOM - I am speaking of Australia as a whole.",43
270,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The r e is only oneState which did not enjoy the benefits of protection before the Commonwealth was established, and we cannot take much credit for extending those benefits to it. The condition of the people is such that we should not impose upon them unnecessary taxation to the extent of even a shilling, and it would be a piece of wanton extravagance to establish a High Courb upon a larger scale than is required ab the presenb bime. It is surely more prudent, and more in accordance wibh the rules of common sense, to commence on a moderabe scale, and' bo enlarge the jurisdiction of the Courb, and increase the number of J udges, as occasion may require. The Attorney-General cannot .be indifferent to the wishes of the people, and I do not think any one could doubt but' that if a vote of the electors were taken on the question a High Court would not be established for many years to come. Of course, I recognise that by a majority honourable members have decided to establish a High Court, but we have not decided to create an unnecessarily large court, and I hope that honourable members will set their faces against that. I was so strongly - opposed to the establishment of a High Court at the present time thab, if I had voted for the second reading of the Bill, I should have been ashamed of' my vobe as long as I lived. Bub I know bhat many other honourable members, who are of my own way of thinking, but do not feel so strongly on the matter, voted for the B i ll because they did nob wish bo' embarrass the Government. I think it is the general wish of the Commibtee, however,, and the almost universal desire of the people, that we should commence on as moderate a scale as possible. If we merely vest the Court with appellate jurisdiction and the original jurisdiction given to it by the Constitution, we shall meet all the requirements of the case. I hope that the Government will not press this matter to a division. Why should they place themselves in opposition to what they must recognise as the desire of the great majority of the people 1 I ask the Attorney-General, induswho, I am sure, is keenly alive to the present condition of the people, to save them from unnecessary burdens.",43
271,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION, We are all with the honourable member for Gippsland in the wish not to create an extravagant High Court. But he has 'really argued against the establishment of a High Court at all.,44
272,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Not this evening, though I do not want to see a High Court established.",44
273,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That is the position which the honourable member took up on the second reading, and to which his speech to-night logically leads. He will not acknowledge recognised facts. The division in favour of the second reading, no matter how brought about, though I consider it the honest expression of the opinions of honourable members, showed that there is a majority in favour of the establishment of a High Court. The honourable member for Gippsland admits that the High Court must have an appellate jurisdiction, but he argued against giving it the original jurisdiction which is provided for in this clause. Now, if the High Court is created, it must have the original jurisdiction which is given to it by the five sub-sections of section 75 of the Constitution.",44
274,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,If there are only three Judges they will not be troubled much with the original jurisdiction vested in the court by the Constitution.,44
275,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The honourable member ought to show that paragraphs («), (b), and (d) of clause 31 are nob embraced by, or at least are more bhan an extension of, the original jurisdiction provided for in the Constitution. I think that if he compares this clause with section 75, and especially with the third sub-section of that section of the Constitution, he will see that there is hardly even an extension of the original jurisdiction contemplated, and that where there is an extension it is only a proper one.",44
276,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Why should there be any extension at all 1,44
277,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"It is open to doubt whether bhere is any exbension, and whether the clause is not merely a necessary explanation or interpretation of the Constibuiion. The honourable member presumed to judge of, nob only the feeling of his own consbibuency, but that of all the constituencies of the Commonwealth. Bub he has evidently been misled by the atbibude of the bwo Melbourne morning journals in regard to this proposal.",44
278,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,I expressed my present opinion before the newspapers in question published anybhing ab all on the subjecb.,44
279,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I do not say that the honourable member is in the slightest degree influenced by the opinions expressed in those newspapers, bub he has been misled as to the tendency of public opinion by the fact that the views expressed in them coincide with his own.",44
280,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"It is much more likely that the honourable and learned member is misled by his surroundings, whereas I am able to take an impartial view.",44
281,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The honourable member considered himself justified in stating that if a vote of the electors were taken the High Court would not be established, but I, on the other hand, venture bo say bhat if the matter were referred to the intelligent electors, and the amount of discussion and explanation preceded the referendum that should take place whenever a question of this kind is referred to the people, the vote would be in favour of the establishment of a High Court. There is a large amount of feeling a,gainst the High Court, purely because it will not be a final appellate court, and I ask the Attorney-General whether he will make an attempt to restore the Court to the form proposed in the draft Constitution before amendment by the Imperial Government. Our delegation to London desired to. carry out our wishes, bub were misled by the representatives of financial institutions and others who foi - i warded telegrams to Mr Chamberlain asking him to retain the right of appeal to the Privy Council.",44
282,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,If we attempt to do away with the right of appeal to the Privy Council we shall have to reserve the whole Bill for H is Majesty's assent. It would be bebber to introduce a separate measure with that object.,44
283,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Sectio n 74 of the Constitution does not earn' the King's power of veto any further than other provisions of the Constitution relating to the King's right of vebo, and I should like bo have the promise of the Abtorney-General that he will endeavour to carry out the original intention of the people of Australia before the Constitution was mutilated by the Imperial authorities. Mr CoNitov - Was it a mutilation 1",44
284,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I think so, according to the opinions I have heard expressed by even members of this House who oppose this Bill.",44
285,Mr CONROY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,All the legal authorities know are against the abolition of the right of appeal to the Privy Council.,45
286,Mr CROUCH,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"On e of the principal opponents of this measure, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, laid the very greatest stress upon his objection to the continuance of the right of appeal to the Privy Council, and I voted for the measure because I thought that the High Court would be largely an appellate court, and because I think it . could be made, in committee, the final appellate court, and because I believe that Australia should be self-contained in every respect. I desire to see the right of appeal to the Privy Council abolished, and I am sure that this would be in accord with the wishes of the great majority of the intelligent people of the Commonwealth. I admit that there is still the possibility of an Imperial court of appeal being established, and I shall not so much object to that, because we should then he treated upon the same footing as the people of England. At present the people of England are able to obtain a final decision far more readily than we can, as their appeals aie limited to two stages, whilst ours necessitate four, and upon this fact is based one of my principal objections to - the present arrangement. If the High Court were made a final court of appeal, a great many of the objections now urged against it would disappear, and if the Attorney-General will not take the responsibility of moving an amendment with thab object, I shall take action myself. I have the greatest faith in the ability and patriotism of the members of every Federal Convention from 1891 onwards, all of which were against the appeal to the Privy Council, and I hope that the Attorney-General will be persuaded to do all he possibly can to give expression to the full desire of the Australian people.",45
287,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Robertson) The speech of the honourable member for Gippsland must appeal to every lay member of this House, and to the common sense of every business man who has regard for economy in our administration. Honourable members who spoke in support of the clause last evening apparently desiie to make the High Court us comprehensive as possible, for no other reason than to increase the expenditure of the Commonwealbh. It is proposed to give to the High Court the same jurisdiction as is now exercised by I - the States Supreme Courts, and to that extent to duplicate the present courbs. We have been told that the Judges of the States Supreme Courts are selected with the utmost care, and, therefore, it cannot be suggested that bribunals of such high character are not fully competent to perform all their present functions. If the High Court is restricted to a purely appellate jurisdiction, the desires of the Ausbralian people will-be fully satisfied. The Attorney General has represented that the proposed extension of the powers of the Court will be in the interests of suitors, but I do not see how any benefit will be conferred upon litigants, whose aim is to obtain justice by the most ready means. Under present circumsbances, a libiganb can bring an acbion in one of the lower Sbate Courts, and if he is dissatisfied, can appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, and then to the Privy Council. When the High Court is appointed he can appeal to the High Court, and, if he be still dissatisfied, can make a further appeal to the Privy Council. On the obher hand, he mighb ignore the High Courb altogether, and appeal direct from the State Supreme Courb to the Privy Council. I do nob see any objecb in interposing the High Court as a tribunal having original jurisdiction. The AbborneyGeneral evidently desires to impose as much work as possible upon the Court, so that it may be necessary to appoint a ful l Bench of five J udges. If we confer upon the Court only an appellate jurisdiction, there will nob be the same necessity for appointing five Judges, and I think that in this connection the efforts of the honourable and learned members who have fought so staunchly against the Government proposals are to be highly commended. The Attorney-General has expressed the hope that the Court will attract work, not only from the States Supreme Courts, but also from New Zealand, and ho frankly admits that if the work increases bo such an extent that the J udges appointed cannot cope wibh ib, he will be prepared bo bring down a Bill bo sbrengbhen the Bench. I shall oppose the clause, because I do nob believe in giving such an extended jurisdiction to the Court. When the late Sir Henry Parkes submitted his proposal for a High Court, he contemplated the necessity for appointinga Bench often Judges. Sir Samuel Griffith contended that whilst possibly afc the inception of the court sufficient work would not be found for three Judges, he was prepared to admit that, if the jurisdiction of that tribunal were extended, in all probability ten Justices would be necessary. The appeal of the honourable member for Gippsland to keep the expenditure of the Commonwealth within reasonable bounds is deserving of consideration at the hands of this Committee. It is gratifying to know that the leading men at the bar in practically all the States of the Union are unanimous that it is not necessary to embody in this Bill a provision conferring upon the High Court additional original jurisdiction. Mr L . E . GBOOM (Darling Downs) During the discussion which has taken place in committee, various attitudes have been assumed by honourable members, some of which it is difficult to reconcile. In the first place we find that there is practically a desire on the part of some honourable members to block the establishment of the High Court.",45
288,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Onl v for a time. Mr L . E . GROOM - Certainl y the idea is to block the passage of this Bill. For example, the honourable and learned member for Corinella desires to cut down the num'ber of Judges so as to limit the functions of the court practically to Appellate Jurisdiction. In other words, so long as the seat of government is in 'Victoria, he wishes the High Court to sit here armed only with Appellate Jurisdiction in addition to the original jurisdiction which must be vested in it under the Constitution. The other States, therefore, are to be denied an opportunity of having its original jurisdiction exercised in their midst. The idea of many honourable members who object to investing the High Court with additional original jurisdiction is to reduce the number of Judges. B y the appointment of three Judges and by the Court exercising only Appellate Jurisdiction they urge that we shall dispense with the necessity for the adoption of the circuit system. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has declared that the principle underlying the Bill is one of centralization, but it seems to me that the desire of the honourable and learned member for Corinella is to prevent the Court from being invested with additional original jurisdiction, so as to reduce the number of Judges to three. Surely that must result in centralization, whereas the scheme forecasted by the Attorney-General will result in decentralization. The right honourable gentleman seeks, to carry out the true federal idea. In some of the more distant States the feeling is abroad that Federation is something entirely outside of them. The Parliament meets in Melbourne, Federal Ministers have their offices here, and federation to them seems something which is entirely foreign. If we constitute a High Court which will sit only at the seat of Government, we shall accentuate that feeling. Our desire ought to be to extend the sphere of Federal influence as far as possible, instead of endeavouring to crowd everything into Melbourne. If honourable members are successful in limiting the jurisdiction of the Court they will establish centralization.",46
289,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"We will not secure efficiency with the decentralization provided under the Bill. . MrL . E . GROOM - I will deal with that matter presently. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo asked this evening why we should do more than create a Court of Appellate Jurisdiction. He declared that in the United States the Supreme Court is only an Appellate Court. Bnt heforgets that when the Judiciary Act was passed there, Congress did something more than to establish a* tribunal having an Appellate Jurisdiction. It not only clothed its Supreme Court with Appellate Jurisdiction, powers of interpretation, and also a certain amount of original jurisdiction, but ib provided circuit courts, throughout the whole of the United States. One of the first acts of the Justices of that court was bo go upon circuit Congress went even further, and created districtcourts.",46
290,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"They had to do so. Mr L . E . GROOM - The position taken up by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was thab Congress had merely constituted a court with Appellate Jurisdiction. But in Willoughby's The SupremeCourt of the United States, I readThe number of circuits has differed at differenttimes. By the Act of 1789 three were provided for ; since 1869 there have been nine. Until 1869(excepting a short period in 1801.) there were nocircuit Judges, circuit work being done by theSupreme Court Justices. By the Act of 1S69 a. circuit Judge was to be appointed by the President for each circuit. One of the J ustiees of the SupremeCourt is, however, still allotted to each of the-circuits, who after the expiration of the term of the Supreme Court, visits his circuit, and tries the more important cases which may have arisen bhere. The circuit court may be held by the circuit Judge, by the Supreme Court Justice, or by the district judge of that district in which the court is sitting ; or by any two of them, or by till three of them sitting together. Therefore, in the United States itself, a Supreme Courb was set up, the Justices of which visited the various States under the powers and jurisdiction conferred upon them as Circuit Judges. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo also pointed to the case of Canada. He said that in the Dominion the7 had nobhing but an Appellate Courb. He quite overlooked the facb that in 1875, and again in 1S86, in addition to the Supreme Court which possessed appellate jurisdiction, Parliament created an Exchequer Courb endowed with a very' large exclusive jurisdiction. Mr HiGCiiNS - But thab is nob a Federal Court. Mr L . E . GROOM - Legislative authority was used to create a court to try issues connected with the Dominion, a court having also a concurrent jurisdiction in matters relating to the revenue-b o cases in which ib was sought to impeach any patent, or invention, or any lease, or obher instrument respecting land, or in which relief was sought against various public officers. It is a courb created fty Parliament for the purposes of the whole Dominion and of its provinces.",46
291,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The provinces have their own courts. Mr L . E . GROOM - But ' the honourable and learned member for Bendigo led - the Committee to believe that Canada had not bobhered about consbibubing a courb which was possessed of obher bhan appellate jurisdiction. I am showing that the Parliament of thab country went a great deal further. Some of the opponents of this Bill have urged that its operation will result in the centralization of justice. But I contend that if the High Court is going to be worthy of the name litiganbs in the distant Stabes should nob be denied an opporbuniby of bringing bheir cases before ib. It was contended, prior to the taking of the Federal referendum, that the Constitution was framed in such a way that the smallest Sbate need not fear that it would be deprived of ibs rights by the more populous States. It was . urged that the Constitution was so elastic that it was possible for the Federal Judges to travel all over the Commonwealth. That was the case in the United States. The framers of our Constitution, however, did not desire bo follow merely the American model. They had in bheir mind's eye whab was being done in the Sbabes Supreme Courbs. Take, for insbance, the Supreme Court of Queensland. In bhat State we have a court in Townsville, another in Rockhampbon, and still another in Brisbane, each exercising Supreme Courb jurisdiction, in addition to which there is a Ful l Court sitting as a court of appeal. That is all that is proposed under this Bill . Under its provisions, district registries will be established, and in each of those districts ib will be possible bo commence a suib upon Federal mabters. Section 75 of the Constitution provides that the High Court shall be vested with original jurisdiction in all matters arising under any treaty, affecting Consuls, orin which the Commonwealth sues or is sued, or in all matters between Sbabes, or in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition is sought againsb an officer of the Commonwealbh. Under the Constitution, therefore, we cannot have a court with purely an appellate jurisdiction. When we have constituted this tribunal, and have vested in ibs Justices bhat original jurisdiction, ib is only righb that the residenbs of Soubh Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales, should be able to have actions to which they are parties tried before the Courb in thair own Sbabes. If we esbablish the Court, and appoint such a small number of Judges to it that they can sib only at the seat of government, all the matters which it is desired bo bring before ib must of necessity be brought here.",47
292,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Will the honourable and learned member not say that 90 per cent, of the cases are such as would arise under a unitary constitution 1 Mr L . E . GROOM - Of necessiby, under bheConsbibution, original jurisdiction is given to the Courb, and if a plaintiff is to have the right of bringing his action there, the Court should, be framed in such a way that each of the States can have a district registrar to start the cases, and a Judge to hear the matter on the spot, instead of dragging all the witnesses to a central place. The latter condition would cause grievous wrong to the more remote parts of the Commonwealth, and shows the absolute necessity for decentralization. We are told that the proposal of the Government will involve tremendous cost; but would the honourable and learned member for Bendigo favour the abolition of the State Circuit Court which sits in that city ? I am .afraid that if such a proposal were made, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo would seriously object to sill the witnesses and parties concerned being dragged down to Melbourne simply to gratify some little excitement in the comnniniby about economic reform.",47
293,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"There is no. Supreme Court at Bendigo to deal with State matters. Mr L . E . GROOM - But a Supreme Court sits at Bendigo, and, so far as I understand, the arguments of the honourable and learned member for that city were addressed against circuit courts altogether.",48
294,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"No . Mr L . E . GROOM - In the figures which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo gave of the cost of circuit courts, he mentioned £4,500 as the expenses of - witnesses and jurors. But would that sum not be largely increased if all the witnesses had to be brought from Bendigo to Melbourne ? Would the cost of the circuit Judge be escaped ? It is very plausible to stand on a public platform and refer to £11,000 as the total cost of the circuit courts, but I doubt whether country people would appreciate the argument when they had taken away from them the right to have justice administered at their doors, and the community generally were relieved of expense at the cost of the parties interested"" in the trial. It must not be forgotten that it is on the parties to the suit on which the cost of bringing the witnesses to a central place must ultimately fall.",48
295,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Does the honourable and learned member anticipate that the Federal Circuit Judges will sit outside the State capitals ? Mr L . E . GROOM - No ; but it would be a greater saving to bring South Australian witnesses to Adelaide than to bring them to Melbourne or to a seat of government in New South Wales. argument applies in the case of Western Australia and Queensland; and even if we cannot get an adequate number of Judges it is our duty to get as - reasonable a number as we can. We are told that the cost of administration would be great. On this point I would call attention to the Customs cases which were heard in Brisbane, and which extended over four or five weeks. The costs of those cases would have to be incurred whether they were tried before a State Judge or a Federal Judge. Witnesses and jurors would have to be summoned, and the only difference in cost would be the travelling expenses of the Judge.",48
296,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"It is nob so much the cosb of the Judge as the cost of conveying the officials of the court. Mr L . .E. GROOM - W it h all respect to the honourable and learned member it is far more important to us in Queensland that we should have the cause of action tried in that State, than that there should be a small public saving in the cost by bringing the parties to the seat of government.",48
297,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That is not the question. Mr L . E . GROOM - But ib is a serious question bo us in Queensland, and I again poinb oub that the Judges' salaries have bo be paid in any event. There is no necessity in consbibubing a High Courb to appoint a large number of officers to travel wibh the Judge all over the country. AVe need nob convey Crown prosecubors or clerks of courbs, or any obher officials beyond, perhaps, the Judge's associate and his tipstaff. Indeed, we might dispense with a tipstaff, leaving only the Judge and his associate to travel to the scene of'the acbion. For all obher purposes the Stabe officials could be utilized.",48
298,Mr CAM ERON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Bu b they would have to be paid. Mr L . E . GROOM - Not at all. At the present time Sbate officers are doing Federal work wibhoub pay. In the Railway Deparbmenb of Queensland officials are doing work for the Postal Deparbmenb wibhoub having a penny added to bheir salaries : and I believe bhat the idea of the Attorney-General is to utilize the services of the State officials, and thus save expendibure to that exbent.",48
299,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Excep t the Judges. Mr L . E . GROOM - Does the honourable and learned member wish to make oub that the Judges will involve enormous cost?  pay the cosb of the Reid cases in Brisbane 1,48
300,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The Federal Government recovered the cosbs. Mr L . E . GROOM - The intention of the Procedure Bill , and of bhis Bill , is to utilize the local machinery as far as possible, and all that is wanted is a Judge who can exercise the jurisdiction to be conferred by the Bill .",48
301,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"But Attorney-General proposes to give £6,500 a year as an honorarium for the ""flunkeys."" Mr L . E . GROOM - There is no necessity for honorarium: in the High Court, and I am afraid that the honourable member for Robertson has not had much experience in connection with the necessary officials of a court. The Attorney-General does not propose any extravagant paraphernalia, and T think his assurance on that score might be accepted. We are told, further, that the State jurisdiction is sufficient-that the State Judges can do all that is required. But the Attorney-General's position was unanswerable when he said we must remember that we are creating a Court vested with peculiar Federal jurisdiction. That Court will be continually dealing, as the Attorney General says, with Federal matters, and will thus acquire a distinct knowledge and attain an efficiency which, in the end, must command the confidence of the people.",49
302,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Are Federal matters different ""to any large extent from other matters dealt with by the States Courts? Mr L . E . GROOM - There is a great distinction. In Queensland and other States there is a general common law, equity and criminal jurisdiction, but arising from Federal matters there will of necessity be constant arguments before the Court, and the Judges will thus acquire a profound knowledge of constitutional law. B y virtue of constantly exercising Federal jurisdiction the Judges will become thoroughly acquainted with the Federal Constitution and precedents, and the result will be more confidence in and fewer appeals from the decisions given. We should have Judges of that description moving throughout the Commonwealth. We have to give the High Court jurisdiction in the matters set forth in section 75 of the Constitution, and, as pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Indi last night, a great many of the questions which will arise under subsection 3 of that clause would of necessity be tried in the Federal Court whether we give the extended jurisdiction or not. All that the Attorney-General says is that under the Constitution we must confer a certain amount of Federal jurisdiction on the High Court, and seeing that that Court has to be constituted, why not give it the additional jurisdiction, so that the Judges may be able to deal with matters arising under the laws of the Parliament? In this way, if the people desire to have their rights decided by the Federal tribunal, they will be able to have their wish gratified. It is not asked that the Court should be given a general equity and common law jurisdiction ; all the Attorney-General desires is that the High Court Judges should be able to exercise thejurisdiction of interpreting matters that arise under the Constitution. What 'othermatters are likely to arise ? In Qivkk and"" Garran's work on the Constitution, several illustrations are given of cases likely to come before the Court; for instance, where a subjejt of the K in g resident in one State is subject in another State to a disability o r discrimination under section 117 of the Constitution, or as to religious tests required as a qualification for officers o r for actions brought against members for holding, contrary to the Constitution,, places of profit; or questions as to the rights of transferred officers, and so on - In addition, there are other powers specially mentioned under the Constitution, which may be the subject matter of litigation ; and when these constitutional questions arise,, the Commonwealth, if a party, has the right to take people before the Federal tribunal. There may be a hundred and one questions of this kind which arise in actions between the Commonwealth and private parties, or between State and State. I am sure that the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, who has studied the constitutional - history of England and the United States, will find that many of the constitutional questions yet decided have arisen between party and party.",49
303,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Nearl y all the American authorities condemned the extension of the original jurisdiction. Mr L . E . GROOM - The leading case of Gibbons v. Ogden, in America, the case of Stockdale v. Hansard, in England, and the case of Barton v. Taylor, in New South Wales, were all practically between subject and subject. If an action arose with respect to the Speaker ejecting a member, and it became necessary to determine under the Constitution what were the powers and prerogative of this Parliament, and the rights and privileges of members, would the honourable and learned member like that question to be tried in a State Court, instead of in a Federal Court ?",49
304,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Would the case not be sure to go to the court of appeal ? Mr L . E . GROOM - It might or it might not; but let us have a Federal Court which will command the confidence of the people, and so leduce as much as possible the necessity for appeals.",50
305,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"There would be the right of appeal in any case. Mr L . E . GROOM - But it is desired to prevent a man bringing his action in the Federal Court, so that the only way to have these matters settled authoritatively would be to have a trial in a State Court, and then go to the appeal court. Honourable members have argued for an Australian court with Australian appellatejurisdiction, and have afterwards inconsistently contended that action should be first brought in a State Court, from which an appeal may go to the Privy Council, thus avoiding the Australian appellate jurisdiction.",50
306,Mr WATSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That could not be done in respect to constitutional cases. Mr L . E . GROOM - We have yet to determine whether, for instance, in the case of a question arising as to an Act passed by a State being contrary to the Constitution, we can compel the State to come to the High Court, or whether it may be allowed to go to the Privy Council.",50
307,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,We provide - for that in the Bill .,50
308,Mr WATSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"This clause will not get over the matter, because it is still optional for the parties to go to the States Courts. Mr L . E . GROOM - Yes , but I want to give them the opportunity to go to the High Court in the first instance. The jurisdiction which it is proposed to give to the High Court under this clause is jurisdiction on matters arising under the Constitution, or under the laws made by this Parliament. Now, under the laws made by this Parliament, a lot of very important cases will arise, in regard to which litigants should have an opportunity of saying whether they will go before a State Court or the Federal Court. For instance, we have power to pass laws relating to trade and commerce, and if honourable members will turn up the American authorities, they will see that a very large interpretation has been placed upon those words. It might happen, for instance, that a harbour board, in the exercise of the powers 3x conferred upon it, might frame regulations which were regarded as interfering with freedom of trade and commerce between the States, and an action would lie in the State Courb. Such an action would not be an action between a Sbate and the Commonwealth, or between one State and another,, but between a private individual and a corporate body. Therefore the mabter would nob be one coming under section 75 of the Constitution, and if the parties concerned were nob expressly given the righb to go bo. the High Court, they would be precluded from doing so.",50
309,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That is a mabter which would be dealt wibh by the Inber-Sbabe Commission. Mr L . E . GROOM - The dispute mightarise quibe apart from any decision given by the Inter-State Commission. I am instancing the case as one which might occur under a law made by this Parliament, and in regard bo which libiganbs should have the righb bo go before the High Court. In the same way similar questions might ariseunder laws passed by us relating to insurance, banking, promissory notes, patentrights, copyrights, inventions, and any of the various commercial matters upon which we may be called upon to legislate. Arewe going bo prevenb libiganbs from baking causes arising from the laws passed b}' us in regard to those matters before the High Courb 1 I submib that we should nob. The ground upon which we should give the High Courb bhis jurisdiction is that - the Constitution contemplates the exercise o£ a Federal jurisdiction by the High Court, and we should allow every libiganb who thinks that he is being deprived of a right which he should enjoy under the Constitubion to go to the best tribunal we can creabe for a remedy. We do not deprive him of his right bo go before a Sbate Courb if he chooses, bub we give him the righb bo go before the highest tribunal in the Commonwealth.",50
310,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Will the High Court be higher than the Supreme Court of a State 1 Mr L . E . GROOM - I believe that in the long run ib will be a bebter tribunal for the decision of bhese cases, because ib will have appeals from all the States, and will be continuously dealing with Federal matters.",50
311,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"If the High Court can hear an appeal from the Supreme Court, will it not be the higher court? .. Mr L . E . GROOM - I do not undervalue the work done by the States Courts, but I think that in the long run the High Court will be more efficient for the purposes for which it is to be created than any of the Supreme Courts. All the Attorney-General asks is that, in respect to actions arising under the Constitution and under the laws made b)' this Parliament, litigants may have the opportunity of using the Federal Court contemplated by the Constitution. I intend to support the clause. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - As a layman I hesitate about interposing in a matter which has been so ably discussed by the legal members of the Committee, and especially by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr . Glynn, and the honourable and learned members for. Corinella, Bendigo, and Northern Melbourne. But I am bound to raise my voice in protest against an unnecessary and very heavy expenditure, to which the people are decidedly opposed ; I can, at liny rate, speak confidently of the feeling of those whom I immediately represent. The very elaborate defence of the clause made by the Attorney-General last night was characterized more by its rhetoric than by its logic, and showed signs of a weakening in his belief in the measure. Apparently he would be glad to see a considerable portion of it amended. He has already expressed a willingness to jettison paragraph («) of this clause, and also the three clauses which' provide for the transfer of cases to the High Court by Hght, a monstrous provision, which I think the Committee would not allow to remain. The Attorney-General also made an admission which, I think, was entirely in favour of those who oppose the Bill, when he said that it is impossible at the present time, with due regard to economy, to establish such a High Courb as we desire. He does not pretend that the High Court which he proposes to establish will be more than sufficient to meet the demands of the Commonwealth for a limibed bime bo come. By his own showing bhis is only a makeshift measure, to create a High Courb which will be the nucleus of a much more elaborabe establishment in the fubure. I hold, with a great many other, honourable members, that ab the presenb time any High Courb is unnecessary. The Abtorney-General admits that the vesting of additional jurisdiction in a High Court will not deprive the States Courbs of jurisdicbion. Therefore, if we add bo the original j urisdicbion of bheHigh Courb provided for by the Constitution, we shall only beduplicating our legal machinery; we shall be creating a second Bench to do that which the first Bench is now doing to the satisfaction of the people, wibh all the attendant expense, but without any saving by the absorption of the local courts, or bheir reduction in number.  honourable and learned member is now using were all used against federation.",50
312,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"F u r the r more, a High Courb is nob necessary, because the Commonwealth already has a judicature which is able to dispose of the business now being brought before it, or likely to be brought before ib in the immediate fubure. I hope bhat in commitbee we who would gladly have seen the Bill thrown oub will so amend ib that the great cost with which we are threatened will be considerably reduced, so that we shall be able to tell the electors that, so far as it was in our power to enforce economy, we have done so. I urge, for the sake of the taxpayers, who have to meet the charges which will be imposed by the creation of this courb, that every step possible be taken to reduce its cost.",51
313,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Northern Melbourne) I understand that the proposal which the Committee is now considering is virtually the omission of clause 31.,51
314,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That will be the ultimate question. Mr - HIGGINS - We are practically being asked by those who oppose the Bill nob bo give bo the High Courb the jurisdiction provided for in this clause. I must confess that I feel great difficulty in making up my mind as to how to deal wibh the mabter. As honourable members know, I opposed the second reading because I regard a High Court as unnecessary at the present time, and the proposal to establish it as little short of a scandal and a crime. But I must bow to the wisdom of the House. A majority of honourable members have determined that there shall be a High Court, and it is my duty to try to make that court as efficient as possible. If we are to have a babch of highly-paid officers, we musb see that we give them plenby to do.. But I feel that I am much in the position of a man who has to find employment for two gangers who have been appointed to supervise the same piece of work, or for two dentists who are engaged to operate upon the same mouth. The wording of the clauses of the Bill is evidence of a frantic effort on the part of the Attorney-General to provide something for the Judges to do. He must feel as we all do that, if the High Courb has only an appellate jurisdiction and the original jurisdiction provided for in the Constitution, the Judges will have hardly enough to do. What is the result'! It is pioposed to take - such work as can be transferred from the .States Supreme Courts, and foist it upon the High Courb. If we do not give the High Courb the extra original jurisdiction now proposed, it will have very little to do in that particular line, and as mabters stand ib will have a very small appellabe jurisdiction. I am confident thab if. a litiganb has the option of going bo the Privy Council or the High Court, he will prefer to carry his appeal' to the former, and our .Federal Judges will be left bo sib in high dignib) , in ermined robes or furred gowns* and twiddle - their bhumbs whilst waiting for work.  the new J udges, we shall render the States Judges idle.",51
315,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Whereve r the idleness mighb be, I should object bo ib. I have .always supported the proper treatmenb of public servants, but I object to having one more than is required, and I strongly resenb uhe idea of forcing a new High Court, like .an incubus, upon the shoulders of the baxpayers of Australia. If we confine ourselves to the original jurisdiction which is compulsory, there will be very little work for the Judges to do. Ab the same time the appeals will be few in.number, and if we have only three Judges, very few indeed. In Vicboria bhere are usually six Supreme - Court Judges-w e now have five-and it very ofben happens that the whole of the Judges are bo be found sibting upon the Bench. Whab a farce it would be if an appeal were allowed from the unanimous decision of five or six Judges - of the Vicborian Supreme Courb to a High Courb consisting of bhree J udges of no higher - calibre? Would ib nob be especially absurd in view of the facb that without any expense to the taxpayer, we can at present appeal to a court of higher standing and - calibre across the seas ? With me it is nob .merely a question of expense, bub I ask 3X 2 honourable members not to create a court that will not have enough, work to do. I should like to give the court plenby of work, and make ib as useful as possible. What original jurisdiction will the High Court have, unless the clause under discussion is carried ? Section 75 of the - Constitution provides that the High Court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters arising under treaties, or affecting consuls, or other represenbatives of obher counbries. There will nob be a case of either class once in a blue moon. Then there are cases in which the Commonwealbh or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealbh is a party. They may have a few cases under this head, but probably not more than half a dozen in the whole of Australia in any one year. Then there is the class of cases between States or between residents of different States, or between a Sbabe and a residenb of anobher Stabe. The High Court will be called upon to deal with a 7 fewcasesof this description, but we knowthab actions of bhis kind are bried every day in the'Sbates Supreme Courbs. Then the High Courb will have original jurisdiction in cases in which a writ of mandamus, or prohibition, or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealbh. I have already showu bhatthe appellate jurisdiction of the High Court will be very small, and that the business will be furbher reduced if trnly three Judges are appointed. Now ib is proposed bo give exbra original jurisdiction in order to increase the work of the court. It may be assumed that of the three classes of cases regarding which the Federal Court is to have extended original jurisdiction, the greater number will arise under the laws made by this Parliament.",52
316,Mr SAWEHS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Is it not absolutely necessary to have a High Courb to deal with cases arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation 1 ' Mr HIGGINS - No . I should be perfectly prepared to leave those cases - to the States Supreme Courts, in which I have quibe as much confidence as I could repose in any High Courb appointed under present conditions. Mr SAWEB.3 - But bhere. are so many of : them.",52
317,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Yes ; but - the Privy Council will make their decisions uniform if they differ. The greab bulk of the cases that will come before the High Courb will be those arising under the laws passed by this Parliament. Under this clause, taken in conjunction with clause 41, if a man is made bankrupt in Sydne} by a Judge at first instance, he is to have no appeal, except to the High Court, although under present practice he may appeal to the State Court sitting in the next room. Or, supposing a man were compelled to pay a call under the Companies Act, by a Judge in Melbourne, and wished to appeal against the decision ; he would be deprived of the right he now has to appeal to the Pull Court of Victoria, and would be obliged to wait for the sittings of the High Courb.",52
318,Mr DKAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,He would have to wait for the Pull Court in Victoria.,53
319,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Yes ; but the Pul l Court of Victoria has more Judges and a smaller area over which bo operate. If the Government proposals are carried into effect the result will be to deprive litigants of the righb which Magna Charba was inbended bo secure, namely, speedy as well as upright justice. One of the main objects of the law is to secure speedy trial, and yet it is now proposed bo pub aside the 27 J udges whom we now have in Australia, and insisb that all appeals shall be made bo the five Judges of the High Courb. The proposed change will nob secure speedy jusbice, or any obher advantage to the people of Australia. When a man is made insolvent, and his assets are vested in some trustee and he cannot touch them, it is difficult enough for him now to secure the hearing of his appeal ; but it will be trebly hard upon him if he has to wait for the High Court. The Federal Parliament has power to make laws in regard to a greater number of matters than those over which the Federal Parliament of the United States has control. For instance, we can legislate in regard to patents, and the Government proposes that a man who is defeated in a patent case in one of the StateCourtsshall comebobheHigh Courb insbead of being allowed bo go to the Full Court of the State in which the matber was firsb tried. The same thing applies bo trades marks, to insurance cases, and to the most trivial matters relating to the custody of infants. Perhaps the High Courb might be sitbing in Bombala, or Orange, or somewhere in the heart of the conbinenb, and an appeal mighb have bo be senb all the way from Western Australia. May I suggesb to the Attorney-General some alterations which would mitigate my objections to the clause ? I would ask him to make 1 justice speedy for every man by giving the States Courts all the jurisdiction 7 which he intends to confer upon the High Courb. I would also ask him bo allow the States Courts to deal wibh mabters by way of appeal from the Judge ab firsb insbance, in place of compelling appeals to be taken before the High Court. Nine cases out of ten never go beyond the Judge at first instance, and of the tenth cases very few go beyond the F u l l Court. A good deal has been said wibh regard bo the expense of witnesses upon. appeal, bub that is all beside the question, because no wibnesseswill be required bo be dragged bo the F u l l Court.",53
320,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Affidavit s are often moreexpensive than witnesses.',53
321,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"There will be no affidavit on appeals. I do not see why we should, not endeavour to bring justice to the door of every man as far as we can by utilizing the States Supreme Courts as at present, for the - hearing of appeals from the Judge at first instance in matters relating to insolvency, company laws, patents, insurancematters, trade marks, and divorce. If the Attorney-General could grant bo the Sbabes Supreme Courbs the jurisdiction that he now wishes to give to the Federal Court and treat them wibh the confidence they deserve, 'many of my objecbions would be removed. We have had no serious objection baken bo our Supreme Courbs.",53
322,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"He a r , hear. Bub what is the proposal of the honourable and learned member wibh regard bo the relations between the Sbabes Courbs endowed with full Federal jurisdiction and the High Court?",53
323,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"It is bebber bhat we should give the States Courts the same original jurisdiction thab is given to the High Court; and we should allow, as now, an appeal from a single Judge to the Full Bench. At the same time, if we proceed wibh the Bill , we must make the High Court an optional substitube for the Privy Council in regard to appeals from the F u l l Courts. As a rule libiganbs will not go beyond the Ful l Courtsthey will be quite content with the tribunal which is at their doors. Thus a man will be able to get justice more speedily, because the Ful l Court Judges will be confined bo the Sbates capitals.",53
324,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"There would be an optional appeal, I bake ib, either to the F u l l Courb or the High Courb.",53
325,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I would not allow an option of appeal to the High Court from a Judge of the States Courts. But an. appeal would lie from the Full Court tc the High Court if the appellant preferred the High Court to the Privy Council. Clause 41 should be excised, and we should insert a provision which will give to the States Courts the full original jurisdiction which the Government desire to vest in the High Court. My only object in offering this suggestion is to make the best of a bad job. I do not intend to weary the Committee with perpetual protests against a decision which has been carried against me. I have my own opinion upon the matter, but I accept the judgment of the Committee upon it. If by any means I can assist in improving the Bill, and it - defeats the fulfilment of my own prophecies, I shall be only too glad.",54
326,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION," If anything were needed to convince me of the propriety of opposing this clause, it would be the speeches which have been delivered by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. The former has exhibited a vast vista of expense which we are called upon to face in establishing this court. He has indicated the enormous number of matters which it will be possible to bring before this tribunal in its original jurisdiction, and has emphasized the necessity for extending it throughout the whole of Australia. Honourable members must recognise the heavy expenditure which such a proposal would eventually involve - The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has shown how very inefficient the court would be under the proposal of the Attorney-General.",54
327,Mr DEAKIX,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,No .,54
328,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"It would be inefficient, he said, because it would drag litigants who - desire to appear before the Supreme Full Court to the Central High Court. If that is to be avoided the Supreme Courts of the States must practically be able to deal with everything with which the High - Court is called upon to deal, except the few matters in which exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the latter under the Constitution. I ask honourable members to pause before entering upon federation in the spirit which this Bill displays. Surely by adopting federation we did not create two peoples.",54
329,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,We created one.,54
330,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"We are supposed to have done so, but many of the proposals of the Ministry insist upon regarding the taxpayers of Australia as two different peoples. We aie asked to establish two systems of adjudicature throughout the Commonwealth. We did not/create new requirements amongst the people upon the inauguration of the Commonwealth. It is a false policy to neglect the existing institutions of the States in dealing with Federal matters. When we come to legislate on matters which have been placed under our jurisdiction, and many of these are mere transfers, is it not our duty to ask whether we can utilize the existing institutions and officials of the States 1 If the people could obtain satisfaction from their Judiciaries prior to federation, it is extraordinary that those institutions are to be cast aside by the Commonwealth in minor as well as in major matters, and that we are now to be told that they cannot give litigants satisfaction. If we adopt that attitude federation will not prove a blessing to the people of Australia. I desire that we shall not duplicate existing institutions where there is no absolute necessity for so doing. The honourable member for Darling Downs has asked why we should place the States at a disadvantage by requiring litigants and their witnesses to come to Melbourne or the Federal capital when it is created, in order to have the cases in which they are interested, determined. But as I understand this matter, if we make the Federal High Court a Court of Appeal only except as to those original matters which are provided for in the Constitution, we shall not require to bring witnesses from the different States. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has declared that if we limit the business of the court to appeals, and bo those matters in which it is vested wibh original jurisdiction under the Constibution, the work which the courb will be called upon bo discharge will be very light indeed. That being so, whab is bo prevenb the objection of the honourable and learned member for Darliug Downs being met by the court of Appeal visiting the various States'? Mr L . E . GHOOM - I b would be more expensive to take the whole courb bhan to take only one Judge.",54
331,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"If we allow that these Judges will nob obherwise find sufficient work to do, they will have ample opportunity for visiting the different States - Do not the Supreme Court Judges of the States go upon circuit? Why do they adopt that system ? Because it was contended that justice should be taken nearer to the homes of the people. If that argument is to carry weight, and if we insist that we should reserve all disputes in matters under the control of the Federal Government to the High Court, are we not bound to provide those that use that tribunal with facilities equal to those which have been provided by the Supreme Courts of the States ? That means that we must adopt the circuit system. It means that Newcastle, Goulburn, Wagga, Co-bar, and other places will have as good a claim to have the High Court made accessible to them as have the States capitals and as the State Supreme Court is now. As a matter of geography, the court when sitting in some of the States capitals will be nearer to the litigants in another State than will be the court in the capital of that State itself.",54
332,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"At Broken Hill , for stance ?",55
333,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Yes , and Imightf urther instance Albury and places in the northern portion of New South Walesin thatconnexion. It appears to me that by establishing the High Court in the form proposed, we shall not increase the opportunities for people getting justice speedily and rapidly. We should increase those opportunities infinitely more if we conferred the jurisdiction on the States Courts, and allowed them to deal with the questions in the first place. There is a clause in the Bill providing that certain cases go from the Sbates Courts to the High Court ; and, by thab, the latter should be a court of appeal to regulate and make decisions uniform and of original jurisdiction in the mabters provided by the Constitution. But we should not attempt to esbablish in every State a duplication of our present courts to deal with the same questions of trade and commerce, with matrimonial causes, Customs questions, and bankruptcies and obher mabters, which ab the presenb bime are efficiently dealt svibh by the Sbates Courbs.",55
334,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The honourable member would allow the Sbates Supreme Courts bo have all . the original jurisdiction which is vested compulsorily in the Federal Court.,55
335,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I would give the States Courts the fullest jurisdiction, and cases could go from the States Courts to the High Court, as they may now under the Bill .",55
336,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The honourable member has been told that there is no appeal from a single Judge in one case out of ten.,55
337,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Then there would not be an appeal from the Supreme Court in one case oub of ben. Are we bo imagine bhat each of the High Court Judges on circuib would be men so much superior bo the Sbates Courts Judges thab bhere would be no appeal from bheir decisions ? I cannot follow the argument thab, because it is deemed well bo establish a High Courb, we should give the Judges plenby of work when that work is being well done by the State J udges. If suitors have the opportunity of going to either court ib means that both musb be prepared to deal with a larger amount of business than would otherwise be necessary, as each musb be ready to handle almost the whole of the business if it chance bo come to ib; whereas with one courb bhere would be no need to provide for more than the average amount of work inin the particular State. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has said that the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South. Australia, Mr . Glynn, is in favour of centralization and not of decentralization. The proposal is nothing of the sort. The object of the Bill is bo cenbralize justice in each of the capitals ab mosb, while the proposal of the honourable and learned - memberis is nob bo cenbralize ab all, bub bo give the jurisdiction the full reach-no t only of the Supreme Courts, but bo all the minor courbs of each Sbate.",55
338,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Who will travel mosb bo> the inland bowns-bh e Supreme Courb Judges or the High Court Judges ?,55
339,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,I do not bhink ib is intended that the High Court Judges shall travel to the inland towns. Mr L . E . GROOM - If there be only three High Courb Judges they will nob be able to travel at all.,55
340,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,We have it on theauthority of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne thab the time of three Judges will not be fully occupied if the court is an appellate court only.,55
341,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"A good many honourable members agree with the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, that the appellabe jurisdiction of the High Court will keep ib very busilv occupied ' Mr THOMSON - In the"" face of such a difference of opinion bebween genblemen high in the legal profession, the best course for laymen is to ""go easy"" and start on a small scale, because we can always enlarge, while we cannot always reduce. The United States and Canada have been quoted as authorities on both sides ; but to me'those q uotations have not the slightest weight. In the first place, the conditions of the Constitution of the United States are different, and in the second place, we know what our Judiciary is at present, while we do not know what the Judiciary of the United States or of Canada was at the particular time. We know our own circumstances and needs, and the amount of money we already spend in this direction. I admit that our present judicial system is an admirable one, and that it costs a large sum of money, but I would rather it should cost too much and be effective, than cost little and be (he reverse. It is a great system which has met our needs thoroughly, and it would be utterly unwise to abandon it and set up rival courts, which, it appears, would have almost to tout for business. The Attorney General, glories in the fact that the Federal Court will offer such superior facilities that it will, attract business, but we can still keep in our hands the power of the High Court to control the decisions of the States Judges, and by giving the latter' Federal jurisdiction, have, as at present, the advantage of their experience. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs also alluded to'the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, whose speeches I heard with great interest and obtained much light from, as I did from those of other legal members, although I mav differ from some cf them in opinion. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs asked whether the honourable and learned member for Bendigowould approve of the removal of the Supreme Court circuit from that city on the score of expense. The answer to that is that there is no Supreme Court at Bendigo, and as certain cases have to be tried in that court, it is naturally desired that facilities should be provided on the spot. That argument, however, does not apply to the States, in each of which there is a Supreme Court which can be invested with Federal jurisdiction, and which has been doing the very work it is proposed to ask the High Court to do. Outside of the range which would be reached by the High Court, there are ' circuits - of the Supreme Courts which bring the jurisdiction nearer to the people than would the High Court. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs also alluded to the large number of subjects that would come before the High Court, subjects entering into almost all the affairs of the people of the Commonwealth. Do honourable members conceive that when we have passed laws dealing with all these subjects under the Constitution, five Judges will ever be able to handle the business, and also go on circuit throughout the States 1 It is absolutely ridiculous to ask the meanest lay intelligence to entertain such an idea. In each of the larger State capitals there is a Judge occupied solely with bankruptcy matters, and such a Judge could not be removed when cases have been partially heard. Then, in each of the States of New South Wales and Victoria there is a Judge almost entirely occupied with matrimonial cases, and allowing one Judge for the remaining States, three Judges musb devote themselves to that work alone.",55
342,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,I did not allude to that business.,56
343,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,But it is proposed that the High Courb shall deal with such business when we pass the necessary Acbs under the Constibution.,56
344,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Yes , when we pass the laws ; but not if we make no provision for the exercise of sueh jurisdicbion.",56
345,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"Then we are to go away from the High Courb principle after all. Under the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution we pass certain laws, and the High Courb is bo have jurisdicbion in cases arising under bhose laws, because they are cases arising under the Constitution, or under the laws passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. But the Attorney-General tells us by interjection "" When you pass obher laws, 3'ou need not put them under the jurisdiction of the High Court.""",56
346,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I pointed out in the course of my remarks that when the Commonwealth bakes conbrol of legislabion affecting bankrupbcy and insolvency, we shall need to make special provision to give the High Courb jurisdicbion in matters arising under the laws we may pass relating to those subjects. States I Mr THOMSON - That statement supports my argument bhat five Judges will be altogether insufficient for the work of the court - althoug h in these matters it is well to",56
347,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,For the work then conferred.,57
348,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"There is in that statement evidence that the step which we are' now taking will not be by any means the last step. We are now embarking upon an expense of which we cannot see the end, and in my opinion the only justification for it would be that it is unavoidable. But an excellent means for avoiding it already exists, a means which has met the needs of the people of Australia in the past, and of which it is ridiculous not to avail ourselves. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said that, not only would three Judges, if appointed as a Court of Appeal with the original jurisdiction provided for under the Constitution, have too little work to do, but their decisions would not carry weight, because in the State o£ Victoria it is not an uncommon thing - he does not say that it always happens-for six Judges to sit as a Court of Appeal. He regards it as a strange thing to accept the decision of three Judges as superior to that given by six. But if the superiority of a judgment depends upon the number of the Judges who decide the matter, we cannot stop at a court of five Judges ; we must appoint at least eight, because in one of the States there is now a Bench of seven Judges.",57
349,Mr CONUOY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"And inasmuch as eight is an even number, we ought to appoint nine, in order to provide for a majority where there.is a division of opinion.",57
350,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"In my opinion it is not the number of the Judges upon, the Bench that gives weight to the decision of a court. It is not even the fact that the members of the Court of Appeal are abler than the members of the court from which the appeals are made. It is that the Judges of the Court of Appeal have the advantage of the decisions and opinions of the inferior Judges upon the matters which come before them, have a longer opportunity to study the cases which are to be brought before them, and have more experience in connection with the particular questions upon which they adjudicate. When honourable and learned members refer to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, what they do is to pick out the judgments of particular Justices. An y one of the men whose opinions they quote would probably have a discussion by different minds-hav e constituted a satisfactory Court of Appeal. I have no faith in numbers giving weight to the decision of a court. I think that a court of three would give as great satisfaction to the people as a court of twenty.",57
351,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The honourable member * would nob provide for an appeal from a Bench of ten Judges to a single Judge ? 1,57
352,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,It is nob unusual bo appeal from more bhan-ben persons bo one umpire.,57
353,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,An umpire is not appointed until there is a difference of opinion. The honourable member would not provide for an appeal from ten unanimous Judges to a single Judge ? 1,57
354,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"larnnotadvocatingth e proprieby of appointing only one Judge bo the High Courb, bub if an appeal is nob bo be made from a large' Bench bo a small Bench, we cannot constitute a High Court wibh fewer bhan eighb Judges. Bub in appointing three Judges we gain these advanbages. Firsb of all, we do nob incur so heavy an expense in creating what is not, in any case, a complebe bribunal, if we appoinb bhree, as if we appoinb five Judges. Again, if the J udges appointed have a large amounb of time bo bhemselves, afber they have performed bheir duties as convenienbly bo the public as they can, bhat perhaps will nob be a disadvantage, because ib will enable bheiri bo give more sbudy to their cases, and will provide for speedy decisions, which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne regards as one of the righbs of the subject conferred by Magna Charta. If the arguments of those who support the Bill are right, we shall not lose the opportunity of ultimabely carrying out their views. If for the presenb we sbarb on more modesb lines bhan they propose, we can enlarge the original jurisdicbion of the court whenever the necessiby arises, if ib ever does, bo esbablish a Federal Judiciary which will bake the place of our present sysbem. Bub once we step out on the lines laid down in the Bill, we are committed to the fullest extent We establish the court, and try to attract to it the cases which arise under the measures passed by us. In doing so we make more work for it, and the fact that the court is in existence, and is attracting work, will mean that we shall have demands from the .people to bring its jurisdiction nearer to them. In this way we shall subsequently be required to enlarge its circuit, and an expenditure will be required the amount of which it is impossible now to name, but which will be infinitely beyond the estimate which has been given. For these reasons I support a limitation of the origiinil jurisdiction of the court, and with such a limitation I cannot see any reason for the appointment of more than three - Judges. In making this arrangement, we rob the people of nothing. They will still have that system of jurisdiction in which they have gained confidence, and which now deals with nearly all the matters for which it is proposed to ' establish High Courts in each State. Beyond the present judiciaries they will have, if they choose to avail themselves of it, the High - Court as a Court of Appeal to equalize decisions, and to give a final Australian voice. The Privy Council will exist as a further Court of Appeal under either .system. Under these circumstances we shall be neglecting the best interests of the - Commonwealth, and giving ground for some of the attacks which have been made upon the. Federation, if we abandon the means of obtaining justice already established amongst us; which extend not merely to the capitals of the different States, but from end to end of this vast continent. Mi'. WILKS (Dalley) - The Attorney General must be able to see that the Bill is still out of favour with honourable members, and I trust that he will make up his mind to withdraw it. The whole principle of the Bill is being fought over and over again in connection with this clause. The word "" jurisdiction "" has been ringing in our ears, and, as if in order to more thoroughly confuse the public mind, we have had the terms ""original jurisdiction"" and ""compulsory original jurisdiction"" hurled at us from all directions. The Government succeeded in passing the Bill at the second reading stage'by bringing an extraordinarj' amount of pressure to bear. The party for -"" the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill "" was made up of Ministers themselves, whilst the majority of their loyal supporters belonged to what may be called the party of modification. The latter section of honourable members did not agree with the proposal to appoint five Judges, and expressed their intention to modify the Bill by reducing the strength of the proposed Bench. Surely in view of the way in which the debate has proceeded thus far, the Government must see that the Bill will probably emerge from Committee in such a mutilated form that it will be of little practical use, and that they will save the public time and money if the} withdraw7 it at the present stage. We find, in this case, that the lawyers are differing among themselves, and, to paraphrase an old proverb, it is to be hoped that ""Where lawyers differ the public may hold their own."" It is true that the great majority of the lawyers in this Chamber are fighting against the establishment of the High Court or the proposed extension of its jurisdiction.' The only honourable and learned members outside of the ranks of the Ministry who have supported the measure are the honourable and learned member for Indi . and the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. The latter honourable and learned member may be considered the political god-father of the Government, whose dutj might very well have 7 been considered at an end when he moved the adoption of the Address in Reply.",57
355,Mr DEAKIN,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The honourable member for Illawarra is also a supporter of the Bill .,58
356,Mr WILKS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The honourable and learned member's support was only half-hearted.,58
357,Mr MAUGER,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Then there is the leader of the Opposition.,58
358,Mr WILKS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The honourable and learned member for East Sydney is such a warm supporter of the Bill that he has felt, constrained to absent himself from the Chamber for a fortnight. Perhaps his conscience is pricking him, and he cannot see his way to venture here. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has asked most pathetically-""When lawyers differ, what is a poor layman to do 1"" My answer is- "" Remain poor-if you pass this Bill . "" I desire to direct the attention of the Committee to some opinions which were expressed by the Minister for Trade and Customs in opposition to a Bill of the character now before us. The right honourable gentleman, when speaking at the Convention at Melbourne, in 1898, saidWe should, above all in the early stages of the Constitution of this Federation, be careful lest we involve the Commonwealth in an unnecessary expense-in expense which is altogether out of proportion to the necessities of the case. It seems to me bhat, although this Bill is in a preferable shape to that in which it originally saw the light, in that it contains no appropriaof tion, within the four corners of the Constitution, of any huge sums for Judicial salaries, j'et, if we do not carry an amendment, such as is suggested (by Mr Glynn), we shall takeaway the Commonwealth a facile means of providing that is required at least in the earliest period of the or 20 Judges. history of the Constitution, at the least possible expense. The honourable and learned member for Indi has drawn a very pretty picture what might take place in the High Court, but he has not shown the necessity for the tribunal. I will again quote from the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs, was then a lawyer in full practice, an eminent constitutional authority, and President of the Convention.",58
359,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Canno t the honourable ber see the difference between framing a Conit useless. stitution and acting upon the Constitution?,59
360,Mr WILKS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"1 fully understand am now quoting the opinions held by Kingston, which should stand good even today. Mr Kingston is reported to have saidThe fitting solution, I think, is found in the proposition of my friend, Mr Glynn, which is that there shall be a representation of both Chief Justice of Australia, the highest the Commonwealth responsible to the Federation, and the other Judges, more numerous, selected on account of the positions which they occupy in respect to the provinces. I would like, further, to say that I think there is nothing in the contention that the Chief Justices different provinces would be unwilling to positions of the description suggested. I know of no higher position in the gift of the Federal authority than the position of Judge of the Court in Australia.",59
361,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,What did the Convention decide ?,59
362,Mr WILKS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I have not had time to go through the whole of the report, but I am simply giving honourable members the benefit of the remarks made by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Most of the people Australia, hope never to have to go beyond the police court, or even to reach and they must be appalled at the idea that still another court is to be added to the have his joke. already formidable array of tribunals at present in existence in Australia. I that the salaries paid to the Supreme Court Judges in New South Wales amount to out -£21,700 per annum, whilst the annual appropriations for a similar purpose in other States are as follow : - Victoria £18,500, Queensland £11,500, South Ausutilize tralia £5,400, Western Australia £5,900, and Tasmania £3,900, making a total £66,900 for salaries alone. The list of States Judges includes 6 Chief Jusnow tices, and 22 Puisne Judges : and over and from - above these it is now proposed to erect a all marvellous Federal combination of 5, 10, The Attorney-General apparently desires that the High Court should have extended jurisdiction, and that the Judges should tout for business against of the various courts now established. They are to expose their wares like shopkeepers in order to entice litigants to leave the States Courts and entrust their business to the who Federal tribunal. In view of the feeling which has been evinced towards the Bill the both inside this Chamber and out of it, I shall consider it my duty to endeavour memto so whittle its provisions as to make The cry for economy has been described . by the Prime Minister that I as a miserable one, but it is miserMr able only to those who would like to secure a seat on the High Court Bench. All the predictions of the anti-Billites are being absolutely fulfilled. Mr L . E . GROOM - As a federalist the the honourable member knew that a High Court officer in would be established.",59

The District and County Court Judges throughAustralia absorb.£22,000 , and the law officers £118,431, of which Victoria pays the £20,440. The sheriffs receive £51,062. Of course, we are told that the High Court can theservicesof thesheriffs of thevai-iousStates, together with buildings which areowned by the States Governments. But I cannot accept that statement. If the High Court is to be such an exalted tribunal, how can ib use second-hand officers. Are we to have a High Court, the officers of which are to be dressed up in second-hand clothes % The Masters-in-Equity throughoub Australia receive £16,342, of which New Soubh Wales conbribubes £7,650, and Vicboria £8,692.

That is the amounb which aboub 700,000 adulbs pay for the administration of justice, exclusive of police probection. I predicb that upon the esbablishmenb of bhis bribunal the courts will be found bo overlap in their jurisdiction. Moreover, the full number of Judges constituting the High Court will not be able bo go upon circuit, and will the Justices who can do so be any better qualified to. give decisions upon cases which come before them than are the Supreme Courb Judges of the States'? I intend upon every possible occasion to oppose this Bill, with the object of destroying ibs efficacy. I trust thab the arguments which have been advanced in favour of economy will not be again characterized as "" miserable."" Those ardent federalists who desire the Commonwealth to be respecbed, and who wish it to acquire further powers from the States, ought to remember that every extravagant act in which we indulge will be an obstacle to our progress in that direction. One reason why the High Court should not be invested with additional jurisdiction is that before a man can appeal to it his claim must exceed £300. Consequently, admiss i o n to that tribunal is not open to the masses. It is all very well bo say that the Federation should be properly plumed. It sounds very exalted to say so, but the public who have to bear the expense ought to be considered. I would further point out that the Minister for Trade and Customs, when a member of the Federal Convention, advocated practically everything which the opponents of this Bill have urged bo-night. ""If ever there was a vote recorded in this House which was uninfluenced by party considerations, it was that cast upon the second reading of bhis Bill, and I brusb that the same feeling will prevail throughout its discussion in Committee.

I notice that the Government whip is anxious to get the measure through. Will he be as anxious to tell his constibuenbs that ib will involve the appointmenb of ben, twenty, or 25 Judges ? Ib is of no use saying that somany Judges will nob be appointed. The legal members themselves, who are impartial on the subject, have exposed the whole business. They say that the cry is for more and more legal machinery, and more and more courts and Judges. So it will be in the case of the High Court. The Attorney-General himself admitted at the second reading stage that it was intended to appoint five Judges ""for a start."" When we give them more jurisdiction more will be wanted. The honourable member for North Sydney has sbabed that eighb or ben will be required, and the Abborney-General did nob deny ib. There are so many oub of the 25 I have mentioned. The honourable and learned member for Soubh Australia, Mr Glynn, has quoted a number of eminent authorities on this question. He quoted, amongst others, that eminent American writer, Gooley. There is no betber aubhoriby. The honourable and learned member for Indi, who is so well acquainbed wibh the consbibutional writers, must have had many of his opinions shattered when Gooley was quoted. Some one interjected that Mr Dooley ought to be quobed. Mr Dooley, who is an excellent judge of human nature, would be a good aubhoriby bo quote on the present occasion. It is a. pity in the interests of the Commonwealth that we have not got a Dooley here. Under cover of his humour Mr Dooley exposes many abuses surdities, and he would be a powerful - and useful member of this Chamber in posing such abuses as will arise in connection with the High Court. It was said by who opposed federation that it was merely - a game for the benefit of a gang of lawyers. I would not use such a phrase in this ber, but it almost deserves to be used, ticularly as we have reason for that; the appointees to the High Court will be chosen from what are called men of Parthe liamentary experience, acquainted with the the whole party. Federal idea. What right have we to give jurisdiction to men of that character? I to understand that the Chief Justices of Australia-men like Sir Samuel Samuel Way, and Chief J ustice Darley, who are of the very highest repute in their States - are not competent to carry out judicial duties for the Commonwealth? understand that those men are not head and shoulders above the persons alluded to as possessing parliamentary experience and acquaintance with the Federal idea? The most disinterested Judge, and one of the greatest federalists in Sir Samuel Griffith, has told us that no High Court is required yet. That is a very excellent reason for opposing the extension of this jurisdiction. members of the House who have opposed this Bill are entitled to the thanks of the community. T especially allude to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the honourable and learned tomember for Corinella, and the honourable and learned member for South Mr Glynn. Some of them have voted against their party because they knew there was no necessity for the measure. I deeply regret that I have not the legal training which will enable me to oppose it as effecthe tively as I should like to do. Why have the labour party been so significantly silent All I have heard from them was an interfive to three. jection from their leader, who said that for constitutional reasons, constitutional tions ought to be settled by the High Court. Sutely we have a right to expect a more definite expression of opinion the subject from them. Probably honourable member for Bland is possessed information to the effect that this High Court would confer benefits upon the section of the community which he represents. Mr IVUks.",60

I believe the Federal Parliament will be of the opinion that a Chief Justice and two Judges will be all that are required for many a long day, and when the necessity arises, they will have full power to increase the number. The reasons given by those two honourable gentlemen are as good today as they were then, and it is an important fact that the number of Judges was reduced from five to three.",61

385,Mr CONROY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"We cannot get away from the fact that two members of the Ministry, both legal men, and anxious for economy, expressed the opinion that three Judges would be sufficient. There is no necessity to labour the point, but honourable members ought to be reminded that when they vote for the retention of this clause, they, in effect, are voting not only for five Judges, but for a great many more, evert to the number of ten. As far back as 1891, the number of Judges actually proposed by Sir Henry Parkes was ten, and if that number was required for the jurisdiction then proposed it is required to day.  regret very much that the Attorney-General will not concede the request made by a great many honourable members, because he must have seen, from the tone of the debate, thab the opposition to this particular portion of the Bill has not come from this side alone. If we create bhis additional work for the High Court we shall to that extent relieve the Sbabes Courbs, and we should be very careful nob to duplicate jurisdiction which is already sabisfacborily exercised by the latter. The Constitution is mandatory up to a certain point; bub I believe that the creation ofpowers for the High Court at the expense of the Sbates Courbs would be resenbed bhroughout Australia, because, so far from being a decrease, ib means an increase in expenditure. In Australia, wibh a handful of people, the Judicial system today costs close upon £600,000 per annum, or nearly as much as the cosb of the whole of our defence forces. Under the circumstances ib is no wonder thab oubside bhere is agitabion for econony. The honourable member for Norbh Sydney has shown in as good a speech as has been delivered on the Bill, that the proposal of the Government is wrong ""lock, stock, and barrel.""' While I believe a court of some kind is essential, I am of opinion thab we have J udges in Australia quite capable of exercising the jurisdiction, and thab bheir services oughb to be utilized. But the decision come bo lasb week has made thab course impossible, and honourable members are reasonable when they consent to give the court the powers provided in the Constitution, bub no further powers.",62
386,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION," No doubb honourable members are anxious bo proceed bo a division, but this is a question of such vibal importance to the whole of Australia that it is well to discuss it more in detail. I do not claim to speak with any legal knowledge as to the merits of the different proposals which have been made, bub I can claim bo be able bo express an opinion as to the effect the Bill will have, in ibs economic aspecb, on the general community. As the honourable and learned member for Norbhern Melbourne has. already poinbed oub, the Governmenb proposal means, simply, bringinga second dentist to operate when one is ample, and creating a new and increasing permanenb item of expendibure. This is only the beginning of a number of similar proposals bo be considered bhis session, and I desire ab bhis, and every sbage of the Bill, to enter my emphatic probesb againsb incurring this increased permanent expenditure. Gentlemen whom we recognise as authorities have told us thab bhere is justification for the Bill, while obher equally competent authorities have, wibh as much emphasis, informed us thab no justification exisbs. When doctors differ in a matter of the kind, the best course is to place the pabienb in charge of the most competent nurse to be found; and it is time the laymen of the Committee exercised their ""right to devote a little time to the consideration of whab is the proper course bo pursue. As I poinbed oub on a previous occasion, ib was the aspiration of a great many Ausbralians, as represenbed in the Convention, that we should have an Australian Courb of final appeal. The Convention in. bheir wisdom did nob see fit to carry out that desire. When they drew up the original draft of the Constitution they provided for the establishment of a court to deal with all Australian matters, but having framed bhat elaborate machinery to deal with conditions which really did not - exist, they forgot when putting the finishing touches on the Constitution, to reduce it in any way. Some of the represenbabive members of the Convention saw fib to point oub, towards the close of its proceedings, thab in bheir judgmenb it was unnecessary bhen to create an - elaborate court, involving considerable expense, to discharge functions which were already being carried out by a very efficient tribunal. That fact has been repeated this evening by authorities in this Committee, and nothing I could say would emphasize the point they have made. I have heard no argument which would justify me in supporting at the present time the establishmenb of the High Courb wibh all this elaborabe machinery for original jurisdiction. Ib has been poinbed oub that ib will nob cause justice to be more speedily or cheaply obtainable by any citizen of the Commonwealth. That being so, I am at a loss to understand the reasons which impel the Attorney-General to follow the course he is now pursuing. It may be that the ideals held by him, as well as by the Prime Minister, are albogebher above the level of the average citizen of Australia, and that we cannob follow bhem; bub we all know that States Governments are restricted ab presenb in bheir operations by their financial position. That being so it behoves us when dealing with exaebly the same people bo consider whether we should not hesitate before imposing any further burdens upon them until the necessiby of doing so is esbablished. ""We have had sbabemenbs made from differenb sband-points, wibh a view of showing that the necessity exisbs, bub no evidence of sufticienb force, has been given to justify what has been termed a nominal expenditure of £30,000 o)j a High Court. That cost within a few years will increase to at least £50,000 per annum. Ib may nob appear bo be much bo a Governmenb who are dealing wibh a revenue of millions per annum, but ib is bhis fixing of permanent expenditure that in the pasb has proved a source of trouble to the Sbabes Governmenbs.",62
387,Mr WILKINSON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Cannob correspondingly reduce the expendibure on their Judiciaries %,63
388,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,That hope was held oub bo many people when we were asked to accept federation.,63
389,Mr WILKS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,It was a bait.,63
390,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Exactly. I was foolish enough to plead that it would be possible to reduce the cost of the States judicial systems.,63
391,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,The bait will not take this time.,63

393,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,Kyabram . has decided againsb bhis proposal.,63
394,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"The question is nob whab Kyabram has done; and as a matter of fact I have not been an enthusiastic supporter of the Kyabram proposals. The only argument put forward' in support of bhis Bil l is that advanced by the Attorney General, that the judgments of this court may at some future time attract business to ib. Is that a sufficient ground to support the creation of a court upon which the present expenditure will be nearly £30,000 per annum ? It offers no justification whatever. We have also to remember that this is not the only item of permanent expenditure with which the Government propose bo deal bhis session. We have obher infanbs coming along in swaddling clothes-bh e Inter-Stabe Commission, for example.",63
395,Mr MCCAY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,And the appoinbmenb of a High Commissioner.,63
396,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"That appointment may be absolutely necessary, but I am notdealing with it now. These various proposals will involve a very considerable expenditure, and we must deal with each on its merits. In bhis mabter it would be well to hasten slowly. W it h all due deference to the Attorney-General, I would appeal to him to accept the suggestion which has been thrown out, and to agree to the omission of the clause extending, so to speak, the jurisdiction of the court. ""Unless thab is done we shall have to fight the Bil l righb bhrough. As a Governmenb supporter I feel very sbrongly aboub this matber, and it was wibh considerable relucbance that I opposed the second reading of the Bill . I have no libble sympabhy wibh the Governmenb general]y, and because I have a full knowledge of the the States facbs, I am in sympabhy wibh some of their administrative acts which have meb wibh considerable condemnation on the part of the press. Ib will be seen, blierefore, that ib is wibh some reluctance thab I felt impelled bo enber my probesb againsb the incur'ring of bhis expendibure; and I appeal bo the Attorney-General, even at this stage, say that he will accept the suggestion.",63
397,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,We are all ready for a division.,64
398,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"I do not feel ready for a division to be taken on this question. During the second - reading debate I pointed out that honourable members sitting behind a Government are often induced to support the second reading of a measure because of a desire to avoid giving that Government a slap in the face; but during the complications which may subsequently ensue in Com'mittee, those who are opposed to the Bill generally, but who have voted for the second reading because of these considerations, are frequently defeated. That is why I took the first opportunity enter my protest against this proposal. I has already been pointed out that the five Judges whom it is proposed to appoint would not meet the requirements of this clause. We huve been told that instead of a court of five Judges, with a maximum expendiindispensability ture of £30,000 a year, we Bhall require court of ten Judges, with an expenditure amounting to anything between £50,000 entered and £100,000 a year. However, jts the hour is late, and I do not wish to detain honourable members, I shall take the next opportunity that offers for expressing my opinion on this subject.",64
399,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR REBATE ABOLITION,"South Sydney). - I think it was inevitable that the debate on this clause should become practically second reading debate, because of affairs has changed since a majority carried the Bill into Committee. We are now considering the details of the measure, and have come to the parting of the ways, and I feel it necessary to occupy a few minutes in explaining my own position.' When the Bill was introduced last session, I confess that I did not know how to 'vote in regard to it. I am one of those who look upon the Constitution as worthy almost of veneration, and I was prepared to go to almost any lengths to carry its provisions into effect. I looked upon the - establishment of the High Court in some form as absolutely necessary to keep faith with the framers of the Constitution, and I was, therefore, constrained to be very careful how I committed myself to take any part against the Bill . I was ttien prepared to agree to the appointment of the Chief Justices of the States as an interim arrangement during the initial stages of to Federation. But after I had committed myself to that temporary expedient, the Government practically withdrew the measure. Since then so long a period has elapsed that it seems necessary to me to make some permanent provision to obtain an interpretation of the difficult points which have already arisen, and which must arise in the future in regard to the meaning of the Constitution. Therefore, I listened very carefully to the speech of the Attorney-General, and, in common with other lay members, derived great assistance from the able state-. ments of the other legal members who spoke. Having listened carefully to those speeches, I came to the conclusion that the creation of a High Court to exercise the functions conto templated by the Constitution was inevitt able, and to that extent I am entirely in accord with the proposal of the Government. The Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, and the honourable and learned member for Indi demonstrated very fully the absolute of a High Court of some a kind, and therefore I paired for the second reading of the Bill . But now that we have upon the consideration of the details of-the measure, I am face to face with a number of minor difficulties. In keeping faith with the Constitution, we may go further than its provisions require us to go, and create a body which will be too expensive for our present purposes and circumstances. However, as I understand that it is the wish of the Government to a report progress now, I will continue my the position speech tomorrow. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.57 p.m.",64
