1,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from Minister if he has seen the statethis morning's Argus, that a probeen made to alter the law with the admission of Japanese to the there is any truth in the sugput forward by the writer of the article to which I refer? Will the honourable and learned gentleman state what are the intentions of the Government in this matter?",12
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The newspaper article referred to is largely built up of an historical account of what has already happened. Reference is made to the old correspondence between Mr Eitaki, when Consul-General for Japan, and Sir Edmund Barton, which has been laid on the table, and part of it is correctly re-printed. The statements of what has taken place recently are not so correct. I may mention, in passing, that Mr Eitaki ceased to be Consul-General for Japan two or three years ago, the present' acting Consul-General being Mr Iwasaki. Towards the end of the article, it is stated thatThe negotiations have been conducted by correspondence and personal interviews, and-it is understood that they are to some extent based upon a concession which the Commonwealth authorities made to Indian subjects some months ago. That statement is only partly correct. When Minister of External Affairs, on a former occasion, the Government of which I was Prime Minister communicated, of its own volition, with the Japanese Consul-General, in order to arrive at some understanding whereby visitors from Japan, whether tourists or traders, could be received into this country for the purposes of their visits without being subjected to the education test. It was arranged that passports might be issued to such persons by the Japanese Government, on presentation of which they would be freely admitted. Those negotiations were completed by the Government of which the honourable member for Bland was the head, and the arrangement so entered into has since been in force. During the whole of that time on only two occasions-so far as we know-hav e passports teen abused. Inquiry is being made in regard to both cases, the acting Consul General for Japan showing every anxiety to prevent the arrival in Australia of persons of doubtfiul character.",13
3,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The passports are given only to traders and visitors, and have force only for a reasonable time.",13
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes. They are not given to persons who wish to reside in the Commonwealth.,13
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,How long may those who have passports remain in Australia?,13
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That depends on the purpose of their visit. Having originated this arrangement, I lately re-opened negotiations - not with the Government of Japan, because matters have not yet reached the stage in which that Government have come. into touch with us, but with the Consul General for Japan-to see if it would not be possible to extend the passport system to classes of persons other than those to whom it now applies, so that there might be no obstacle to persons of either nation visiting the country of the other. Of course, I desired to preserve the existing law, and to make no change of policy in regard to Japanese wishing to become permanent residents of the Commonwealth. My aim was not as stated to extend to the Japanese an arrangement already made .with the Government of India, because facilities for the issue of passports to the people of both Japan and India were given under the same conditions, at precisely the same time, and the people of Japan have been in enjoyment of the arrangement for the last twelve or sixteen months. It is not correct to say that we are now thinking of applying to Japan any arrangement which we have made with the Government of India. The next statement in the newspaper article is thatThe negotiations have disclosed a desire upon the part of the Japanese Government to limit the number of immigrants from Australia. No such proposition has been submitted to this Government, either directly or indirectly, by the Consul-General for Japan.",13
7,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Govermnent of Japan has always disclaimed any desire for immigrants from Australia.,13
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is quite correct. The newspaper article makes the converse assertion, but I have never heard' of any such suggestion from Japan. With regard to the declaration thatThe Prime Minister desires to remodel the Act * so as to avoid hurting the susceptibilities of the Japanese, by not insisting that immigrants from Japan shall be able to "" write out at dictation, and sign in the presence of the (federal) officer, a passage of fifty words in length in an European language directed by the officer ""that is quite correct, so far as it applies to a possible extension of the passport system to visitors coming here as students, tourists, or traders; but it is true only to that limited extent. The facts, 1 therefore, are that the Government is not yet in a position to inform the House, or even to arrive at any decision in regard lo this matter, because the correspondence - so far has been only between myself and the Consul-General of Japan; 88 8 Personal",13
9,Mr WILKS,Unknown,A r e not the Opposition in this ? The Prime Minister is addressing his remarks entirely to one corner of the Chamber.,14
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When a question has been put to me, it is my habit in replying' to address principally the questioner.",14
11,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable and learned genlleman is addressing his lords and masters.,14
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I address my lords and masters, the people of the Commonwealth, amongst whom, to the extent of about a four-millionth part, the honourable member is included. I have not yet been able to come into touch with the Government of Japan, but it is true, as I have more than once informed the House, that, in considering the amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act, it is not merely the contract labour section which has been under review. I have made that clear by three or four answers to questions given in this Chamber, and by statements which I have made elsewhere. If it be found possible, as I think it is, to restate the general principles of our immigration restriction policy in another form, without altering their substance, so as to avoid hurting the susceptibilities of the people of Japan, or of any other people, I , for one, shall be only too happy to propose it . That, however, can be done only with the consent of Parliament.",14
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable and learned gentleman is making an endeavour to do it ?,14
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes . I may inform the House that in the very first letter directed to the Consul-General of Japan, re-opening the subject, I took occasion to point out to him that I held out no prospect of an alteration of the policy of the Commonwealth embodied in the Immigration Restriction Act ; that what we are willing to - consider is the form in which effect shall be given to that policy. I trust that in any legislative embodiment of Commonwealth policy we shall always endeavour to express it in such a form as not to convey any reflection on those whom it may affect. PERSONAL EXPLANATION . M i . HIGGINS (Northern Melbourne) I wish to make a personal explanation in regard to the report in today's Argus of the deLate yesterday on my motion in favour of Home Rule. In regard to the splitting [REPRESENTATIVES.] Explanation. of the motion into three parts, the Argus saysMr Watson suggested that the three paragraphs of the motion should be put separately. Mr . Higgins objected to this, but when a division was taken, it was decided by 37 votes to 18 that the Speaker should split up the niotion. Any one reading that statement would think that I had voted against the splitting up of the motion, whereas I voted for it. I think it was a good idea, and the best thing that could have been done under the circumstances, so that I am under an obligation to the honourable member for Bland for having suggested it. With reference to the vote on the second paragraph, the Argus says that it was only after the second paragraph had ibeen dropped out that it dawned uponMr Higgins and his supporters that they had voted against portion of the motion which they wished to pass. I need hardly tell honourable members that the reverse of that statement is true. When I found that I was not able to substitute a motion for a petition, in order to meet the views of some honourable members who were friendly to my proposal as a whole, I determined to go for a petition, but to drop out the second paragraph of the motion in deference to the wishes of certain - honourable members, and I voted for that. As my friends and I crossed to the left of the chair, in order to vote for the striking out of the second paragraph, our opponents by mistake crossed to the right of the chair. Several of them found out their mistake, and recrossed the Chamber in time to rectify it , a noble quartette stubbornly adhering to their first decision. This same journal has thought fit, during the present week, to say that I appear in the Chamber day after day at the beginning of the sittings of the House, and leave directly afterwards. I wish to say that that is very often quite true. I , in common with a number of honourable members, do not feel - it incumbent upon us to sit here listening to debates which are meant merely to waste time.",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member is entitled, in making a personal explanation, to deal with his own actions, but «he is not entitled to reflect, even impliedly, upon those of other honourable members.",14
16,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I reflected upon no honourable member; I named no one. Mr SYDNEY SMiTH -^-The honourable and learned member reflected on the House.,14
17,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,No . Honourable members will always turn up in good numbers if there is solid work to be done.,15

34,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," It has been the practice ever since this Parliament was for the Minister in charge of the Defence Estimates to make a general statement for the information of honourable members. I know of no reason why that custom should be departed from. It appears to me that the need of such a stateis as great today as it ever has been. A number of details, as well as questions policy connected with the Estimates, require explanation, and I should like to know whether the Minister intends to exhibit the courtesy which has hitherto been extended to the Committee. By following usual practice, the Minister will facilibusiness considerably. I desire to be made acquainted with the Ministerial view of .a number of matters, and I was 'mucb surprised at the failure of the Minister to open the discussion in the usual way.",15
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I also invite the Minister to make a statement with regard to the intentions of the Government upon defence matters. ture to say that if he takes the Committee into his confidence, and treats honourable members with consideration and courtesy, he will make much better progress with the work before him than did his more stubborn and unreasoning colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs. I can conceive of no more serious obligation than that which rests upon the Minister in charge of these Estimates to make known the intentions of the Government in regard to the important question of. defence. Speaking in the Town H all , Sydney, recently, the Minister indicated that the Government intended to Bring down an enti.relv new scheme of defence, which he hoped would prove acceptable to all parties in Australia. Although I fully appreciate the capacity of the Minister to. ingratiate himself even with his opponents, I doubt whether he will be p'Me to satisfy - all parties concerned by means of any new scheme. I wish to know whether the Government contemplate a complete overturn of the Defence Department. I must enter my protest against anv further tinkering. It is no wonder that the public are disgusted with the Defence administration - We are inaugurating a new system every twelve months, and changes occur so frequently that no scheme can be fairly tested. No system could withstand that constant tinkering.",16
36,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The same thing is happening in everv country.,16
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , it is not. In other countries broad lines of policy are laid down, and there is change ' and adaptation and open-mindedness regard only to the great political, diplomatic, and scientific changes that are taking place in all parts of the globe. These changes do not affect the fundamental principles of defence. desire to know whether the Ministry contemplate the elaboration of an entirely new scheme, or intend to more speedily perfect our present system, which, I understand, was inaugurated by Major General Hutton, and which is admitted to be an effective scheme of land defence.",16
38,Mr WATSON,Unknown,As far as it goes.,16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactly . I submit that it contains the nucleus of as perfect a scheme as we are likely to be able to afford for some years to come. We were told by the honourable and learned member for Corinella that, in order to carry out I ven- Major-General Hutton's scheme, we s'hould have to spend £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 upon armaments, and in other directions, and I think that it would be a scandalous thing if before that work were completed the Government were for anere purposes of popularity to bring down yet another new-fangled plan. If the Minister is able to challenge the present system, and say that it neither meets the wishes of the people nor the necessities of Australia, we are open to hear his arguments, but I think it is time that we set our faces against any changes for mere, political or popular purposes.",16
40,Mr WATSON,Unknown,A change for popular purposes may be justified.,16
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have nqt noticed any special public demonstration in favour of a change except a ' vague general appeal for the training of Australian soldiers. That wish might be gratified without bringing down an entirely new scheme to replace that which is now in process of development. I invite the M i nister to make clear the intentions of the GoI f so, vernment. My own opinion is that instead of going on as we are doing with regard to our land defences, we should pay special attention to our coastal defences.",16
42,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I hope that we shall be able to give attention to both branches.,16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But financial considerations may render it necessary to deal with one part of the problem at a time.,16
44,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The necessity for making provision for coastal defence is pressing, and there are no insuperable financial difficulties. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I quite agree with that we should give our attention to the very military, important subject of coastal defences. We have already provided for an army of 25,000 men in peace and 40,000 men in war time. I think that if we are able to send I out a thoroughly equipped army of 40,000 men against any force which is likely to come here, we need have no anxiety as to the sufficiency of our land! defences. A well-equipped army of that size would, in my judgment, be able to meet all the contingencies that are likely to arise in Australia for some years. Therefore, I think that we should do well to put. our o coastal defences in as perfect state as possible consistent with the resources at our disposal. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to make an explicit statement as to what the Ministry propose. Such a statement has been rendered all the more necessary by the remarks which the Prime Minister has constantly been making of late, indicting our present system. We ought to be informed whether it is proposed to entirely supersede that system.",16
45,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," When the Works and Buildings Estimates were before the Committee, they were passed-so far as those relating to defence matters were concerned-wit h very little debate upon the Prime Minister undertaking that before the session closed a complete statement would be made as to what was intended in regard to warlike stores. I hope that the honourable and learned gentleman will redeem that promise today.",17
46,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That , matter cannot come up for discussion here, but it must be discussed when any change that we may propose is submitted to the House.",17
47,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister promise that it shall be brought forward before the close of the session?,17
48,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Certainly .,17
49,Mr BROW N,Unknown," I trust that the Minister will deal with the question of our defences somewhat exhaustively before we are called upon to pass these Estimates in detail. The Defence Department is one of the most important under the control of the Commonwealth. A considerable expenditure is incurred-in' its working, and it cannot be regarded as a revenue-producing department in any sense. As a matter of fact, it involves a huge drain upon the resources of the Commonwealth. What I desire to know is how the money which we vote for defence purposes is being expended? The Minister has intimated that a revision of the existing scheme is now under consideration. Recently, various officers of the department have indulged in a good deal of criticism of that scheme. Statements are being constantly made which are in no way complimentary to it . Under existing conditions the possibility of extendarm ing that branch of the service which is known as the Australian Light Horse- a branch which is very popular indeed-is exceedingly limited. The Department, it appears, is not open to consider any further applications to extend that arm of our defence. In the town of Condobolin, in my own elec[ 3i]- 2 r a torate, a volunteer company has been working for the past two years. That town is the centre of a large agricultural and pastoral district, which contains a number of young men who are very proficient horsemen. Some of them served in the Boer war, and one of their number was sent home from South Africa as a representative volunteer to the King's Coronation. These men have formed a company with a view to securing their enrolment in the Light Horse. But although they have made repeated applications in that direction during the past two and a half years, the Department declares that under the present system they cannot be enrolled, because the limit fixed for that arm of the service has already been reached. All that it can do is to enrol this company as a rifle club. It seems to me that that is not a satisfactory position. We ought to endeavour as far as possible to encourage the development of a citizen soldiery. I hope that in any revision of the present scheme the embargo of which I complain will be removed, and that' every, encouragement will be given to the formation inland o.f companies of Light Horse. I do not think that the adoption of such a policy would add materially to the expense of the Department. Apparently a conflict has arisen between the permanent branch of our defence force and our citizen soldiers. Because this Parliament in its wisdom insisted that the permanent staff should be reduced to the lowest limit compatible with efficiency, and that our citizen soldiers should be encouraged, a scheme has been formulated which requires the number of permanent officers in the service to be increased proportionately to the increase in the number of citizen soldiers.",17
50,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The scheme does not laythat down.,17
51,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"It looks very like it . One of the big objections urged against the enrolment in the Light Horse of the company to which I have referred is that the Department cannot entertain any application for a further extension of that of the service until provision has been made for an increase of the permanent staff. ,",17
52,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"If we increase the number of Light Horse, we must have more sergeant-majors to instruct them.",17
53,Mr BROWN,Unknown,I admit that. I recognise that a certain amount of supervision \ must be exercised. But surely the expenjustices diture involved in the supervision of a few extra corps of Light Horse would not be of such a character as to place an embargo upon their establishment.,17
54,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They cost about £ 1 5 per head.,18
55,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"I have been authorized by the members of the company to which [ have already alluded to submit to the Minister a proposal under which - if 1 their application be grantedthey shall, not be granted any pay. officers But the Department is not prepared notwithstanding to entertain even that proposal. The most that it will do is to consider whether will register the company as a rifle club. In doing so I think it is moving in the right direction, because such clubs doubtedly encourage efficient marksmanhave ship. Indeed, if we are to judge by the utterances of leading military authorities in the old world-suc h men as Lord that Roberts-this branch of defence should ceive more attention than it has hitherto done. The matter referred to by the deputy leader of the Opposition T- that .of our naval and harbour defences-is an important one. Whilst it is desirable that we should instruct and equip our able-bodied men with a view to securing as efficient an army of citizen soldiers as'is possible, should be acting very unwisely if we neglected to make provision for the tection of our harbors and for naval defence. Our danger, it must be recogtablish nised, is an external one. I trust that Minister will place before the Committee a full statement of the Government intento tions in respect to any contemplated provements in our system of defence.",18
56,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown," 1 should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to give us some idea of the inbeing tentions of the Government concerning appointment of an inspector-general our Military Forces. I would suggest that in making a permanent appointment to position they should, if possible, select Australian in preference to an imported officer. I think that an opportunity should be afforded Australians to rise to the est position in the Military Forces.",18
57,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown," out of his own pocket. There are a good many matters which have not been touched upon by previous speakers, not merely regarding the reorganization our Defence Forces, but the administration of this Department. A great many insuch a practice. exist which demand the strictest investigation. Officers who are held in the highest respect by every one who has served under them, and who have also had long service, are often most unjustly treated by their superiors. Among these is an officer who has had nearly 20 years' service, and has proved himself one of the most capable men in the South Australian branch of the forces. I have known him to be given command of a company composed entirely of recruits, even the non-commissioned being without military training, and this handicap, to raise it to the very highest standard of efficiency it within a comparatively short period. Some officers often find it very difficult to secure an opportunity to submit themselves for unexamination for promotion. Then again, I known others to be called upon at a few hours-' notice to undergo a very stiff examination, the desire apparently being they should fail, and thus present an reopportunity tc get rid of men who, despite their popularity with some commanding officers, have incurred the displeasure of others. These are matters that should be inquired into before we agree to a large expenditure upon the re-organization of the defence system. Whilst in camp at different times, I - saw enough to we satisfy me that offioers had been guilty of offences for which they should have been prosummarily dismissed; but they were - shielded. It should be our endeavour to esa tribunal to which any officer or man the may appeal, without fear of incurring the displeasure of his superiors. I do not wish delay the passing of the Estimates, hut imI think that, as has been suggested, the Minister should 'make a full statement of the policy of the Government, and intimate whether, under the new scheme, steps will be taken to prevent both officers and men unfairly treated. Reference has been the made by the honourable member for Canoof bolas to the position of instructors. I - have known instructors in South Australia that to be quite unnecessarily overworked. I an have known an officer to be called upon to drill a number of recruits night after night, and when, his duties required him to rehighmain so late that he had to take a cab home, to be called upon to pay the fare",18
58,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That was some time ago. of The honourable member knows that steps were taken to prevent the recurrence of 0,18
59,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I do not, I do know that many grievances were redressed by the honourable and learned member during the short time that he was in office; but many others still remain to be remedied. A system of favouritism obtains throughout the whole of the forces. Ample evidence of this would be forthcoming if officers knew that they could speak without fear of damaging their position by incurring the displeasure of their superiors. like to know what provision has been made to prevent instructors from being overworked. The trouble is that most of the grievances under which subordinate officers and men suffer never reach the head of the Department, the men being afraid that if they complained to head-quarters, they would be punished. I should like the Minister to say whether steps are being taken to enable the humblest officer or private in the ranks to bring his grievance before the head of the Department, when he cannot obtain satisfaction from his superior officer? It would be interesting also to learn whether a capable officer may now, without fear, criticise a superior officer who is utterly incapable. I have known an officer to be in command of a regiment, although utterly incapable of taking command of a section of a company. Men of this stamp are entirely dependent upon the knowledge of their subordinate officers, and vet, if one of the latter dared to offer any criticism, he would receivepunishment out of all proportion to the offence. I trust that the Minister will be able to assure the Committee that under the new system there will be no danger of favouritism. I have known officers to be placed on the Unattached List simply to make - room for more favoured men.",19
60,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,-That must have been since the present Ministry came into office.,19
61,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Case s of the kind have occurred at various times during the last few years.,19
62,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I make the positive statecarried ment that no such case occurred whilst I was in office. I never passed a list without making inquiries. In every case where an officer did not apply to be placed on-the Unattached List, I inquired the reason for the proposal to add his name to it .",19
63,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I know of an officer who has been placed on the Unattached List, but he would be the last to complain to the Department, because he hopes at some time or other to be again put upon the Active List. I have known an officer to be placed in command of a regiment, although he could not be sure of his seat in the saddle for half-an-hour; and I have also known of another officer who was incapable of giving ordinary commands. Owing to the blunder of a superior officer, I have been kept thirty-eight hours continuously on duty, and when I have had the temerity to complain to my superior officer, the latter has complained to his I should superior, who in turn has complained to some one else",19
64,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,When was this?,19
65,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"About four or five years ago; but my object in ireferring to the matter is to impress upon the Minister that under the new scheme a recurrence of such incidents should be impossible. Is it not absurd that a clerk, or a man employed in a warehouse, who is unused to heavy work, - should be kept twenty-four hours on guard duty, and then called upon to walk about twenty miles and take part in a sham fight?",19
66,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I have done it myself more than once.,19
67,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"So have I , and have done it with pleasure; but there are many men who are not fit to undergo such a strain. I have known a man, after 'being continuously on duty in this way, to be incapable of walking half-a-dozen yards, because of the state of his feet.",19
68,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"When a man is doing guard duty, he is two hours on and four hours off.",19
69,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,But think of the walking that he has to do.,19
70,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Not when he is on guard. He has only to walk up and down for a short distance, - and may stop whenever he pleases.",19
71,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"In South Australia, I have known men on guard to be instructed not only to keep walking to and fro, but to walk briskly. I have received instructions to see that these orders were out, and have not hesitated to tell the men what I thought of them. There are scores and scores of substantial grievances in connection with the Military Forces which ought to be investigated, and if the Minister will give me his assurance that these will be remedied, I shall be pleased to assist him in passing the Estimates of the Department. We have spent enormous sums of money on the Defence Forces, without securing anything like an adequate return. When the present Postmaster-General held office as Minister of Defence, I pointed out to him that when the staff in - South Australia' was only a third of its present size, the men experienced not the least difficulty in obtaining - what' they required; but quite recently L have known officers of the Military Club to waste half a day in securing a few rounds of ammunition, the delay being due to the stupid circumlocutory methods adopted in the staff office, which costs four or five times as much as it used to do.",19
72,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That is the object of circumlocution-to spend money.,20
73,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Exactly. . I South Australia, we had a larger force, which was better managed in every way, by a smaller staff. I give the honourable and learned member for Corinella credit force which did not reach him. for having allowed the States Commandants a great deal more latitude than they used to have. At one time if they required even a pencil, they had to apply to head-quaroutlying ters, and to wait a week for a reply. That was the kind of thing that went on for years under the organization of a great general from Great Britain, of whom the miliredress, tary authorities of South Australia, with the exception of those who come from the old country, hold almost unanimously the opinion that it is a good thing that his autocratic rule is ended. No doubt is a good and brilliant soldier, and f u l capital ideas; but his ideas do not fit in with those of the people of the CommonI wealth. I hope that the Minister will give us his assurance that he will see no member of the Military Forces, from the highest to the lowest rank, need suffer injustice, and that every man will be forded an opportunity to petition the ister himself, if need be, to hare his ance remedied.",20
74,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown," I wish to make a few remarks on the general question, but, before doing so, should to pay my tribute to the ability displayed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella when Minister of Defence; believe that, during the short time that had charge of the Department, very many necessary reforms, and I hope that his successor will follow his good example by carrying out the good work which he started, because there is still need reform.",20
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In some cases, at any rate, the Department is not keeping to the arrangements made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella.",20
76,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,In what way?,20
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,In regard to the Tasmanian defences.,20
78,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,That matter has been threshed out.,20
79,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"I should like to emphasize the fact that companies in the outlying portions of the Commonwealth suffer in comparison with companies situated nearer head-quarters, through not being able to get their representations placed before the Minister. At any rate, they cannot do so without passing them through n many hands. I was pleased to hear the honourable and learned member for Corinella say that he Knew of no representations having been made by members of the But it is the complaint of companies in Queensland, and I have no doubt a similar complaint has been made by companies in other portions of the Commonwealth, that it is with the utmost difficulty that they get anything done. If , after having exhausted every other means of obtaining an appellant reaches the ear of the Minister, he probably finds that, in the long run, it would have been better for him not to have troubled to do so, because, while he may gain his immediate object, he he will be made to suffer for it afterwards, l of and his last case, owing to the persecution which goes on, will be worse than his first. could adduce instances in support of this statement, but I think that it would be that unwise to mention the names of the individuals. I have been informed of several cases in which it seemed to me that conafsiderable injustice had been done, without Minthere being a chance to remedy it, though grievI believe that in one or two cases the matter has come before'the Minister. In a case which I have in mind, there were certain non-commissioned and warrant officers, trained in Australia, who held the like same rank and were doing in all respects the same work as certain non-commissioned officers imported from the old country, but, I when an opportunity for promotion came, he the former, while being promoted in rank, he initiated received no extra pay.",20
80,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"How long ago was that? In April last the whole of the instructional for staff was classified, in accordance with a considered scheme.",20
81,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"I believe that a good many of these matters have been redressed, buf in the cases to which I refer the complaint was made that, owing to the lateness of the period at which the changes were made, these men lost a considerable amount in arrears of pay which were never made up. Some of them were entitled to increased rates of pay from July, 1902. The Imperial officers were given £ 1 8 4 a year, while the Australian trained officers received only £ 1 4 3 a year.",20
82,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The Imperial officers came out to Australia at certain salaries.,21
83,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"Yes ; but I have been informed that since they have been here they have been given preference over Australian-trained officers, in regard to promotion and pay. I do not wish to refer to individual cases openly, but I regard my information on the subject as authentic. Another matter to which I wish to refer is this: Six horses are considered necessary to move field artillery; but the Department does not keep horses for the purpose. When an encampment is to take place, tenders are called for the supply of horses, and animals are hired for. a certain period. At the last encampment of the Queensland forces held in Brisbane, through some want of foresight or blundering, only four horses, instead of six, could be obtained for each gun, and they were horses of such a heavy breed that it was impossible to get them to trot.",21
84,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"In all ithe States it is found exceedingly difficult to obtain suitable artillery horses. The contract for supplying them is made for a year, the horses to be available when required.",21
85,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"If the men are not properly equipped on the only occasions which they have for meeting together and learning military manoeuvres, the money spent on these annual encampments is largely wasted, and any attempted saving which destroys the effectiveness of the training is false economy. ' I am also informed that for the last two years the Queensland forces have not been provided with great coats. I believe that tenders were invited for the supply of such clothing, but that the cloth submitted was too thick and heavy, it being material better suited for an Arctic climate than for a tropical region. At any rate, no contract was let, and at the end of the financial year the vote lapsed. That, however, is not a sufficient reason for keeping the men for two years without a necessary portion of their uniform. Another matter to which I wish to refer has to' do with the reorganization of the forces by the late Commandant. One of the. Queensland companies-a n Ipswich company-whic h was the first to be disbanded, was complimented by Major-General Sir Edward Hutton upon having made the best appearance at a certain encampment, and yet immediately afterwards they were marched off the field without their arms. The men had received notice that the company was to be disbanded, but a mistake was made in.treating them in that manner, and they felt very hurt at what they conceived to be the slight which they received. This treatment, however, has not quite killed their enthusiasm, and they are both anxious to form another infantry corps.",21
86,Mr EWING,Unknown,Was the matter dealt with by the Minister?,21
87,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"The recommendation of the General Officer Commanding was carried into effect, and the company was disbanded. Several of the trained officers who are now on the Unattached List, and a large number of young men whp were formerly with the company, are willing to again enrol themselves. I believe that many of them are content'to serve without pay, and I think this spirit-should be encouraged. I desire to once more refer to the subject of the greatcoats. I understand that board after b.oard has considered the question, and that, the money voted in this direction would probably have been sufficient to defray the cost of the garments required.",21
88,Mr EWING,Unknown,The - vote which lapsed last year is being re-appropriated and ample provision wfll be made for the future.,21
89,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"How often are greatcoats supplied-ever y year, or every two years ?.",21
90,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Greatcoat s ought to last about seven years.,21
91,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,The members of the Defence Force in Queensland ought not to require any great coats.,21
92,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"Such is the geniality of the Queensland climate that no doubt soldiers and other persons can clothe themselves very much more comfortably, and at Less cost than can the residents of most other parts of Australia. At the same time, we have our winter as well as our summer, and in some parts of Queensland, it is very cold at times. I suppose that during my stay in Melbourne I am as lightly clothed as any honourable member. I wear no heavier clothing in Melbourne than I do in Queensland, and I have felt the cold in some parts of Queensland more severely. 3896 Estimates: [REPRESENTATIVES.] than I have done in Melbourne. I have experienced hotter weather in Melbourne than in any part of Queensland. Provision has been made by the Department for the issue of overcoats to members of the Queensland Defence Forces, and I presume that such garments were considered necessary.",21
93,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"The trouble has been due to the fact that the States authorities did not supply overcoats. In that regard, the Commonwealth has had to start from nothing in the case of Queensland, whereas there were stocks of overcoats in the other States.",22
94,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"I am glad to know that the Commonwealth is doing something more for the Queensland Defence Forces than was done by the States authorities. The general impression, however, is that the forces have suffered under the Commonwealth administration.",22
95,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The rifle clubs are better off than they were under the State administration.,22
96,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable and learned member, but other persons hold a different view. I am. informed that in some of the States the members of the Australian Light Horse are provided with saddles.",22
97,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"No ; the Commonwealth has not provided any saddles, but I understand that in N ew South Wales some of the men have saddles which were provided by the State authorities.",22
98,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"I do not think it is desirable that we should require the men to supply their own saddles. At present one man may appear on parade with a buckjumper's saddle on his horse, whilst another may have to be content with a jockey's saddle. I understand that the members of the Australian Light Horse have to provide their own horses, for which an allowance is made, and I think that we should give every encouragement to the young men who so willingly offer their services, and who represent such a useful branch of our defences. I wish to say a few words in reference to a matter which I regard as one of the most important that can engage our attention. I refer to the question of establishing our own small arms and ammunition factory. This is a subject upon which most of us are agreed, but upon which we are very slow to take action. However careful contractors may be. mistakes will occur, and the series of accidents which have recently occurred have given Defence. rise to a very uneasy feeling amongst riflemen. At present we can bring no one to account for the defects in our ammunition supply, but if we manufactured our own We should be able to place the responsibility on the right shoulders. It has been stated that some of the cartridges turned out in 1904 contained two bullets instead of one, and many ol'd riflemen have objected to use the ammunition supplied to them without a . guarantee that it is free from any such defects. I do not think there is very much to fear in this connection, particularly since an order has been given for the recall of the old ammunition. Neither do I think it would be very difficult to pick out the defective cartridges by subjecting them to a 'weight test. The difference in weight between a cartridge containing one bullet, and another containing two, would be readily noticeable to any person handling the ammunition. I trust that the Minister will have something to 1 say upon this question which will allay the fear existing in some quarters. I do not propose to say anything with regard to rifle clubs, and the travelling allowances to members, because I believe it is the intention of the Department to act generously in that regard. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, during the time he was Minister of Defence, took action in the right direction, and I trust that his good example will be followed by the present administration.",22
99,Mr EWING,Unknown,The allowance for travelling expenses has been nearlv doubled.,22
100,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,I trust that the members of rifle clubs will be encouraged in every possible way to improve their skill as marksmen by engaging in contests among themselves.,22
101,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Hear , hear; I think the vote for travelling expenses should be still further increased.",22
102,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"Wit h regard to the proposed importation of 5,000 .rifles of the new pattern, I desire to point out that the condemnation reported to have been passed on the new weapon has, to some extent, been discounted by the approval of the Indian military authorities, who consider it is superior to the long magazine rifle. I have used all classes of modern rifles, from the Snider upwards, and, speaking as a .rifleman, I do not hesitateto say that the short magazine service rifle is the ,best we have had yet. I would suggest that the Minister should obtain a report from the experts connected with the Department as to the possibility of fixing upon the long magazine rifles, sights lar to those which are attached to the short rifle. I believe that if this change were made, the long magazine rifles, which are press. by no means bad weapons, would be very much handier, and prove sufficient for all our purposes for a considerable time. the Marksmen would then have attached to tion. their rifles everything necessary to enable them to do good shooting. rifle I cannot understand why such a prejudice bane. exists in favour of fixed sights, because in these days of sharp-sliooting and ""sniping,"" a man who is accustomed to calculating vation and windage, might fire much rapidly if , by the turn of a screw, everycision thing necessary could be secured. alteration-if it can be made-shoul d not prove a very cosfly one, and, in my opinion, I refer,. the amount of lead that would be saved by it if the forces of Australia were ever called upon to engage a foe would be very considerable. There are some thouForce sands of these long magazine rifles in Commonwealth, and I believe that they be very effective weapons for many years to come. Witli regard to a metropolitan range at Brisbane, I may say that two sites are suggested."" Personally, I have not seen either of them, so that all my informathe tion in this connection has been gleaned second-hand. Apparently, the range which the Defence Department has decided adopt is that ""which is situated at Nudgee, near Sandgate. This range, it is urged will interfere very greatly with the fine sideration. institution known as the Nudgee Orphanriflemen age, which has been established in that sight on their weapons. district. The authorities of that institution complain that the establishment of a range in its vicinity will seriously interfere with its working and the privacy of grounds. I do not suppose that the DepartBritish ment would sanction the resumption of this area without first having given the matter very careful consideration. The other range which has been suggested is located at Woolston. Colonel Bridges, one of the perts of the Department, has already spected both ranges. From a report which I saw in the Brisbane Courier, it appears that that officer, prior to the meeting of the Rifle Association there, favoured the selection of the Woolston site. When, however, he submitted his report, he the Nudgee or Sandgate range.",22
103,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Colone l Bridges sort of man to be influenced by anybody when he is forming an opinion.,23
104,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,I am not attributsimiing any vacillation to him. I am merely giving the Committee the benefit of certain information which I have gleaned from the The Orphanage authorities hold that the selection of the Sandgate site will have the effect of very largely curtailing area used by the inmates of the institu,23
105,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,It is very urgent that a range should be provided at Bris,23

But, before any deis arrived at, I hope that the fullest The consideration will be given to the representations made by the institution to which",23
107,Mr LEE,Unknown," The present Minister of Defence has, so far, exhibited a desire to make our Defence as efficient as possible. It was a the good thing for the Commonwealth when will it had. in charge of the Department a Minister of the calibre of the honourable rifle and learned member for Corinella- a man who understood"" his business, and who was not always prepared to unreservedly accept opinions of his oflicers.

There are many 'matters connected with this Department which require serious conI cannot understand why insist upon having a fixed The new magazine rifle is, in my opinion, a very rifle efficient one, and I speak with some experience of various types of rifles.

I am confident that if such a course were adopted, the verdict would be in favour of exthe new weapon as against the old.

If we take steps to secure an efficient Defence Force we shall have full confidence in our ability to defend ourselves in an emergency.

114,Mr EWING,Unknown,I said that that was. the intention of the Minister of Defence.,24
115,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It is idle to talk about the value of a citizen soldiery unless we are prepared to practically encourage the movement. Many riflemen in my electorate find that it is a severe tax on their resources to be called upon to pay their railway fares every time that they visit the rifle ranges. It is hot fair to ask them to If. we want efficiency we do so. . They give their time and their money to the service, and yet all sorts of obstacles are placed in the way of their becoming experts. Why should we waste money on head-quarters and red tape whilst the members of our rifle clubs, who fonri an important branch of our citizen soldiery, are hampered in every way? I wish'now to direct attention to the naval side of the question.

Every impediment appears to be placed in the way of the development of this branch of our dewith fences.

118,Mr E,Unknown,WING - Yes .,25
119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What does honourable member desire?,25
120,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I hold that our naval brigades, instead of being strengthened, have been weakened and hampered in every way. I hope that the Government will carry but the promise made by decessors, and that by encouraging the naval cadets and naval brigades, as well as by establishing a system of harbour debeen fence, they will initiate what may mately become a complete system of local naval defence. We often speak of what the mother country has done for us, I for one appreciate all. that she has but we ought to encourage, a spirit of reliance.",25

122,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Most decidedly; but every surely all the effort should not be on the tary science. one side.

124,Mr KELLY,Unknown," I do not in think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports desired to cast a reflection on any other member of the House when he that the best way to show our patriotism was to evidence our self-reliance in creating an Australian navy. It is not my intention at this stage tp deal in extenso the subject, but I would point out that, although the honourable member who has just resumed his seat told 'us that he was in favour of ah Australian Navy for the the naval defence of Australia, he declined to quesexplain what he meant by that term. In his concluding remarks he spoke also of ""coastal defence."" Which did he mean? the An Australian Navy, properly speaking, or torpedo craft for local use?

130,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I affirm that the reports which have been made by him to this House show that if he has, he did not thoroughly consider, the subject before presenting them. 'He has spoken of the possibility of using small cruisers, which could be designed unusually strong for their size, both in offence and defence, by circumscribing their radius.",26
131,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Does the honourable member set himself up as an authority against Captain Creswell ?,26
132,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am not setting myself up. as an authority, but before I venture to express opinions on this subject. I go, not to the writings of ex-lieutenants in the Imperial Navy, but to world-wide naval authorities. I go to the works of writers who are recognised throughout the world as sound authorities. I do not for a moment set myself up as an authority, nor do I propose to follow blindly and unintelligently the opinions expressed by any officer of the Commonwealth. If the statement made by Captain Creswell as to circumscribing the radius of his proposed ships be correct, he must admit at the start that his cruisers would be useless for the defence of Australia, or Australian interests, outside their unusually circumscribed radius. I wish to know what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports means by his references to an "" Australian Navy."" If he) has in mind a navy of the class suggested by Captain Creswell, how does he propose that it shall protect the vast interests of Australia floating on the high seas?",26
133,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Does the honourable member believe in the development of an Australian Navy?,26
134,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I believe in the development of Australian naval effort in co-operation with that of the mother country and every other section of the Empire.,26
135,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Who proposes anything else?,26
136,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member proposes a scheme which would do away with unity of effort in naval action.

137,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I have denied nothing sults. of the kind. The honourable member might as well say that the Australian Military Forces would not co-operate with those other parts of the Empire.,26
138,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not recognise the same necessity for the Australian Military Forces to so co-operate with those of other parts of the Empire. I have never advocated a force which could be taken out of Australia to co-operate with the forces of other parts of the Empire. Our Military Forces are designed to meet local requirements and local conditions; but conditions on the high seas are the same all over the world. All authorities are agreed that Naval effort, to be successful, must be offensive-of f the enemy's coast. The honourable memher, in his closing periods, assured us that we could best show our patriotism % by establishing an Australian Navy for Australian defence. In saying that, he was trving to provoke prejudice against those who believe in co-operation with other see- 1 tions of the Empire in naval matters, and was using clap-trap to meet what are irrefutable arguments. In my opinion, a he has unworthily reflected on the opinions and intentions of honourable members who do not support the particular form of naval effort which he suggests. I , personally, wish to see our Naval Brigades given a field of training; but what better field can they have than the British Navy?",26

One Minister after another has sat at the table, and told us in general terms believes the cadets to be the basis of our Military Force, and wishes to give assistance to the rifle clubs. Certainly, this year a little more encouragement is being given to the rifle clubs in New South Wales than has been given in the past; but the rifle club movement is not receiving the enthusiastic support which it should get.

Apart from this special advantage, the country will gain greatly from the cadet system by its effect on our young people in inculcating respect for authority and the of discipline. This is a trainwhich the Australian boy very urgently 0 a needs. He is apt to think that he knows due at least as much as his father, and to instruction from that quarter. But time if he once becomes a member of a cadet corps, he is made amenable to discipline, and, in addition to the sood effect that it Expert has upon his character, obtains military out training. I was allowed by the late Honourable Sir Frederick Sargood to co-operate with him on one or two occasions in regard to the cadet movement which was so close to his heart, and one of the last injunctions which I received from him on leaving the Legislative Council of Victoria was to keep subject constantly in the foreground, East until the end in view had been accomplished. One of the last acts of that honourable gentleman was to join with me when I one of our Defence Bills was under consideration in calling together the heads of the public schools of Victoria to obtain their readvice and recommendations in regard to it, Minand these were transmitted to the Minister an of Defence of the day. It seems to me, know hoAvever, that we are merely beating the pracair and wasting time in making speeches on the subject, because no practical result follows. The public of Australia are getDeting tired of this Parliament, and are askhas ing when practical work will be done by us. This is a matter in regard to which in something practical may be done, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council will tell us that the Department of Defence intends to submit proposals for the encouragement of the cadet movement and the support of the rifle clubs, every honorgive able member, without respect to party, will be glad of the announcement. If we get some such promise from the Minister, this discussion will not have been altogether",27
156,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown," I shall support the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong. I believe that the cadet movement is capable of being of the greatest advantage to the Commonwealth, both because of the military training which it can give to our youth and because of the physical and moral training which are inseparable from martial exercises and attention to discipline. There is nothing like physical training for smartening up young men, and, moreover, military discipline will inculcate - respect for authority. I do not believe in anything approaching servility, but we should aim at developing true manliness, associated with due respect for authority. If we keep these ends in view, and encourage our rifle clubs and the volunteer spirit generally, we shall secure all that we need in the direction of our defences. Any attempt to carry out. a system similar to that in vogue in Switzerland would entail an expenditure that the Commonwealth could not possibly bear, and the idea of conscription, or compulsory military service, is utterly repugnant to the spirit of a free people like ours. I am surprised that the leading members of the Labour Party should be inclined to favour conscription.",28
157,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is now speaking of something which is not provided for in the Estimates.,28
158,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I am speaking of the general military policy, and of suggestions which have been made for the introduction of changes.",28
159,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"No provision is made for conscription, and it' would not be in order for the honourable member to make any more than an incidental reference tb the subject at present. If the Government decide to introduce conscription, they will have to obtain legislative authority. The honourable member can discuss only such proposals as are covered by the Estimates. '. Mr LONSDALE - The'subjec t of conr scription and other matters has been alluded tp by other honourable members, and I claim the right to place my views before the Committee. We have adopted a system of voluntary enlistment, and I prefer that to anything in the shape of compulsory militarv service. The working men would suffer more than any others under a system of conscription, because they would .have to serve their, full time, whilst'others in better circumstances might, uppn varipus pretexts, esaape their responsibilities. I am quite in accord with the honourable member for Melbpurne Ports that we ought to cultivate self-reliance, but I differ from him as to the means to be emplpyed to that end. So far, the honprable member has shewn that he believes in relying upon the State, and the self-reliance he speaks about is altogether different from that which I have in my mind. The hcnprable member preposes to tell the mother country that we can do without her help in the direction of naval defence, and that we can provide a Navy of our own. I should like to know what position we should occupy if we had to rely upon ourown Navy to repel an attack by a foreign nation ? Instead ef setting up a sham Navy of our own, which would be absolutely useless, it would be far better for us to contribute a fair share towards the maintenance of the British Navy, and develop an Australian Squadron under the control of the British Admiralty. It is not sufficient for us to provide vessels to patrol our shores. The war-ships detailed for our defence must do the main part of their work on the broad ocean. We should never allow an enemy to approach our coasts, if we can meet and fight him elsewhere. We shall best conserve OUT interests in the matter of naval defence by contributing more largely to the support of the British Navy.",28
160,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The Naval Subsidy is not now under discussion.,28
161,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,I am merely replying to the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.,28
162,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports merely referred to the Naval Brigade, for which provision is made in these Estimates. Mr KELLY.^-On a point of order, I would direct attention to the fact that the honourable member for 'Melbourne Ports brought under the notice of the Minister the advisability of incurring considerable outlay for-the purposes of Australian naval defence, and I submit that he - thereby opened up the whole question of making sufficient provision in that direction.",28
163,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member ought to know that no honourable member can open up a discussion in the way he suggests. .,28
164,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I should like to ask you whether^ in the event of one honourable member introducing a subject into the discussion, and not being ruled out of order, it is competent for another honourable member tb refer to the matter? The CHAIRMAN,-No . Not if the' remarks are irrelevant to the matter before the Chair.",28
165,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I have no wish to transgress; but it appears to me that it will be necessary to watch the discussion carefully, and raise a point of order immediately any honourable member goes beyond the strict lines laid down by the Chairman. All honourable members must enjoy the same privileges. I congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council upon having attained his present position. I quite realise that he will be amenable to the representations of honourable members, and that he will not-^-Iike some of his colleaguesrefuse information when a reasonable request is made to him. By treating honourable members with courteous consideration, he will achieve far greater success than by following the bad example which has been set him by other Ministers.",29
166,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"Capricornia). - There seems to be some doubt as to whether the authorities intend to supply the Australian Light Horse regiments with saddles. If they decide to make such provision, I trust that they will exercise a reasonable discretion in calling for tenders. The 15th Regiment of Light Horse, whose head-quarters are in Rockhampton, are distributed over a district which extends from Biggenden to Townsville. This regiment will require 350 saddles and sets of leather equipment, and I would urge upon the Minister the desirabilitv of calling for tenders locally, and providing for the delivery of the goods at the head-rjuarters of the regiment in Rockhampton, instead of requiring them to be sent to Brisbane. If delivery in Brisbane is required, the tenderers in Northern and Central Queensland will be seriously handicapped, because they will have to pay the freight upon the materials from Brisbane northwards, as well as the freight upon the finished article from the place of manufacture to .Brisbane. The saddles required for the Mounted Rifles, which were sent .from Northern Queensland to South Africa, were manufactured in Rockhampton, and proved to be highly, satisfactory, and there is no reason to suppose that the local saddlers will not meet present requirement's. I trust .that the'Minister will give this matter .his serious'consideration, and that, instead of calling for tenders'for'the requirements of the whole' State, he will,""'as-'far as possible; distribute the work.",29
167,Mr EWING,Unknown," It has been inferred by honourable members-no t without justification-that before these Estimates were considered in detail, I would, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, make a statement as to the intentions of the Government. In the first place, I desire to say that the Estimates were accepted by the Government-as the Committee are aware-afte r they had received very careful consideration at the hands of the late Minister of Defence, the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I am prepared to extend the fullest credit to him in that connection. A great deal of the work which he initiated, and almost brought to a termination, has proved invaluable to the Government, which, consisting, as it does, of a number of laymen, requires the generous help bf every honourable member ih dealing with this .question. No fault can be found with Ithe speeches which were delivered this morning. They were all reasonable and to the point. Honourable members are unanimous in their belief that' the defence of our country is of more importance than is the delaying of the progress of these Estimates or the heckling of a Government. With regard to the honourable and learned member for Corio, we recognise that he possesses a knowledge of military affairs, and if he will loyally assist us in dealing with those matters. I shall be very glad to allow bygones to be bygones.",29
168,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Then the Government will consent to the appointment of the Select Committee for which I have asked?,29
169,Mr EWING,Unknown,"That is a matter for future consideration. I am now dealing with the past. I am quite prepared to dp what the deputy leader of the Opposition has suggested, namely, to take the .Committee, into the confidence of the Minister of Defence and of the Government. That, k Minister should always be prepared to do! My experience of representative institutions is that a Government might just as 1 wen inform the House,' in the first instance, .of the views they.entertain upon any question, because honourable members are bound tp discover what they nre at a later stage. Consequently, any 'Ministry migrrt just as >yell gain the credit of being perfectly frank''with honourable' members. I propose now to' tell ""the Committee what is, the position of 'the Government iii regard 't'o the' questipri of defence! r With '' 1 the'""permission of ' the"" Committee - I am aware that no discussion, can take place on the whole subject - I intend to dishas close exactly what we intend to do, so honourable members will be duly prepared to agree with the Prime Minister, when explains the Government proposals upon future date. I know that these Estimates with the exception of one or two minor details, ' have the approval of honorGovernment able members of the Opposition. the speeches which were delivered this morning it was made perfectly clear that honourable members generally apprefrom ciate the difficulty which exists in carryquired ing out any scheme for the defence of tralia. They realise fully that any scheme upon which we embark without a full reit cognition of the end in view must inevitour ably fail. The Minister must clearly derstand what work he has to perform beas fore he undertakes to clo anything definitely. ville In the past, considerable difficulty has been experienced by reason of one Government purchasing a certain class of arm., and another Administration ordering a different type. Again, one Government has pinned its faith to torpedoes, another to forts, still another to our land forces. opinion of the present Minister, any scheme for the defence of Australia must be a prehensive one, and he has determined to undertake any work, the value of which is at all open to question without searching investigation. To do so would probtrol ably involve a waste of public money, and, as the honourable member for Parraployment matta has remarked, a continual alteration of our Defence system is disastrous to country, and inimical to the efficiency our forces. I now come to the question naval defence, in which the honourable member for Wentworth exhibits such a persistent and-when he agrees with - n intelligent interest. me a nexion, the policy of the Government is our coastal to stand by the Naval Agreement. That That is oneshipping agreement was made to cover a number years, and there it remains. Whatever our views may be in regard to our harbour dewe fences, and however much we may appredefences, ciate the valour of our citizen soldiers, we recognise that the strength of the Empire as a sea power rests in the British Navy. To further emphasize this subject is not perposal mitted by the rules of debate. The next question to which I desire to direct attention is that of our harbour defences. In his speech this morning, the deputy-leader of the Opposition mentioned the various Mr Ewing. struments of destruction, the use of which to be considered in this connection. In that endeavouring to deal with any scheme for the protection of Australia, this is the he problem which confronts the Government. is Our harbour defences constitute our second line of defence. Frankly speaking, I am not in a position to say i'n detail what the intend to do in regard to this In aspect of the matter. A few days ago the honourable and learned member for Corinella pointed out that a sum, variously stated at £500,000 to £r,000,000, was reto put our forts alone in order. The Ausquestion of type of guns must be considered. In the opinion of the Government is essential that for the protection of shipping there should be, at every ungreat centre-at such places, for example, Melbourne, Sydney, Hobart, Adelaide, Fremantle, Brisbane, and perhaps Townsand Thursday Island",29
170,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,And Newcastle.,30
171,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am dealing with the matter in general terms. Leaving out of consideration the protection of our coastal and cities, the Government desire that, at inIn the tervals all along our coast, there should be harbors in which shipping would be abcomsolutely safe. Then the question arises, not ""How can we insure its safety?"" This perhaps can be best accomplished partly by means of forts-the guns of which will conthe sea for a certain distance-partl y by means of mines, and partly by the emof torpedo boats or submersibles and submarines. All these things are interthe woven. For instance, by employing a few of torpedo boats, - we might obviate an enorof mous expenditure upon our forts, and by laying mines we might avoid a considerable outlay upon our fixed defences. The Government is composed of laymen, and will welcome suggestions from whatever source In this conthey may come. How can we best protect when it is in port? of the problems which the of Minister has to solve. In attempting to solve it, he has to consider the guns which should employ, the nature of our fixed the class of boats that we shall use if it is necessary to augment these, and the protection afforded by mines. ' No Government which has only had at its disthe time available to"" the present Administration could possibly have dealt with the details of questions of this character.",30
172,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Surely there are experts in in the Department who can advise the Government?,30
173,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Whil e fully recognising the ability of a number of officers of the Department, I think that a question in which so many aspects of land and naval defence are thus intermixed may be in addition dealt with by one or two supreme intellects before we ask the country to accept any particular scheme. In the course of a few months the Minister hopes to have solved this problem, which I am sure honourable members will admit is an exceedingly knotty one. If the Government assure the Committee that they will expedite the solution of the details of this problem, and submit proposals to Parliament immediately - full information is obtained, that is all magazine that we can be asked. In the meantime, the Minister proposes to keep our Permanent Forces together, and to continue as at present, although we deplore the fact that the state of our coastal defences is not satisfactory. Whilst I was in Sydney I made a statement which has been productive of considerable debate. The question which has been agitating my mind is, ""Are the representatives of the people satisfied with the existing position in regard to our land forces?"" At the present time those forces consist of the instructional staff, the field force, and the garrison, force, and aggregate about 22,442 men. What we have to consider is whether Australia is to be primarily dependent for her land protection upon this force.",31
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How much per man does our present expenditure upon it represent?,31
175,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The average annual cost per member is as follows :-Militia-Australian Light Horse, £ 1 6 18s. rod.; Field Artillery, £ 1 9 16s. j Garrison Artillery, ,£13 19s.; Engineers, Field Company, £12 9s.; Engineers, Subminers, £ 1 6 os. gd.; Infantry, £ 1 3 os. n d . ; Signallers, £ 1 3 os. n d . ; Army Service Corps, £ 1 7 ; Army Medical Corps, £ 1 6 ; Volunteers-Infantry , £ 6 8s. od.; rifle clubs, £ 1 ios. 3d.",31
176,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The rifle clubs cost more than that.,31
177,Mr EWING,Unknown,The average annual cost of rifle clubs is given in the statement pre- midst. sented to me as being £45 each.,31
178,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The rifle clubs cost about £ 2 2s. per man per annum.,31
179,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am putting before the House the figures as they have been presented to me. When I was interrogated by the honourable member for Parramatta, I was asking the Committee whether the land defence of Australia rests on the 22,242 men of the forces, or upon something more. The vast majority of the people of Australia believe that it rests upon something widely different-that it depends upon the numerical strength, the valour, and the character of the training of the Australian people themselves.",31
180,Mr KELLY,Unknown,And the capacity to transport them to different points of attack.,31
181,Mr EWING,Unknown,"But it would be idle to arrange for the transport of men who had no knowledge of how to use a rifle. I have already mentioned that we have 35,000 rifles, worth approximately £150,000, but in addition to that number, we have 20,000 of a pattern which, rightly or wrongly, has been discarded by. the British Army.",31
182,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Can the honourable gentleman give us the number of single-loaders in the possession of the Department?,31
183,Mr EWING,Unknown,"There are 26,591 M. E. .303 rifles. I find that there are 1,000,000 male electors on the rolls in Australia, and that we have in addition 200,000 lads between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years. It will thus be seen that there are in Australia 1,200,000 males, a considerable proportion of whom would be in a position, as citizen soldiers, if properly trained, and taught the use of the rifle, to defend the country in time of war.",31
184,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"They need facilities foi that training, but these are not forthcoming.",31
185,Mr EWING,Unknown,"They need to be trained, and also to be supplied with rifles. Some honourable members have referred to the necessity to make arrangements to transport our troops from point to point in time of emergency. After all, however, the knowledge of strength means the preservation of peace. To take a homely illustration, a sound, vigorous, healthy-looking man, would be the last upon whom an attack would be made. And so with the nations. The [knowledge that we had 1,200,000 men, a large proportion of whom were acquainted with the rudiments of drill, and able to use the rifle effectively, would cause a nation to hesitate to bring war into our",31
186,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The knowledge that we had that number of men with leaders.,31
187,Mr EWING,Unknown,Of course.,31
188,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"How would the honourable gentleman protect the Nortbern Territory from invasion with 1,200,000 men in the southern part of Australia?",31
189,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I appreciate the value of the British Navy to Australia as the first line of defence, and to that extent, at all events, my views coincide with those of the honourable member; but every man in Australia ought to have a sense of responsibility to his country, and should be in a position to defend it if the occasion arose. That is the corollary of democratic institutions. The figures I have quoted show that we have about one modern magazine rifle to every thirty men on the rolls, to say nothing of the 200,000 males between fifteen and twenty-one years of age, many of whom would be available for defence purposes. That being so, it must be conceded that our supply of modern rifles is insufficient.",32
190,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,What attack is this designed to meet?,32
191,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I have no desire to deal with problematical cases. The view taken by the Government is that the defence of Australia in a final resort depends upon the intelligence, the patriotism, and the arming and training of a citizen soldiery. I propose now to draw attention to one of the flaws in the Estimates, as framed by the late Minister of Defence. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, whose ability I have always recognised, did not propose to make provision for the purchase of any new rifles. The present Government took the view that such an omission was a serious mistake, and has determined that a suim of £34,000 shall be expended in that direction - By the expenditure of this sum we shall secure a further supply of about 8,000 modern rifles. It .is idle to talk about the value of a citizen soldiery unless we can arm them. A number of honourable members have spoken of the need of securing saddles.. The Government appreciates the importance of uniformity of dress and equipment, but when it comes to making a ''choice between purchasing' articles: for which substitutes may be obtained locallv'in time of-war.; and securing those for-which substitutes could nor be found in such ah emergency we feel.''that the prefer1 ence must be given to the 'latter. If we are ever called on to go to war we.shall not hurl saddles at* the 'enemy; we shall seek to destroy them with our guns -- might",32
192,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"^DO 'the Government propose to increase' the' small ammunition' reserve in proportion to the increase in rifles? wi' Mr EWING --Yes. ' Speaking' from memory we have;"" about 40I000,000 rounds' .of ball cartridge on hand and a local factory working double shifts can turn out about 24,000,000 rounds per annum. The Minister has now under consideration the question of whether it is not possible to bring the factory more in touch with the Government-to bring it more directly under Government supervision and to increase its output. It is essential that we. should have cordite ammunition, and, if possible, rifles, manufactured in Australia,",32
193,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,To what extent do the Government propose to increase the reserve of ammunition ?,32
194,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It will be increased in proportion to the'increase in rifles. It is absurd to imagine that the Government would add to its store of rifles without purchasing ammunition for them. The question which has been raised in regard to the need of securing a full supply of saddles illustrates the difference between the view 'of the present Government,' and that of the late Minister of Defence. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, by reason of his long association with defence matters and his identification with military service, has a tendency to prefer the finished soldier. It is obvious, however, from the figures which I have quoted, that we cannot afford the finished article.",32
195,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is not suggesting that I prefer the permanent soldier?,32
196,Mr EWING,Unknown,"No . The point I wish to make is that the militia man costs more than the volunteer, and the volunteer rnorp than .the rifleman. EaGh succeeding grade requires more drill, and a better acquaints ance with .military duties, and we pass from one to another. until, at last we reach the permanent soldier, the cost of whose maintenance amounts to something like £120 a year - . , : Mr - MCCAY - No one. asks, for a large number of permanent soldiers. - ' Mr .EWING,-We cannot afford them. The Government policy, is - shown by its action in regard to'the ipurchase of cordite and arms. If war broke out We should not be able to-obtain rifle's or'ebrdite locallv, but supplies of saddles 'would be forth' coming. . Although perftans the ' supplv not be uniform, incidentals 'could"" be obtained in such an emergency,- but not so with the essentials of war."" We therefore lay-down'the general principle 'that! we mnst have supplies bf cordite ""for the'guns, and of rifles -- and ammunition - fdr' our''meri; sacrificing those things for the present which could be obtained locally in time of war to those essential things, which might not then be procurable. the fundamental difference between the position taken up by the present Minister of Defence and his predecessor. The honourable member for Kooyong and several others have referred to the cadet movement, holding that it is valuable not only from the point of view that it enables our bovs to' acquire a knowledge of military training, but because it inculcates in them habits of obedience and a recognition of their national responsibility. Every one understands it to be desirable that the minds of our youth should be imbued as early as possible with these principles, and, therefore, the cadet movement must meet with general approval. there are 150,000 boys over twelve years of age attending school in Australia, but of that number only 10,000 are cadets. In other words, nine out of every ten pass through our schools without any military training, and without any true appreciation of their responsibility with respect to the defence of their country.",32
197,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Thos e are the children who are now at school ?,33
198,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Yes ; boys over twelve years of - age, still at school.",33
199,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,What is to be done in regard to boys who have left school ?,33
200,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I will refer later on to the establishment of ' senior cadet corps. The honourable and learned member for Corinella was full y seized of these matters, and had a scheme with regard to cadets almost completed when the present Government took office. We are continuing his good work.",33
201,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Why did not the present Government accept the Estimates which he prepared for the Tasmanian forces? The honourable member for Eden Monaro, when Minister of Defence, gave me . a written promise in regard to that matter, which has been deliberately broken.",33
202,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Any promise made to-the honourable member by this Government will be kept. The school children of Australia s are under the control of authorities appointed by the Governments of the States, and therefore no scheme for a cadet force can take effect until it has been accepted by the States.. Within a. week or two, however, there is to be a meeting in Sydney, held at the suggestion of the Minister of Defence, of representatives from all parts of Australia, who will deal with the subject, and when the details of the proposed scheme That is have been agreed to, and received Cabinet approval, it will be submitted to Parliament. In the meantime, the Minister proposes to increase the vote for cadets by £ 7 , 0 0 0, making it £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , to provide for the carrying out of the work. Replying to the question of the honourable member for Moreton, the Government realise that the senior cadet is the connecting link between the school cadet and the adult volunteer.",33
203,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Ge t the junior cadet force established before doing anything in regard to the senior cadets. In my scheme, I pointed out that the senior cadet force would not come into existence for two or three years after the junior cadet force At present had been established.",33
204,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Minister will have plenty to do for some time to come in organizing a junior cadet scheme for the 105,000 school boys of Australia; but we regard the establishment of a senior cadet force as the necessary connecting link to which I have referred.",33
205,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Why not reduce the age at which young men are allowed to join rifle clubs?,33
206,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I do nof see why that should not be done. There are 30,000 members of rifle clubs in the Commonwealth, of whom New South Wales has 4,800; Victoria, 16,298; Queensland, 2,961; South Australia. 3,385; Western Australia, 2,493 > ^ d Tasmania, 310.",33
207,Mr BROWN,Unknown,Does the Department propose to do anything in the direction of increasing the Australian Light Horse?,33
208,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Le t me finish what I have to say in regard to the rifle clubs before I deal with another subject. The Government felt that it was absurd to try to increase our citizen soldierv Avithout increasing the arms available for them, and the Minister has, therefore, set aside £ 3 4 , 0 0 0 for the purchase of rifles. It is the policy of the Government to do everj>thing possible to encourage our citizen soldiers by offering inducements to join rifle clubs, in giving travelling alloAvances in connection with matches, in.granting aid for the erec : tion of targets aiid the improvement of ranges, and in all other legitimate ways. The man"" Avho ' is prepared to' voluntarily devote his time and energies to the serAnce of his country should be encouraged in every way possible. If men are also prepared to find horses for a mounted corps, the Government should be ready to accept their assistance.",33
209,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The Geelong and Werribee men have been offering themselves for the last three years, and cannot get the Government to accept them.",34
210,Mr EWING,Unknown,That ought not to be.  vernment alter it?,34
211,Mr EWING,Unknown,We are making alterations as rapidly as we can.  same thing.,34
212,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Every Minister has not done all that the present Minister has; and, in saying that, I do not lose sight of the work of the honourable and learned member for Corinella.",34
213,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Does the Minister say that whenever offers of service are made for any arm of the Force they will be accepted, irrespective of any Departmental scheme?",34
214,Mr EWING,Unknown,"No' ; he could nqt say that. The Government are ready to give every encouragement to those who are prepared to devote their time to obtaining practice in rifle shooting, volunteer service, and drill.",34
215,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,For the past three years every application for the establishment of a rifle club has been granted without delay.,34
216,Mr EWING,Unknown,"That policy will continue to be followed. The Minister is making the conditions more liberal, though we are desirous that some small knowledge of drill shall be obtained by the members of these clubs. The honourable member for South Sydney has said that in battle it takes a man's weight in lead to kill a combatant. No doubt there is a great deal of truth in that statement, and it is due, to a great extent, to the fact that many of the men engaged are not marksmen. If we could make all the members of our rifle clubs marksmen, and instil into them the rudiments of drill, without creating irritation or interfering with their ordinary vocations, we should have a vast force to draw on in time of trouble, which would be an infinite menace to any power offering to interfere with us.  ing "" like that? What is the percentage of marksmen"" in our forces now ?",34
217,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It ought to be greater than 'it is. But everything cannot'be done in a day or two. If the present Government remain in power for any length of time, the honourable member will see a great improvement.",34
218,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,A statement of that kind means nothing. . It contains no pronouncement of system.,34
219,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Government propose following a definite system in regard to rifle clubs and cadets, have increased the vote for the support of these bodies, and set aside £34,000 for the purchase of rifles. Whatever I may say, it will be objected that the scheme is not complete. The honourable and learned member has admitted the difficulties in regard to the establishment of an efficient coastal or harbour defence.",34
220,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I have never denied them.,34
221,Mr EWING,Unknown,"He has also admitted that the scheme of defence propounded by Major-General Sir Edward Hutton is not sufficient. Will he not also admit that the organization of a cadet force and the popularizing of the rifle clubs will be a step in the right direction, in familiarizing our people with the use of arms?",34
222,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I am not likely to quarrel with my own proposals. What I wish to know is, how are the Government going to do these things?",34
223,Mr EWING,Unknown,The honourable and learned member for Corinella asked how we are going to get competent officers.,34
224,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I said leaders.,34
225,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It might as well beasked how are we going to get competent members of Parliament. We must avail ourselves in both cases of the best material offering. In time of war, every nation has had to pay, and will continue to have to pay, very dearly for the incompetence of its officers. That is a trouble which all countries have to face. The Minister, however, is determined-and this is evidenced by the alterations of the defence regulations-that the position of officer shall not be closed against any class of men. Wherever ability is to be found, no matter how humble the origin of its possessor, it will be recognised. The Minister of Defence is determined that merit alone shall be the ground for promotion.",34
226,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The honourable gentleman does not suggest that that is a new determination ?,34
227,Mr EWING,Unknown,"No . But I am satisfied that the honourable and learned member "".will agree with me that we are taking the proper course in this matter - The honourable and learned member for Corio brought a large number of matters under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and I think the answers which he has received have shown that the desire of the Minister is as indicated. In the . past the examinations have been of such a kind as might allow the mature soldier to be beaten by a boy from the University or from school. Obviously that was wrong. In the future, everything will be done to enable the ranker who possesses the necessary qualifications to rise to the position of officer, and every one who loves his country, and wishes for competent management in military affairs, will insist that able men must be employed wherever they may be found, irrespective of their social status. Does not history afford us numberless examples of men who have sprung from the ranks and rendered noble service? I have explained as far as possible the views of the Government j none of the matters regarding which promises have been made shall be left unattended to. the difficulties that lie before the Minister. I am prepared to admit that, possibly, in our Naval and Military Forces there are men who ought not to be occupying their present positions, but the remedy cannot be applied by any Government in a week or two. Honourable members say there is an incompetent man here, and another there, and we all recognise the disastrous results that would overtake our Military Forces if they were led by incompetent officers in time of war; but the Minister has to obtain some knowledge of the officers before he can make provision for securing thorough efficiency in all branches of the service. I trust that honourable members will be prepared to pass the Estimates in their present form, and leave the rest to the honour of the Government.",34
228,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I suppose that the Minister has said scarcely a word with which we do not heartily agree; but my complaint is that he has confined himself to pleasant generalities, without giving us any specific information.",35
229,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,He has told us about the proposed purchase of rifles.,35
230,Mr EWING,Unknown,And also regarding the expenditure upon cordite..,35
231,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Neithe r of those matters are vital to the defence of Australia. I had hoped that the Minister would have faced the real problem, and that, recognising that we have only limited funds at our disposal, and cannot do all the things we want to do, or even those which are well-nigh essential, he would have indicated how the difficulty was to be met. Every one agrees that the rifle club movement should be extended. When I had the privilege of occupying the position of Minister of Defence I issued instructions that every application for the formation of a' rifle club, in regard to which the necessary requirements had been complied with, shoinld be approved, irrespective of the actual amount of funds available. If there was a deficiency, I was prepared to take the responsibility of securing the approval of my colleagues and of Parliament. There has never been any hindrance to the formation of rifle clubs, and I venture to hold the opinion that, under the regulations as they now stand, rifle clubs are very fairly treated, and have no real ground for complaint. The Minister is sanguine if he believes that there is going to be any sudden enormous enrolment of riflemen At the height of the enthusiasm resulting from the I know South African war, when everything was done to encourage the formation of rifle clubs in Victoria, we enrolled some 22,000 men out of a male electoral population of 300,000 or more. When the Minister talks to us about there being 1,000,000 male electors and 200,000 lads of ages ranging from 15 to 21 in Australia in juxtaposition with the defences of Australia and the provision of arms, does he wish us to understand that the Government propose to begin- I do not suppose they will do it during the current or the next financial year -- a policy which will result in providing rifles and an adequate supply of ammunition for every male capable of bearing arms in Australia?",35
232,Mr EWING,Unknown,"That is the ideal, if the men are fit for it.",35
233,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Then I ask what is the particular danger the Government apprehend ?,35
234,Mr EWING,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member object to rifle clubs?,35
235,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I do not think that is a reasonable or just interjection on the part of the Minister. I am speaking at present of the prospect of a million of men being placed under arms in Australia.,35
236,Mr EWING,Unknown,We shall never see that.,35
237,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I want to know what is the apprehended danger for which these 1 preparations are being made. I want the Government to remember that their first duty - is to provide against the dangers we may reasonably apprehend. They should decide. in the first instance, as to the danger be apprehended, and then provide for meetmany ing it. The most imminent danger should be the first provided against. I have objection to rifle clubs. On the contrary, I have both publicly and privately comhave mitted myself to a strong support of them; but rifle clubs should not be encouraged the expense of equally, or possibly more, necessary branches of our defences - The first business of the Government is to place us in a position to defend ourselves, against imaginary huge attacks in ture, but the probable attacks of the sent and the immediate future. We are not in that position at the present time. No one recognises that more fully than I do. General high-sounding statements about great policies are not what we quire. We want to know what preparations are being made-they have been begun, and have been in the course of developin ment with more or less satisfactory for many years-to enable the Government to say to the country, "" We apprehend tain possible forms of danger to Australia, and we have made our preparations to meet them. We have not gone ""three-fourth's or seven-eighths of the way, with a vague force behind us, but we have completed our parations, and we are now in a position encounter all probable dangers."" If that were done, and the money' were available, the Government might fairly propose undertake a larger scheme. Australia not in danger of attack in force by an army of occupation. I do not think that within our Jives we are likely to see an invasion of Australia by a huge army with the intention .of territorial occupation. is only one power-I need not name itfrom which such a movement towards any part of Australia could possibly be anticipart pated, and the probability is that that power .will not for a 'generation carry such an enterprise, even though it may think of acting in such a manner. Therefore, my mind, the Government proposals suffer from the defects, first, of vagueness, secondly of not being consciously directed to the dangers to be met. I am not referagainst ring to such comparatively small matters whether we should obtain 10,000 more rifles before we procure 5,000 more saddles, or vice vrsd. Such matters can have little effect upon the development of our defence policy. As'regards rifle clubs, I say we should by all means' giVe them every encouragement, but we should not share Mr MCCay. to illusion which unfortunately possesses so of the people of Australia-that if we have plenty of rifles and plenty of men no and ammunition the country will be safe: Even under such conditions we should not progressed very far along the road towards complete defence. The only time at at which such a force would be of use would be in the final resort, with the whole population under arms, fighting against an invader. But that is not the real and immenot diate danger that lies before us. I do the funot wish to speak at any great prelength upon this occasion. I had the privilege of addressing the Committee during the debate upon the Treasurer's financial statement, and I prefer to reserve any further remarks I may have to make until rewe have some definite proposal before us regarding which"" we can speak in something - more than general terms. The Minister, the first part of his speech, answered results the observations he made later on. He fell into an error ini speaking cerof our land forces as something quite apart from our harbour defences, because, to my mind, the existing land forces of Australia are nothing but harbour and coastal defence forces. We have no forces for the preprotection of the inland portions of the to Continent. Such forces would be necessary only' in the last extreme, after a huge army had successfully landed on our shores and to had occupied bases from which the enemy is <vmld develop a campaign of occupation. The whole of our land forces are designed for the purpose of protecting the coastline of Australia against a raid-a n invasion On a small scale-and it is a great There mistake to speak of our land forces and our harbour defences in different breaths, instead of in the same bTeath. They are of the one scheme for the protection of our coast-line, and especially of our centres out of commercial life, our harbors of refuge, and our bases of action. ""Until our armato ments, the equipment of the forces necessary to support those armaments, and whatand ever auxiliary naval support may be required, are complete, our system of defence immediate danger cannot be reas garded as perfected. We must not forget that our real' protection against an army of invasion, whilst Australian territory remains isolated, and our population is small, rests with the Imperial Navy. If we were that not a part of the British Empire, or had not an alliance with the mother country, the we should be helpless against any of the great Powers. Mr . PAGE - I think we all recognise that.",35
238,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Yes ; but I venture to lhink that the Government proposals, so far as one can understand them, do not recognise it .",37
239,Mr EWING,Unknown,In my opening remarks I admitted that.,37
240,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"But the Minister went on to indicate lines of development which, if pursued to the full extent that his remarks would make possible-becaus e he placed no limitations on his proposalmight interfere very seriouslv with the development of the scheme necessary to meet the requirements of the case. In the same way, with regard to our cadets, we shall never place our sea .or land forces upon a sound basis until we begin with the compulsory training of boys at school, and provide for their further training in senior cadet corps, and later on as members of the Defence Forces proper. Switzerland recognises that in her new proposals, which begin with the compulsory training of her boys at school, and which very effectively prevent them from shirking that training by providing that if they do not undergo it whilst at school, they must submit to it when they are young men, without receiving anything in the nature of payment. I am satisfied that we shall never put our defence system upon a perfectly sound basis until we insist upon the compulsory training of our boys at school, so that they may afterwards be enrolled in the senior cadets. I do not say that all service should be compulsory. I dp not - say, for instance, that therta should be compulsory service on the part of those who are engaged in industry. But in the' meantime we have a more urgent duty awaiting us, and that is to establish that system of defence which is necessary to complete the protection - that is already afforded by the Imperial Navy-the defence which is required to secure us against raiding attacks upon a comparatively small scale, and to render Australian ports harbors of refuge.; I was glad to hear the Minister speak today of harbour defence in .contradistinction from coastal defence, because a. great deal of confusion often arises from the loose use of the latter term.. Harbor defence is .an entirely different matter from coastal defence upon the high seas. I do nbt want the Government to postpone expenditure necessary to pfoyitie against immediate , danger, ih. order that they may develop a ptolicy for the distant future. TBaf is the point that I ' wish to urge upon them. The Minister is courteous enough to speak to me frankly upon these matters, whenever I approach him, and in spite of the jocular mcod which he sometimes assumes, I know that he has the question at heart just as much as has any honourable member, and that he is as f u l ly seized as .any one of the dangers of the present situation. : There is only one other word that I have to say, and it is that honourable members who ap-1 pear to take' an excessive interest in these matters are ' not inspired by any feeling of militarism. In the very first speech which I made in this House upon defence matters, I pointed out that the fundamental principle underlying any effective system should be a citizen soldiery. Our present foroe is a citizen force. From what we sometimes hear, one would almost be led to believe that it is not. There are 23,751 men provided for upon these Estimates, of whom only 1,300 are imembers of the permanent forces. As compared with last year's Estimates, there is an increase provided of 1,500 men, of whom only sixty represent an addition to the permanent staff. The whole of the remainder are either citizen soldiers or sailors.",37
241,Mr EWING,Unknown,The administrative staff is low.,37
242,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Yes . I wish honourable members to recognise that we must have permanent - officers to assist in the instruc-. tion of the citizen fonces. To. take men into a campaign without first having done what is reasonable in the way of providing them lyith proper leaders-and in the term "" leaders,"" I include a corporal just 1 as much as a general-is nothing more nor less than murder. War teaches no lesson other than that men who are well led, perform their work with less loss of life than do troops who are indifferently l e d ; indeed, the great loss of lif e which has occurred in many battles has been directly due to bad leadership. I do not draw any distinction, between commissioned and' non-commissioned officers as regards the responsibilities of leadership, 'except that the former have a greater' measure of responsibility, T iclass them' allunder ' the 'term ""'leaders."" Consecjuently, I ''would urge the Government '-""'not to starve the instructional staff ""of the Citizen Forces-in any shape or . for m . Whilst I Was at - the', 1 head of the Defence Department, I ' madff 1 somesmall increases in''the'""Instructional' Staff; - which, I am glad to, see that the Government have retained. They constitute the-.minimum of whs£t is - required - * - . ; v :",37
243,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We propose to increase them.,38
244,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I am very glad to hear that, in view of the keen scrutiny to which increases in that staff are usually subjected. Whilst I was in office I visited every State for the purpose of inquiring into the conditions which obtained, and 1 decided upon the spot what was the minimum, increase necessary in the case of the Instructional. Staff. In regard to the cadet movement, I conferred personally with the Minister of Education in each State, 'and I am very sanguine that much good will result from those conferences. At the same time, I think that any proposal in regard to the cadet movement must provide for compulsory training at school. The adoption of that system need not interfere with the existing cadet force at all. I am aware that a number of cadet officers imagine that such a course would injure existing organizations. There need not be the slightest apprehension on that ground. Instead of injuring them, it would extend their scope. At the present time there are between iz,ooo and 13,000 cadets in thei Commonwealth, including 4,000 in Victoria, an equal number in New South Wales, between 2,000 and 3,000 in Western Australia, about 1,000 in Queensland, between 1,300 and 1,400 in South' Australia, and 200 in Tasmania. A ll that we desire is to increase that number. There was no intention on my part-and I do not think there is oni the part of the present Government - to put an end to the work that has been done, already in connection with the cadet forces. In Victoria, and ini nearly all the other States, those forces are under State control. In New South Wales there are 4,000 cadets under State control, and we desire to extend that system throughout all the schools. But to this end it is essential that the Commonwealth' should secure the co-operation of all the States. The Commonwealth hjas the instructors, who can impart information to the teachers. A very small . additional expenditure would suffice for that. Then the teachers would instruct the boys at school, and finally the Commonwealth would step in and ascertain the results of that instruction. Each would use the instruments which it had at hand. That is the only way in which the work cari be carried out cheaply and effectively. Co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth is absolutely essential. The great advantage of the system of compulsory training which I am advocating is that, instead of taking young men, who are earning their livelihood, away from their work for purposes of instruction, we should take that instruction to the boys at school. As I said before, I want to see the "" three R's"" in our public school curriculum changed into four, namely, reading, writing, arithmetic, and rifles. Therein, I think, lies the secret of the future development of our Defence Forces. I do ask the Government to remember that they must not sacrifice the present for the future, any more than they should sacrifice the future for the present. My complaint against the Minister is that he did not tell us the methods by which these excellent objects ,are to be attained. We all agree as to the ends in view, and there is no quarrel with the desire to attain them. The trouble 1 is not ""What do you want to do,"" but "" How are you going to do it ?"" It is these methods of procedure which have chiefly to be considered, and in regard to which it is most necessary that we should reeeive information. I intend to wait till I have the Government proposals in a specific form before venturing to offer any criticisms upon them. So far as I am concerned, this is not a party matter, and , if my assistance is thought worth having, it is always at the disposal of the Government. I must confess, however, that in some respects I am sorry to observe the course of administration in the Defence Department during the past few months. I should like to say that army organization-whethe r citizen or otherwise-is not consonant with the democratic idea of government by majority, and it cannot be so in its essence. The very essence of the organization of a fighting force is the maintenance of proper subordination, and of the chain of responsibility and authority. With every respect to the Minister and to the democratic principles which the Vice-President of the Executive Council vaunted a few minutes ago, I do say that it is necessary- I do not wish to see injustice done in order to achieve this result - to preserve the spirit of subordination and discipline in our forces. I do think that the Government have done two or three things recently which, instead of tending to preserve that spirit, are calculated to be subversive of discipline and of subordination. I have no desire to mention names, but I will take one specific case which haa aroused considerable interest. I refer to the case of Major Carroll, who was recently replaced on the instructional staff in Victoria. I have no desire to go into the merits or demerits of his case. He has been returned to duty by Executive authority, and I do not intend to say anything whdch might in any way interfere with his usefuless, or which might appear derogatory to him. 1 will neither say that his return to duty constituted the remedying of an injustice, nor that it did not. That is a matter of opinion amongst those who have readthe evidence taken before the Select Committee which investigated his complaint. In passing, I may say that I doubt whether the Minister himself has read that evidence. - He may have read the report, but I doubt whether he has read the evidence. Major Carroll, I venture to assert, was restored to his present position contrary to the administrative advisers of the Department. Such a course of action must inevitably lead to the conclusion that, right or wrong",38
245,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The honourable and learned member would not reinstate him.,39
246,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I may say at once that I informed Major Carroll that I did not propose to reinstate him.,39
247,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is a kind of discipline which can be purchased at too great a price.,39
248,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I have no desire to see discipline purchased at the price of injustice. But the honourable member must: admit that the case to which I am referring is one in regard to which very wide differences of opinion exist.,39
249,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"In - the preliminary stages of the inquiry there was ""no room for difference of opinion.",39
250,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I twice read the whole of the evidence taken before the Select Committee, and, having done so, I notified Major Carroll in the terms I have mentioned. But my point ds that we must not create in the force a feeling that, if a member can exert sufficient political pressure, he can achieve his object. That is a danger which we must guard against, and that, I fear, is what has already taken - place to some extent. I quite admit that this Parliament is the court of final appeal to remedy injustice. Nevertheless, we must not create the feeling that it is only necessary for an officer to bring sufficient political pressure to bear in order to attain his object. The proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corio in regard to the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the Defence regulations would, if adopted, have ,a similarly disastrous result.",39
251,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"A lot of abuses exist which ought to* be remedied, and the honourable and learned member himself is responsible for some of them.",39
252,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The honourable and learned member for Corio is now making another of his personal attacks. His hostility to me dates from a very well-defined period. I do not wish to say anything more in regard to that matter.,39
253,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I have no personal hostility towards the honourable and learned member, and am sorry that he should think that I have.",39
254,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I shall leave the Committee, who have observed the. honourable and learned member's attitude ""from time to time towards myself and my administration, to form their own conclusion as' to whether or not he is an impartial critic. Whilst I fully admit, as I have said, that it is not only the right, but the duty of the Parliament, as the court of final appeal, to remedy wrongs, I wish to point out that there is one connection in which that right must be exercised with the utmost caution, and that is where parliamentary action might produce an opinion that political pressure will secure its own reward, quite irrespective of the merits of the particular case.",39
255,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,That is a reflection upon honourable members.,39
256,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I am not reflecting upon any one. I say that we must take great care that such an impression is not produced. In my opinion, one or two things which the Government have done lately, and the way in which they have done them, have been calculated to produce, and have to some extent given ;rise to, that impression. I hope it will always be remembered, whilst justice is being done to individuals in the Forces, that justice should also be clone to the community by preserving that spirit of discipline and subordination which is the first essential of a citizen force.  that that spirit of discipline might not be preserved.",39
257,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"It does; and to make that assertion in a perfectly friendly spirit, and without arrogance, is not in my opinion to cast a reflection upon any one. I am afraid that in zeal for well-doing in individual cases, a Minister who does not quite realise to the full the necessity for subordination, and for the maintenance of a proper spirit amongst the Citizen Forces, may unintentionally go too far, and do more harm than good. I therefore, in the most friendly spirit possible, offer these few sugspecial items. gestions to the Ministry. I find in the Estimates a proposal to grant sums of money to two commissioned officers, both of them being very excellent men. are not the only men who have retired from the Forces under similar circumstances during the last year or two; but the whole point is that they have brought influence to bear.",39
258,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No . We are informed that of all the oflicers they are the only two in anything like the same position.,40
259,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Non-commissione d officers have also been retired.,40
260,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I do not think that the two to whom the honourable and learned member refers are on exactly the same footing,.",40
261,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,No one will deny that they are the two who' have brought influence to bear.,40
262,Mr EWING,Unknown,I never saw an honourable member in regard to either of them.,40
263,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I do not suppose that the honourable gentleman did; but I repeat that they are the two who brought influence to bear.,40
264,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable and learned member will have an opportunity to discuss that point when we reach the division in which the item appears.,40
265,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Surely , Mr Chairman, I may point out that, in making provision fpr gratuities in these Estimates, the Government have selected spme officers and excluded Pthers? We are allowed upon the first division of the Estimates to enter upon a general discussion with regard to the administratipn pf the Department.",40
266,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"That is SP; but the henprable and learned member, whilst at liberty tp refer incidentally to particular items in other divisions, may not npw discuss them-.",40
267,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I wish tc refer tp the items in question, in order to give point to my argument that there is a danger of a belief arising that political pressure can be brought to bear to advantage.",40
268,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,That is tantamount to a charge of corruption.,40
269,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"It is not.  rule, Mr Chairman, that we are not at liberty to discuss any item in these Estimates ?",40
270,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,No .  why the honourable and learned member for Corinella was not allowed to refer to two,40
271,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I would remind honourable members that we are now followThese ing the practice adopted in the House of Commons with regard to the Army and Navy Estimates. There a statement is usually made by the Minister upon the first votes that are proposed to the' Committee, and a general discussion then takes place. It is at that stage, and at that stage only, that such a debate occurs, and whilst particular items may be referred to by way of illustration, they may not be discussed. I will quote a paragraph appearing in May, on page 584, which deals with the pointIn accordance with general usage, the main principle which governs debate in the Committee of Supply is relevancy to the matter which the question proposed from the chair submits to the committee. To this rule a necessary exception is made. The expenditure on the army and navy services, though spread over various sources' of outlay, is expenditure devoted to one object. By established usage, therefore, the Minister in charge ot the army or navy Estimates makes a general statement concerning the services for the year upon the first votes that are proposed to the committee, namely, the votes which determine"" the number of the land forces and seamen that shall be maintained, or for their pay; and a general discussion upon the army and navy services is taken thereon. This power , of general debate does not, however, sanction discussion in detail upon special subjects, which must be reserved until the grant for that special service is before the committee, such as the re-organization of the controlling authorities over navy expenditure, or the tactics adopted during naval manoeuvres. It is upon this 'practice that I base my ruling. I wash honourable members to clearly understand that they will not lose anything by being prevented at this stage from discussing a particular item in detail. They will recognise that if they were ""allowed to do so, they ought also to be allowed to propose an amendment relating to the item, and that, if that were done, it would anticipate a vote on a particular division of the Estimates. I feel bound to add that, up to the ppint at which I interrupted the honprable and learned member fer Cprinella, I dp not think that he had transgressed, but it appeared to me that he was proceeding to discuss the merits of a proposal which wculd ccme befpre the Cpmmittee later on.",40
272,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not wish the impres-. sipn to gp abroad that those who bring influehce'to bear fare better than those who do not. In 1902, the Parliament practically declared that gratuities should not be given to officers upon their retirement. - Mr WATSON - And yet we gave some.",40
273,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"We gave them to men who were being retired in pursuance of a retrenchment scheme upon the distinct standing, as pointed out by the honourable member . for Hume-the n Acting Minister of Defence-that this was not to be taken as a precedent, and that gratuities were not in future to be given. I find that the Estimates now before us make provision for gratuities to two persons, while no provision is made for others, who have retired from the Department in circumstances not distinguishable from those of the two to whom I refer. I do not know what is the reason for this, unless it be that the two in question have represented their cases more actively than the others have done. If such be the position, it is calculated to produce a bad impression. There are non-commissioned officers-at all events, I know of one non-commissioned officer-wh' o retired towards the end of last year under circumstances identical with those of at least one of the men to whom it is proposed to grant a gratuity. When I was in office I obeyed the decision of Parliament, and provided gratuities for no one. I now find that selections are being made. I do not think that is desirable in the interests of the forces or of the public. Either every man should receive a gratuity, or no one should receive one. That is the position I wish to put, but it is not the course followed by the placing of these amounts on the Estimates. When Minister of Defence, I declined to provide any gratuities, because I understood it to be the will of the Parliament that none should be granted. Not because I do not feel as keenly as any one might tEe harshness of the circumstances under which some persons have had to retire from the Commonwealth Public Service, on account of illness. It seems to me, however, that selections are being made, and I consider that very undesirable.",41
274,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Did not the honourable and learned gentleman say, in this Chamber last year, that if Parliament showed that it wished these gratuities to be given he would grant them ?",41
275,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"NO ; I said that if Parliament showed a desire to that effect I would ask the Cabinet to reconsider the matter. The honourable member for Bland asked me what the exact position of the Government was, but, although he tried to lure me into saying something more, I would not go beyond the statement. I have just repeated.",41
276,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I was not then convinced of the wisdom of giving these gratuities, and I should like to hear further arguunder- ment on the subject now.",41
277,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"After the debate referred to by the honourable and learned member for Corio, I went into the whole matter again, and found that I must adhere to my first conclusion; that it would be contrary to my duty to recommend the payment of these gratuities. What I say how is that selections are being made, and I disapprove of that course. There should be a general rule, applicable to every case, instead of allowing consideration to be given to those who represent their claims most strongly. I do not wish it to be understood that I am in any way opposed to the development of the rifle club movement, because I am one of its warmest friends, and my actions have shown me to be so. I agree with the Minister that every facility should be given to allow the best men to become leaders, either as commissioned or non-commissioned officers, without regard to their social position, or any consideration other than qualification for the work demanded of them.",41
278,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) There are a number of items in separate divisions, providing. for grants in different States, which are unequal, and I wish to refer to this inequality. Shall I be in order when the first of these divisions is before the Committee, in referring to the items in the other five divisions?",41
279,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Certainly ; if the items-are connected with each other.,41
280,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I feel it my duty to reply to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who says that since a certain occasion I have shown personal antagonism towards him. I have not approved of his administration at all times, though I think that fie displayed a great deal of energy, when Minister of Defence, but I am absolutely unconscious of having displayed any personal antagonism towards the honourable member. However, my practice is not to allow personal matters to be discussed openly in a Committee, or in the House, but to go to the honourable member who has raised them, and straightforwardly ask Bim the meaning of what HeTfias said. That I shall do in this case.",41
281,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,T have not seen evidence of personal antagonism.,42
282,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I am not conscious of having displayed any. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has explained these Estimates under considerable difficulties, because he does not know very much about the working of the Defence Department, and can only echo the opinions of the Minister at the head of ft. The position shows clearly the need for having the Ministers in charge of the three great spending Departments of State-the Customs Department, the Defence Department, and the Post Office-in this Chamber. While I should be sorry for our valued and democratic friend, Senator Playford, to leave the Cabinet, I should like to see a rearrangement of portfolios, which would enable the Vice-President of the Executive Council to speak to us with authority on defence matters. At the present time whenever a question is asked in this Chamber of the Minister of Defence, the honourable gentleman puts us off by saying that the matter will be considered. I think that if our records were examined it would be seen that most of the questions which have been asked of the Minister of Defence have been answered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in that way. Seeing, however, that this Chamber has the power of the purse, we should be able to get direct information in regard to the administration of a Department like the Defence Department.",42
283,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member suggests that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is only an understudy to the Minister of Defence. """,42
284,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I do not think that he will deny that.,42
285,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,-He is a good understudy.,42
286,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Yes ; but his position is one of difficulty. I should like to know what we are to understand by his statement that the Government intend to bring to Australia two officers of great ability and intellect to inquire thoroughly tion of our defences.,42
287,Mr EWING,Unknown,"What I said was that, notwithstanding the ability of our advisers, the Government must be perfectly assured of their ground, and that it might therefore be necessary to get some supreme intellect to review the position, so that we may be satisfied that we are placing the right scheme before Parliament. While I said that that might be necessary, I did not say that it would be necessary.",42
288,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Are we to take it that it is the intention of the Minister of Defence to import one or two experts ?,42
289,Mr EWING,Unknown,The Government has come to no determination on the matter. I speak of this only as a possibility.,42
290,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I understand that it may be necessary that two experts of supreme intellect should be brought out. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Would 1 the honourable and learned member agree to become one of them?,42
291,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I am an Australian, and ready to hand, so that I could not be brought but, though perhaps 1I have sufficient confidence in myself to take any position. If honourable members will listen to me, they can have the benefit of my experience and advice at any time. I should like the Government to remember, however, the mistakes of the past in the matter of bringing out experts.",42
292,Mr EWING,Unknown,It is not proposed that any one shall be brought out.,42
293,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The Minister may know the circular mound near the entrance to Port Phillip, which a very great expert advised the Government to convert into a fort. The place is known as the Pope's Eye, and about £10,000 were expended in depositing rock and other material there to carry this advice info effect. Then another supreme intellect came along, and suggested that nothing should be done. Consequently the money already spent has been-'wasled, and the islet is gradually being washed away. The place is of no value for the defence of the port, but might in time of war be used by the enemy against our own defenders.",42
294,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Has the honourable and learned member represented this state of things to the Government?,42
295,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I am doing so now. The facts are all on record in the Departinto the posiment of Defence.,42
296,Mr EWING,Unknown,There is no danger of the Government being in a hurry to import an expert.,42
297,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I am glad to hear that, though I am surprised at the statement, in view of the recent announcement of the Minister of Defence that he would not reemploy Imperial officers now in our service, but would make use of Australian officers. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has slightly enlarged upon the scheme which the Prime Minister put before honourable members a little while ago in speaking of the alterations that the Government propose to make in the scheme of defence prepared by the late Minister, the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I do not wholly agree with either the present scheme or that of the late Minister, because each rejects what I regard as essentials. The late Minister of Defence made no adequate provision for the purchase of rifle9 and cordite, while the present Minister of Defence makes no proper provision for other matters to which the late Minister considered it absolutely necessary to give attention. Neither of them appear ready to face the real necessities of the situation, and to ask the people of the Commonwealth to provide the funds, required to niake our defence absolutely effective. The present Minister admits that, in his opinion, our harbour defence is not satisfactory; but the Estimates contain no provision for making them sp, and, in presenting such Estimates to Parliament, he is really passing a vpte of censure on himself. There it really no great difference between the scheme of the present Minister and that of his predecessor. The latter really gets down to the proposals of Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, and the present Minister is adopting those proppsals. NP dpubt, SP lpng as we depend pn the British Navy f p r protection as the basis of our defence, all that Ministers can do is to fill in subsidiary or gaps in our scheme of defence. Under Major-General Hutton's scheme we are dependent upon the Imperial Navy as the first line of defence. His purpose was not only to serve Australia, but the Empire, and the provision which he made for Light Horse regiments was designed to place at the disposal of the Empire in time of war a useful body of men ' who would be available for service abroad. To that extent his scheme went beypnd what was absolutely necessary. The Minister said that it was proposed to largely increase the supplv of cordite and ammunition.",42
298,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I said that it was intended to increase our stock of ammunition for immediate requirements, but that it was desired to make provision for the local manufacture of all the ammunition we required.",43
299,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"On the 15th September, the Minister of Defence said that he did not think it was practicable to arrange for the local manufacture of cordite, because two proposals had been submitted to him, neither of which he could accept.",43
300,Mr EWING,Unknown,"That merely indicated his temporary attitude towards the subject. It is a matter of money. Mr CROUCH,-This matter has been under the consideration of successive Governments for a long time, and yet we appear as far off a settlement as ever. In connection with the manufacture of cordite in Australia, it must be recognised that the whole of the requirements of the Commonwealth for twelve months in times of peace could be manufactured in one factory in eighteen working days. The Government could not afford to incur a large initial outlay in procuring machinery and plant, for which they would have only a limited use. Therefore, it seems to me. that it will be necessary to associate the manufacture pf cordite with spme commercial enterprise. I understand that the Defence Department are now paying 2s. 8d. per pound for the cordite they require, and that the Australian Ammunition Company has offered to lay down the plant necessary to enable them to manufacture cordite here if the Government will agree to purchase from them 50,000 lbs. annually at 3s. 2d. per lb. The Government are being asked tp pay a price only 20 per cent, in advance of that at which they are now purchasing the article, and it is a question for serious consideration whether it would not be in the best interests of the Commonwealth to parts accept these terms. The company would be able to supply all the cordite required, even under the stress of war, and we should thus be rendered independent of supplies from abroad. I desire to impress upon the Committee the serious importance of this matter, and I trust that it will nof be lost sight of by the defence authorities. In regard to the cadet forces, I understand that the late Minister of Defence has propounded a scheme under which the cadet training would be restricted to lads above twelve years of age. Such' a system might be applied with advantage to the grammar schools and similar institutions, but it must be remembered that the great majority of lads leave the State schools when they are between the ages of thirteen and fourteen. It appears to me. to be necessary to provide for at least' three years' train ing in the case of cadets, and if years is to be-.regarded as the age at which the training 'should commence, it will necessary to require lads who had to the time , of leaving school, passed through the three years' training to attend drill afterwards until they had completed the full .:x>urse. Personally, I do not think that we can commence too early to drill school children. In considering this matof the Estimates. ter the Minister will have to look to the drill-books that are supplied. At present we have a drill-book which was issued three years ago, after the close of the South A can war. That replaced a system of drill which had been in use since the days of battle of Waterloo. I understand that it youths over the age of eighteen. is now intended to issue another new drillam book entirely different from that now in use. Constant changes in the methods of drill will interfere seriously with the tinuity of the training of our cadets, it appears to me that we should adopt some permanent form. What is' the use of training either boys or men in a form of drill which in three years will become obsolete? The Minister has pointed out that there are in the Commonsettlement wealth 1,200.000 men and boys over the age of fifteen who would be availExternal able for military service. That number would include many individuals who are considerably below the standard height adopted in .connection with our Defence Forces. It has always seemed to rather hard that men who are of less stature than 5 feet 6 inches should be debarred from taking part in the defence of their country. In England the standard is 5 feet i \ inches, and in some continental tries 5 feet i j inches, and I think that in these days when a soldier needs primarily to exercise his intelligence we should 'cease to follow the iron-bound methods of the old Tuesday. country by which we have been trammelled for so long. If we do so, we shall have made available to us a large quantity of useful material.",43
301,Mr EWING,Unknown," A con^ dence siderable number of honourable members have expressed their desire to take part this debate,"" and although I had hoped that State. these Estimates would have been disposed of this afternoon, I am willing to agree an adjournment at this stage. I trust that honourable members will assist me to finish the Estimates on Tuesday next.

It is proposed on Tuesday next to proceed with the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill , and to afterwards continue the consideration",44
302,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," Some little time ago I asked the Prime Minister a question with regard to flogging in the f r i - Navy. He has been good enough to give me a reply, from which it appears that the flogging or birching is not practised upon As I informed that the contrary practice has sometimes prevailed, I should like to have the fact placed upon the official record. conTherefore, I should feel obliged if the and Prime Minister would announce to the House the reply that he has received.",44
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he is. yet in a position to inform the House what steps have been taken to bring about a of the Federal Capital dispute?,44
304,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," In reply to the deputy leader of the Opposition, I wish to say that the only new development in the matter to which he refers since it was last before the House, is that the Attorney-General of me New South Wales has received ere this the letter to which I referred yesterday, and to which I hope to receive a prompt reply, which will close the correspondence.",44
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why not let us counknow the contents of that letter?,44
306,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have not a copy of it with me now, otherwise I would lay it upon the table. I will , however, do so on",44
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think the Prime Minister is treating the House with contempt.,44

309,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I follow a different to practice from that adopted in New South Wales, and it seems to me that it is not in accordance with the usual procedure to publish correspondence before it is fairly complete.",44
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This is essentially a matter upon which the public should be informed stage by stage.,45
311,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not pretend that my view of the question is so obdurate that 1 would refuse-if only to meet the wish of the honourable member-to publish the correspondence dav by day. But it seems to me that it is beneath the dignity of honourable members to have such corre sporidence' laid before them in scraps. However, I am perfectly prepared to obligeIt is purely a question of taste. In answer to the honourable and learned member for Corio, I wish to say that the Naval' Commander-in-Chief has replied as follows: Inquiries have been made in regard to this matter, and it'is learned that ""flogging,"" by.which term is. meant corporal punishment with the cat, is no longer carried out in the Navy. The only form of corporal punishment in vogue in the Navy is the birching and caning of youths under 18 years of age, and the former of these two punishments is only inflicted for grave offences, which, in the case of men, would' probably entail a term of imprisonment with hard labour. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.3 p.m ",45
