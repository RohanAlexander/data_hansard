Lt - Colonel ABBOTT -""Wtil l the Acting Attorney-General inform me if in the Active Service Moratorium Regulations, which apply to members of the Australian Imperial Porce, provision is made i u cases of hardship for an extension of the term of a mortgage beyond the period specified in the regulations embodied in the schedule to the Bill as introduced?",21
2,Mr GROOM,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM,"The honourable member was good enough to' inf orm me that he intended to ask this question. When the Bill was under discussion the honourable member, who has taken a keen interest in this matter, raised the question of the right of soldiers to have applied to them the same privileges as are accorded private citizens under the General Moratorium Regulations in regard to an extension of the term of a mortgage on the ground of hardship: In the case of ordinary citizens, under' the General Moratorium, after the expiry of the time specified, a further extension of twelve months may be granted in cases of hardship, and - the honourable member urged that this extensionshould also be provided for in the case of members of the Australian. Imperial Force under the Active Service Moratorium.. In Committee ou the Bill I moved an amendment of the schedule dealing with the Active Service Moratorium Regulation's, so as to give the soldiers the same rights in this respect as is given to private individuals. The honourable member's wish has, therefore, been gratified. Amendments were made to the schedule of the Bill in which these regulations are embodied for an extension of the prescribed dates in the General Moratorium, which ranged from August until June, 1920, so as to provide for a sliding scale running from February, 1920, to July, 1920. Tbese several amendments have been embodied in the respective War Precautions Regulations, so that they are now in operation. When the Moratorium Bill is passed those regulations, as amended, will continue in force by virtue of the Act. MR. JOWETT, M.P., AND THE NATIONAL EEDEEATION.",21
3,Mr TUDOR,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM,Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been drawn to a paragraph in the press Stating that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has resigned his position as a member of the National Federation?,22
4,Mr HIGGS,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM,As a trustee.,22
5,Mr TUDOR,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM,"As a trustee or vicepresident. If the statement is correct, does it mean that the honourable member has also resigned from the party under whose auspices he was elected, and are we to take it that the Ministerial party is falling to pieces or merely decaying?",22
6,Mr SPEAKER,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM," The question is not in order, and the Acting Prime Minister will not be in order in replying to it, since it has nothing to do with the administration of any Department, and does not relate to a matter coming within the official cognisance of members of the Government. TAXATION OF LEASEHOLDS.",22
7,Mr EICHAED FOSTER,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM,"In view of a reported statement that the revenue derived from the taxation of pastoral leaseholds in arid, unreliable rainfall country in the interior does not cover the cost of valuation and administration, aiid having regard also to the fact that the decision of the High Court in the case of the Canowie Pastoral Company, was unfavorable to the Department in respect of such valuations, will the Treasurer state whether it is the intention of the Government to discontinue the taxation of such leaseholds in the interior?",22
8,Mr WATT,ACTI VE SERVICE MORATORIUM,"I have not seen the statement to which the honourable member refers,-and know nothing as to its import other than what he has conveyed. I think my honourable friend is aware that a Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the basis of valuation of Crown leaseholds under the Land Tax Act. It is not correct to say that the revenue derived from those leases is insufficient for any purpose, since the collection of the tax has been held up pending the decision. It is not the intention of the Government to eliminate the taxation of Crown leaseholds; but it is desirous of embodying in legislation, if the recommendation of the Commission be in that direction, perhaps a more equitable method of valuation. NA WOEKS.",22
9,Mr FENTON,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The Premier of New South Wales, in announcing a comprehensive public works policy, is reported to have intimated the intention of his Government to proceed with the construct tion of 200 miles of railway, and to have said: "" These lines the Commonwealth . Government have arranged to finance out of the proceeds of the forthcoming war loan."" Will the Treasurer state whether that statement is correct, and, if so, whether this policy on the part of the Commonwealth Government will apply to all States?",22
10,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I have not seen the statement quoted by the honourable member, and cannot imagine that the Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales would have made such a bald announcement .without a fuller explanation. Condensation has probably produced the rough meaning of his statement without the necessary qualifications. The Premier of New South Wales is aware, as is the head of every State Government, that we have made proposals to the States to finance certain works of a repatriative kind that will lead to land settlement. The arrangement made holds good with regard to all the States that accept it. I do not know whether it embraces, in the case of New South Wales, Â£2,000,000, more or less, but it is a general arrangement with all the States. 11608 Wheat Pool. [REPRESENTATIVES.] WHEAT POOL.",22
11,Mr GREGORY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"In view of the very favourable financial statement published this morning by the Minister in charge of the Wheat Pool, will the Treasurer state whether it will be possible to have furthe r dividends declared at an early date in connection with that Pool?",23
12,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"It is easy to perceive the solicitude of representatives of rural districts with regard to the distribution of further moneys from the Wheat Pool. I have endeavoured to explain before, that until the question of payment for the recent sales to the British Government by the Australian Wheat Board is settled, the Commonwealth Treasury cannot see its way to authorize auy further payments. The Government, however, is desirous of clearing up the matter as soon as possible. We are still cabling the Imperial authorities, and will announce the policy to be pursued as soon as it is possible to do so. BLYTHERIVERIRON DEPOSITS. by the court martial Mr TOWLER . - Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether the Government's option over the Blythe River iron deposits has been abandoned, and whether it is the intention of the Government to enter into speculations of a similar character ?",23
13,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"As announced this week, in another place, it is not proposed to exercise the option to which the honourable member refers. The Government gave instructions to have all the reports, plans, assay results, and figures, which are embodied in the report of the experts, copied for presentation to both Houses of Parliament, and that I expect will be done, next week. As to what the honourable member refers to as "" speculations,"" I give no pledges. PASTORALLEASE S, NORTHERN such TERRITORY.",23
14,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"In regard to an advertisement inviting applications for leases of pastoral blocks in the Northern Territory, and setting out the rental, and the requirements as to stocking up to a certain l i m it within a given time, I desire to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether he has Seamen's Strike. based that l i m it of demand for stocking on the advice of expert pastoralists who are familiar with the country?",23
15,Mr GLYNN,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The conditions were settled with the Administrator on information supplied by him and gathered in the Territory. Many months ago I saw some pastoralists in South Australia and discussed with them the question of what conditions should be provided for in respect of these leases. It was on such facts as were then gained that the conditions were finally settled. If the honourable member has any suggestion to make I shall be pleased to receive it . COURT MARTIAL ON HMAS. AUSTRALIA.,23
16,Mr MAHONY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"As the control of the Australian Navy has again reverted to the Commonwealth Government, is the Acting Minister for the Navy prepared to take the responsibility of extending clemency to the lads who were sentenced on HMAS. Australia?  do anything until the Admiralty has had an opportunity of seeing the papers and dealing with the request that has already been made to them by the Government. I think it would be very wrong to step in at this particular stage in order to do what the honourable member suggests. SEAMEN'S STRIKE. FOOD SCARCITY AT WYNDHAM .",23
17,Mr GREGORY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"At the present time there is a serious shortage of food at Wyndham. The Western Australian Government are able to send food supplies as far north as Derby by the Singapore line of steamers, and I desire to ask the Acting Minister for the Navy whether he will use his utmost endeavours to have supplies carried at short intervals to Wyndham ?  ber is aware of the present situation, and I shall certainly do what he requests. We have already promised that when we return to anything like normal shipping conditions first consideration will be given to those districts most urgently in need of supplies. I am doing all I can, as the honourable member is aware, to have food supplies sent to those places that are very badly situated. EUSSIAN INTEENEES .",23
18,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"> I have received a telegram from the Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council, requesting me to inquire from the Acting Prime Minister whether he can give any information as to when the Eussian internees will be deported, and whether Miss Eeid will be allowed to accompany a man named JQushin. I understand that Miss Eeid has been married to this man under Eussian law.",24
19,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"As to the first part of the question, I am afraid that I cannot give any definite information regarding when the Eussian internees will be deported. We are operating in association with the Government of Britain in matters relating to other nations, and all the ports of Eussia are still closed to deportations from British or other belligerent oountries.",24
20,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,What about Odessa?,24
21,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Odessa , Vladivostock, and all the Baltic ports are closed. As soon as a port opens, which we are advised will accept deportees, the Eussian aliens here will be deported. As to the latter part of the question, I am not familiar - with the circumstances of the association between the two parties referred to, and I cannot give any promise. DEPOETATIONS. POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT.",24
22,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC," I have received from the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The policy of the Government with regard to deportations."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",24
23,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Capricornia) [11.20] It appeai-3 to me to he necessary to aet promptly in this matter, seeing that the [436]- A House might adjourn at any time, and the people whom the Government propose to deport might be on the high seas before we had an opportunity to deal with the questions I propose to bring under the notice of honourable members. We have grave reason to complain of the manner in which the Government have treated this question of deporting enemy subjects, and, indeed, of the manner in which they have treated the whole question of deportations. As long ago as the 27th June I brought under the notice of the House a circular-letter issued to the wives of enemy aliens, to this effectHead-Quarters, Brisbane, 12th June, 1919. It is possible that your husband will be deported. If so, you and your children will have to accompany him, except under the following conditions:1. If you were a British subject before your marriage, you have the right to refuse to accompany your husband, and you will be allowed to remain in Australia. 2. All children born in Australia have the right to remain here if they so desire. It will therefore be necessary for you to forward to this office immediately your certificate of marriage, and the certificate of birth of your children. In the event of yotir not being able to produce these certificates, it will be necessary for you to supply this ofiice with the date and place of your marriage, and also the full Christian name, date and place of birth of each of your children. Should the children desire to stay here though their parents are deported, they will have to state their desire in writing. In exceptional cases, the wife of an enemy alien subject may be allowed to remain in Australia even if she were not a British subject before her marriage, in which case it is necessary that she state fully her reasons for not desiring to accompany her husband. C. Woons, Captain, Intelligence Section, General Staff. That is only one of many circular-letters issued by the Government to various people throughout Australia.",24
24,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Was the circular issued by the Government or the Commandants.,24
25,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I shall tell the honourable member the facts so far as I know them. When I brought that circularletter under the notice of the House I asked whether the Government approved of it . The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) interjected, "" Were those circulars sent out indiscriminately, or only to certain in d i v iduals?"" and the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) replied, "" Only to certain in dividuals."" I forwarded a petition to the Acting Prime Minister, but, owing to that gentleman's illness, it was sent on to the Defence Department, and, in reply, I received a letter, signed by Mr T . Trumble, Secretary, dated 14th July, Stating, amongst other thingsWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, addressed to the Acting Prinie Minister, and a petition received by you from certain enemy aliens resident in the Ambrose and Mt. Larcom districts, together with a supporting petition signed by either residents of the districts, I have to' inform you that nothing is known of these individual cases at head-quarters, but that only in exceptional cases is it proposed to call on uninterned enemy aliens to show cause why they should not be deported, and that before any person is deported he will have an opportunity of applying to a specially appointed tribunal for permission to remain in Australia.",24
26,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The Commandants acted on their own authority.,25
27,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"If so, it is the duty of the Government to prove the fact. The Government appointed a Committee, to go into the question of the policy of the Government with regard to those aliens, and came to a decision.",25
28,Mr CORSER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Was not come to before the Committee was appointed ?,25
29,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"No . I have tried to get fro m the Government what the Committee reported, and what was the Government's decision or what was the attitude of the Government; but the Acting Prime Minister has been unable, so far , to put the paper on the table, although he was under the impression that it had already been placed there. of the Committee has been kept back, and we desire to know why. ment have said that they are prepared to tako responsibility for the conclusions of the two Boards, the Special Committee of Magistrates and the Committee of Reference, in regard to the matter. It is all very well for the Government to he preREPRESENTATIVES.] Deportations. pared to take responsibility for the action of any of the Boards, hut my complaint is that the Government have not looked into matters for themselves, and that previous wrongs are being perpetrated. As late as the 22nd July a letter was written from the Department of Defence, signed hy Captain C. Woods, of the General Staff, the same gentleman who had signed the circular-letter I have read, to a lady residing at Mount LarcomWith reference to your letter of the 14th inst., I have to inform you that you will be allowed to take 84 lbs. of luggage with you, and, in addition, you may carry a small parcel of articles for immediate requirements. You will be permitted to take f50 sterling, or its equivalent in valuables. With regard to your farm, you may appoint an attorney to look after your interests, but its disposal will be decided by the Government.",25
30,Mr GROOM,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Is that the wif e of an internee ?,25
31,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I cannot say whether the lady is the wife of an internee, but her name is Mrs N . Koppchen. He r letter was embodied in a petition signed by several mothers who are claiming the consideration of the Government. In that petition is the following: And what about the farms? Are wo given pay for our work and the work of our men? We, the wives of those men who are to be deported in the name of our children, many of them born in Australia, emphatically protest the decision against the confiscation of our property. We women and children arc entitled to the earnings of our men and fathers, ancl by wronging them you arc injuring us. Our children alone have a legal right to the belongings of their parents. We, the guardians of our children, advocate their legal rights by asking the Federal Parliament to see to it that their fathers get paid for the value of their work created through hard work and hardships on our part. That refers both to the internees whom it is proposed to deport and those whom evidently the Government intend to deThe report port, although they were not interned. The petition goes on to sayThe GovernOn the 12th inst. were Peace medals given to our children in the schools, with the inscription, "" Victory, the triumph of liberty and justice. The Peace of 191!)."" We don't care to believe that any Government stands for such a justice and liberty as to take from these children their birthland as well as the values their parents have created for them. The following are the signatures: Emma Prost and four children; Mathilda Werner and two children; Emma Abraham and four children; Anna Ktickert and two children; Frieda Bummcny and four children; Hedwig Schmidt and two children; Amanda Meiberg and son. Let me say at once, on behalf of the party I represent in this matter, that they do not desire that any German or Austrian enemy subject who is proved to means 1 ' ' have been disloyal to the Allies during the war shall be allowed to remain in Australia, hut they do take the stand that even the most disloyal of those people is entitled to an open and public trial. The internees numbered 7,000, or 8,000, altono gether, of whom I believe some 2,000, or gestion. 3,000, have been already deported at their own wish. Of these internees some were interned because they were advising people not to go to the Front. Some were charged with organizing an immediate armed rising of Germans, Austrians, others to attack Australians in Australia Committee has evidence which as soon as an opportune moment sented itself, if the Germans got the hand. There can be no doubt about that, but there were also a number of unthe naturalized Germans and Austrians, and also naturalized Germans and Austrians, who, owing to public opinion at the time, were deprived of their employment and their businesses, and asked the Defence Department to intern them because they and their wives and children were starving. They were interned, and their wives and children were humanely granted by the Government a sustenance allowance. In the internment camps, therefore, were all kinds of people. The Government have appointed a Board consisting of six magistrates to hear the cases.",25
32,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"That is not a Board. Those are six separate tribunals lent by the States, three in New South Wales, and the three others scattered through the other States. The Board is the other body that sits afterwards.",26
33,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"At any rate, there are those six magistrates, and there is an Aliens' Board of Reference- a Court of Appeal. Judge Williams, Brigadierforeign General Williams, and Mr Teece constithe tute that Appeal Court. I understand, and I believe my information can be fied, that these Committees get before [436]- 2 them the internee who desires to remain in Australia, and ask him certain questions. They do not tell him anything ahout the charge against him, and the questions they put are simple, such as "" What is your name ?"" "" What is your birthplace?"" "" What age are you?"" "" Why do you want to remain in Australia?""",26
34,Mr WEST,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"And "" Have you any",26
35,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,My honourable friend tells me that that question is also asked.,26
36,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I answered that allegation after inquiry, and stated that there was shadow of justification for the sug",26
37,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) will be able to deal with that matter himself. The internees then retire, and the Committee decides, in their absence and secretly, and what they will do. In many cases the has prebeen collected hy the Defence Deupper partment, and which, it is alleged, proves that these men are disloyal, but internee is not told what the charge against him is, nor is he told the name of his accuser. This could have heen justified in time of war. I venture to say that no Government can conduct a war efficiently unless it has a secret service system. The Government of every country has its secret agents, and the Government can convince any reasonable person that in the midst of war there is no time to have trials, or to hold a public and open inquiry, because the moment you j?ive the name of your secret agent his usefulness is gone. We must bear in mind that, although these people were accused of being disloyal, they were not put in gaol. They were merely put inan internment camp and supported there at Government expense for the safety of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to defend that action on any platform as unavoidable during the war; but now that the war is over, now that the Germanic Allies have been utterly defeated, Germany's former rulers are refugees in countries, the Germany Navy or greater part of it at the bottom of the sea, and the great German A r m y disveribanded, the Government ought to be prepared to give every man - whom it is proposed to deport a fair and open trial. I shall be interested to hear from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) what justification there is for refusing such a trial.",26
38,Mr KELLY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"In such an open trial, what case would you state for the Judge or jury to decide?",27
39,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"That the accused is proved to have acted in a disloyal manner to the British Allies during the war. The Government have either changed their policy with regard to the people who were not interned, or, as they claim, they never had such a policy, and the policy adopted hy the Commandants was adopted on their own initiative and under A. misapprehension. It may be said that no action is being taken regarding persons who were not interned, but I have the following case, given to me by Senator Needham:August Zoller - Zollc r and his wife wore born in Germany, and have been resident in Australia for many years. Was not interned during the period of the war, although not a naturalized subject. Conducted his business as butcher most of the time. Has been carrying on that business, and is still a resident in Northcote. Was on parole during the whole period of the war. Local police report favourable. Gave him a good character. Now listed for deportation. Has two children Australian born.",27
40,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"How does the honourable senator who makes that statement know that the man is ""listed for deportation?""",27
41,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"That is the case as given to me. I had also the following letter handed to me by Senator Grant:Sir, I most respectfully wish to bring before you the following matter, re my position as a deportee fro m F i j i , or a subject of German birth, namely:1. I left Germany in the year 1873 for England. I was engaged by Messrs. Beyer and Peacott as a loco - engineer, and came to Sydney with twenty-four locomotives for the New South Wales Government railways, and then was employed by the Tramway Department as a motor-driver for fourteen years, after which I left for F i j i , and kept a hotel at Levuka up to the time of my deportation to Bourke, when the late war started. I now apply to you for a permit to remain here for the following reasons:That I am sixty-eight years of age, and the climate, after residing here and in F i j i for over forty-one years, is not suitable for my age and health. That my children are all living here, and settled down, and I have no interest at all in Germany. Having been naturalized here in New South Wales in the month of January, 27th, 1883, I possess the certificate; also having been naturalized in F i j i , 5th January, 1907, the certificate is in my possession; and I have complied wit h the conditions laid down by the Government of F i j i . All my relations in Germany are dead. Hoping you will grant me my request to remain near my family for the rest of my few years of life, as I have no interest in Germany. I remain, Your most obedient servant, FRANZ E. VOLK. Dorothy Cottage, Long View-road, off Great North-road, Five Docks, Sydney, N.S.W.",27
42,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,What happened to that man?,27
43,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I understand that it is proposed to deport him.,27
44,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,But do you know?,27
45,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I know in a general way, and challenge the Acting Prime Minister to deny it, that these internees are brought before these Committees and not informed what the charge against them is, or of the name of their accuser.",27
46,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The honourable member is shifting his ground. Does he know anything about that case?,27
47,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I am informed that it is proposed to deport that man. The Acting Prime Minister is intervening in the hope of gaining some advantage by throwing me off the track, but that will not do. This is only an individual case.",27
48,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I wanted to know what knowledge the honourable member had, because it is not good enough to suggest a thing and then claim it as proved.",27
49,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The honourable gentleman can obtain any quantity of information. He knows there are two main facts - that neither the magistrates nor the Appeal Board give the accused the name of his accuser, nor do they tell the person concerned why he is to be deported. That applies to hundreds, and, probably, thousands of cases. The instances I have just quoted were given to me as those of men about to he deported. I have roughed out some suggestions for the Government. As regards the women, who have been informed that it is , proposed to deport their husbands, the Government - say 'they do not propose to deport anybody who has not been in terned. The least the Government can do now is at once to send. woTd to those women to the effect that the Government never had any intention to deport their husbands, or, at any <rate, that it is not their intention to deport them now. I suggest, therefore:1. To every wom'an whose husband has not been interned, and to whom a circular has been sent informing her that it is possible her husband will he deported, a telegram shall be forwarded at once, informing her that the Government have no intention to deport her husband. Is not that a most reasonable suggestion? All the Government have to do is to issue instructions to the Commandants to this effect: "" If you have sent any circulars of the kind referred to, send a wire to every woman, saying that the Government have no intention to deport her husband."" 2, That every internee whom it is proposed to deport against his will shall be furnished with the name of his accuser, and the terms of the accusation, and the reasons why it is proposed to deport him . We take our stand on that. We say that now peace has arrived every man is entitled to an open and public t r i a l . Our great boast is that our j u r y system is the safeguard of the liberty and property of the individual, and that that right was won for us 700 years ago.",27
50,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Some do not boast about it now.,28
51,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Seve n hundred years ago it was secured for us, and it is the pride of our race today. .",28
52,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,To the honourable member trial by jury is still the palladium 'of British liberty.,28
53,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Why not?,28
54,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Notwithstandin g all the miscarriages of the system in Australia ?,28
55,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,There have been miscarriages of justice.,28
56,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"-When two men fought in the streets of Melbourne with revolvers, the plainest possible evidence to obtain, what was the result of the case?",28
57,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I am sorry, but this argument is taking up my time. Let me proceed with the suggestions that I have : to offer3. That if the Government cannot see its way clear to disclose the name of the person making a charge against an internee, the accused shall be informed of the terms of the charge, and of the reasons why dt is proposed to deport him. 4. That every internee whom it is proposed to deport against his will shall have a public t r i a l ; that he shall be allowed to be represented at that tria l by a legal or other advocate. 5. That every internee shall be allowed to call witnesses to prove that he had not been disloyal to the British Allies during the war, and that during his residence in Australia he has been an honest, law abiding, and industrious resident. He is not allowedto do that now. 6. That in cases where an accused person is unable, on the ground of expense or other cause, to bring witnesses from distant parts of Australia to Holdsworthy, New South Wales, he shall be allowed to have his witnesses examined on oath by a justice of. the peace or other qualified person in the town or place at which said witnesses reside. As I have pointed out, some of these persons reside at Mount Larcom, 1,000 miles from Holdsworthy Canrp. How can they bring witnesses down there? It is impossible for them to do so. 7. That all internees whom it is decided to deport shall be permitted to remain in Australia under surveillance during such reasonable time as the Court may decide, in order that they may dispose of their businesses, farms, or other property. We must not forget that our State Governments sent immigration agents abroad to invite these people to come to Australia. Many of them came here to avoid conscription in Germany. At the conclusion of the Franco-German war many persons left Germany and France because they desired to reside in countries where there would be no possibility of war. Some of them came to Australia. We invited them to come for various reasons. Conservative-Torv party opposite",28
58,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,What ! ',29
59,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"You are the Tory party. You have individuals among you who are opposed to ""Democracy.",29
60,Mr KELLY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I thought that this was a non-party question.,29
61,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"If there is any fear that party political animosities may be stirred up hy my remark I withdraw it , and simply say that these people were brought here by the State Governments. They came to Australia, took up virgin forest land, felled the trees, tivated the soil, married Australian girls in some cases, and reared Australian children. The greatest solicitude should be shown by every one inquiring into their cases to see that no injustice is done; but I think no Government can defend the methods adopted in dealing with them.",29
62,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.50] - Wit h the exception of one slip, for which the honourable member duly atoned, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) has discussed this matter from his point of view in as temperate a way as could be expected from his side of the House, but, at the same time, his accusations aud suggestions cover a very wide area which whether it is possible to deal with properly in the limited time available for honourable members on a motion of this kind. The main object with which the honourable member addressed himself to the Chamber appears to have been to seek, first of all, a declaration of the policy and procedure of the Government in relation to the deportation of enemy aliens, and, if that was not satisfactory, to give a list of suggestions for the modification of the policy now being pursued. I want to set forth what the Government have done in regard to this and other kindred matters during the last twelve months. When it became p l a in - I speak from a recollection that has checked by reference to the files-that the war was either d r if t in g to a close or had closed, the Government realized that a number of questions relating to enemy The aliens resident in Australia demanded very careful consideration. Ministers were living a pretty busy life in the broken sessional and administrative work we were doing, and, therefore, we selected a body of the most experienced and competent departmental heads, and associated with them a member of the Senate, and we authorized them to inquire into all phases of the enemy question that would need treatment at the close of the war. That body was presided over by Senator Fairbairn, and deliberated for many months. It brought to the Government, as it was requested to do, a cul- very complete report. It looked into the question in the light of all the inquiries made in Great Britain and the other Dominions, and it had the advantage of perusing the discussions that took place at the Imperial Conference and all printed documents the British Government had circulated for the use of the Dominion Governments. I venture to think that hereafter the report of this body.will be regarded as a very complete and reasonable document. It was, as a preliminary step, referred to a sub-Committee of the Cabinet, who, in their turn , for many weeks sifted all the matters covered by the recommendations. Finally, Cabinet considered the sub-Committee's report, and authorized both the report of the Committee and the recommendations of the Cabinet sub-Committee I doubt to be printed and laid on the table of Parliament. That was the position when, unfortunately, I was dislocated from work, and I imagined, as I informed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), that the documents had actually been laid on the table; but on making inquiries from the Acting Attorney-General (Mr . Groom) I found that this was not the case. There were so many subjects covered in the report beyond the question of the treatment of internees or aliens, that it was deemed inadvisable to lay the documents on the table until the Government saw the exact nature of tha Peace Treaty determinations relating; to enemy property and other subjects covered. not been",29
63,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Does not that suggest that the Government should have from deporting people until the Peace Treaty determinations were ascertained 1,30
64,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"We delayed submitting the documents to Parliament not because we did not know - what the Peace Treaty covered in regard to the question of deportation-w e knew what it covered in that regard-bu t because we did not know the exact nature of the economic phases of the Peace Treaty which do or may cover or colour questions of enemy property and debits and credits within Australia. In order to be quite safe and quite fair we did not deem it advisable to proclaim the findings of Cabinet until we could see whether, in view of the conditions of the Peace Treaty, they were possible of operation.",30
65,Mr MATHEWS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Then why go on deporting while you did not know ?,30
66,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I am addressing the i telligent members of the House, and beg to say to the honourable member that if he will refrain",30
67,Mr MATHEWS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I have as much ligence as you.,30
68,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Then I wish the honourable member would show it occasionally.,30
69,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC, I must ask honourable members to cease interjecting.,30
70,Mr BLAKELEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"On a point of order, object to the language used by the Acting Prime Minister.",30
71,Mr MATHEWS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,It was a damned in sult.,30
72,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Order ! honourable member for Melbourne Ports to cease interjecting.,30
73,Mr BLAKELEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I think that the ing Prime Minister should restrain his language, and be more gentlemanly and courteous to honourable members on this side of the House.",30
74,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"On a motion for. adjournment an lionorable member's time is very limited. If honourable members will refrain from interjecting there will be no excuse for retorts which may velop into personalities. However, if Acting Prime Minister addressed himself to an honourable member in language which that honourable member considers offening-house sive, I am sure he will be only too willing and credits existing prior lo withdraw it .",30
75,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I have frequently made refrained the remark that I was addressing the in telligent members of the House, and have not heen called upon to withdraw it . Before I had the opportunity to show the application of my remark, the lionorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) took umbrage at it and covered the House with confusion and noise. If ho asks for a withdrawal of my remark I shall withdraw it , but not otherwise. I was saying that I was addressing the intelligent members of the House, and it is extremely difficult in the short time available to cover all that a Minister wants to cover in speaking upon a matter of this kind. If honourable members will allow the Government to place before them the information they seek to give they will see that the points exciting the in terest of honourable members opposite are covered. In the meantime I am drawn - ing attention to the procedure adopted I by the Government in dealing with all the interwoven and interlaced, enemy problems, amongst which is the question inteljÂ£ internment and deportation. The honourable member's questions deal with the ' ' clean-slate "" policy. At this stage I do not propose to elaborate that policy extensively, but simply say that, at the conclusion of a great struggle of this kind, it is apparent to all the belligerent I nations, victorious or otherwise, that there must be a reckoning between the Allies and their enemies in regard to the debits and credits existing - prior to the war, or evolved during the war, between the I ask the nations of the central empires and their allies, and the great nations and their allies opposed to them. All these have Actto be written down against one another, aud one of the greatest problems which statecraft and accountancy have to face is that of ascertaining the facts of debits and credits, and making due allowance for them. If enemy aliens, residing in Australia, owe us money, if Germans, residing in Germany, owe us money, or if Australians, residing in Germany, owe that decountry or Australia inoney, it may the all have to come into the sum. It is perfectly plain that the different nations will have to establish a great countto properly mark the debits to the war, and developed during the war, for satisfactory settlement in accordance with the treaty terms at the conclusion of the war. That "" clean-slate"" policy is affected by the report of the Committee, presided over by Senator Eairbairn, and the findings of the Cabinet sub-Committee, so also are questions of enemy aliens residing in Australia, who own property here, and owe no debts outside Australia, and enemy aliens residing in Australia who own enemy shares. These are the problems that demand attention, possibly followed by important legislation.",30
76,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I think the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) sold all the enemy shares.,31
77,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The honourable member's "" thin k "" is wrong.",31
78,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"It is not. His "" think "" is the Prime Minister's statement.",31
79,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"No ; it is his "" think "" as to the Prime Minister's statement. cannot imagine the honourable member for Bourke being a liar.",31
80,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I would not be a politician if I were not a liar.,31
81,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The honourable member is not a politician. He is so nearly dead that we may with safety call him a statesman. The inference from his statement, at which I take no umbrage, is that, being a politician, I am a liar. I pass it , because I have known the honourable member too long",31
82,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I did not understand the honourable member for Bourke to accuse the Acting Prime Minister of being a politician.,31
83,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Sir , you do not know the honourable member for Bourke as well as I do. There was a double-barrelled in sinuation in his remark. There are questions also of naturalization now and hereafter, and of denaturalization at the conclusion of the war. There are questions as to what is to happen to Germans who tap at Australia's doors and ask for admission to the country later, questions of admission relating to passports, immigration, - and naturalization. These are all embodied, and because some of them may be covered by the Peace Treaty provisions wo cannot give the information to the House. Although he has a full knowledge that these problems must be dealt with by Parliament, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has elected to confine his attention to one question, namely, the deportation of persons who belong to Germany, Austria, or other enemy countries.",31
84,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"It is a question of deportation, irrespective of whether or not they are enemy aliens. The deportations are not confined to enemy aliens.",31
85,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The honourable member may believe that that is so, but the mover of the motion dealt only with enemy aliens. I could deal with the deportation of others, but I am replying to the honourable member for Capricornia.",31
86,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Canno t the Acting Prime Minister deal with the other cases?,31
87,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Perhaps . If any of the honoraible member's friends have been sent away, he is quiteat liberty to utter his I elegy.",31
88,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Some of my enemies have not gone. That is what I complain about.,31
89,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"That grievance is common to all of us. Let me explain the procedure which the Government have adopted in relation to the deportation of enemy aliens. Pirst of all, I should state that the Government invented a special machine to deal with all internments at the close of the war.",31
90,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,""" Machine"" is a good name for it .",31
91,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"It is a better machine than honourable members opposite invented for the internment of these people. Of the approximately 7,000 persons who have been interned, the majority were interned long before the present Government assumed office. We became merely the custodians of them by virtue of our Ministerial responsibilities.",31
92,Mr TUDOR,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,They were interned by the man who is still Minister for Defence. (Senator Pearce).,31
93,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I am not putting a party colour upon this question, but I say that the internment machine invented by a Labour Government was worse than the machine which the present Government has devised, because the former Administration left the whole matter entirely in the hands of the Defence officers. considered that there was a grave danger in that arrangement, that it was not proper to allow the officers of the Defence Department, who had placed these people in internment, to decide whether their applications for release should be granted. We thought that a specific and well-chosen tribunal, and one more representative of civilian thought in this counrepatriated try, might well deal with all appeals, and we created a Committe of three, comprising a gentleman who was at that time a prominent barrister in Melbourne, and is now Judge Williams, of the Victorian County Court; Brigadier-General Will liams, a civilian soldier, who filled the position of Commandant of Victoria with such conspicuous success for a long time during the war, and who has lived a life that has kept him in touch with the people ever since he was a boy; and a representative of the neighbouring capital of Sydney, Mr Teece. We arranged that all applications for release from internment should be made to the Minister through that hody. That was a reform which ought to have been, and, I believe, was, gratefully accepted by the internees, and every release granted since then has been on the recommendation of that t r i bunal. We were called upon to deal with the question of deportation, in some cases suddenly. Under the conditions of the Armistice and the arrangements which followed, the exchange of prisoners of war and of civilian prisoners interned had been arranged amongst some of the nations, notably Britain and Germany, and various ships were sent fro m Britain to take away those men whom the British Government had contracted to return to Germany.",31
94,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC, The honourable member's time has expired. Extension of time granted.,32
95,Mr WEST,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The honourable member has not touched the question yet. This is a lot of window-dressing.,32
96,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I cannot obey the scriptural injunction to "" answer a fool according to his f o l l y . """,32
97,Mr FENTON,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"O r turn the other cheek. - Mr Watt - I have done that too often, and have found that it is a process which makes one lament. We Mr GREGORY - Will the Acting Prime Minister say what was done in regard to the internees in F i j i ? I understand that some Australian girls were involved.",32
98,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I cannot say offhand, but' I shall ascertain for the 'honourable member. We fulfille d our part of the Armistice bargain. The people who desired to be to enemy countries, the voluntary deportees, were put on the ships quickly, but in case there should be enemy internees who were being deported against their will , such objection not being known to ihe Government, we asked the State Governments to nominate six magistrates to whom all cases of enemy aliens who were being sent away against their will could be referred. Speaking from memory, three - magistrates were nominated in New South Wales, where the principal internment camp is, and three others in other States. We decided that these magistrates should take into consideration all relevant facts relating to men who were being deported and who might wish to remain in l i e country. By an instruction prepared by the Commonwealth Crown Law Department, the magistrates were directed to have regard to the following conditions:The Couunonwealth Government has decided that in dealing with appeals, the following considerations should guide the magistrate:(i) Whether the appellant has such ties with the Commonwealth that he is, or is likely soon to become, practically Australian; for instance, persons within the following classes might usually, in the absence of strong grounds to the contrary, be exempted from repatriation:(a) Those whose upbringing has been Australian, e.g., persons of ten years or more residence who came to the Commonwealth when under sixteen, persons of twenty years or more residence who came to the Commonwealth when uuder twenty. (6) Persons over sixty years of age who have been in British Territory not less than twenty-five years. (c) Families of ten years or more residence where the children, or some of them, are not less than ten and not more than eighteen yeara of age, and have been or are going to Australian scliools, and are either British born or English speaking. (d) British-born women who have married Germans, whether exempted or not, and other women married to husbands exempted under (a) or (6). (ii) Whether the appellant's sympathies have been shown to be on the side of the Allies. (iii) Whether owing to age, infirmity, or other cause the appellant cannot be expelled without inhumanity. There is a large number of enemy aliens who have been naturalized and are drawing old-age pensions.",32
99,Mr BRENNAN,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"And the Government are cutting off the pensions, with gross inhumanity. These pompous expressions on paper do not carry much weight.",33
100,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Order ! The honourable member is quite out of order.,33
101,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) often forgets where he is. At the proper time. I shall deal with the question he has raised, but I am following one consecutive line of thought with the obiect of showing that the Government have endeavoured, with the information they possessed, to tackle this matter properly. The instructions continued(iv) Whether appellant possesses such special qualifications or skill as will enable him to earn a livelihood without special injury to the Commonwealth. Eor instance, there are men who claim to be engineers and chemists, and, providing they would not injure the Commonwealth by the prosecution of their business after the war, they were to be allowed to remain. I submit that those are humane and sane instructions which were issued to the magistrates to guide them in their considerations; but if , notwithstanding them, a magistrate decided to recommend that the appellant should he deported, the case came before the mental officers who deal with these matters. If it appeared to them that certain conditions had been overlooked, or had not been given due weight, the case was then submitted to the Committee comprising Judge Brigadier-General Williams, and Mr . Teece, who had power to act as a Court of Appeal and finalize the recommendations to the Government.",33
102,Mr HIGGS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Will the Acting Prime Minister say who were the departmental officers who dealt with these cases?,33
103,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I can ascertain their names for the honourable member.,33
104,Mr TUDOR,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Hav e any persons been deported who have been deprived by the M i l it a r y authorities of the opportunity of having their case* heard by a magistrate?,33
105,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Not since, at the close of the Armistice, we created the procedure to which I have referred.",33
106,Mr TUDOR,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Non e were deported before that date.,33
107,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The instructions are perfectly plain. The orders of the Government in relation to enemy aliens are that only those who have been in internment are subject to deportation.,33
108,Mr TUDOR,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"That is not so. Mr Watt . ^ I do not say that other enemy aliens have not been deported, but I assure the House that the Government have issued that determination, and that it represents their policy. If any honourable memlbers will in for m me of enemy aliens who have been deported, although they had not been interned, I shall immediately investigate the cases.",33
109,Mr TUDOR,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"There is the case of one man who was deported twice. I refer to Freeman, who was never interned.",33
110,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Freema n was not deported under the arrangements to which I am referring. There are others who have been dealt with under the Unlawfu l Associations Act , but they were not proceeded against for' being enemy aliens; also other undesirable aliens were deported. For merely being an enemy alien, no man who has not been interned has been deported, certainly not at the will of the Government. depart- I repeat, that the Government have been acting as the custodians of internees whom it was our duty to guard, although we had not the in it i a l responsibility for their internment. I helieve that an analysis would disclose that the bulk of Williams, the 6,000 or 7,000 persons interned were arrested and segregated during the first few months of the war. They have been kept in internment, apparently for reasons that appeared good and sufficient to the various Administrations that have controlled the affairs of Australia during the war period. Tho honourable member for Capricornia has asked for an open public trial of these persons. That is his suggestion in relation to those who desire to appeal against deportations.",33
111,Mr WEST,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,We should treat them just as Britishers would like to be treated. ',34
112,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I am dealing now with the question as to whether, there should not be, as the honourable member for Capricornia has suggested, an open public trial. The honourable member said, amongst other things, that it would have been imprudent for any nation or Government, during the war period, to expose the operations of its secret service. I quite appreciate the very vivid way in which he made that point, and may say that the bulk of honourable members all through have taken the same view. They have realized that it is an absolutely indispensable pre-requisite to weapon a Government with the right to examine its community, to find out any hostile internal movement, and the Government which did not do that would be leading itself blindly up an alley to slaughter. Why were these persons, in the bulk of cases, subjected to internment without public trial ? Let us look at the facts broadly, and, for the present, without sentiment. Sentiment is a powerful operating feature in all the public affairs of this country, but safety is more important than sentiment, and the safety of the nation must be the supreme law just as it was in ancient Rome. When the Intelligence Department and the Police Foroe brought them information about hostile movements of Germans or pro-Germans why did not the Government grant such persons a public trial ? The reason was, plainly, that it was possible to get a great deal of information if the people in German communities throughout Australia were not obliged to face the German communities in which they lived. I know districts in Australia- I am particularly familiar with one-wher e it would be absolutely unsafe for any Britisher or Australian to stand up and say in a public Court, ' ' That man has uttered sentiments that are disloyal to Australia."" If it is true that that kind of fact recommended itself to the interning Administration as all-sufficient it is. equally true now with regard to releases. If we were called upon to grant a trial in open Court to the appeal cases-ther e are nearly a thousand appeals-it would take months, or years, to hear them, and the intimidation that would be exercised on the original or subsequent informers would be so unendurable that the authorities would not be able to obtain their evidence. What has been done generally by all Administrations that have had to deal with this matter of interning Germans, is this",34
113,Mr BKENNAN,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Alway s do the right thing.,34
114,Mr KELLY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Then the honourable member should do the right thing by remaining quiet.,34
115,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,What purpose is served by asking the honourable member to keep quiet? As I said of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) if he had to keep quiet he would possibly burst.,34
116,Mr MATHEWS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"There is such a thing as tricky knowledge which, by some people, is spoken of as brains. It is cunning.",34
117,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I could apply a far more violent term, but I do not wish to cross swords with the honourable member. My desire now is to give facts. I will deal with the honourable member's interjection, if necessary, at a more appropriate time. If the. position in regard to an open trial was true when these internments were made it is equally true today. It would be impossible to get people from the districts from which the bulk of these internees have come to stand up in open Court and give their evidence. They would have to leave this community because, for their country's good, they had told the Government of the day what they knew. Their lives here would be insufferable. Judging by the investigations I have been able to make what happened was this: The Intelligence Department of the nation brought information to the authorities about certain Germans",34
118,Mr BRENNAN,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The pimps and spies of the authorities.,34
119,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC," Order ! These constant interjectionary punctuations are entirely out of order, besides being of a distinctly offensive nature; and they must cease.",34
120,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"On e might describe them aspunctures! This information, so far as my information goes, was not acted upon, and certainly it has not been acted upon for the last two and a-half years, during which I have had a personal knowledge, of the procedure> unless i confirmed by a reference to the State authorities, known as the police. If information came originally from the police it was not acted upon unless firmed by the Intelligence Departments of which they came. the. Navy or the Army. It was upon that, kind of inter-related information that Departments, and the Governments of the day were satisfied. That is the only formation the Departments have, and is the kind of information which the magistrates have nut in front of them show the cause of any internment. The internee, on his part, can ask why it proposed todeport him, and he has every the end'. opportunity, by documentary or personal representations, to. show why he-should, he deported. My honourable friend (Mr Higgs) that now that the war is over and the GermanNavy lies on the sands* of Scapa, fbr it? we might safely doa number of things that we-could not doduring the war. That is true of somethings, but not others. It would' be extremely injudicious now that the war is over to subject terrorism either the Intelligence officers, the Police Force, or patriotic citizens have come to the aid of the several vernments, that have been in office during this period'. I say plainly that the-Governformation,, ment is possessed of information which shows clearly that, notwithstanding the overwhelming and crushing defeat of can obtain a trial. Germany on land and sea, there are in certain German communities in Australia today Germans and Germanfor Australians who have been allowed motives. to roam at pleasure, and who are as truculentas they were in the a early stages of the war. This community must protect itself. Even if there is a slight injustice in some part of the proobtained cedure adopted, the safety of. this comlease. munity is more important than the display of sentiment towards a particular class of people. I do not hesitate for moment to say that the procedure adopted, while not customary in time of peaceor in connection with civil matters, is the inevitable concomitant of the war, and that it can beoperated with moderation and tolerance, as it is being operated today. The members of our party, and I believe, the members of the Opposition, have no t was vendetta to ply against Germans generally. But we will net allow Australia to the be subjected to dangers and hostile influences by permitting to remain here men conwho. ought to go back to the country from We are determined, whether honourable gentlemen here or elsethe where like it or not, to follow what we believe to be a considered line of policy inand procedure, so that we can safely, say it to the people whose servants we are that we have done this thing because we conto sidered it to he our duty. We have followed this course without undue cruelty, is but with resolution and determination to",35

122,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I did not say. that. I said that he could learn the reason why of he. was being deported.

No political pressure is recognised or exercised in relation to those important matters. If we found that an officer had yielded to such pressure he would receive the swiftest treatment. We have been doing a very unpleasant job, because it was cast upon us, and doing it in a better way than did any former Administration the preceding part of it. I think I am at liberty to say that only this very week I entertained a numher of honourable members opposite in a confidential chat about the enemy internee problem.",35

133,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,No one would accuse the honourable member of any sinister intention when he smiles as he is now doing. It is only when he adopts his ancient funereal role that we become doubtful.,36

As I said at the outset, it is impossible to deal with the whole matter on an occasion like this; hut since a great deal is covered by the suggestions and recommendations of the honourable member for Capricornia, I beg leave to defer to his views, and not to those of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). The honourable member for Capricornia and others of his party are apparently anxious to obtain the views of the Government, and I am giving them.",36
139,Mr TUDOR,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"The question is an exceedingly wide and important one, and both sides are anxious to ascertain all the facts. Might we not have a suspension of the Standing Orders to allow further time for this discussion?",36
140,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I am afraid not today; hut it may be possible at a later stage. I desire, on the adjournment, if I may be permitted to do so, to speak of the procedure for the next fortnight. The honourable member for Capricornia has given us a series of suggestions other than his proposal that there should he an open trial. Some of these suggestions have, for me, novel features, and I shall see that they are recommended for the consideration of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) and the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell), in order that we may determine how far they are capable of adaptation to what we consider tb he safe principles. As to the confiscation of the property of those people who are sent away, there is no desire or intention on the part of the Government that there should be anything of the kind. Being German subjects, if they are deported, and, in that sense, repatriated, they will probably come within the Treaty provisions. This nation cannot expropriate these people without regard to the compensation features of the Treaty.",36
141,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"No matter what other injustice is done, property is to be safe^ guarded.",36
142,Mr WATT,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"It is a question, not of safeguarding property, which has neither feelings nor soul, but of safeguarding the interests of certain people in which is a human interest, and not an interest of shares or bricks and Honourable members are aware that enemy shares were placed in the hands of a receiver, not that the holder should not get the money again, but that they should be held in trust until after the war. Peace Treaty provides for such ments, and to its terms we shall become subject if we adopt it in this Certain honourable members made representations wider than those advanced by the honourable member for Capricornia. It was said by them that we ought to release a great many more internees we were releasing. I want to deal with only one phase of that contention, not to traverse the whole of the ground. Certain Australian and British-born are in the internment camps with enemy subjects, but under the promise made by the then Prime Minister (Mr. as to the administration of the War Precautions Act, every Government taken care that before any of this class was interned his case should come before the Cabinet. Those who have Executive Councillors during the war period know that that has been so. We are anxious to release the born, because we do not propose to deport them under the same conditions as enemy aliens, but to keep them here. awaiting the time when Britain will announce to us that the Peace Treaty has become binding on the requisite of principal Powers, and is an actual fact in. the life of the United Kingdom the Dominions, when we will release all these men. In regard to the others, the more honourable members are familiar with the motives and procedure adopted by the Government in relation to the release or deportation of men who have been or are interned, the more they ought to approve of the improvements made by the recent alterations. If honourable members show me that the principles I have enunciated have not been followed, I shall welcome the information. I shall follow up, as far as I am capable, any cases that are supposed to be exceptions to the determination of the Cabinet, and involve personal injustice. Jfr. Watt. property Mr ANSTEY (Bourke) [12.32] - I was not aware this question was to be dismortar. cussed until I entered the House this morning, and if I rise now it is not to make any affirmation against the Government. I wish it clearly to be understood that I have not a word to say in defence The of the Germans interned. The Acting settlePrime Minister (Mr Watt ) is quite right when he states that this is not a party quesParliament. tion. My objection is not to the internment of Germans, but to the fact that many men in the country, of German origin and birth, have been able to escape internment because of their wealth and than social standing. On the other hand, there are many men and women of Australian and birth, with fathers and mothers also of Australian birth, who have been dismissed men from the Public Service because of their German origin. Is the Minister in charge of the House (Mr Groom) aware of that? Fisher) Mr GROOM - I regret I was not listening to what the honourable member was has saying. My attention was, for the moment, diverted.",36
143,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Then I might as well been sit down.,37
144,Mr BRENNAN,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Batman) [12.33] The address of the Acting Prime Minister Australian- (Mr Watt ) lacked nothing in clarity and sympathy, and if it were a literally accurate statement of the position as it is in We are Australia today in regard to aliens and others, no - possible exception could be taken to the position of the Government. number In view of the very brief time at my disposal, I challenge the honourable gentleman at once upon the two main stateand ments he put before the House. He alleged that nobody was to be deported from this country who had not been in terned, and also that there would be no inhumanity-notabl y in connection with old-age pensions-to any person by reason of his racial lineage. I have to tell the Government and the country that I can quote one instance which has just recently can come under my notice, which appears to he typical of many. It is that of a Bendigo man who has never been interned and against whom no charge has been made, who is known to have been a useful resident of Australia, if not technically a citizen. This man has been notifiedthat he must present himself at once in Melbourne for deportation. The Acting Prime Minister, apparently because he does not know, and the Defence Department does not think it necessary to inform him, complacently takes his place in this House and tells us that uo injustice will be done with the Government sanction. My complaint is that the Government do not appear to know or care to attend to what their Defence officers are doing. While the Government declares that it takes the responsibility, it suffers this abuse to go on without protest. What is the use of the Acting Prime Minister telling us that man will he deported unless he has been interned or has given some evidence of disloyalty? Every honourable member knows, if he is honest with himself, that there is injustice in spite of the solemn protests of the Acting Prime Minister. I will take it that the honourable gentleman is candid in what he has said, aud that he does not know of these occurences. But is it not worth his while to investigate? Is it becoming in him, as Acting Prime Minister, on a motion of this kind, to disclose his ignorance on a vital matter affecting the liberty of people whom we are pledged to guard so long as they are residents within our shores? It is in my own knowledge that an old man, getting into the seventies, with probably a residence here of t h i r t forty years, and nothing against his character as an honest, hard-working person, is to be deprived of his old-age pension. And this, although he is naturalized, as he must be to get that pension. When I asked for an explanation as to why this old. man is robbed of his only means of sustenance, I was told, officially, by a departmental officer, that a person in such case must prove his loyalty. How is he toprove his loyalty, and to whom must he prove it . He has never been called upon to prove his loyalty, but he has been harassed and chased away from Queenscliff, where he has lived for a number of years, and is left to starve in hia old age. We are making the vital mistake of endeavouring to live up to the standard which we have imputed to the enemy we have been fighting. We have declared that the enemy does this kind of thing, and we have held it up to publio reprobation, as something for which the enemy ought to be punished; but we i m itate an example which we, in other times, declare to deserve our strongest condemnation. As to the Secret Service, the honourable gentleman who leads this House (Mr . W at t ) has spoken of the national safety - tol d us that the safety of the nation is the highest law. I do not grant that, sir. I challenge the complacent view of those who are content to say that, in the interests of safety, we must do this or that. In the interests of safety you may no not invade a sacred principle, or do in justice to a single individual in the country. We have to buckle on our armour, throw out our chest, and, like men, run the risk of doing the right thing. It is idle to open our proceedings with solemn prayer to the Deity, and then disregard the equally solemn injunction that religion imposes on every man to do justice to his fellow-citizens and fellowmen. We should not he afraid to do the righ t thing. Would, however, the safety of the country he jeopardized by doing the right and honest thing by the men whom we are now wronging? Not a b it of it . Every one of those men to whom we do an injustice, and to whom we deny the application of the fundamental principles of British justice, will, through his y or friends and relatives, become, so far as the Government can make him , an active propagandist of disloyalty. Instead of safeguarding the interests of Australia by doing obvious injustice to any residents in the country, we are really doing our best to spread disloyalty and disaffection. The-Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) spoke of the means taken to inquire into the loyalty or otherwise of men who have been interned, and he sought to justify the Secret Service on the ground that it is an immemorial practice in war time, and after war time, to avail ourselves of this means of knowledge in order to safeguard the'nation. The honourable gentleman mentioned the German communities; and I ask, What are the means adopted in their case? The means are, through the Defence Department, to make use of every tittle-tattle, gossip or malevolent whisper, probably from an interested party, in order to make out a case against a man who is to be put behind prison bars avithout himself getting a hearing. The honourable gentleman says that we must adopt this means because, forsooth, if I , or any one else, were to publicly accuse a man of disloyalty, the accuser's life and property would not be safe. Such a statement applies to every court of justice and every tribunal that was ever erected in a free country; but it has been found, as the result of years of experience, and particularly has it been found in Britain, that it is worthwhile to do these things in public-to do the right, even at the risk of its resulting indirectly in injury to somebody else. I make bold to say that there axe men who have been interned on this secret evidence and to whom gross injustice has been done. What happens ? A man may have a grudge against one of those unfortunate persons of so-called enemy birth; it may be a private grudge, caused by personal spite arising out of a business deal or a private estrangement between families and relations, but a case is up in secret, and the man has no chance to answer the charge. Some have had a chance, because they had sufficient influence, political and private, to enable them to go to the Minister in charge and protest their loyalty. These have succeeded in having trials, if not in public at least with the ordinary forms of justice, and, to my knowledge, as a result, some have been liberated. But what about an unfortunate wretch who has no such influence? He gets no trial, never sees the document or his accuser, and has no opportunity of having the merits of his case examined. The Acting Prime Minister other day, said that the Labour party was very likely to get the reputation of being defenders of Germans; and honourable members deprecated the statement. We should hesitate, he said, before we allowed a character of that kind to attach to us. What do honourable members suppose that I can gain in my electorate or in this House by appearing to be the defender of Germans or Germany? I have nothing to gain and all to lose. from the very beginning of this war, from the moment that I thought it was going Mr Brennan. to result in a vendetta and acts of revenge against men who had done no wrong in this country, it is true that much of my public activities have been directed to correcting that injustice. It is not because it will redound to my advantage or disadvantage, or because it will do this party harm or good, that my conduct will be influenced. It will be influenced only by the best traditions of the administration of British justice, which have been brought down to this-countiy and which, instead of abusing, we should hold more sacred today in a free Democracy than even our forefathers did in the years gone by. The honourable member who moved this motion (Mr Higgs) 'has rightly pointed out that the deportees who are principally affected are men who were invited here, not 60 much by the Labour party as by the Liberal and Conservative parties. On the platform those gentlemen were accustomed to hold forth at large about the protection that would be given, under the British flag, in this built country to immigrants so long as they were obedient to the country's laws. Now, forsooth, because of the war, - which took place in another part of the world, men in this country, who left the Central Powers because they hated the military traditions of the country in which they were born, and who were making, or - were likely to make, good citizens here, are to be turned out. This will create amongst their friends and relatives a feeling of hostility and disloyalty which is likely to live many years after the war is over. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) tried to get a moment's attention to the fact that we are driving out of our Public Service young Australian-born the men-no t only young men who were not born in enemy countries, but young men neither of whose parents was born in enemy countries, and to whose ancestors of three generations back you have to go to get what is conceived to be the taint of enemy blood. What will be the effect of treating these young men! in this way ? What will be the efEect of throwing a young Australian out of the Public Service, in which he has won in competitive examination his right to work and live? But, He will go out into the general community hating the Government that treated him in that way, and teaching others to hate the Government also. So far from the Government safeguarding the interests of the nation, the interests of the nation w i ll be, to a great extent, jeopardized by these acts of injustice.",37
145,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Barrier) [12.49] I desire also to raise my voice in protest against this policy of the Government. I regret that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) has confined his reply to the question of the deportation of enemy aliens. In answer to an interjection by me he said that the mover of the motion had dealt only with that question. I am much more concerned with the deportation of men, more particularly members of the working class, who were not enemy aliens. The Acting Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet have throughout refused to give us information about those cases. I have received the following letter:Glenogie Station, New Angledool, N.S.W., On 19th February, 1919, I , a Commonwealth citizen, was served with an order under the Alien Restrictions Regulations. Upon protesting to the Acting Minister for Defence, I was calmly informed through Military head-quarters at Sydney, that my application (demanding an inquiry, because I have done nothing to justify the action of the Military authority) had been dismissed. So there is Russian justice-g o to Siberia and live or perish there, because the Military say so. I have ample proof of my loyalty, but all my protestations were of no avail. Had I been guilty of any wrong I would say nothing, hut to carry the brand of Cain without recourse to justice is going back to slavery. This so-called liberty, fraternity, and equality is civilized man's greatest farce, There is the case of a man who claims to be loyal and to be able to prove his loyalty, but the Minister for Defence refused an inquiry, and the man was ordered out of the country. Another case amongst many was that of Abraham Marks, who was convicted under the U n lawful Associations Act , received a sentence of six months, was kept in goal for about seventeen months, and finally deported. I wrote to the Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom) about that case on the 5th February of this year. It was the 28th A p r i l before I obtained any definite information from the Department about that and other cases. Then I received the following curt intimation: With further reference to your letter of 14tb instant relative to the cases of Messrs. Abraliam Marks and Paul Freeman, I have to inform you that both of these aliens have been deported from the Commonwealth. I know of two Germans who were in terned at Holdsworthy because they were unable to earn a living. When the war broke out there was strong national antipathy manifested towards German aliens, and it was impossible for a number of men belonging to the working class to follow their usual occupations. For them the only alternative to utter starvation was internment. They had to give themselves up in order to obtain sustenance for their wives and families. During the war we had introduced here a modern equivalent of the Lion's Mouth of Venice. Anybody with feelings of hostility or more sinister motives could impute disloyalty 6th June, 1919. to others, and send the accusation in to the Intelligence Branch of the Defence Department. Those aimed at never knew who their accusers were, and had. no opportunity to contradict the allegations made against them. Such a system is absolutely disgraceful, and I cannot understand how honourable members opposite could sit down and allow so monstrous an injustice to be perpetrated. There can be no excuse for it now, no matter what may be said about the necessity for an espionage system in time of war, and no matter how members may defend the devious methods used by every Government when war is declared. There can be Yours faithfully, no reason now for not giving every one of J. 0. SETEFERT. the men or women who feel aggrieved an open opportunity to face their accusers, to see the charges laid against them, and to answer them. That is what is being asked for ; but what are the facts? A p a r t from the deportation of enemy aliens, we know that men of British birth-English , Scotch', and Irish-hav e been deported from here during the whole course of the war without t r i a l. Men are picked up and charged and left in ?aol-as Marks was left , and as others have been left - and then deported. I believe that Paul Freeman has again been deported, this time as a German. stand that, on 'Friday last, he was brought before the so-called tribunal; but what chance had he? The Government put hi m in Holdsworthy, and said, "" Y o u are a German; prove that you are not . "" I honestly believe the only reason w'hv the Government deported him was that he had come into conflict with the mining compauies in Queensland after discovering a valuable copper "" show.""",40
146,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Of what nationality is he? .,41
147,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"My own impression, from working with him at Broken Hill and knowing him for seven or eight years, is that he is an American. He speaks with a pronounced American accent.",41
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The American Government will not let him land there.,41
149,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Sufficien t evidence has been adduced to create a strong suspicion in the minds of a considerable section of the public that the only accusation against him is that he has come into conflict over this mining "" s h o w "" with the ""mining companies in Queensland.",41
150,Mr CORSER,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,That has been denied over and over again.,41
151,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"It has not been disproved, and the honourable member and his party will not give us a tribunal where the charge can be tried.",41
152,Mr GROOM,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,You r statement has not been proved.,41
153,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,The Government have refused us an opportunity to prove it.,41
154,Mr GROOM,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,It is expressly denied by those whose names you have supplied.,41
155,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,I have evidence in my possession that both Corbould and another man made the statement publicly that they were responsible for Freeman's internment.,41
156,Mr GROOM,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Can you supply that evidence to me?,41
157,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"I will the honourable member will give us an in quiry, but not otherwise. If Paul Freeman proved to the authorities that he was an American it would not prevent his deI under- portation. The Government are determined to deport him in any case. If he proved he was not a German, the only difference would be that he would be deported to the country of which he proved that he was a citizen.",41
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,Some of the Americans who come here are far more dangerous than a lot of the Germans.,41
159,Mr CONSIDINE,FINANCING OF STATE PUBLIC,"Whether one nationality is more vicious than another is a different question. The point is whether an injustice is being done, not only to Freeman, but to other citizens. Many people were deported during the war, and many others will be deported now that the war is over. Not a - man is safe while this system of persecution is permitted. Any honourable member who did not happen to be born in this country, and who ""misses the b u s "" at the next election, would he just as liable to be deported as anybody else. The man who does not raise his voice in protest against this damnable system deserves deportation. I am actuated only by the desire to obtain justice for these individuals. There is no justice in the methods employed up to the preseut timej It is quite clear to those who examine the social status of the men who have been deported, keeping in mind the system introduced in other countries, during and since the war, that there is a concerted movement to deport people who are opposed to the prevailing economic system.

Has permission been refused the Queensland State Government to charter ships for the purpose of supplying Northern Queensland with foodstuffs, and is such permission still withheld? 2. Is it correct that two steamers, the Maroro and the Porpoise, recently sailed under private enterprise with cargoes for North Queensland ports which largely consisted of beer? 3. In view of a serious shortage of bread and flour, will some effective control be exercised which will insure that cargo space will be allotted so as to give foodstuffs preference over all other cargo?",43
168,Mr WATT,CONVEYANCE OF FOODSTUFFS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. A statement having been made to the Controller that two small vessels had recently left Brisbane witli cargoes largely consisting of beer to the exclusion of foodstuffs, he immediately issued instructions that no vessel should be allowed to sail until they had advised the Controller of the ports of call and description of cargo, and obtained his permission to make the trip. 3.

Any shortage of foodstuffs in North Queensland is entirely due to the fact that steamers have been held up owing to the seamen refusing to man them. 2. Arrangements were made for the Chillagoe has to lift locomotives and coal from Maryborough to Port Augusta as these were urgently required.

Docs not the Minister consider that this reduction in. rank will cast an. undeserved slur on these officers, as such reduction in rank bo considered by those who do' not know the departmental policy to have been caused by some serious fault of their, own?  answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:-1.

201,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Indi) [2.28] - In considering this Bill we are handicapped by the knowledge that the Government have forestalled the consent of the House by entering into certain negotiations and making appointments in connection with an Institute of Science and Industry. It is but another example of the bad effect the use of the War Precautions Act has had, not only upon Ministers, but also upon Parliament itself. Everything is carried out by Executive act. Parliament considered as nothing. It seems to me we shall need a new generation ""of Minisafter ters, and possibly a new generation of legislators, before we rid ourselves of this virus of the Ministry desiring to do everything on their own-floutin g Parliament, through Parliament, flouting the people. We are also handicapped by the fact that no scheme is set out in the Bill itself. There is practically nothing before honourable members beyond the fact that certain gentlemen are to be appointed to draw up and carry out some scheme for the formation' of an Institute of Science and Industry. The scheme itself is not put forward by Ministers. They propose to hand over to certain tors, some of whom have been appointed, the task of drawing up a scheme which will be acceptable to Parliament and to the country. The Government have not presented to the House any financial statement or told us how much the Institute will cost Australia. They have not in any way taken the House into their confidence, or stated how they will collaborate""Will the States, which already have big agricultural bureaux carrying out a similar class of work. The Minister (Mr Groom) made great use of the words "" co-ordination "" and "" co-operation,"" - which seemed to me to mean in this case the squeezing out of the States and the Commonwealth doing everything on its own. In effect, the Government say that one man trying to find a road through a jungle has a better chance of success than half-a-dozen men would have. You cannot set one man to make a certain discovery. Great tific problems are solved only by many minds working from different points of view to achieve the same end.",48
202,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I am not aware that anv member of the Government has said anything to the contrary.,49
203,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Minister has said that the Commonwealth Institute; by coordinating the work of the States, will have a better chance of solving these problems than will all the different States working independently. I doubt that very much indeed. Many years' experience of science has shown that the big results are achieved by various minds working independently on the one problem.",49
204,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The experience of the States of the American Union, working separately, but in co-operation with the Federal authority, shows the reverse to be the case.",49
205,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Why does not the Minister enter into some arrangement with the Slates ?,49
206,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Bill provides for that.,49
207,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It does not provide for anything of the sort.,49
208,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member cannot have read the Bill .,49
209,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Bill provides for the appointment of directors to carry direcout the scheme, and co-operate with the already States if they choose.",49
210,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,We cannot compel the States to co-operate.,49
211,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No , but it is of no use to' hold a pistol at the heads of the States and say, ""Unless you agree with us we shall duplicate all your existing machinery, do the work on our own, and squash the State bureaux."" A f t e r reading the Bil l and the speech of the Minister, I am i m pressed with the fact that the principal services of this Institute are to be rendered to primary production. The very work which the Minister has emphasized is that which is now being cnrried on by the States. Many of the States have very big Departments, with wellequipped laboratories, and headed by distinguished men who have been very successful in working out problems in conscien- nexion with our primary industries, including the breeding of new varieties of wheat and the treatment of diseases in cattle.",49
212,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"There is room for improvement. Mr LECKIE , - I have no doubt that the honourable member will approve of the Government's scheme, because one of the things which thÂ© Minister stressed as a justification for the creation of this In stitute is the necessity for reclaiming great areas of Queensland from the orickly pear,- which the State Parliament has been trying for years to eradicate. I do not know in what way the Commonwealth will be able to supplement the experiments which have been already made in that connection.",49
213,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Already , the Commonwealth is co-operating with the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales on that subject.",49
214,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What does the Minister mean by co-operating ?,49
215,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Combine d efforts by the Federal and State authorities and sharing the cost.,50
216,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That means the Commonwealth is paying for the eradication of the prickly pear in Queensland.,50
217,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Commonwealth and the States are co-operating and sharing the expenditure for that purpose.,50
218,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Then the Commonwealth has undertaken to supply money .for this purpose without consulting Parliament. How much money have the Government provided?,50
219,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Commonwealth has agreed to provide Â£4,000 per annum for five years, and the States of New South Wales and Queensland each Â£2,000 per annum for the same period.",50
220,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,How much have the Commonwealth provided for the eradication of St.. John's wort in Victoria?,50
221,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,There is no proposal of that kind.,50
222,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Victori a has been attempting for years to eradicate that pest, which is more dangerous than the prickly pear. - Mr GROOM - I thought the honourable member was dealing with the Bill on national grounds.",50
223,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am; but when I find that the Government have allocated a sum of money to certain States without consulting Parliament, I begin to think that the national point of view is not taken hy the Ministry. I look upon the scheme represented by this Bill as flamboyant and impracticable. I have always found that the people who go the whole hog on education, and regard it as the beginning and end of everything, are divided into two classes-firstly , those who have not had the advantage of education; and, secondly, those who have been so overeducated that they are not able to make their living in the practical walks of life. So it is with science and technical education. Those men who are the greatest sticklers for technical and scientific education are those who have not had the advantage of training in technical .schools or workshops, or those who have gone in for extra scientific education to such an extent that they are incapable of appreciating the commercial side of industrial enterprises. Lt.nColonel ABBOTT - Would the honourable member shut out science from this Institute ?",50
224,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No . Some have regarded as a blot on the Bill the fact that the man who has been appointed chairman of directors is not a scientist. I regard that fact as a distinct advantage, because on a board of directors we want not so much scientists as organizers. The fact that the chairman of directors is not a scientist is the one good feature I have discovered in the scheme. During the debate a good deal has been said about what Germany has done with the aid of science. The great commercial advance of that country has been ascribed to the use of science in industry. I differ altogether from that point of view. Germany became commercially great, not by reason of the scientific education of its workmen, but because it harnessed finance to industrial and business concerns. MT. FOWLER - German y cribbed a great many of its scientific ideas from other countries.",50
225,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Almos t every one of the scientific methods which Germany uses were discovered iby other countries. The Germans saw the advantage of placing those methods at the service of their .industries, and the Government, not only provided the money, but insisted upon the controllers of industries using science in their work. I find not one provision in the Bill for the harnessing of science to industry. In the country districts I have seen an old horse harnessed to a jinker with a few bits of twine; but in this scheme, not even to that flimsy extent is science harnessed to industry - As a preliminary step in this project, the Government should have said to the big industrial concerns, ""We are prepared to help you in your industry by placing science at your disposal, if you will do your part by providing some of the wherewithal."" Under this Bill the Government adopt the very opposite policy. They propose to sot mp a big Institute, appoint directors Â£1,200 per annum, and spend money i all sorts of ways; but in only one small clause of the Bill is provision made industries to pay for the scientific aid be provided by the Government.",50
226,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Olaus e 13, paragraph d, provides that one of the functions of directors shall bo the recognition of sons or associations engaged in industries for the purpose of carrying out inlittle dustrial scientific research, and co-operaciated tion with and the making of grants them.",51
227,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I shall deal with the making of grants directly. The Minister has said that the directors of the Institute will not spend money without the consent of Parliament, but in half-a-dozen clauses of the Bill provision is made for the sooner. directors to make grants.",51
228,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But only out of money appropriated by Parliament, and under any regulations made.",51
229,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What is the use of fooling us and the directors by telling Mines. them that they have power to make grants, and then telling us that Parliademands ment has to appropriate the money?",51
230,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The lionorable member - formed.""] knows that that is the usual procedure. Parliament appropriates money for a purscientists pose, and then regulations are made to govern its expenditure.",51
231,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I was not aware that that was the procedure.,51
232,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That is the way in whioh repatriation money is appropriated expended.,51
233,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"On the contrary, my visory observation has been that the money has been practically all spent before the vernment, at the close of the financial year, ask Parliament for approval of the expenditure. That is what will happen connection with this Institute. Again, grants are to be given for travelling scholarships, they must be given to cover a number of years. What is the good of saying that a scholarship has been granted for research for a period of ten years, if our shortages. in the second year the payment of the money is to be subject to a parliamentary appropriation? Does the Minister expect that scientists trained in a university at without relation to - ordinary business, will n make an immediate success when they become associated with a commercial enterfor prise, and attempt to graft business to methods on their scientific training. In a small way I am a captain of industry; that is to say, I am engaged in manufacthe ture which requires a certain amount of perscientific research. The big discoveries and improvements in industry are made by little. No man can become assowith an industrial concern, and into a month, or even twelve months, put it on the high road to fortune. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - If that had happened to the Allies during the war we would not have been out of the wood for ten years, but science made such rapid strides that we were successful much",51
234,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Because science was harnessed to the business all the time. In case, the men who made the big scientific discoveries during the war were principally graduates from institutions like the Ballarat and Bendigo Schools of",51
235,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,This interesting debate a quorum. I call attention to the state of the House. {Quorum,51
236,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"During the war British showed that they did not lag behind those of other countries, but the principal discoveries were made, not by university men, but hy those who had graduated from such institutions as the Ballarat School of Mines, and had pracand tical, working experience. During the last three years various adcouncils and other bodies of scientists have been endeavouring to find efGofective substitutes for certain commodities of which, owing to the war, there is a shortage in the Commonwealth; but not in one discovery of any moment to Australia if has been made by the ultra-trained men. I have had some experience of their methods, and have been surprised at the ridiculously childish schemes which they have brought forward to. relieve some of",51
237,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Will the honourable member go into details ?,51
238,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I can do so. I would remind honourable members that at the very forefront of .a recent number of Science amd Industry, the journal of the Iastatute, there was set out as a big achievement on the part of the Advisory Council, its discovery of a substitute for tin plate.. My association - with .a business in which the use of tin plate is involved led me to .ascertain that their final conclusion was that the only .substitute for tin plate which they could nominate was a material, .the price of which was very much higher than even the enhanced price of tin during tihe war period. And this was placed before the people as a very great .achievement. The Advisory Council could have learned from a dozen different manufacturing establishments in Australia at the very outset of its investigations that the material it recommended would be suitable but for its price. It began, however, with the very ABC of the investigation of the subject, and, working from the bottom, prosecuted experiments which had been made long before by various private firms. I recognise that in opposing a scheme of this kind one lays oneself open to the charge of being unprogressive, and of not being anxious to expand the industries of Australia. My objection to this Bill is that I see no future for a scheme based on the principles for which it provides. The Government should not have entered upon this project, nor should it have made appointments to the Institute without first consulting Parliament. In the second place, I see no evidence that the Government have endeavoured in any way to cooperate with thedifferent States, which are already spending large sums on scientific research work in relation principally to our primary industries.",51
239,Mr WATKINS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Are not these proposals mere copies of what is being done in the States.,52
240,Mr LECKIE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They are almost the same. We have already in the States adequate laboratories and many scientists carrying out investigations designed to assist our primary industries. It seems to me that the title of this Bill is a misnomer, and really a fraud, since, in framing it, there has not been any attempt to provide for the harnessing of science to industry. Doubtless, several scientists with Hghi - degrees will be .appointed to the Institute, but not one of them will have had any experience of ordinary working conditions. Those of us who have had experience as workers in - or controllers of factories know full well that big scientific discoveries are not made in a day. They represent gradual accumulations of minor - discoveries, and the steady building up of small improvements. Unless we are going to get these chemists and scientists right into our factories, workshops, and chemical laboratories, no good will result from this Bill. If we put the scientists into private workshops and factories and called upon the industries benefited by their work to subscribe to the cost, the position would be different; but, as it is, we shall not obtain any advantage from the Bill. I protest against this Bill, in the first place, because no definite scheme has been placed before us, and because we are asked to commit ourselves to an unknown expenditure in connection with it. It is all very well for supporters of the measure to say that Parliament will have annually to appropriate the money necessary to provide for the maintenance of the Institute, and that, therefore, we shall have full control over its expenditure; but my experience is that, once a Parliament commits itself to such a scheme, it will not stop at an expenditure of Â£10,000, Â£20,000, or even Â£50,000 per annum. We know how quickly a new Department grows. Every head of a Department wants to boom it, and to make it appear to be the most essential of all. A Department is no sooner created than the officer placed incharge of. it requires a staff of secretaries, filing clerks, and others, and it speedily becomes a vast spending body. It is fastened on the people, and we are unable to get rid of it. Because the Government have not formulated a proper scheme, because they have not submitted a statement as to the cost which this scheme will involve, and also for the reason that they have not attempted in any way to provide for the extension of scientific research to the workshop and the factory, I am utterly opposed to this Bill.",52
241,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Wilmot) [2.53] While I am opposed to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I give place to no honourable member in the bester's lief that it is absolutely necessary bring to hear on our primary and secondDepartment, ary industries the best scientific knowanomaly. ledge. I recognise that we shall have to improve our methods of business in order to hold our own in the fierce trade competition that must follow the war. We shall have to go, not only to Great Britain and to the United States of America, but particularly to Germany in respect of some matters, in order learn the best system of conducting our industrial enterprises. I do not wish be considered unprogressive, but I am ments. opposed to this Bill, because I can see in it nothing more than a proposal for a useless expenditure of money. We are told that the object of this Institute is stimulate production. With such an obment, ject we must all have sympathy. Honorlishment able members, and the people generally, have again and again urged that we must increase our production ih order to meet nary business investigations. our war expenditure, and to balance financial ledger; but this Institute will help us very little in that direction.",53
242,Mr COKSEK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,We cannot yet say that we know enough of it to be able to make that statement.,53
243,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is so, but we have had some indication of what it is likely to do, and I can see nothing more in this Bill than an attempt to set up another Department which will be supermoney. imposed upon the scientific bureaux already carried on hy the States. It useless for the Minister (Mr Groom) to tell me in a light and airy that way that the work of this Institute and the State bureaux will be cobusiness ordinated. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I have learned of what has happened in connection with schemes of this kind, and I know what will happen in this case. I am surprised case. that Ministers do not profit by experience. They do not seem to realise the rapidity with which Departments grow. We have seen an unnecessary Department estabenterprises. lished and rapidly assume vast dimenthis sions. One may enter such a Departture ment and find it impossible to fault it, yet it ought never to have heen created. 1 We have for instance the Prime MiniDepartment. This is the only part to of the Empire in which there is such a and it is certainly an Some one got on the blind side of Mr Eisher, who apparently thought he would he justified in creating a precedent, and he set about establishing a Department of the Prime Minister. That Department is not wanted in Australia. All the work that it did even during the war, when the Prime Minister was certo tainly a busy man, could have been done very much better by means of temporary to additions to the staffs of other DepartI n regard to all these Government enterprises, the position is the same. Parliament is induced by Ministers to to consent to the setting up of an establishand the expenditure on that estabincreases from year to year. Government factories are generally started without any satisfactory prelimiSuch a the thing would never be done by, for instance, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. If a scheme is submitted to that eompany, it takes steps at once to secure the best possible advice with regard to it, and once it has ascertained that it is likely to prove a sound and payable proposition, it sets to work upon it, with the result that within two or three years the shareholders get some return for their When we inquire into the position of a Government enterprise like the is Small Arms Factory, we see that Parliament has not got what it intended, and the expenditure upon it has grown beyond all anticipation. If ordinary methods had been followed, if a thorough preliminary investigation had been made, we should have got what we wanted, and with much less expenditure.",53
244,Mr COKSEK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That is hardly a parallel,53
245,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Thes e observations will apply to practically all Government The Minister in charge of Bill cannot tell us what the expendion the Institute will be. I do not blame him for that, but he should at least be able to give us a very reliable estimate. I should not care what the cost was as long as I was satisfied that the results would be beneficial; but my objection is that we are not going to obtain any good results from this scheme.",53
246,Mr COBSEB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That is more than any one can say at the present time.,54
247,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Honourable members have indulged in the expression of a pious hope that the Institute will prove of great value, hut we have had no concrete case showing that its establishment is likely to have an important bearing on any industry. We could get better results by devoting the best talent available to specific propositions. Could an Institute of this kind add anything to our knowledge of nodules in meat, or any other pest? The present organization has done little or nothing in this direction, except in a perambulatory sort of way. Of course, in the case of a pest like the fly, it would not matter what the cost of the investigation was so long as we got results; but we are not likely to get any "" forrader "" in the way that this Institute will probably act. It would be far better to pick out special subjects and allow the States and the Commonwealth together to devote the best talent obtainable to them. Professor Reid came out some time ago on behalf of the British Government to investigate matters concerning wheat, and, on request, devoted some attention to the fly pest, for which, he says, he has already discovered a remedy. Whether or not that remedy will prove efficacious, we are more likely to attain success in this and other similar directions by selecting particular subjects for investigation. Most inventions and discoveries do not come from organized or applied science, but from men who are practically engaged in the industries concerned, and who submit their ideas to the scientists for development. The Minister talked a great deal about the Bureau in America, but it would be more to the point if he showed us that the proposed Institute in Australia is to bo fostered and conducted in the same way. We have not unlimited funds, and unless we can look forward to successful results, the idea can only end in - waste. Nothing has been said to upset my contention that the Institute is not going to achieve its object of stimulating production. ' We are told that it is not the intention to interfere with the States organizations, but only ""co-ordinate."" I like the word "" co-ordinate,"" and co-ordination is a good thing if it can be brought about. But, apparently, we are going to do much more than co-ordinate and co-operate ? The present Commonwealth Bureau has already sent out reports, and issues a monthly journal containing more or less interesting matter. The States, however, were doing all this kind of work, and, if I may say so, were issuing much better journals.",54
248,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Commonwealth journal is printed on the very best paper. Mr RICHAB D FOSTER - Where does all the information come from in the journal?,54
249,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It is a re-hash of what has been published in the past.,54
250,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes ; what does the journal contain ? I am not complaining of thÂ© matter, but however good it may be in itself, it is not directed to any particular purpose. The only result of this Bill will be the creation of another Department to find billets for people and issue reports. As to the appointments proposed, Dr Gellatly may be the best man forthÂ© position of director, but I hope, for thÂ© sake of the honour and reputation of the Government, that it is not true they have already appointed Dr Gilruth. Probably Dr Gellatly, who is not a man of any special scientific standing, is there as an organizer and business head.",54
251,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is curious to select a doctor of medicine for such a post. Mr ATKINSON , - I believe that Dr Gellatly is a barrister and a journalist. As to Dr Gilruth, I do not think he is better qualified for a position of the kind than many men who could be found in Australia; besides, he has just left a Commonwealth position, and it would appear as though the Government were hunting for another for him. At a time like this, the Government ought to give Parliament some sav in matters of the kind, or, at any rate, conduct them openly, and allow for compÂ©tition.",54
252,Mr MCDONALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What is the salary to be paid to Dr Gilruth?,55
253,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I think it is Â£1,50 0 a year.",55
254,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If that is so, it is about time Parliament made a stand.",55
255,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If we were to propose that the appointment should not be made, honourable members oppositewould vote in favour of the appointment.",55
256,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is the honourable member's opinion. If there were proper co-ordination, three good scientific) men, with a few clerks, could do all that was necessary. Did we ever know a body created with practically unlimited power to make appointments, and so for t h, which did not in a little time have a whole host of officials around it ? It is only a pious hope, which wil l not. be realized, that there is to be no interference with the States Departments, but only co-ordination. What about the Quarantine, the Electoral, and the Taxation branches? Is there co-ordination in regard to these, although the Government and every official, both Commonwealth and State, knows that there should be? Could there be any more disgraceful exhibition than what happened when the influenza epidemic broke out? TheÂ» State and Commonwealth Quarantine Departments squabbled while peoDle were dying.",55
257,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Commonwealth called the representatives of the States together, and an agreement was come to which was observed by the Commonwealth.",55
258,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,P o r how long?,55
259,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,All through; we never deviated from it .,55
260,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No , because the Commonwealth wanted to have all its own way.",55
261,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Because the States had made an agreement.,55
262,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That was a flagrant instance of the way in which the public interest was sunk amidst the squabbles of public Departments. But the quarantine business is not over yet. What about Tasmania and the Commonwealth? Tasmania, as a clean State, stood out for seven days' quarantine, because that was the period agreed on at the November Conference. The Commonwealth, however, tried to compel Tasmania to accept the Commonwealth view, although the Commonwealth doctors know no more about the disease than do the State doctors.",55
263,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Surely the honourable member does not think that quarantine should be controlled by the States ?,55
264,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No ; but I am pointing out the position, and showing what fudge the Minister was talking about .co-ordination. Ministers come down at a time like this and make statements in an airy way, when they ought to be discussing business. The time is most inopportune for the establishment of an Institute of the kind proposed. Unfor tunately, our financial position, like that of Great Britain, and most other countries, is very critical.",55
265,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That is because they have abandoned the idea of investigations of this kind.,55
266,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Othe r countries have not abandoned the idea of this sort of bureau, because they have never been foolish enough to adopt it . I give way to no one in my desire to assist and make use of scientific investigation, but I must see some results from the expenditure of our money in the way of increased production. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - This Institute will lift Australia out of the mud, and Tasmania with it .",55
267,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Australi a has never yet been in the "" m u d . "" However, the times are so bad that we should be very careful about spending money without adequate return.",55
268,Mr COBSEB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That is what we expect.,55
269,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Sho w me how we are going to get it . All this maudlin calk at a time like this sickens practical people. It is imperative that, the Government should he economical, and set their faces against any unnecessary expenditure, not because we do not want this Institute, and many other things, but because we cannot afford them. At the same time, the Government should have, what I am afraid they lack, enterprise and business acumen, so as to be prepared to take a proper risk in seizing an opprtunity to stimulate production. There are many ways in which this could, and ought to be, done, and if a little money were lost here and there, no blame would attach to the Government.",55
270,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,To what is the honourable member referring 1,56
271,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"To a number of industries. For instance, in the wool industry and the mining industry, the Government could assist, and ought to assist, even at the risk of losing a little, in view of the fact that if success were attained, there would be ample return for the outlay. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - What about the standardization of iron and steelstandard ships, and so forth?",56
272,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Goo d heavens! Here is an honourable member asking me how the standardization of iron and steel can be brought about without an Institute of Science and Industry. Does the honourable member think the Broken Hill Company and the great. steel concerns cannot take advantage of all the best knowledge existing in the world? Does the Colonial Sugar Befining Company go round holding out its arms for some one to come and help it? No; it employs and pays the best chemists good salaries.,56
273,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,We want to expand that idea.,56
274,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"We shall not do it in this way. If the question of the standardization of iron and steel is very pressing, let us put the best men on to attend to it, and get it done. In that way we shall obtain some return for our money; but do not wait till a perambulating institute reaches the question of steel in its programme. If it is true that Dr Gilruth has been appointed to this Institute, do honourable members think that is going to settle the question of the standardization of steel?",56
275,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member asks whether it is time. The Minister has not denied it, and I assert that it is true.",56
276,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If it is true, I shall be sorry to hear it for the sake of the reputation of the Government. I object, further, to the way in which this business was started. 1916 the Prime Minister Hughes} had a column or two in [437] the papers on the subject of an Advisory Council of Science. Probably some one had caught him on the hop when he was busy, and obsessed him for the moment with the idea; but I do not suppose that even he at that time expected the scheme to develop in this way. Science at that time was very much in evidence. We were attributing the great success of Germany to her scientific activities, and science loomed large in the public mind. The war is over now. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - But the industrial war is still going on.",56
277,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I stated earlieT that I did not object to the application of science to industry. We should go to science, ibut the Government, in this Bill, are founding a body - that will give us anything hut science. It will give us reports that will lead nowhere so far as practical business is concerned. I want to see the proposal remodelled before I support it. Probably the Prime Minister never intended that the Advisory Council should develop into an Institute in this way without Parliament heing consulted and everything being done above-board'. There have been far too many instances lately to show how this Chamber is losing its grip of the purse-strings of the country. The Treasurer (Mr Watt) cannot even tell us what he expects to spend on the Institute.",56
278,Mr MCDONALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It will cost Â£500,000 at least.",56
279,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That would be a large sum of money to spend, although, if we secured adequate results, I would not mind spending Â£5,000,000. The country' must be assured first, however, of adequate returns. We can get them if we set ahout the business in a proper way. That will mean doing away with what we have done, and starting afresh. This is another instance of the expenditure of money without parliamentary sanction. Not long ago we had a debate on the question of spending money on ships without parliamentary sanction. I tried very hard to catch your eye, sir, during the time allowed for that debate, During because I wished to say that I considered (Mr that the Government had acted unconstitutionally, but that I could have overlooked it if , on the very first opportunity, they had admitted the fact to Parliament. Everybody knew when the' contract for those ships was concluded, and it was the duty of the Government, before any question was put on the subject, to tell the House of the proposed expenditure. No Minister, however, took that course. When objection was raised, the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) pointed to the fact that the House had adopted the Ministerial statement of policy.",56
280,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Acting Minister for the Navy announced it in the House several days before.,57
281,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"He should have made the announcement three weeks or a month before. He should have said to Parliament, "" We have done certain things. We know we have acted irregularly, but our excuse is so-and-so, and we hope Parliament will accept it.""",57
282,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What has that to do with Ihe Institute of Science and Industry?,57
283,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It has everything to do with the attempt to establish an Institute, because there has also been unauthorized expenditure on that body. If Ministers had come to the House, as in duty bound, as the trustees of the public purse, and told the House that they had done things irregularly in England, hut that they had been forced to that course because their actions had to he kept secret to prevent interference by the Shipping Ring, the House would have been satisfied, and we should never have heard anything of the motion for adjournment inoved by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), which was so strongly supported.",57
284,Mr SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND," Order ! I ask the honorablo member not to go into that matter. . Mr ATKINSON - I am quoting it .simply as an illustration on parallel lines. The Government are following . the same evil course in this case, and I object to it. The States have heen doing this work, and some of them have on .'occasions achieved very valuable results. ., Mr Laird SMITH - How much have ..we been able to do in Tasmania?",57
285,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I do not know that it has been very much, but some of the people there have had the pluck to start out and do a good deal for themselves. The orchardists of the Huon district took drastic action in connection with certain pests, and that helped them to found the industry of which the country ought to be proud.",57
286,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I believe they are waiting down there with shot-guns for two or three of the scientists to come back.,57
287,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The scientists did very little for the apple-growers of Tasmania. The growers in the south of the island have done things for themselves very well. Three or four of the States have been issuing periodical publications showing the work they have done. What the Commonwealth should do is to meet the States and co-operate with them in the proper sense. ' We need only one real bureau.,57
288,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Government wish to co-operate with the States.,57
289,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They say that that is their wish, but, if it is, they are not going the Tight way about it. We all admit the value of science, but surely if we find that we are moving in a direction that is not leading towards the goal we should, as sensible men, retrace our steps in time.",57
290,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Does the honourable member mean, that the Commonwealth should not appoint any scientific experts at all?",57
291,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"My contention is that we should have had a thorough understanding with the States; looked into the whole proposition with them, and seen what was best for the whole of the people of Australia, because, after all, it is the one taxpayer that keeps both authorities going. We sometimes forget that we are one agent and the States other agents for the same people. We should all look to the general interests of the community. If that had been done, we could have started a bureau on something like sound lines. One bureau is enough for Australia. We should have a good central bureau, and then we could have our officers in all the States. That would secure co-ordination.",57
292,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Do .you mean the States to give up their bureaux, and we to have an Australian bureau?",58
293,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes ; and let the Commonwealth ancl the States share the expenditure. In that way we should get good results. There is plenty of room in this continent, for the application of science.",58
294,Mr COKSEK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Competitio n in obtaining that science is good.,58
295,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If we have a good, sound bureau we do not need a lot of competition. Doe3 the honourable member think that Western Australia is trying to outdo Queensland in knowledge of tick or prickly pear? As soon as any State finds the best remedy for a pest all the other States will adopt it, after its value has been proved. If we had one bureau, with a sub-department in each State, we could do all that the Minister expects to do hy means of State and Federal bodies at very much less cost and in a far more progressive way. We should found our bureau on very differentlines from those now proposed. Australia will uot grudge the money so long as anything like satisfactory results are obtained. I am so convinced that we are ou wrong lines in this measure that I shall oppose the second reading. I want to see the Bill thrown out, so that we may get on to the right path. From a bureau such as I have outlined, people interested in industries who required assistance to work out their problems would be able to obtain assistance just as well as they could from'six or seven bureaux. We are not starting on business lines, and we shall not succeed if we do not. We do not want our scientific men necessarily to he business men. We want them to be good at the subjects with which they have to deal, and we require a good organizing business head. This, for all I know, we mav have in Dr Gellatly.",58
296,Mr LATRD SMITH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What do you sugshall gest should be done?,58
297,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I have suggested that we should start afresh, and build up one bureau for all Australia.",58
298,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,You would ask the States to repeal their Acts?,58
299,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Exactly . I do not say that they will agree to any such proposal. But if they will not, the position cannot bo helped. It is our duty to do the best that we possibly can for the people whom we have heen elected to serve. I ask the Minister whether there has heen any conference between State and Federal authorities with a view to re-organizing their Departments?",58
300,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,We know very well that the States will not give up their Departments.,58
301,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If that is the case, I am opposed to the proposal of the Government on the ground that it is altogether too big. If it is merely a question of co-ordinating the Departments of the States and the Commonwealth in regard to science and industry, we can do very much better than we shall do by means of this Bill. It is all very well to talk about what has heen done in other parte of the world. But there is no evidence that we are starting our Institute in anything like the way that the Federal Institute was started in the United States of America. To me it does not matter what some conference may have determined. My objection is that there has never been a proper attempt made by the Federal authorities to get the States into line on this matter. i Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Is not that attempt being made under this Bill ?",58
302,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No . Under this measure, we shall merely have another Department, and we shall not insure any more friendly relations between the States and the Commonwealth than exist today.",58
303,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,At the present moment the Advisory Council is working in complete J-armony with the States.,58
304,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But the Commonwealth authority has not got into its stride yet. I hold that the whole business should be commenced afresh, and I certainly back up my opinion with my vote. 1 '- ' ' '-'",58
305,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Wakefield) [ 3 . 3 5 ] - I do not altogether agree ray honourable friend who has just resumed his seat. He is like the curate's egg-goo in parts. When he talks about abolishWorks ing the excellent work that is being done by State organizations,59
306,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I did not suggest they should be abolished.,59
307,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"When my honourable friend gets his speech properly corrected, doubtless I shall agree with him entirely. This Bill is not to sanction the creation of a Bilreau of Science and Industry. It is a measure relating to a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and, following their usual tactics, the Government have first created the Institute, and now come to Parliament to sanction their action. I am sick of this sort of business. The j Government cannot blame its supporters if they speak out, and say that it is this sort of thing came to a stop. lieve in the creation of a Bureau of Science and Industry, but I also believe in doing things decently and in order. This matter has not been brought forward in accordance with the best traditions Parliament, and Ministers are asking their supporters to carry burdens which they ought not to be expected to carry. If the Bill is not put in its proper for a time, until some better scheme is with the same project. forthcoming, I shall vote against the motion for its second reading. I am strongly of opinion that it is tial we should create an Institute upon the lines of similar organizations in America. But I believe it would be useless to create an Institute of this character to act in - of spending Â£500,000 a year. dependently, and to overlap the activities of the different State Departments. We i have had many of these activities in exisment, tence for years, and they have accomt plished excellent work. They struggled during their initial stages against prejuthing dice of every kind, and many of them are only now overcoming that prejudice. Science, particularly as applied to our primary industries, has justified thousand times over. We have been told that it is intended to co-operate with States, and that all State activities, with done ? this Institute as a nerve centre, are to be organized upon proper lines. I am sure that any such organization would with produce results that, from a monetary stand-point, would justify a very large d expenditure. But I ask the Minister for and Railways (Mr Groom) whether the co-operation of the States with the Commonwealth in these developthat ments was not determined upon before this Department was created by the Commonwealth.",59
308,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Since the Advisory Council has been in existence it has been intended co-operating with the States.,59
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes . I am pleased that there is an inclination in that direction in some of the States, but that circumstance does not remove any objection to the action of the Government in first establishing this Department, and afterwards coming to Parliament to u s t i fy its action. It is simply belittling the States, saying to them, "" We have time launched this enterprise, and now we I bewant you to co-operate with us."" ' Two or three years before he left public life that splendid Leader of this House for many years, Mr Deakin, was exceedof ingly anxious to see his ideas as to the creation of an institution of this kind, of which he was enamoured, come to f r u i tion. Later on, the present Prime Minisplace ter (Mr Hughes) became fascinated He told the people on several public occasions that he intended to develop a scheme at the proper time. In fact, on one of his days essenout, when he was having a good time, he said that he was prepared to justify a scheme that might develop to the extent I would not object to that amount of expenditure f , in the successive stages of its developsuch an Institute would full y jusi f y its existence. This may well happen ; but, for Heaven's sake let us do the decently,.and let us put an end to the Parliament and the country being continually committed to big schemes in volving possible heavy expenditure withitself a out being consulted. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - What does the the honourable member suggest should be",59
310,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"In this case, the Government should have f o i lowed the usual practice of Parliaments, and not have humiliated honourable members on this side of the House. Ministers will not have the whole of the members on this side wet-nursing them for very long. Lt. Colonel ABUOTT - How would the J honourable member launch this scheme?",59
311,Mr RIOHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Firs t of all, I would settle with the States the matter of co-operation. The first steps towards that end were only taken by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) at the last Premiers' Conference; when, upon the outbreak of influenza, there was a rush of business which caused it, and many other matters of importance, to be set aside. It was not showing sufficient respect and courtesy to the (States, ancl to the Commonwealth itself, to submit a question of so much importance, practically without notice, to a conference that was unexpectedly interrupted. The scheme had been launched previously without seeking a conference with the States.",60
312,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"In 1916, when the scheme was launched, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) invited the State Premiers to a conference in Melbourne. were consulted right from the beginning.",60
313,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That conference was not convened for this particular purpose. It came to no conclusion upon this subject. I have been following up this matter, because I am interested in it. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I believe that the honourable member supports the scheme.",60
314,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Not on the present lines. Although the Minister (Mr Groom) may elucidate the matter as to the date upon which the cooperation of the States was first sought, he will not move my primary objection that this Institute was commenced, and a liability incurred in regard to it, before Parliament was asked to consent to the establishment of it. Until a scheme has been submitted by the Government showing that the ordinary lines of courtesy and decency towards the States have been followedthat is to say, if this Bill is designed to create an Institute of Science and In dustry independent of the States- I shall oppose it at every stage.",60
315,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What else can it do as we are now proceeding?,60
316,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,There were many omissions from 'the speech with which the Minister introduced the Bill. He did not tell us what the Institute would cost. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - The main question is whether we are to get value for the money we spend.,60
317,Mr RIOHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The main question is whether we propose to do things in the proper way-by co-operating with the States. When they are treated in this way, can - we wonder when we hear so much from Ministers about the hopelessness of co-operating with the States, or about getting the consent of the States to certain proposals? If the In stitute is launched in its proper form, with the State Agricultural Bureaux, the Agricultural Schools, Workmen's Colleges, and other institutions all. properly co-ordinated uncler it, the Commonwealth Institute, the central activity, may lead Australia excellently well in the applicaThey tion of science to industries, primary and secondary. One of the greatest requirements of the Commonweath is the further development of chemistry in relation to the soil, and in regard to its application to manufactures. Another reason why I shall oppose the Bill, until we have a proper statement from the Government upon the matters to which I have referred, is the personnel of the proposed directorate of the Institute. The Minister has told us nothing.",60
318,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Director s have not been, and cannot be appointed. The only arrangement made is the appointment of the director, Dr Gellatly.",60
319,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Well , that 13 one.",60
320,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What about Dr Gilruth ?,60
321,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,No appointment has been made.,60
322,Mr RIOHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Has he not been appointed ?.,60
323,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,No .,60
324,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am delighted to have the Minister's assurance, because Dr Gilruth made a most awfui and lamentable failure of his administration in the Northern Territory. But it is remarkable that we have had no assurance, previously, from the Minister, although he has been plied again and again during the course of this debate for information on this point.",61
325,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I make the statement now, because it has been repeated so often. I had intended to reply to it in my speech.",61
326,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"-The ister's assurance is a great relief to me, because we could not have had a greater failure in administration than during Dr Gilruth's term in the Northern and but for the fact that strong were made he would have secured an appointment for another term of five years. In order to get out of a difficulty he was allowed to remain there until the war was over. This man wbo made such a failure of the Northern Territory, been ridiculed in both Houses of Parliament for years past, has now been sent abroad upon some mission. !-> it true also that his expenses are being paid ? If he had been appointed to this Institute of Science and Industry it would have damned the whole business from A to Z. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Bu the has not - been appointed.",61
327,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is a blessing. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Then why talk about it? Mr RICHARD FOSTER talking about it in the hope that the appointment never will be made. I want honourable members to carry their minds back twenty or twenty-five year3 ago, to the time when scientific education was first being applied to agricultural operations in the different States of Australia, through the Agricultural Colleges. When the professors began to teach farmers how to grow wheat and carry on other operations, they were simply beating the air for years and years. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - What Lowrie ?",61
328,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"He was a farmer as well as a professor, reared among the Highlands of Scotland on porridge and the Shorter catechism. As a poor man at the plough Professor Lowrie won his way to the University, but even after he had obtained his degree, and entered upon his profession, it took him years to remove prejudice from the minds of some of the farmers. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Will i a m Farrar was not, a practical farmer; he was a surveyor.",61
329,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Farra r was a university man who became a practical farmer, and if he had never done anyMinthing else but breed Federation wheat would still have been regarded as one of the greatest benefactors to this country. Things are different today. The foundaTerritory, tions for higher scientific education have protests been laid, and farmers are ready to listen to scientists with the practical side of their education full y developed. But if they are expected to listen to the type of man that was administering the Northern Territory-if he is placed on the and who has staff of the Institute of Science and In dustry-the n farewell to progress. Is this true? Mr GROOM - Surely the honourable member realizes that there never was a time when scientific assistance was more necessary than it is today.",61
330,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I do, but I want the Government to go about it in the right way.",61
331,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But you say you will not assist us to do it even now.,61
332,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I will not assist the Government u n t i l they settle the matter with the States. - I am Mr GROOM - What do you mean by that ? We have been consulting with the States right through, and they aro cooperating. We want authority to go on.",61
333,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If the Government desire by the dissemination of scientific knowledge to secure greater efficiency, they might well give attention to those concerns with which they are dealing today. Let them eliminate the waste that is being reported in nearly all Government activities. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Poin t to one in about stance.",61
334,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member has been away fighting for this country for several years, or he would have known that during the whole of that time we had Royal Commissions of expert business men inquiring into and reporting upon the inefficient management of various Government Departments.",61
335,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What Commissions do ? Mr RICHABD FOSTER , - They showed waste in expenditure amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the unfortunate fact is that those who were responsible for this waste are in the same positions and with the same authority today. I repeat that I do not intend to support this .Bill until the States and the Commonwealth have had a reasonable opportunity to co-ordinate State activities with this scheme. There is no hurry for a week or two. The House has enough business to keep members full y occupied for twelve solid months. In order to make this scheme successful we want big men-the biggest men that can be found. I do not care what salaries are paid if the right men are obtained. In the meantime I am against the Bill . Debate (on motion by Mr Fenton) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. DEPOBTATION or ENEMY ALIENS - RETURN OF MINISTERS FROM ENGLAND.",62
336,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister, and Treasurer) [ 4 . 1 ] - I move That the House do now adjourn. During the adjournment debate earlier in the day, I promised to inquire into the case of one man who is supposed to have been listed for compulsory deportation. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr . Groom) has since investigated the case of Zoller, and finds that he twice applied for deportation, although, Â©apparently, he found cause to object when the time of departure actually came.",62
337,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Was the application put in writing?,62
338,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"There is a letter in which he saysIf I may be permitted to wait until the boit, I will be ready to sail, but it is sible for me to go by this boat. I am anxious to get baek to GÂ°rmany, and do not intend to return to Australia. That is in his own handwriting. I am glad to have the opportunity of removing the misapprehension regarding my statement this morning, that we were not compulsorily repatriating any men without did those fair inquiry, but others we were repatriating at their own request. If , however, honourable members know or discover any cases to which the principles I have expressed today have not been applied, the Government will be glad to hear of them, and to see that their determinations are strictly observed by the Departments concerned.",62
339,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Will the honourable member have a few copies of his speech today reprinted for distribution?,62
340,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I shall leave that to be decided by the Acting Attorney-General. No doubt, if copies of the speech are made available, honourable members who are being appealed to for an exposition of the deportation policy will be enabled to give it clearly. In regard to the case of J . 0 . Seyffert, mentioned by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), a search has been made, and no order for his deportation has been discovered. No such case as that mentioned by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is traceable in the Department, but I shall be glad to have investigated any cases in respect of which honourable members think that the principles I have enunciated have been violated.",62
341,Mr MAHONY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Has the Acting Prime Minister investigated the cases I mentioned yesterday ?,62
342,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I have placed them in the hands of the Crown Law authorities, and have not yet received any answer. By way of explanation, rather than apology, I intimate to honourable members that I expect to be absent from the House for a fortnight.",62
343,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Where is the honourable member going ?,62
344,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"To the "" l it t l e grey home in the west."" I think that, in view of the important happenings at the Peace Conference, responsible Ministers next should take the earliest possible onporimpostunity of making themselves acquainted with the Peace Treaty, and entering into a consultation with the returning Ministers. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) suggested that this trip involved a contradiction of a statement made by me earlier in the session, that Ministers in Australia have been in frequent consultation with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) abroad. It does not; but cable communication is not as full as conversation first-hand can be. Quite a number of things happened at the Peace Conference which neither the press cablegrams nor those sent to Ministers in Australia full y explained. I desire, also, on behalf of the Government, to convey to the returning Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) a record of the work of the Government during their sixteen months' absence.",62
345,Mr TUDOH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,And the rocky position they are in today.,63
346,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Ministerial party and the Government stand as impregnable and motionless as Gibraltar.,63
347,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,""" M o t i o n l e s s "" is good.",63
348,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That was a slip.,63
349,Mr WATT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It was no slip. It was specially designed to trap honourable members opposite. We do our work without exhibiting our mobility. Honourable members of the Opposition should not think, when they see honourable members on this side reserved, placid, and confident, and not throwing their arms about, that we are not accomplishing things. During the Prime Minister's absence of sixteen months, important things have happened. The war has terminated, and the actions of Parliament and the Departments should be made known to returning Ministers. During my somewhat extended occupancy of the position of Deputy Leader of the House, a position not sought by me, and one which I have no desire to continue to occupy, I have received from honourable members on both sides of the House nothing but consideration. I - wish to openly and publicly acknowledge that, and, as I shall not be in a position to express that feeling in quite the same authoritative wav later, I take this opportunity of doing it . Government members have realized, perhaps more than Opposition members have allowed themselves to do, some of the problems the Government have been dealing with , and the pressure put upon us, and they have extended to us a sympathetic consideration which we have appreciated. But to honourable members of the Opposition, whose function is to oppose and fight, I render a similar acknowledgment. I can imagine that they might have made the task of the Government more irksome, but during the' strenuous period through which we have passed they have shown to me and other Ministers a courtesy that is all too rare in public life.",63
350,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Y a r r a ) [4.9] - Whil e the Acting Prime Minister has occupied the position of Leader of the House, I have got along with him very well. Members on this side have extended courtesy to him , and we have received courtesy in return. Although honourable members may disagree upon many matters, we should at least give each other credit for sincerity in the opinions we express. I support the request of my colleague (Mr Higgs), that the speech of the Acting Prime Minister, in regard to the deportation of enemy aliens, should be made available in pamphlet form. It contains a statement of the principles which dominate the Government policy in that regard, and copies of the speech will be handy for distribution. The deputy leader of our party (Mr Higgs) made a speech extending over less than half-an-hour in which he set out.reasons why a certain course should be followed, and I should be glad if the Government would arrange for a few copies of his speech, and the speech made by the Acting Prime Minister in reply, to be distributed. Honourable members would then be able to follow the complaints and suggestions made, and the answers thereto by the Government.",63
351,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I think that could be arranged. The* honourable member's suggestion is that proof slips of the two speeches, should be pinned together and distributed ?",63
352,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Yes .,63
353,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That , could be arranged by Hansard. We will have the two speeches sent out together.",63
354,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That will satisfy me. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.11 p.m.,63
