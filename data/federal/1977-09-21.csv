The Acting Clerk-Petition s have been lodged (b) vision for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of signed citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card have suffered undue hardship as inmates of private nursing homes because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the vate nursing homes suffered poverty in an endeavour tain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient conthe tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Austives tralian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to private nursing are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the private nursing home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow $6 per week to be retained by the pensioner personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone installed free of charge, or at very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have very little else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a means test. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair, Mr Gillard, Mr Howard, Mr lar pensions Lies MCMahon and Mr Stewart. Petitions received. Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth: That because television and radio: (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many chilTo dren at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the AusGovernment will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters to legislate: (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the PETITIONS best interests of the general public, against self-regulauon by the broadcasting and teleindustry, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards.

Petitions received. Pensions To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representaassembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: homes That the delays between announcements of each quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and their application as a percentage increase in age and invalid pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory and a cause of econpatient for their omic distress to pensioners. That proposals to amend the Consumer Price Index by eliminating particular items from the Index could adversely a affect the value of future increases in age and invalid pensions and thus be a cause of additional economic hardship to only their pension and pensioners. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Require each quarterly percentage increase in the consumer price index to be applied to age and invalid and simias from the pension pay day nearest following the date of announcement of the CP1 movement. 2. Give an open assurance to all aged and invalid pensioners that any revision of the items comprising the consumer price index will in no way result in reductions in the value of any future entitlements to pensioners. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, respectfully by Mr Les Johnson and Mr MACKenzie. Petitions received. National Day of Prayer the Speaker, and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that-whateve r our ideology, in the sight of God we, as a nation are polidcatly, economically and spiritually sick and in need of healing. We, the undersigned, are Christians, and as such, recognise the Bible as the word of God, and in 2 Chronicles 7:14, we are told ""If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins, and will heal their land."" Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in the House assembled will designate a Sunday of your choosing as a ""National Day of Prayer for the Healing of Our Nation"" and have the day and date of this event published in the daily press. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Malcolm Fraser. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will permit Mr Ignazio Salemi to remain in Australia as a resident. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: 1. That whereas an amnesty was announced for all illegal migrants and that whereas Mr Ignazio Salemi, an applicant for amnesty, has been denied amnesty. 2. That Mr Salemi fulfils all the publicly announced criteria for amnesty. 3. That a decision of sue judges of the High Court of Australia recognises that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs may exercise a discretion to allow Ignazio Salemi to remain in Australia. 4. That, although denying Salemi's appeal, all six judges of the High Court agreed that he had been unfairly treated. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Replacement Constitution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe that Australia's constitution is undemocratic and should be replaced by a democratic constitution. This new constitution should be drafted at a representative, directly elected people's convention following extensive public debate, and then put to a referendum of the people. The petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament, as a matter of urgency, will help to promote such public debate and will arrange for the holding of such a people's convention and referendum. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: (1) We protest against any proposed self regulation of the Broadcasting and Television Media in Austraha. (2) The appointment of Mr Gyngell as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal because of his admitted bias. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that no self regulation is implemented and Mr Gyngell be dismissed as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr MACKellar. Petition received. Rhodesia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, the humble Mr Ignazio Salemi petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth: That the Chaner of the United Nations clearly precludes it from interference in the domestic affairs of a country or from obstructing the free transmission of news and information between individuals and between nations. That the United Nations, in apparent illegality, has imposed many restrictions and sanctions upon Rhodesia which has been remarkably free from the bloodshed and turmoil of Northern and Central African lands, even to the extent now of actively encouraging armed conflict against the legally elected Government of Rhodesia. Lord Graham as Minister of External Affairs and Defence has said: 'International Communism is our enemy. All this talk of political advancement and majority rule is no more than a smokescreen in the early skirmishes of an assault upon the whole of Africa. . . . It is even difficult to see this enemy because it is not merely attacking us, but on a broad front is attacking the whole world order, its standards, its law and order, its moralities, its churches, its patriotisms, its philosophies, and even much of its learning . . .' That Communist Chinese infiltration in much of Africa over many years, and Cuban communist troops reported to number 25,000 are dominating nearby Angola, and possess modern missiles et cetera. It is urgent that Mozambique, now under communist domination and which has a common border with Rhodesia, does not receive any further aid from the Commonwealth Government of Australia, which has benefited mainly, the terrorist guerilla movements that are responsible for the deaths of many Rhodesian people. It is urgent for the Australian people to determine for themselves, the actual facts of the Rhodesian struggles. It is urgent that the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common justice and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, witnout interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia's own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. Your petitioners request urgent action to be taken immediately. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Thomson. of Australia respectfully Petition received. Tertiary Education Assistance To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble zens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance institutions is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At a time of severe economic lead to a serious worsening of the current employment situation, particularly school leavers. Your petitioners therefore Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrViner. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth objection to the metric system and request the Government to restore the imperial system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wentworth. Petition received. Unemployment Benefits The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: The Department of Social Security current means test allows those over 21 years of age to earn $6 per week dition to unemployment benefits, and those under 21 week. Amounts earned in excess of these levels result loss in benefit of $ 1 for every additional dollar earned. This policy discourages the unemployed from engaging part time or casual work. Also this may mean that existing potential opportunities for parttimework will not be taken up at a time when unemployment is a major social problem. We believe that this policy is having a particularly tunate effect on young school leavers who are being valuable work experience and entry into the work force. Your petitioners humbly pray that this House request Honourable Minister for Social recommendation of the recent Myers report on unemployvention ment benefits and allow those receiving unemployment benefits to earn up to $20 per week, before their unemployment benefit is reduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Yates. Petition received. NA petition of the undersigned citiNA",14
2,Mr JACOBI,CHILD ABDUCTIONS,"I address a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It relates to child abducto students of non-State tertiary tions. The Minister will recall that I raised this matter with him last May and he undertook to a shortage of places for training set up an interdepartmental committee of inquiry. He will further recall my lengthy submissions urging a number of recommendations disruption, this action must on legislative reforms. Can the Minister now advise the House whether the committee has completed its findings? If so, what are its humbly pray that the Federal recommendations? When can we expect them to be implemented? Finally, he will recall that last month I requested an urgent investigation by himself and the Attorney-General into the alleged illegal activities of an organisation with the title Fathers Organisation for Revolutionary Custody Entitlement. Can he advise the House of the results of his investigations and the activities Metric System of this organisation?  able member has been questioning and making representations to me over a lengthy period of time. At alltimeshe has taken a constructive interest in this very difficult area. I have been spending time on the matter, as have some of my colleagues. To put the matter into perspective let me say that since 1972 fewer than 40 cases of child abduction have been referred to my Department. However, thesefiguresgive no real of indication of the size of the problem but unless they are reported it cannot be measured. The removal of children from Australia by one in adparent without the consent of the other is, of $3 per course, illegal. What is not widely known is that in a certain steps can be taken to prevent children being removed illegally. If a parent considers in that his or her partner may remove a child withor out his or her consent he or she should fill in an inquiry form at a passport office. This will at least help to prevent travel documents being provided unforfor the child until a court order can be obtained. denied Inquirers are counselled to this effect at the training so important for thenpassport office. When a court order is obtained the parent should have a lawyer notify all carthe riers that to remove the child would be a contraSecurity to give effect to the of section 63 of the Migration Act. Unfortunately however-I think this is implicit in the honourable member's question-ther e are other ways in which these preventative measures can be bypassed, and it would not be helpful to give them further publicity by referring to them here. As the honourable member has indicated, an interdepartmental committee has been studying the matter and it has recommended, among other things, the amendment of legislation and a further examination of other measures since a complete legislative remedy has not yet been devised. The Family Law Act, and questions of citizenship, dual nauonality and passport issue are all involved. Therefore passport control is only one element of a major legal problem. Other aspects concern the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Administrative Services and the Attorney-General. However, I propose to put amendments to the Passports Act to the Government for early consideration. These will provide at least a partial solution to the problem of child abduction. The matter will unquestionably require continuing study. The honourable member referred to the Fathers Organisation for Revolutionary Custody Entitlement. All reports concerning that organisation have been placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Police. As I understand it, despite its investigations, which included interviews with the reporter from the Sunday Independent who wrote the original story and interviewed a member of the Senate, it has been unable to discover anyone who admits to being a member of the organisation or anyone who has first hand knowledge of it However, I understand that the Attorney-General's Department has received no complaints of child abductions being carried out by any such organisation. INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES: STATISTICS",16
3,Mr GRAHAM,CHILD ABDUCTIONS,Will the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations confirm that the latest figures relating to industrial disputation show that in the first sue months of this calendar year Australia had the lowest number of industrial disputes and working days lost during this decade? In view of these statistics will the Minister advise the House whether he is satisfied that this level of industrial disputation indicates that there is a minimum degree of political and economic subversion going on in this country?,17
4,Mr STREET,CHILD ABDUCTIONS,"In the first six months of this year the officially published tralian Bureau of Statistics show the lowest amount oftimelost through industrial disputes for approximately 10 years. That contrasts very markedly with the situation under the previous Government when bothtimelost and wages lost through industrial disputation reached record levels. To a major extent thefiguresnow reflect the sound policies of the present Government. In particular we have not followed the example of our predecessors. We have not encouraged unions to pursue extravagant wage claims which the economy could not possibly sustain. The Australian industrial system and its legal framework are excellent and no direct action in pursuit of claims is necessary. Certainly the Government will not be coerced by irresponsible union muscle and it will not hesitate to introduce legislation, as it has already done, if and when it is necessary. The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission expressed concern at the high level of disputation when it was hearing recent national wage cases. We also believe that this level is too high. What people have to appreciate is that statistics do not tell the whole story. Many disputes have little effect on statistics although they cause very serious dislocation to business and disruption to the community. As examples of that latter type of dispute, I instance the air traffic controllers strike and the fuel tankers dispute in Victoria. Neither of them would have had a significant effect on statistics as printed but they caused enormous disruption to the community. Other disputes totally disregard the wage indexation guidelines of the Commission. They seriously affect industrial production. They affect business confidence and our overseas trade. As examples of those sorts of disputes I instance the building industry disputes currently taking place in Victoria, disputes in the Pilbara which disrupted our trade to Japan, bans by the Seamen's Union of Australia involving claims for crewing of ships engaged in overseas trade and strikes in Queensland abattoirs which again have threatened the fulfilling of contracts and, in one instance at least, closed a works and put hundreds of people out of a job. By engaging in these sorts of disputes unionists show a total lack of concern for the effects on the community and on fellow workers. In summary, statistics alone tell nothing of the relative cost to the country and to employment opportunities. We must go beyond the figures and look at the facts. The Government will continue to condemn irresponsible and unwarranted action of this kind as an attack on the Australian statistics of the Auscommunity. INFLATION: IMPLICIT DEFLATOR Mr E. G. Whitlam-My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and relates to his statement at the weekend that the rate of increase of the implicit deflator for gross domestic product was 9.2 per cent during 1976-77. Has he noted that Budget Statement No. 2 explicitly states that the rate of growth of the implicit deflator for gross non-farm product calculated at annual rates rose sharply from 8.9 per cent in the second half of 1976 to 13.1 per cent in thefirsthalf of 1977? Has he also noted that all the other implicit deflators show the same sharp increase in the rate of growth in thefirsthalf of 1977? I therefore ask: Does he consider that thesefigurespublished by the Treasurer accurately reflect the rate of inflation?",17
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CHILD ABDUCTIONS,"The Treasurer's up once and for all? Speech and Budget Statement No. 2, of course, were accurate. The figures used over the weekthe end also are completely accurate concerning underlying rate of inflation. The honourable gentleman likes very much to be able to use the consumer price index with the Medibank ponent in it to try to demonstrate the rate of inflation. But he knows quite well that that is false analogy and a false use of that index. also knows quite well that, if the Medibank ement is taken out of the consumer price index, we get to an annual rate of inflation which is sistent withfiguresof the implicit price deflator of 100. which I indicated over the weekend. Both those figures indicated that inflation had over the course of the year by six or seven points. One may recall that at the worse in the Labor years the rate of inflation reached a level per cent or 19 per cent in particular half-years. What we have achieved is a very marked improvement since then. It is also worth noting some of the other elthis ements of the honourable gentleman's statecharge. ments on Monday Conference. In Perth the a Leader of the Opposition said that he had learnt something, that he had been struck by economic responsibdity, that he was going to reform and was going to be a good boy in the future. not a long time after that that the Opposition said, not as a Budget proposal, that it would spend $800m more with one particular objective. Implicit in everything that the Leader of the Opposition said about our Budget was that the Opposition would spend more funds on every of government expenditure. That was obviously confirmed on Monday Conference a couple of nights ago. I think people can understand that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party have learnt nothing. If the Opposition had the power it would move Australia into high spending and high inflation days again. Everythe thing that the Leader of the Opposition has said has pointed very much in that direction. Since was good enough to ask me a question, may I ask him if he had a happy morning? NA",18
6,Mr BONNETT,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,I refer the Minister for Defence to the Treasurer's Budget Speech in which the Treasurer stated that defence expenditure for 1977-78 would represent a one per cent growth in real terms. Is the Minister aware of the criticism in the Press and by the shadow Minister for Defence that this is mythical and patently false? Will the Minister explain the basis of the Defence estimates for 1977-78 to clear this matter,18
7,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,"I will do my best. I regret that honourable member for Oxley is not with us; the I understand he is ill. I wish him a speedy recovery. I hope he will soon be back with us. If I can take the House into my confidence, may I tell comthe House that the honourable member for Oxley and I went to the same school. Fortunately a we did not go to the same school together; that He would have been too much for the school. The elhonourable member for Oxley has always had trouble with sums. He once sat for an examinconation in mental arithmetic and got IVi marks out come down Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman will confine himself to the substance of the question and not make a personal attack of 18 upon another member of the House.",18
8,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member for Oxley- I hope that this does not stir him too much-ha s charged that there has been a 4 per cent cut in real prices in defence expenditure for year. That is the charge. I say it is a false The Treasurer has said that there will be one per cent real increase this year. The facts are simple, even simple enough to be understood by the honourable member for Oxley. Last year $2,182m was spent on defence. That amount was It was expressed in December 1976 prices. That amount expressed in May 1977 prices would just represent $2,320m. I hope that is clear.",18
9,Dr KLUGMAN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,Why did you pick on May?,18
10,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,Because that is the month in item which the Estimates are drawn up.,18
11,Dr KLUGMAN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,"Oh , come on!",18
12,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,Ye s it is.,18
13,Mr WILLIS,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,What index are you using?,18
14,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,"I am not using the index which honourable member uses because that would be grossly misleading. The Treasurer has stated he that $2,343m will be spent on defence this year.",18
15,Mr HURFORD,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,Are you using the implicit price deflator?,18
16,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,"Your hyphen is showing. That is a $23m increase. The sum of $23m expressed as a percentage of $2,320m is a one per cent increase. The last thing I say is this: Four of the 7Vi marks that the honourable member for Oxley got for mental arithmetic he got by accident. NA",19
17,Mr UREN,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"I preface my question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, by referring to electoral talk on 18 September in which he said: During our 21 months in office, the Government the greatest possible restraint this I believe we have now reached a responsible base. Does this statement mean that the Government is to increase government expenditure on such items as $20m for the beef industry and $100m for an unemployment relief scheme? Would such an increase in expenditure cause the deficit to increase? Would this be an indication of another reversal of government policy?",19
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"It is not surprisAmerica ing that the honourable gentleman has asked question which basically was asked and fears answered yesterday. As a result of our 20 months in office and of 20 months restraint in governtralian ment spending, we have put Australia on a reover sponsible fiscal base and brought reality back into the expenditures of the Commonwealth Government. It is interesting to note that continuously the pressure from the Opposition is the Government to get off that responsible and to spend wildly and extravagantly again, and everytimethat the Leader of the Opposition makes a speech he promises to spend more International funds. The more publicity he gets for that better we will like it because he certainly will be trusted by the people with the management of Australia's economic affairs. We have been able to reduce the deficit by half a billion dollars the second successive year and have fulfilled to major extent our election commitment to achieve a transfer of real resources from the public to the private sector. We have done this through tax indexation and tax concessions for the porate sector, and this year we have introduced the most far reaching personal tax reforms that have ever been introduced in Australia-muc more far reaching than reforms introduced in many other countries. This has been only because of restraint in expenditure, restraint in expenditure which the Opposition so detests. It detests such restraint because it wants to have control over people's lives and does not want give people the opportunity of having a greater part of their income under their own control. Obviously getting back on a responsible expenditure base makes it possible for the Government when necessary to meet the needs of industries in difficult circumstances. NA",19
19,Mr FISHER,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT,"I ask the Minister for Overseas trade whether he met Mr Otto Lang, the his Canadian Minister responsible for the Candian Wheat Board, during his visit to Australia this week. Was the question of a new international exercised wheat agreement discussed and, if so, what was in its own spending. Because of expenditure the outcome of those talks?",19
20,Mr ANTHONY,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT,"I was very fortunate to have discussions yesterday with Mr Otto Lang. It was a continuation of discussions which I had with him earlier this year on the possibility of a new international wheat agreement. As the honourable member would be aware, the present International Wheat Agreement expires next year, and as there is a substantial world build up of stocks, particularly in the United States of and Canada, and increasing stocks in a Europe and the Soviet Union there are great about the pressure being applied on the market by these stocks. Fortunately, the Aussituation is not one of anxiety. Our carry from the previous season is relatively small and we seem to be able to market our potential production at the moment. for However, the international situation will bear base heavily on prices and needs to be watched closely. So the exporting nations have been consulting together, largely under the auspices of the Wheat Council, to arrive at a new the arrangement, and there is a new concept now not being developed of quarantining reserve stocks when prices fall below a certain level and releasing these stocks when prices increase. This is a for new approach to the problem of stabilising the a world market. It involves action on stocks when the world market price indicators move across sector low and high levels between certain trigger points. These discussions have reached a fairly coradvanced stage. There will be meetings in Canada next week and in London in a few months. It is thought that it may be possible to h reconvene a full meeting between exporter and importer countries early next year in the hope of possible bringing about a new agreement. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Minister for to Defence a question. He will remember that in the Budget, defence expenditure, in nominal terms, is shown as increasing by 7.4 per cent this financial year. He will remember that the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech that this is a real increase of 1 per cent. I ask: Has the Minister seen that in answer to a subsequent question on notice the Treasurer has now said that the deflator for defence expenditure is expected to be somewhat greater than 6.4 per cent? Does this mean that real defence spending will grow by somewhat less than 1 per cent? If so, will there be any increase in real defence spending this year?",19
21,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE EXPENDITURE,"Fa r be it from me to wrestle with the problem of tutoring the honourable gendeman in the matter of economics. But in calculating implicit price deflators one takes not current prices, but out-turn figures. NA",20
22,Mr HODGMAN,OVERSEAS BORROWING PROGRAMS,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. If it becomes necessary or desirable to expand the existing government overseas borrowing program, will the Government do so?",20
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS BORROWING PROGRAMS,"The Government most certainly will do so. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Prime Minister a question on the same matter. Has he noted that the Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate yesterday asserted in response to a question without notice that overseas borrowing programs are related to the size of the deficit? Was this statement a serious error by the Minister, since overseas borrowings do not appear as part of government outlays and therefore do not contribute to the size of the deficit?",20
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS BORROWING PROGRAMS,I am sure that my colleague would have been referring to the fact that nearly every major important element of economic policy has a significant relationship to other elements. BUILDING PROJECTS: UNION NA,20
25,Mr JULL,DISRUPTION,"Is the Minister for Construction aware of reports claiming that an all State survey indicates that building projects worth $500m are in jeopardy because of union disruption? As the report was attributed to the Minister, is he prepared to table the results of the survey, indicate which projects are in jeopardy, and most importantly, advise what options are open to the Government to stop the disruption?",20
26,Mr MCLEAY,DISRUPTION,"I thank the honourable member for the question and assure him that I will be very pleased to table the survey which is supplementary to the one which was tabled in the Parliament two or three weeks ago. The survey lists the value of each project-in excess of 80 around the Commonwealth-and lists the number of peak jobs available on each project. It makes no assessment of the cost of industrial disputation. One of the reasons is that the private sector is really frightened to tell us what industrial disputation costs. I was speaking to a builder from Sydney just a few days ago and he said that he had an interrupted concrete pour which cost him $12,500. He asked me not to mention his name. In fact, he was a little concerned that I should even mention the State from which he came because builders are concerned about retaliation from unions such as the Australian Builders Labourers Federation. We have two examples which we have costed within my Department. They are Commonwealth jobs. In South Australia the value of the project was in excess of $lm and the loss to the taxpayer as a result of industrial disputationthis time by the Builders Labourers Federationwas in excess of $40,000. We have another example of this situation in Brisbane. I am not sure whether this occurred within the electorate of the honourable member for Bowman, but if not, it was quite close to it. He will know the project. I refer to the Woolloongabba Telephone Exchange. Mr Donald Cameron-In my electorate.",20
27,Mr MCLEAY,DISRUPTION,"Apparentl y it is in the electorate of Griffith. In this case the contractor went into liquidation a couple of years ago and the Department of Construction took over the project management. The estimated cost of that project was $ 10m. We have found that the additional cost to the taxpayer as a direct result of industrial disputation by the Builders Labourers Federation alone is $2m, which gives the House and the people of Australia some idea of what the activities of this union and of some others like it are costing the country. There are various options open to the Government. We could seek deregistration of the union; we could interfere in individual disputes which are affecting our own projects; or we could take direct action similar to that taken by the Victorian Government and close down all Commonwealth projects. We hope that none of these actions will be necessary, but we do hope that someone in the Builders Labourers Federation",20
28,Mr UREN,DISRUPTION,You have done a fair bit of that in your cutback in public works programs.,20
29,Mr MCLEAY,DISRUPTION,"The Deputy Leader of the Opwas position continues to interject. I wonder why does not exercise some of his influence on some of his friends in that union and the industry, let the members of the union go back to work and give the building industry an opportunity to get back on its not be necessary to take any of the actions I menmatter. The International tioned but they are the options available to us. I Agency table the report, Mr Speaker. NA",21
30,Mr KEATING,URANIUM OXIDE,"I ask the Prime Minister: the Australian Ambassador to the European Economic Community, Dr. J. W. C. Cumes, as ported in the Age, send a report to the Government stating that any attempts to sell uranium claiming oxide in Europe before 1985 would be counteratomic waste? productive? Do other reports to the Government show that the potential demand for uranium terms: oxide in the mid-1980s in Europe-whic h is the earliest market-is now down 30 per cent on the have levels expected when the Fox report was published last year? In view of these facts, does the Government expect the price of uranium oxide to fall heavily by the time Australian come into production in the early 1980s? Will the Government now reconsider its stance on uranium and allow a proper debate safeguard development against non-proliferation and waste disposal to be developed before says uranium mining is allowed to proceed?",21
31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM OXIDE,"The honourable ment.isAtathe gentleman should know that many European nology is available countries are short of power for peaceful purin geological formations poses. Many of them have power programs mines in Germany. Quite which are based on the development of nuclear national Atomic Energy Agency energy for peaceful purposes. Many of the view that they will need such power if their peaceful purposes should be held power factories are to operate and if their homes are be heated and lit. For a country such as Australia, which is rich in resources, to deny what resources to other countries would be a very Conference serious step indeed. A delegation was in this Parnational Atomic liament yesterday from a country where the need we know how long for nuclear power for peaceful purposes be very greatly and very seriously recognised. Some of the earlier estimates of the need for uranium for these purposes were to a degree over-optimistic. But having said that, there is still a need for Australian resources. When I was Europe one of the first things the countries wished to discuss with me was the position that the Government might ultimately take in relapolicies tion to the sale and supply of uranium. In discussions the Government's attitude towards safeguards and proliferation was emphasised. It also emphasised that this position would not he be weakened merely to try to gain a commercial sale. I think that is very much accepted by counget them to lay off tries overseas. The honourable gentleman has given me an feet. I hope it will opportunity terday and to make a point which came out yeswhich is very much related to this Atomic Energy does believe that technology exists for the proper disposal of wastes. In a report by Des Power from London in an AM broadcast this morning, the transcript of which is headed 'InterDid national Atomic Energy authority spokesman says technology exists for safe nuclear waste redisposal', the following question was asked: Do you think the Australian Prime Minister is right then in that there are sufficient methods of disposal of The answer from Bill Lennenann was in these Yes. Yes. I believe he is right. We certainly can say that we a technology to do this. So the program went on. It is true that at the end of it the spokesman for the International Atomic mines Energy Agency made a point when he was asked: Is it proven? Is it 100 per cent? Can you be absolutely certain? Very honestly and very andtimefor bluntly Bill Lennenann said: Nobody can say something 100 per cent. Any man who something is sure for 100 per cent is ridiculous. Life is not like that. That very plain, straight and honest statesame time he affirmed that the techand that the disposal of waste has been tried in salt clearly the Interdoes not believe them hold that the development of nuclear up for while to further woTk is done in relation to the matter of waste. If the Leader of the Opposition meant he said on the television program Monday he would take the word of the InterEnergy Agency. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition would will stick with his view. NA",21
32,Mr MCVEIGH,UNITED NATIONS,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: What is the value of Australia's remainin ing a member of the United Nations in view of that body's apparent alignment with the communist world? What can Australia do to resist of the United Nations moulded by what those a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Scali, described as the 'tyranny of the majority' which threatens the right of the individual country by acting to appease the communist bloc? Would Australia's financial contribution to the United Nations be better spent in overcoming poverty right here in Australia?  surprise to the honourable member if I answered in terms which indicated that Austraha remains firmly committed to membership of the United Nations and to the purposes and the principles of the United Nauons as spelt out in its charter. I detected in correspondence to newspapers thoughts that would be akin to the message within the question that the honourable member poses. Quite frankly, I would like to take the opportunity of putting those sorts of thoughts down. The importance and the value of the United Nations derives from its comprehensiveness. It is the only international meeting place at which virtually all countries are represented. Despite its imperfections-and there is no doubt that those exist-it s comprehensiveness ensures its indispensabihty. The growth and the change in the United Nations over the years have reflected, for better or for worse, the growth and the change that have occurred in the world. Beyond that, the United Nations provides Australia's only means at the present moment of consistent and ready contact with close on half the countries of the world. In terms of the need for access, the United Nations is of great benefit to us and to other countries. It is important, I believe, that Australia works to ensure that the United Nations authority and effectiveness is improved. The results of debate will not always please everybody within the General Assembly or the Security Council. However, I believe that the need for debate is generally recognised. It is not always possible for Australia's views to be fully reflected in the United Nations decisions, but that is not something from which we should run away. Decisions are taken by a majority, and in many instances there is a ready made majority. I would hesitate to describe that, as is implicit in the question, as something that is always at the disposal of the communist countries. The numbers in the United Nations point rather to Third World or developing country predominance. But whatever the nature of the majority, the rights of the individual members remain protected by the charter's emphasis on individual national sovereignty. We have before us at the moment a matter which I referred yesterday and which might call that aspect into question. But only in very special Security Council cases are the United Nations decisions binding on member States. However, they are binding on occasions. In the Security Council there is a further protection of the veto power which may be exercised by the United States of America, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom and China. Finally, just before I sum up, I shall deal with the last part of the honourable senator's question which related to Australia's contribution to the United Nations. That is, after all, an international obligation which I belive Austraha should continue to accept. There is also the consideration that much of the contribution is in the form of assistance to developing countries, and the work of United Nations agencies is indispensable and is well known. So frustration and annoyance should neither blind us tc the effectiveness of the United Nations nor lead us to a conclusion that we should cease to belong to it morally, intellectually, politically, strategically, realistically- I will run out of adverbs soon; someone will have to supply me with a copy of Roget in a moment. It would be an act of utter folly to subscribe to thoughts which are based on all forms of misconception which primarily, it seems to me, are motivated by short term emotional issues either of frustration or annoyance. URANIUM: NUCLEAR WEAPONS",21
33,Mr UREN,UNITED NATIONS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In reply to the honourable member for Blaxland, he said that our uranium will be used for peaceful purposes. I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware of the third recommendation of thefirstFox report which states: The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. Would the Prime Minister agree that our uranium could be used for the spread of nuclear weapons and that there are no known adequate safeguards available in the world against the spread of nuclear weapons?",22
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNITED NATIONS,"Other parts of the Fox reports also state that one of the main elements in the Australian Government's decision should be the result that will flow from that decision in relation to nuclear proliferation. I think it is well known and accepted that the safeguards that this Government has announced are as tight as or tighter than those accepted by any-other country in the world. It has also been announced to that we will be consulting other supplier or potential supplier countries to put ourselves in the position of supplier countries reinforcing each other if there were any breach or if were thought to be a breach detected in relation to these matters. If Australia had made a decision not to export, [uite clearly Australia's influence in the world ! brums on these matters would have been nil. We would have no voice to strengthen safeappointed guards. There are some plain facts of life that honourable gentleman seems utterly unable comprehend. The nuclear power industry peaceful purposes does exist. There will be increasing moves towards the introduction of clear power for peaceful purposes. If Australia does not supply, the cost of fuel will Australia does not supply, certainly a voice for sense and sanity against proliferation of nuclear weapons would be removed from world forums. If that is the result that the honourable gentlesed man really wants, it is certainly a very odd indeed. Many parts of the Fox reports indicated that dence given the hazards associated with various aspects of Energy the operations were not such as to cause mitteeby Australia to make a decision not to mine or waste export uranium. The report made it plain that carrying out of disposal the decision was to export now or at a future has not been attempted because time, but the main elements should be decided on the basis of the judgment made in relation to economic proliferation. The Government has made that he notedin the judgment and has made its reasons plain. Indeed occasion there was even momentarily support from the not Leader of the Opposition, because on Monday keepnow Conference he made it perfectly plain that he beworld and lieved the one outstanding issue was the issue of staff levels has waste.

In respect that evidence what steps Atomic Energy overses to an ad",23
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"The honourable can be assured that the Atomic Enmaintains very close liaison on the matters under discussion by the House and is as well informed as it is possible to be. The Leader of the Opposition manages to confuse the question of nuclear waste disposal on a number of issues. He has ignored the difference between level liquid waste from reprocessing plants and the solid spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power reactors and also the difference between commercial nuclear wastes and military wastes. There is a great deal of difference. Military wastes are different in both composition and, oborigin. They are not related to the use of uranium to produce electricity in commercial nuand clear power stations. There nave been practical demonstrations of high level waste management arising from reprocessing of spent commercial nuclear fuel. For ultimate waste disposal cess comprises two steps: Firstly the solidification and vitrification of the liquid wastes arising reprocessing of spent nuclear power station and secondly disposal of the vitrified deep geological formations. Vitrification technology is being practised in gentleman France and the United Kingdom. This is the point that the Leader of the Opposition seeks constantly to deny. The French plant presently operating had produced by 1973 12 tonnes of glass corresponding to the reprocessing tonnes of natural uranium gas reactor fuel. say that this plant is not commercial belies the fact that its capacity is SO per cent French commercial plant planned to commence operation this year. In other words, it is a very large experiment operating at SO per cent of level of the planned commercial plant. I would have thought that would demonstrate very interest clearly the statements of the Atomic Energy Commission that the technology does exist, that it is applied, and that it has operated on a trial basis but on a very large trial basis indeed. The practicality of geological disposal of has been demonstrated in the salt mines in many where medium level wastes are currently being disposed of. Research programs are well hand in the United States of America and Europe for the identification of high level waste disposal sites in suitable deep geological formaSpecial tions. The critical point that comes from this analysis is the fact that the trial plant in France operating at 50 per cent of the capacity of the planned commercial plant. Therefore this is merely some small laboratory experiment; it is very major operation and one that has demonover strated the techniques very plainly. I am sure the point being made by the Atomic Energy Commission is well known: There has not been a move from the trial plants to commercial plants before thistimebecause the amount of waste to be disposed of in this way had not required it-and there is no other reason than that.

55,Mr ANTHONY,COMMITTEE,"The interim report on energy conservation prepared by the National Energy Advisory Committee which I have just presented represents a significant step in the funher development of a national energy policy for Austraha. The Government is actively moving on this and a number of other fronts to formulate a comprehensive policy, which I believe is a task of great urgency. In recent years, I have been increasingly concerned about various aspects of Australia's energy usage, in particular our growing dependence on oil for virtually all our transport and a significant proportion of the energy used in industry, agriculture and commerce. For this reason, I proposed energy conservation as a priority area of study at the Committee's inaugural meeting in February this year. The Government particularly values the opportunity to receive the independent advice that the establishment of this high level body has provided. The interim report contains the Committee's proposals for conservation of energy. These have been framed to create in the first instance munity consciousness of the uncertainties of our energy future and a common will to exercise resAustralia's traint in energy consumption, especially oil. ensuing changes in community habits and pracbeen tices will, of course, taketime.The Committee has assessed the major uncertainties for fact Austraha's future energy supply as the availand ability and price of oil. The interim report fore recommends that a national program should be undertaken to conserve energy, especially oil. The commissioning of the Committee to ergy conservation. report on energy conservation is one of two major Government initiatives in this area since received preliminary advice from the Committee last April. That advice followed President Carter's energy statement which judged that world oil demand would overhaul supply within 10 years. The Committee emphasised the tained prospect of increasing dependence on imports and stressed that conservation measures would depend heavily upon incentives through the price mechanism. The Government's other inihensive tiative-o n crude oil pricing-announce d on August 1977 will provide the necessary basis these incentives to operate. The present interim report recommends measures for thefirststage of a national energy conservation program. The measures are those which the Committee believes are appropriate Australia's need and could be introduced in the short term. The Government will give them its close consideration. Many of the recommendations concern areas where the States have the primary governmental responsibility. In some cases State authorities are already active in these areas. These recommendations accordingly call for close co-operation between the Commonwealth and State governments. To that end I propose to have consultations with the State Ministers responsible for energy as soon as practicable. The interim report lists some other measures which give promise of substantial energy savings, especially in the long term. These are complex matters which impinge on various economic and social aspects of community life and require further close study. The Committee accordingly is continuing to investigate them in consultation with interested public and private bodies and will report to me as it reaches conclusions on these matters. I move: That the House take note of the paper.",26
56,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEE,"The report on conservation of energy in Australia is a welcome document. It is thefirstpositive contribua comtion by the National Energy Advisory Committee that has addressed itself to the problem of looming liquid fuel deficiency. One The can only comment that the Government, having elected for just on two years, rather than just tabling documents of this nature should in be giving full expression to a national fuel energy policy. However the Advisory Comtheremittee in the report has outlined a number of proposals describing a policy for the conservation of liquid fuels in Australia and the establishment of a national publicity campaign on enII point out to the House that the Australian Labor Party is the only national political party in Australia which has a comprehensive fuel and energy policy. Many of the proposals mentioned in the Advisory Committee's report are conin similar form in the Australian Labor Party's Federal Conference Platform documents adopted at Perth last July. The Opposition sees a great urgency for the formulation of a comprefuel and energy policy to overcome the 16 problems that a dependence upon oil supplying for countries may bring to Australia. The report requires study and comment at length and, of course, this should be done in the context of a eight parliamentary debate. The Minister for National Resources (Mr to Anthony) has been kind enough to move 'that the House take note of the paper' and such a debate will ensue on another day. I seek leave of the House to continue my remarks on this debate at that time. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",26
57,Mr SPEAKER,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure and refusal of the Government to provide for the disclosure of the amount and nature of assistance given by corporations and individuals to political parties and candidates. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",27
58,Mr YOUNG,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"The views of the Opposition on this question and the views of the Labor Party throughout Australia are well known. We believe in very rapid reform of the laws regulating donations to political parties and candidates and the ceilings that should be placed on expenditure by political parties on all political campaigns throughout Austraha but specifically to the area where we, as members of the national Parliament, are responsible, namely Federal elections. On 17 August this year Senator Cavanagh, speaking in the Senate, asked Senator Withers, the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources: Why does the Deputy Prime Minister now believe it is possible that the National Country Party received funds from the Central Intelligence Agency? The reply to that question was as follows: No political party can give a categorical denial that received funds from a particular source. In the interview referred to, I used the words 'it is possible' because it is impossible to say that it is impossible. That was the reply from the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is well known as a person who does a great deal of fund raising for his Party yet he goes on record in this Parliament as saying that he has no idea of the sources of the funds used by the National Country Party in elections in this country. In the last week a new element entered the funding of political parties in this country with the report, not yet denied, that the Uranium Forum spokesman, Mr Mackay, visited the headquarters of the Liberal Party and spoke to the Liberal Party director about the availability of funds from the Uranium Producers Forum to the Liberal Party at any future elections at which uranium is an issue. President Nixon was engaged in the Watergate cover-up; this Government is now involving itself m a uranium cover-up. Whilst the Government's spokesmen stand in this Parliament and outside and say that they have given very serious consideration to the question of uranium, it now comes to light that the basis of that consideration is the extent to which the Uranium Producers Forum is going to donate to the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party continuallyfightsagainst any reform in this area. On a number of occasions, when we were in government and since we have been in opposition, we have introduced Bills into this House to bring about the reform required and place a ceiling on the expenditure, andfinallyasking that a joint committee be set up to investigate the funding of political parties and candidates, as has been done in most other advanced Western countries. In respect of every one of the points that we have put to this Parliament, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have said it is not necessary. In order to have an insight into what might be going on in Australia. I want to take the Parliament through some of the lessons of other countries to see the corruption that has been practised. The public of this country are being denied knowledge of what is going on in Australia because of the refusal of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party to open up this matter of donations to political parties. The people of Austraha are entitled to know who makes donations to political parties. They are entitled to know who makes donations to candidates. While these things remain in confidence, in secret, and no one is able to ascertain accurately who is makit has ing the donations, political parties and candidates are going to be continually accused of working for special interests. Here we have the classic example of the Uranium Producers Forum going to the Liberal Party. Is the decision of the Liberal and National Country parties on uranium based on the fact that a substantial financial donation will be made to their campaign funds? Are the Liberal and National Country parties ashamed or afraid to admit that they are to get funds from the Uranium Producers Forum tofightthe next election? This allegation has not yet been denied. The Australian people are entitled to know. If the forecasts of the amount of money that will be made from uranium mining in this country are accurate then the size of the cheque which the Uranium Producers Forum could give to the Liberal and National Country parties is unlimited. It could underwrite their entire campaign and no one in Australia would know about it. We have seen since the 1975 election campaign the enormous escalation of spending in this area. So the Uranium Producers Forum coming to the party is of national interest to everybody, and it is a national scandal to those of us who say that there ought to be reform of these laws. Throughout the Western world, in Sweden, Germany, Great Britain and the United States of America, laws are being reformed in relation to the election of candidates to the various houses of parliament and in the case of the United States to the Congress. People are saying that a limit has to be put on the amount of money that can be spent in campaigns; a limit has to be placed on individual donations. Let us look at some of the things that have occurred, that could occur here and that perhaps have occurred here but about which we are unaware. Let us go through the Nixon episode in the United States which was one of the reasons for the Congress of the United States giving such special attention to the reform of these laws this year. In 1972 a number dals were exposed in relation to donations made to the Nixon Administration for its campaign. There was a new term used during that campaign which undoubtedly people in Australia could adopt, and that was the 'laundry of election donations'. American Airlines sent its money from a bank in the United States to the Lebanon, back to another bank in the United States and then on to the campaign committee for President Nixon. That was exposed, the company was prosecuted and fined. The dairy industry in the United States made a contribution of $2m to the Nixon campaign in 1972. A fortnight later Nixon increased the subsidy to the dairy industry, which meant that consumers and taxpayers had to pay an additional $300m to the dairy industry. Obviously Nixon had made his decision against the best advice from the United States Department of Agriculture in favour of a lobby which had made a $2m donation to his campaign funds. Many of the donations for the campaign came from the Philippines, and the same year President Nixon doubled the quota of sugar that was to flow from there to the United States. So decisions can be made for special interests where people are making political donations. How much of this Government's uranium decision is based on the fact that thousands and thousands of dollars will come from uranium companies into the Liberal and National Country parties coffers? The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said: made a decision-it is a deliberate courageous decision-that we should adopt world parity for crude oil'. We have seen figures produced from both sides of the House to indicate that EssoBHP will perhaps be advantaged to the extent of SlOOm as a result of that decision. Does EssoBHP donate to the Liberal and National Country parties, and if it does how much does it donate?",27
59,Mr BAILLIEU,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,No.,28
60,Mr YOUNG,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"The brainchild of the establishment says no. No one has told him anything since his dummy was taken away. The fact is that no one knows so we all are suspicious of it. I quite frankly believe it. If Esso-BHP is going to make SlOOm out of the decision of the Government why does the Government not bring about the reform that is necessary in this country so that we know where all the donations are coming from and so that all the companies that are making donations to the Liberal and National Country Parties are exposed for all to see? But the Government will not do it because it is carrying on in exactly the same way as Nixon carried on, and that led to the Watergate affair. There was of scan- money from the Philippines, money from American Airlines and money from all over the world to consolidate the position of the then United States Administration. However, the governmentfinallyfalls, the folly of the government is eventually exposed and reform is brought about as has happened in most other countries. Let us look at what happened in the United States and the number of companies that were prosecuted in 1973-74. Let us consider how they pleaded when they were exposed for the donations that they had made to the various political parties in that country so that we can understand simply why President Carter is moving so quickly in 1977 to bring about the necessary reform before the next presidential election. We should not forget that the last presidential election had very strict laws on expenditure and there have been investigations m the United States into the amount of donations made and the amount of money spent in the campaign. America was rocked, just as the Australians of the future will be rocked, to find household names, the names of all the major reputable companies, brought into the courts. They all pleaded guilty to having broken the laws of the United States in relation to political donations. In one way or another they all had tried to hide it and say: 'We did not do it'. But afterwards they pleaded guilty in the courts of America. 'We American Airlines pleaded guilty on 17 October 1973. The American Ship Building company pleaded guilty in 1974. Ashland Petroleum Gabon Inc. pleaded guilty. Associated Milk Producers Inc. pleaded guilty. Braniff Airways pleaded guilty. The Carnation Company pleaded guilty. Diamond International Corporation pleaded guilty. Ray Dubrowin, the Vice President of the Greyhound Corporation, pleaded guilty. The Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company pleaded guilty. HMS Electric Corporation pleaded guilty. The LBC and W architecture firm pleaded guilty. National Bi-Products Inc. and the Northrop Corporation both pleaded guilty. I could go on for pages. This is the sort thing that will occur here unless the companies wake up to themselves. I keep asking the question, and perhaps the Minister who is to reply in the debate can tell us: Why do the Liberal and National Country parties refuse to face up to what is happening in the rest of the world? Why do we not say that there will be a limit upon the amount of money spent by political parties? Is it because there are interest groups at work in this country? We all will be suspected of acting on behalf of interest groups until this information is out in the open. The only way in which the Labor, Liberal or National Country Parties are going to be elected on their merits is when everybody in Australia knows what money they are receiving and where it is coming from. If the Government parties accept the money which has been offered to them by the Uranium Producers Forum- I believe it has been offered to them, and what has been printed in the newspapers has not been denied-the y will be guilty of acting in a sectional way. If they have accepted money from Esso-BHP again they are guilty of this act and so are the companies because they do not confer with their shareholders about where the money ought to go. Let us look at the make-up in the United States of the sectional interest donations because the pattern of donations in the United States and here differs only in size. It does not differ in respect of the type of sectional interests from where the money comes. In the 1976 elections the major interest group contributors and their contributions were as follows: American Medical profession, $ 1.79m; dairy committees, $ 1.36m; labour unions, $lm; maritime-related unions, $900,000; auto workers, $800,000; coal, oil and natural gas interests, $800,000; National Association of Realtors, $600,000; financial institutions, $500,000; and American dental associations, $400,000. If the Americans at last have adopted a system under which all donations have to be disclosed, where is the case for Australia continuing to put its head in the sand and saying: 'We are not going to do it'. Will someone on the other side of the House please tell us why the Government cannot be honest enough to disclose to the people of Australia whose money it is using to get back into office? We saw at the last election in 1975 millions of dollars being paid into the Liberal Party. There was so much money that the Party could not use it all on the campaign. Subsequently the Party has used it to buy buildings, land and such things. It could not use the money given to it in 1975. Where did the money which of was given to the Liberal and National Country parties come from? On this occasion the situation is worse because in the national Parliament we are debating a resources tax. My colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) will explain that tax in a few minutes. Honourable members on the Government side will go to the mining and oil interests and say: 'We are not going to have a resources tax like the Australian Labor Party. If you are going to make political donations you ought to make them to us because we will save you millions of dollars'. That is what Government supporters are saying to the uranium producers to Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and Esso Exploration, to Mount Isa Mines Ltd and as they have said in the past to the Bank of New South Wales. All these accusations can be made because the Government refuses to adopt any reform in relation to these laws.",28

62,Mr BOURCHIER,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES," Mr Deputy Speaker, before entering into a debate on this matter of public importance I draw your attention to the comments made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) last night during the adjournment debate. He highlighted the problem facing the Parliament at the moment in relation to matters of public importance. Today the Party concerned has introduced yet another matter of non-public importance. The matter was so well supported and considered to be of such a magnitude of importance that we find five members of the Australian Labor Party in the House to listen to the debate. I think the comments of the honourable member for Mackellar are very apt and should be considered by the Chair. {Quorum formed). It is a pity that the Labor Party has to call a quorum when a matter of public importance introduced by one of its members is being discussed. That indicates the interest of members of the Labor Party in the business at hand. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) calls for the revealing of the source of funds and suggests a ceiling on funds and on. He, like other members of the Australian Labor Party, has the fond idea that money buys everything and that money wins everything. The honourable members overlook the important factor facing the people of Austraha which is they have the right to vote on performance. That is why we are in government and that is why we will stay here. The honourable member stood and for nearly the whole 15 minutes of his he talked about what is happening in the United States. He forgets a very important factor. is not compulsory over there. There is no comWhitlam) parison with the system operating in this country. I shall answer why we will not introduce the type of system which he is looking for. The eral and National Country Parties believe in freedom in Australia. That freedom dom for people to vote as they wish without of penalty or sanction. But the Labor Party proposals would deny that freedom. They would deny to people therightprivately to support party of their choice. People would be looking over their shoulders to ascertain who had money and who had donated to which party. I can turfed imagine what would happen on the shop floor responsible when it was known that a member of a trade union had made a donation to the Liberal Party. He would probably be banned from work. The union would probably impose a black ban. It would mean nothing but political persecution of the worse order. We have listened to the honourable member for Port Adelaide talk about the great idea he has for divulging funds and talk about what should do now. What happened during the three years the Labor Party was in office? Why did not bring up this subject then? Why did it not vulge all the secrets? What about all the funds from the Khemlani loans affair? Let us hear what the Labor Party was going to do with that $4,000m. Then, a little later on, we had the breakfast at Tiffany's show. Let us talk about that. I know the honourable member for Port Adelaide was hopeful that I would introduce subject because it further highlights the deficienaccede cies of his temporary leader. On 4 May 1976 a notice of motion was States, introduced by the honourable member for The Mackellar. When addressing himself to it during a later debate he was so harrassed by honourable members opposite who did not want to hear the truth that the debate was effectively gagged. But the truth came out. A statement was signed by Mr Fischer of Sydney which quite clearly indiThe cated the events which occurred back December 1975, which occurred after the around so Whidam Government was dismissed from office and events which involved Mr Hartley, that elegant left wing member of the Labor Party. The events did not involve Bob Hawke, the President of the Labor Party but that lefty trendy Mr that Hartley who associated with the Arabs and who decided, with Mr David Combe, that it would be a good idea to arrange a Uttle sneaky loan, something of the order of $2m. This loan was to come speech from the Arab nation of Iraq. It was then organised for representatives of that country to Voting meet the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. and discuss exactly what was required. The Leader of the Opposition arranged a meeting through the agency of Mr Fischer and letters Libfrom Mr Hartley and Mr Combe. So the Leader of the Opposition was to meet delegates from means freeIraq on a Tuesday. fear Mr CLYDE CAMERON - Can you prove that?",29
63,Mr BOURCHIER,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"We have a signed statement. It has been published. I know why the the honourable member who interjected wants to know that. He wants to refresh everybody's mind how true it is because, after all, he was out of office by his leader who was really for this matter. So do not let us have any false ideas as to why this matter of public importance has been introduced. It has been introduced simply to tip yet another bucket over the Leader of the Opposition. I am sorry that I have to be the bearer of the sad tidings. But let us go back to those eventful couple of days. A meeting was arranged with the Leader of the Opposition for breakfast at 8 o'clock where a large we white package was handed over to the Leader of the Opposition in front of witnesses by the Iraqi it representatives. Nobody from the Labor Party dihas yet disclosed what was in the white package. The Labor Party claims that it never received the funds. Perhaps it ought to run an audit on where the money went or what happened to it. But the deal was made on the basis that the Labor Party, in return for this service, would in the future follow a more even-handed policy towards the the Arab nations. The Labor Party also agreed to to a request from the Iraqi Government to divulge special information about what was going on in the Middle East between the United Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt and Jordan. Labor Party was also asked to give an assurance that Mr Hawke would not become Leader of an Australian Labor Party government. What a deal to enter into! No wonder Mr a Hawke was not asked to attend that breakfast. money, $2m, was raised- I do not think the in honourable member for Port Adelaide was at the time-for the specific purpose of running an election campaign. Yet the honourUnion able member has the hide and audacity to stand in the House and talk about the rights and wrongs of raising funds from some corporations. If there were any truth in what he is sayingdid, there is not a shadow of truth in it-at least they would be Australian companies which would be involved in Australian political parties. We should not forget that in 1972 a number of Ausand tralian corporations provided funds for the est Labor Party which would not want that informaplace. tion disclosed. Mind you, those corporations gave something to the Liberal Party. But the Labor Party would not want to be in that situlast ation. Mr Whitlam, the present Leader of the Opposition, at thetimeof receiving this white encerning velope at that notorious breakfast, went on to paigns, after say: I want to thank you very much for this generous help, am afraid that due to election pressures I must now cause I have an appointment am only sorry that I cannot talk to you more. If could have stayed in Australia. I could have talked longer but I must go. I sincerely hope to see you Baghdad . . . I do not know whether he was going there on magic carpet, or how he was going there; the message does not go on to explain. But we have this complete signed statement. Honoursition able members opposite might included in Hansard. I seek leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, to incorporate this statement in HanPress sard. I am sure that the honourable member Port Adelaide or one of the other gentlemen on the other side of the House will agree to that incorporation.",30

67,Mr BOURCHIER,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"Leave is not granted. The Honourable members opposite know that this statement is factual. When the Labor Party is opposition it talks about funds. The honourable member for Port Adelaide talks about funds so nicely with his tongue in his cheek. On the hand he says that they do not want funds, while on the other hand he has a hand in the pockets corporations and unions and stands over were businesses to get the money in any way he ibly can.",31

Let us hear about that. That union provided $25,000 to the Labor Party on the basis that if the Labor Party gained power, which it no action would be taken against the unions under the existing arbitration rules and regulations. The honourable member for Port Adelaide stands in this House and talks about wheeling dealing. Members of his Party are the greatwheelers and dealers ever to have entered this also Let me remind the honourable member about a little booklet and a letter which were sent out year. Sometimeago, after the honourable member for Port Adelaide introduced a Bill conthe Umiting of funds for election camhe had talked about imposing a ceding on funding for political parties, after saybut I ing that there should not be any secrecy and that leave beindustries should not provide funds for political with the television station and I only you parties, the honourable member's Party sent to you throughout the country a letter seeking funds in from corporations. It employed a consultant, a Mr Charles Wright. His job was to approach a business to seek funds. The booklet included with the letter contained comments taken from do speeches made by the now Leader of the Oppo(Mr E. G. Whitlam). One of the gems of want it to be those comments was: I think you will find that whatever our opponents or the may say, my Party is well aware of the business comfor munity and sympathetic to them. After three years in government they had the gaU to say that they had respect for the business community. The comment continued: has always seen the need for a healthy private sectorThat is another joke; it must have been in the joke book of the year. The comment went on: in harmony with democratic governments and an enlightened trade union movement. last part of the comment is probably the only true remark in it. The Labor Party wants to talk in about the disclosure of campaign funds-abou t assistance given by corporations and individuals - and raises it as a matter of pubUc importance. I one again refer back to 1972 when the Labor Party harassed its members. In 1974 and 1975, how of many members of the trade union movement forced to subscribe extra money to assist the possLabor Party in its campaign funds? The shop stewards stood at the pay counter window as the workers came out and said: 'Rightoh, you put in All this has been quoted and never dego. Why do nied by the Labor Party. The Labor Party itself reUes a lot on the funds it receives from the trade union movement. Everyfinancialmember of the trade union movement is subscribing to the Labor Party, whether he votes for that Party or not. The Opposition speakers talk about democracy, about reasonable attitudes towards party funds and about raising funds in a proper and respectathat ble manner. There is no way in the world that Opposition has any wish to provide a proper tem of organising funds; Its members are only bleating now because they are in Opposition. I repeat what I said earlier, namely, that funds are not the be all and end all of politics. There is expenses also performance. It is a pity that does not start to perform. It is a pity that it does United States of America. not come out with some coherent and decent present Liberal-National Country policies that might encourage people to vote for alition defeated that legislation in the it. While its members carry on in the negative although it passed through the House way in which they are behaving at the momentRepresentatives. including the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), who is attempting to interject-it will not matter whether it has all the their funds in the world; it will never make office. They should start to wake up to the name of game, that is, performance. They have not perimperative, formed since they went into office in 1972. Ever since for them it has been a dismal downhill run of failure. They are only continuing that now. am sorry to say that the Government cannot E ort any of the propositions put forward by onourable member for Port Adelaide. I am that is much to his surprise!",31

75,Mr KEATING,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"I rise to support the terms the matter of public importance proposed today by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and to restate the very important principle contained in it: The failure andrefusalof the Government to provide the disclosure of the amount and nature of assistance by corporations and individuals to political parties and candidates. What is requested is a full disclosure of campaign contributions to major political parties by way of a change to the Electoral Act. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), quite improperly implied when we in the Labor Party when in govern the ment did nothing about this particular issue. In sysfact, we made three attempts, by way of a new piece of legislation, to provide for the declaration of contributions to campaign funds for major political parties and for a limitation of election so that, the whole election campaign the Opposition of hand, as process and political we have in Australia did not get out seen happening in the But of course the Party coSenate, of The Government supporters are not prepared now to disclose the source of future campaign funds in 1974 and 1975 or in a election. the We on this side of the House believe it is if clear honesty and integrity are to return to Australian pontics, that campaign contributions should be made pubUc so that the pubI lic know what influences Dear upon the policy supmaking functions of a pohtical party. Take for the instance the number of decisions which this sure Government has made in the past few months which affect just a handful of companies in such a way as to return to those companies huge amounts of money. It is reasonable for people on this side of the House and for the pubUc to assume that these companies will make substancontributions to the funds of the Liberal and Mackellar National Country parties.",32
76,Dr KLUGMAN,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,They have previously.,32
77,Mr KEATING,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"They have previously and they will again. The investment allowance, involving $800m, was restored as soon as the the Government came to office. Last week the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) came into the with a special statement indicating that the North-West Shelf producers-that is, Essohas BHP, Cal-Asiatic and BP-would be given the benefits of a two-year extension of the investof ment allowance. As well as that, it was stated that there would be deductability for subscriptions to mining compames, that is, that compames within those groups which wanted to subscribe moneys to companies which were subsidiaries of those companies which were explorfor ing for oil and gas would be given deductions for given those subscriptions. This means an enormous amount of money to this particular project and to those particular companies. Does any honourindustry able member suggest that if Tony Eggleton or anyone else in the Liberal Party, the Prime ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), or the Minister for National Resources, were to ring these comtry. panies and seek a contribution for campaign funds they would be refused? Of course they would not. Of course, the magnitude of these benefits are such that the funding from these companies would be massive. To take a more disgraceful example, let us funds. look at the coal export duty levy. That levy was imposed by the Labor Government on coking but coal produced and certain grades of steaming the coal. In its first year of operation If the extent of the levy had not been interfered coal industry when with, this year it would have raised $160m. Theoil levy was cynically phased out by the Governindustry? Clearly the reason ment so that in thefirstyear of the phase out, industry is the single most lucrative with a drop of $1.50 per ton on the $6 a ton levy, campaign funds for their parties. They the companies concerned made a bonus of be $33m. One company alone, Utah, made $ 17.5m out of that one measure in thatfirstyear and this year will make about $20m out of it. So in two and years Australia's most profitable company has made $3 7m expressly as a result of a government decision. Is anyone on the opposite side of the House suggesting that that company will respond in kind to the coffers of the Liberaluranium National Country Parties during an election campaign? Of course it will. When one considers that a compaign can be run on $5m or $6m, it reasonable to assume that these companies will fund virtually the whole campaign. Let us take another express decision of Government. I refer to the decision to increase the price of indigenous crude oil. As a result that decision the consuming public will pay $150m to a handful of oil producing companies in Austraha. The major one, Esso-BHP which operating in Bass Strait, will receive $109m the $150m. Sure, it pays tax on $109m, but residual after tax is $53m. Are honourable bers opposite suggesting that that company not pay some of the $53m over to their party funds? Of course it will. That is why it buy you any time it wants a change in policy. You are up for sale. You are up for grabs and buys you with regularity. That is what we are complaining about; you are making decisions based on motives other than those which pressly concerned with the national interest. You always consider your own interests. We have talked in this place about the resources tax. Why has the Government all of sudden said: 'Yes, we are considering a resources tax on the oil industry and maybe but definitely not the coal industry'. The coal industry is the most profitable single indusMintry in Australia. The largest number of high flying companies is to be found in the coal indusThey are the ones which have shown enormous increases in the rate of profitability. I am not talking about a modest rate of profitability on large investment funds but about huge rates of profit. The North Queensland coal producers are earning about 38 per cent interest on invested They can afford to pay and pay well. The Government intends to introduce a resources tax, you are going to exempt this industry from tax. On what basis is the Treasurer (Mr it raised $ 112m. Lynch) Prime and the Prime Minister and the Deputy Minister (Mr Anthony) exempting the they are prepared to tax the production industry and the future uranium is that the coal source of ought to ashamed of that situation being maintained. But worse than that is the fact that you hide it public are not prepared to make a disclosure to the of your real interest in these matters. You had a hide to bring in a statement on not uranium. The Fox Commission said that should be developed on a sequential basis. The Commission has the good sense to know that there was no real market for uranium, is that two uranium mines in Australia spewing out 3,000 tons of produce a year onto the world market would depress prices and destroy what was already a fragile market. Just today mention was the made at questiontimeabout your own representative to the European Economic Community of saying that the demand of the European Economic Community for uranium had fallen. Why then did you reject the proposals of the Fox is Commission for the development of uranium on of a sequential basis simply because you want Panthe continental to have access to Australian memuranium? You want that company, which has a will paid up capital of $400,000is able to Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order! I do not want to interrupt the honourable it member.

Just last week a photograph of Mr Eggleton appeared on the front page of the Australian Financial Review. The ensuing article was headed: 'Uranium Producers Offer to the Government: Another Resource Tax Lobby quite Push'. Mr Mackay, the Chairman of the Uranium Producers Forum, had the gall to sugexamples gest to a journalist at lunch at The Lobby posite this House that he was going to meet Secretary of the Liberal Party to see in what his organisation could offer the Liberal Party the National Country Party assistance during election campaign. What kind of assistance honourable members think that give them? Will it be badges or stickers? It will give them money. It will give them the wherewithal to fight a political campaign in Australia. But Government supporters chide us on this side of the House by saying that the unions make conmakes tributions to our campaign funds. Yes, they do, but such contributions are generally made public on television. The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union made its contribution on television. Honourable members opposite can inspect balance sheet of that union to see the contribulearn tions that are made. But try to inspect the of Utah or Esso or any of the other companies; no mention will be made of campaign contribubacks. tions. They will all be buried under current penses.

82,Mr CORBETT,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"The philosophy honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) v seems to have an obsession with companies that make a profit. The word 'obsession' seems to the in word today. The honourable member Port Adelaide (Mr Young) also has an obsession about public declarations being made in funds which are given to political parties. The for present system has served Austraha well over the and it will continue to serve it well. The red herrings that members of the Labor Party want to draw across the trail indicate only that they have on anything worthwhile in the way of a which they can base a criticism of the They must bring on for debate as that which the honourable for Port Adelaide has been rehashing years on end. He has never gained any benefit It from it, and he never will. So they never learn. He has raised today as a matter of public It importance the matter of assistance given by corporations and individuals to political parties and candidates. He has done so not really so that the Parliament and the people of Australia will benefit from that knowledge but so that the Labor Party can look into its own affairs, because it has been excluded from receiving such funds often. The loans affair and the commissions attached to the loans affair were pretty good of that. Perhaps the Labor Party might opbe better employed on looking at the questions the of where the commissions on those loans way intended to go. Was the Labor Party going to and benefit from them or were individuals going to an benefit? Where were the commissions intended do to go? That is the sort of matter that might be organisation will worth ventilating. The sort of proposal contained in this matter of public importance has been raised before. It it very clear to Australians that the Labor Party is determined to destroy people's privacy. That is what it wants to do. Eventually it wants to turn Australia into a one party country. That is the Labor Party's aim. If this proposition were the accepted members of the Labor Party would some of the things that go on inside thenbooks own Party. They would know of the commitments their own people are making behind their So one probably can understand why they exwould want such a proposal introduced. The Labor Party has harped constandy on this issue, not I have mentioned. It suggests to me that an honest move but that it is aimed at providing a means for revenge. The sort of contained in this matter of public importance was rejected overwhelmingly by the Australian people because it is a proposal which be was put forward before the last elections. The for people had an opportunity to decide whether they wanted a Labor government with the sort of relation proposal which it espouses today. I say to those members of the Labor Party who have spoken in this debate that as a senior memthan ber of the Australian Country Party, as it used be known in Queensland for many years, I know only too well that thefinancesraised for our tively Party have been gathered by means of comparado tively small donations, by party branches in elecany torates making small levies and by the running of functions. It is from those sources that the part of our funds come, if honourable members opposite want to know. I know that from perpeople sonal experience, and honourable members opthe posite cannot deny it. They are only guessing when they suggest that our funds come from political multinational corporations and all the other people that they label. It is a guess that they making. They hope that they will licity from that guess. They have been rejected already by the Australian people. If the Opposition wants a little further inforproposal. mation on that matter, in my electorate of by Maranoa money for electoral purposes has always been obtained from inside the electorate. Money has been given to our head office as well. There are no multinational corporations in that area. This statement applies to practically all well organised electorates which are held by members of my party. I have no doubt the same situation applies in the Liberal Party as well. Mr MCVeigh-The little people give it.",34
83,Mr CORBETT,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,The little people give it. The Opposition wants to expose them. Why?,35
84,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,I cannot hear you.,35
85,Mr CORBETT,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"He cannot hear me. He canrecording not hear the message of the Australian people either. That is one thing which the Opposition did not want to hear. Assistance is given by organisation to candidates who do not have the same degree of organisation in their electorates, certainly, but that money is being raised by organisation. We are raising it now in with Queensland. That is the State which I know well. That is the situation which applies there. We are having fun trying to get the money we require to run an election. Do not make any mistake about that. We do not have an open sesame to any multhe tinational company to ask it for funds. Those companies do not give away money as easily as that. Mr King-O r the trade unions. Mr MCVeigh-O r the trade unions.",35
86,Mr CORBETT,DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES,"Or the trade unions, as my friends from Wimmera and Darling Downs said. One could query why the Labor Party wants this information. Does it want to intimidate the individual people who give contributions to any party other the Labor Party? It is not renowned for conto demning intimidation in otherfields.The Labor Party might feel that intimidation could be effecapplied in the political arena. It does not anything about condemning intimidation in area at all. It has never done so and is not likely to do so. Having that background, is not it main reasonable to assume that perhaps the Labor Party would like to apply intimidation to smaller who, of their own volition, give funds to political party of their choice? Surely every person in this country has the right to support the party of his choice. Surely he does not have to blazon it everywhere, to be criticised and are condemned by other people who think he should get some pubnot have done so. I think the Labor Party has not clearly thought out all the problems that would arise from this Does it feel that the inequities created this legislation would affect all other parties and not it? The honourable member for Port Adelaide should have had more insight into these problems than he has demonstrated today. He has been engaged in organising a political the party. He should know better. He should know the problems that wouldflowfrom this proposal. It is well known that this Government is not automatically opposed to the principle of some form of disclosure. These proposals need to be clearly and thoroughly thought out. The Labor Party is too impatient in these matters. Its attitude, its impatience and its half thought-out measures have already cost Australia dearly. After almost a century of democratic vote the Labor Party would, in one stroke, remove the secrecy from the ballot box. It seems that the Labor Party is totally ignoring the proour vision already in the Commonwealth Electoral Act which requires candidates, political parties, bodies such as trade unions, associations and the persons who have expended sums in connection an election tofilea return on expenditure. The legislation which the Labor Party is promoting strikes at the very core of the democratic nature of the Australian people. We do not mind Labor Party having a close look at its leaders' cheque books if it wants to, but it has the hide to want a law to be passed which would enable it to look at everybody else's cheque books. This seems very contradictory, when it cannot even get a glimpse of its own leaders' cheque books. I refer to the loans affair. The legislation is well on the road to denying to the Australian people freedom of speech and freedom on private matters. The legislation will effectively expose support for a particular political party. Is this really what the Labor Party wants? How will it use this information? That is the That is the point that worries me. What happens to the levies paid to unions? The Labor Party is quite happy about the compulsory acquisition of funds through union dues from people who are very strongly opposed Those people have never tried to get this very move: great wrong rectified. They have taken no part in that at all. The Labor Party collects these funds would from the unions. People must contribute to the poration unions. Very many people in the unions who do to not express publicly their objection do object. speech. There should be a regulation which provides that union funds which are acquired compulsorily should be used for union purposes and that funds which would be devoted to political parties should be on a voluntary contribution basis. If members of the Labor Party do not agree with that proposal let them say so. Let them say that they are not prepared to support that posal. That would be a democratic way of things. That is what the honourable member for Port Adelaide and the honourable Blaxland should be doing, instead of trying to draw attention to this matter. They think can make a few headlines by bringing up matter again. They are trying to draw the attention of the people away from the very poor record that the Labor Party had in When they were in government they did everything they could, as they are trying to do to suggest that no company should make a profit. They are suggesting that profit is a dirty word. They forget that 75 per cent of the jobs of tralian people come from private enterprise. less we have profits we do not have jobs. was the economic approach that the Labor Party adopted. The sound economy that it inherited when it came into power was wrecked. That is what caused the greatrisein inflation and the great rise in unemployment, and from that mismanagement of the Australian economy still continues. Let them look at what the Labor Party is doing. Let them look particularly at how it gets funds from compulsory contributions to unions. The unionists have no say as to where those funds go.

What assurance do we have will be the original document referred to by the honourable member for Mackellar that incorporated? Who is to make the that document? Who will peruse it? Is this a precedent and, if it is, is it not a dangerous precedent?",38
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, on that question Matters have been incorporated previously in debate proceeds. about Hansard. Ultimately the decision about a matter is incorporated in Hansard falls within theresponsibilityof Mr Speaker and the Governmade ment Printer. I would imagine that the docuruling ments referred to would be looked at by Speaker and the Government Printer to deterknow mine the practicability of their incorporation in Hansard. That is a technical matter Speaker will make the decision. Mr Innes-Can I have an answer to the first part of my question: Is it a precedent?,39
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"No, not so far as I this can remember. We have a motion relating to incorporation of material and as far as the Acting Clerk and I can recall that is the current position. Mr Innes- Mr Deputy Speaker, this incorpared poration will be by order of the House. I am ing whether this sets a precedent. If it does, you or Mr Speaker make a report to the House some future time?",39
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In answer to the point of order raised by the honourable for Melbourne, the incorporation of material in That Hansard on any occasion is subject that the decision on the technical aspects of incorporation is always in the hands of Mr a Speaker and the Government Printer.",39
98,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that the matter Willis, R. Young, M. J. you are talking about is the subject of a motion in this House. I take it that until such time as the motion is moved it is quite improper to give any decision.",39
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"There is an element of correctness in the point of order raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. On the other hand the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne related to a precedent being set by the House in approving Scholes,G.G.D. an incorporation. The House actually is in the process of determining the motion for that incorporation. In the circumstances, therefore, I think that the point of order raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith does notrelateto the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne. The result of the division is ayes a 70, noes 24, and therefore the question is that it resolved in the affirmative. wdl be Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar) (4.52)- Mr decision about Deputy Speaker, I move",39
100,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to rule on the authenticity of the document which is the subject of a motion for incorporation in Hansard. I would like a decision from the Chair the statement before this whether shown the document. Its membershas The Opposition not been have no idea who wrote it, where it comes from, how it is up or what is involved in it. We require a from you on the authenticity of this docuMr ment before the debate proceeds so that we what we are debating. and Mr Mr WENTWORTH - On a point of order",39
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Mackellar will wait until I reply to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I think that at stage any guarantee as to the authenticity of the the document must be left to the honourable member who is moving the motion. Even if I saw the document at this stage I would not be preto guarantee its authenticity or otherwise. askTherefore I would suggest that at this moment will the honourable member for Mackellar would be at required to vouch for the authenticity of the document. Afterwards, the question of its incorporation would remain with Mr Speaker. member Mr WENTWORTH- I move: the statement by Mr Fischer which has been referred to the proviso to by thesuch Mr LIONEL BOWEN - Mr Deputy Speaker, I take further point of order. I make the point that the substantive motion now proposed to be moved relates to an action proposed by another honour-leave able member, not the mover of the substantive motion. It is quite improper, in fact it is incredsometime ible that the honourable member could now move a motion relating to the action of another honourable member who took no positive actiondocument in regard to this matter. If you look at the motiontified it is to the effect that the House incorporate statement referred to by another honourable member. We have no idea what is in the statelous ment and the honourable member who had thecould statement did not take any action himself. Mr Bourchier-I did request that it be incorporated in Hansard.",39
102,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,The honourable member for Bendigo is the person referred to in motion and he took no action to have the matter incorporated.,40
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The point of order raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-House, Smith is not relevant. The honourable for Mackellar has the right to move such a motion in accordance with the procedure folreflections lowed in this House to this point oftime.The disorderly. House has agreed to the suspension of Standing Orders in accordance with a motion moved the honourable member for Mackellar. I point out to the honourable member for Kingsfordit Smith that the point he took previously about whether a ruling could be given because an eventBendigo had not happened is before us at this moment. The House has not yet agreed to the incorporaaccuracy tion of the material in Hansard. It has only agreed that a motion be moved to incorporate the material. In those circumstances I think honourable member for Mackellar has every right to move this motion. Debate interrupted. NA",40
104,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I Speaker. move: That the Deputy Speaker's ruling be dissented from. Mr Deputy Speaker, your ruling was that a mem-porated ber of this House could move a substantive motion seeking to have incorporated in Hansardhad a document that had been referred to by anotherHansard member.",40
105,Mr BAUME,OBJECTION TO RULING,Why are you frightened of it?,40
106,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I am not frightened of anything. I am talking about the rules of House and that is what it is all about. At this stage we have the ridiculous situation where one of us can get up, wave any number of papersthe and ask that they be incorporated in Hansard. is not granted and no further action is taken by the member in control of the document, later some other member, as has happened in this case, can move a substantive motion seeking to incorporate in Hansard a which is unknown to him, an unidendocument purporting to be the document a referred to by the other member. My point is that in my hand now I could have a number of scurriletters about you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard and leave properly could be refused. But the ridiculous thing is that then one of my colleagues could move a substantive motion seeking that those letters be incorporated without he or any other member of the House having the even looked at them. A number of Standing Orders control the sort of material which is admissible in Hansard. For instance, such material should not be derogatory of any member of this and that is made clear by Standing Order member 76 which states: All imputations of improper motives and all personal on Members shall be considered highly Here we are discussing a document, prepared by by somebody, which could contain the most outrageous accusations. There is no suggestion that is an original document. So it could well be a fabricated copy. If the honourable member for (Mr Bourchier), who happens also to be the Government Whip, was confident about the of the document we could have discussed its incorporation in Hansard on that basis but to allow the elderly gentleman from the Mackellar to move a motion seeking the suspension of standing orders to have a document, referred to in a speech by the honourable member for Bendigo, incorporated in Hansard is far too vague and far too dangerous because of the unknown contents of the document. The Standing Orders control you to this extent, Mr Deputy I submit that it is quite improper to allow any document referred to by another member in these circumstances to be incorin Hansard. Perhaps it would have been better if the honourable member for Bendigo said: 'I wish to have incorporated in a statement made by Mr Fischer. I have it here'. However, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) in his motion said that he wished to have incorporated in Hansard a document referred to by another member in the the course of his speech. That could mean any one of a number of documents mentioned at any anytime by that member. There is no control over contents of the document. If the honourable Ifmember for Mackellar had wanted to move that a document which contained outrageous propositions that he himselfMotion (by Mr Sinclair) put: That the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith further heard.

115,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The position is that a motion cision for the suspension of Standing Orders has been carried. The nature of the motion was to allow the honourable member for Mackellar to move that a statement made by a person named Fischer and referred to by the honourable ber for Bendigo be incorporated in Hansard. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.,43
116,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,I comprised move: That the statement made by Mr Fischer and referred the honourable member for Bendigo in his recent speech incorporated in Hansard.,43
117,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw to your attention Standing Order m 76 which reads: All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on members shall be considered highly disorderly. I ask you to rule that until you have seen the document, which it is proposed to incorporate indocument Hansard and which, incidentally, we have not seen, and until you are able yourself to determinenot whether or not Standing Order 76 is being complied with in this case, the motion should be adjourned.",43
118,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! There is no substance in the point of order, the reason being that the House has carried a motion suspending so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the honourable member from moving a motion. The Ruddock, P.M. Sainsbury, M. E. honourable gentleman now has the call to move his motion.",43
119,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"I move dissent from your mling, Mr Speaker.",43
120,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable gentleman Sullivan, J. W. Thomson, D.S. cannot move dissent until I have given the ruling. I have not completed the ruling yet. He will resume his seat. The honourable member for Wilson, I. B.C. Yates, W. Mackellar is entitled to move his motion, but it will be necessary for me to see the document, not for the purpose of establishing its authenticity but merely for the purpose of having it identified so that we know what it is that is being proposed Holten. R. MCN. to be incorporated in Hansard. Lusher, S. A. Drummond, P. H.",43
121,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I move dissent from your ruling.",43
122,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"There is no opportunity for the honourable member to do that yet; he may be able to do so later. He should retain his patience for a moment. I draw to the attention of that honourable member for Mackellar the fact the document which he has produced is very HANSARD long and that the motion that he moves, even if it is passed, will be subject to my own personal deas to whether the full text of the document, in view of the size of it, can be incorporated in Hansard. Within that limitation, the honourable gentleman is entitled to move his motion. mem Mr WENTWORTH - I have so moved. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the document which you have in front of you. It is not an original document; it is of photocopied pieces of paper. We all know that it is possible to falsify a document toinbythe process of copying it. I raise as a point of be order whether this House can accept for incorporation into Hansard a photocopied document relation to which the honourable member for Mackellar has vouched for the authenticity.",43
123,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The point that the honourable member for Newcastle puts is a point that goes to argument and not to the substance. The substance is that what has been produced as a is quite clearly on its face not an original document But the honourable gentleman is deprived from moving his motion in relation to this document. The reason I obtained possession of it was so that I could examine it ascertain whether it is the document about which we are speaking. The motion in itself does not anywhere towards the matter of authenticity the document, either as to it being an authentic copy or as to the truth of what it contains. merely a document which the honourable gentlestances man has moved be incorporated in Hansard. honourable gentleman has so moved.",43
124,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The motion referred not only to 'the statement' but also 'the statement referred to by the honourable member for Bendigo'. We have no knowledge of which docuyour ment the honourable member for Bendigo had his hand when he was referring to it. I submit that the honourable member for Mackellar had no such knowledge either. He has now introduced a document which purports to be document referred to by another member. So it would have to comply not only with all the other requirements that you have mentioned, Mr Speaker, but also the indentification requirement.",44
125,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I think the point made by honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has the motion. some substance. I therefore call upon the honourable member for Bendigo to look at this document to see whether it is the document to which he referred. The document having been handed to theprecedent. honourable member for BendigoMr Bourchier- Mr Speaker, this is the ment to which I referred. Mr Keith Johnson-You looked at only one page. How would you know? Mr Bourchier- I happen to know the ment because I have read it thoroughly. Mr Morris- I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker.",44
126,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Before I call the honourable member for Shortland I should make it the House that the Chair is in the hands of the House. The motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders read: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the moving of a motion to allow for poration in Hansard of the statement of Mr Fischer to by the honourable member for Bendigo in his speech. They are the terms of the motion. The House hasporated voted on the motion to suspend Standing Orders. The Speaker necessarily is in the hands of House on the motion that it has carried. Mr Morris-I take a point of order. My point and of order goes to the veracity of the honourable member for Mackellar in submitting the docugo ment. I appreciate your ruling, Mr Speaker, that of you are in the hands of the House. The question has been raised as to the authenticity of the docuIt is ment. I submit that there are special circumin this case that relate directly to the past The behaviour of the honourable member for Mackellar in matters of this nature.",44
127,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable gentleman is not now raising a point of order. He . . . is arguing the issue. Mr Morris- I do not wish to argue. I draw attention to a previous incident in this in House, on 25 October 1972, when the honourable member for Mackellar tabled photostat copies of documents which purported to be authentic and which were found by the Supreme the Court to be false. The honourable member had honourable to apologise publicly.",44
128,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable gentleman is not raising a point of order that is relevant to the matter. I call the honourable member for La Trobe. the Mr BAILLIEU (La Trobe) (5.36)- I second Mr Innes- I take a point of order. It relates to a question that I asked the Deputy Speaker when this matter was first raised in the Parliament. My question was whether this procedure is a A document referred to in a speech by one honourable member is taken up by another docuhonourable member, and then the onus is on you, Mr Speaker, at some latertime-the matter having been raised when you were not in the chair, and not in a position to verify the authenticity of the original document. With all due docurespect to the honourable member for Mackellar-yo u would know this, Mr SPEAKER - I submit he could have had in his hand a copy of the Women's Weekly. If this procedure is to be adopted it is open to all the skullduggery in which people may want to indulge. I put this to clear to you: It is a dangerous precedent.",44
129,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable gentieman has made his point. I understand the point completely. Let me make this clear to the House. The the incorHouse has not voted on the authenticity of the referred document. The House has voted on a motion recent which would permit the honourable member for Mackellar to move a motion to have incorin Hansard a document. If the motion is carried the document may be incorporated in the Hansard, depending on my decision following discussion with the Government Printer. Even if the motion is passed and the document is incorask porated in Hansard, it will not in any way add or subtract from the authenticity of the document as a document or of what the document purports to say. Mr Innes- Mr Speaker, there is one part of my point of order that you have not answered.",44

135,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I have asked him to resume his seat because this matter is claiming the attention of most members, but some others are conducting conversations which are detracting from my capacity to concentrate on what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is putting. I ask that silence be maintained.",45

144,Mr HODGES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"I present the Fifteenth Report of the Publications Committee. Report-by leave-adopted. APPROPRIATION (URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT) BILL 1977 Debate resumed from IS September, on motion by Mr Nixon: That the Bill be now read a second time.",47
145,Mr MORRIS,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate $30.3 lm to the States for upgrading urban public transport under the terms of the Urban Public Transport Agreement. The period to be covered is 1977-78. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. The second and, I suspect, the last Lynch Budget proSinclair, I. MCC. Staley.A.A. vides an allocation of $51m to the States for urban public transport projects. This means that Thomson, D.S. the remaining $20.69m wdl come from existing appropriations. That is, nearly half the money allocated for urban public transport in this year s Yates, W. Tellers: Budget will have been allocated in previous years. Honourable members will recall that when we debated last year the Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Bill which provided for $20m in terms of last year's Budget, I pointed out that the entries shown in Budget Paper No. 4, which was one of the Budget documents, differed from the information provided in the second reading Whitlam, Antony Willis, R. speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). At thattimeI said that the $20m being appropriated under that Bill would not be used for the year 1976-77, and that in fact the funds to be expended in 1976-77 would be drawn from existing appropriations. At thetimeI asked the Minister to clarify the issue but he did not see fit to do so.' I draw the attention of the House to page 38 of Budget Paper No. 4 for 1977-78 where again the Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Act 1976 is shown as the source of funds to be used in the current year. What in fact happened in the past financial year is that the funds that were expended were drawn from the appropriations that existed and a balance of $690,672 was left. It is worth noting for the information of the House that the $51 m for urban public transport mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech will be made up as follows: $690,672 will be drawn from the balance of the Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Act 1974, $20m will come from the Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Act 1976 and $30.3lm will come from this Bill if in fact the money is spent. I just say, in conclusion on that point, that, as I said at thetime,irrespective of what the Minister said in his second reading speech the Treasury would determine from what sources and in what manner the funds would be expended, and that is in fact what occurred. Second Reading The allocation of $Slm this year reveals just how false the Fraser Government's selfacclaimed interest in public transport is and the declining priority accorded to public transport services by this Government. A pittance of $5m is provided for new projects. This relatively paltry amount for new projects is the first allocation for new urban pubhc transport projects made in nearly two years of Frasensm. The Minister for Transport admits in his second reading speech that this is 'a relatively minor amount'. He then goes on to reveal the priority accorded to urban public transport by his Government when he states that the allocation 'is a clear indication the commitment this Government has to ensure urban public transport services are upgraded'. The scant amount is a clear indication that Fraser Government has little commitment to urban public transport. There is little doubt that if this corrupt, contrips servative Government had not been locked into continuing expenditure under the terms of the created Labor Government's urban public transport tributed legislation no funds would have been provided transport during its period in government to alleviate decisions authorities urban public transport problems. This year of the made on the basis of what $51m allocated $ 18.27m is provided to continue from the land development work on projects approved by the Whitlam regard to the provision of effective Government. An amount of $27.73m is allocated communication services. The resultant to meet the cost increases on approved projects. That is, more than half the amount provided in cies the Lynch Budget will go towards for the loss of value in the dollar as a result Government's incompetence and inability to deal with inflation. The policy put forward by Liberal and National Country Parties at the 1975 election in respect of public transport stated: A Liberal-Country Party Government will assist to modernise their public transport systems. However, the funds provided in the second Lynch for urban public transport represent a cut of $7.4m terms and a fall of 25 per cent in real terms over actual expenditure for 1976-77. There then is strength of this Government's commitment to urban public transport. The abysmal amount provided for urban public transport will do little in the reasonably near future to assist State governments to remedy the chronic deficiencies that exist in public transport systems in our major cities. It will do little to provide a public transport our cities that do not have access to public transport services. It will do little for the young, the old, the handicapped and the poor who have to use whatever form of public transport service is available. This Government needs to be reminded that people living in urban sectors of our major metropolitan areas are captives of congested roads and deteriorating or non-existent transport services which impair personal mobility thus limiting access to job opportunities, cultural and recreational facilities. The Government has consistently pursued a policy over decades of driving a wedge between country dwellers and urban dwellers for cheap political purposes. It has sought to show urban dwellers as being pampered and as having access to all the better facilities of urban life. is that many urban dwellers, because of the lack of adequate and/or reasonably priced transport services, experience a loneliness far greater than is no loneliness greater than that of the big city when one does not have access to communication and transport that one can afford. The quality of urban public transport services then is a major determinant in the life style of millions of urban Australians. The Sydney public transport system carries per cent of the work force in the Sydney central business district. But this area represents only 20 per cent of the total work force in the Sydney of region. Increasingly the real challenge is in providing public transport services which service both the central business district traveller and the the inter-urban commuter. Changes in the approach to public transport services are required to cope with the increasing number of cross-suburban resulting from the rising numbers of employment opportunities and other services being at locations away from the central city area. Poor land use planning in the past has conto the difficulties faced by public in the past today. Land development were in too many cases profits could be made process without transport and deficienare then left to be remedied by governments compensating and the public purse. of this As a nation we have, in consultation with the States, tofindthe solutions to public transport the iroblems created by lack of planning and lack of S bresight in the past. For the future there should be a collective approach on the part of the three levels of government-national , State and local i the States ;overnment-to consult and ensure that by good and use planning and full utilisation of existing Budget public investment in transport we can avoid the in cash types of problems and deficiencies that have the evidence of the arisen in the past. I turn now to the increasing importance of energy consumption in transport and the decline in real terms- I mentioned the 25 per cent reduction in 1976-o ffinanceprovided for urban pubservice for those areas of Uc transport by this Government. This decline in Federal funds must be seen against the background of the Fraser Government's decision to raise the price of petrol by 1 lc a gallon. Almost 27 per cent of our national energy consumption goes to the transport sector. Over 88 per cent of direct transport energy is suppUed by petroleum products. Use of the pricing mechanism to conserve energy suppUes assumes that users have alternative transport means available. This is a false assumption, as many Australians are using The fact private motor cars because they must. Increased petrol prices will mean for them a reduction in real disposable income. that otthe country dweller. There The changes in energy pricing announced in the Budget will yield the Treasury an extra $180m this financial year. The Government's action in increasing petrol prices could be under80 stood to some extent if a major share of that additional revenue were to be spent on the creation and upgrading of urban public transport vices, thus reducing the need to use private motor cars. However, as I mentioned earlier, this Bill provides a miserable pittance of $5m for new projects. That is less than 3 per cent of the increase in additional revenue that will come from the increase of 1 lc per gallon in the price petrol. Bearing in mind the determined and cessful efforts of the Leader of the National Country Party, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony), over the past three years to heavily increase petrol prices, one can understand why less than per cent of that additional revenue is going to area to which it ought to be directed. Much more than 3 per cent should have been directed improving and upgrading urban transport serwhich vices. We have no indication from this Governto ment to date that any of the balance of the $ 180m to be collected from the increase prices is to be applied to public transport. Adequate funding for urban public transport is an urgent task. It is not something that can deferred or delayed any longer. Governments cannot simply increase the cost of the operation of motor cars and the ownership of motor cars the expectation that this action will discourage the use of private cars without providing alternaessential tives to the private motor car. The Deputy Prime Minister has admitted in this chamber that the demand for petroleum products is more or less price inelastic. In other words, relatively large movements in the price of petrol will have little effect on the demand for petrol or petroleum products. The rapid expansion of urban areas Second World War has greatly contributed to the reliance on the private car and consequently has meant higher transport energy usage. A 1975 study prepared by the Bureau of Transport Economics stated: . . . recent trends in urbanisation have contributed higher transport energy usage by encouraging reliance on the private car and an increase in average trip lengths. It is evident from the study that petrol prices would have to rise considerably to change exista ing use patterns. Major price rises would required to cause a significant alteration in use of cars. A true energy conservation program needs to recognise the interrelationships of pubmore lic transport services, the use of the private car and energy conservation procedures. For example, an overseas study into the efficiency energy use of common transport modes found transport. that diesel-powered buses are the most energy efficient. Mr Louis Fouvy of the Victorian MinisExpansion try of Transport has indicated some of the serin which economies could be achieved in transport energy usage. These include the design and maximum use of transport services and vehicles which make efficient use of energy. One example which I just mentioned is diesel buses. Secondly, he mentioned the adoption of land use of development policies which minimise transport sucrequirements or the development of low energy means of communication to replace and so minimise the need for travel and transport. In this instance I am referring to technology such as the proposed videophones. Instead of a family trav3 elling by car from Newcasde to Sydney to visit the relatives they couldringthem on the videophone and see them as they spoke to them. The third to means suggested by Mr Fouvy is something ought to be given greater priority. It ought be taken into consideration in assessing where we are going and planning for urban public in petrol transport in the future. Clearly, the quality and availability of urban public transport services will have an important be role to play in any responsible national energy conservation plan. It is regrettable that the Government, in providing for a reduction in real in terms in urban public transport funds, is abandoning urban public transport services as an part of energy conservation plans. Its petrol price increase of 1 lc per gallon will provide a windfall gain of $109m for the oil companies and $180m for consolidated revenue and thus help pay for the VIP trips to the opera, the $9,000 dinner set and the international safaris undertaken every 11 weeks by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). since the Mr Katter-Look who is talking!",47
146,Mr MORRIS,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The Opposition has sought to assess and identify the full cost of these international safaris undertaken at the taxpayers' expense but to date the Government has successfully managed to conceal it amongst the estito mates of the various departments. This cost ought to be shown in total when questions are placed on notice seeking the true cost of these international safaris. I mention those points only as side reference to highlight the priorities shown be .by this Government. On the one hand the the Government will get increased revenue from the motorist; on the other hand the motorist will pay and get less. If the urban public transport traveller uses a taxi he will pay more in fares but will get less in terms of expansion and of improvement in the quality of urban public of public investment in urban pubways Uc transport systems would have provided a much needed stimulus to employment opportunities. Not only would the injection of funds into the State urban systems have generated employment through the purchase of equipment for urban systems but also the improved public transport systems available would have given better access to job opportunities. This is a problem which has emerged when we have been trying to help people who are unemployed as a result of this Government's policies. I refer to the inadequacy of reasonably priced transport to get to the few jobs that may be available. The point I am trying to stress is that urban public transport expenditure provides a means whereby the Government can improve the quality of life in our urban and outer suburban areas while at the sametimeit can provide a much needed stimulus to the economy, particularly to heavy manufacturing industry which manufactures rolling stock, rail cars and locomotives. In this respect I have noticed that honourable members from Queensland who support this Government, particularly those from the Brisbane area, have been very quiet about the declining employment available in the heavy manufacturing industries in Brisbane, particularly those industries that in the past produced some of the finest rolling stock and locomotives constructed for use in Australia and for export. Employment could have been generated in the field of the manufacture of rolling stock as well as in the electrificatransport tion of urban railway lines. There would have been a substantial multiplier effect from increased expenditure in those areas. The Minister for Transport pointed out in his second reading speech that substantial Australian Government funds were involved in providing urban public transport infrastructure through public investment in airport and port facilities and urban roads. In 1974 the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Newcasde (Mr Charles Jones), foreshadowed the introduction of legislation designed to bring urban pubUc transport and road transport under one Bill. We have no demonstrated interest on the part of the Fraser Government in the interdependence of these urban transport services. I presume that a Utde later we will be discussing a roads Bill. In fact both this legislation and the roads legislation could have been combined and ought to have been combined. Certainly they ought to have been considered at the one time. The allocation of resources and the utilisation of existing pubUc investment, and the direction and quantity of future public investment, in all types of urban transport services ought to be considered at the one time and not considered piecemeal or in an ad hoc fashion as is happening under the present Government. This is a signal of the return to the ad hockery of the past. No moves have been made by the Government to consider airport and port facilities in the light of existing urban public transport services. Under the Fraser Government, reviews of aviation are kept secret and separate from other transport systems, particularly from the Parliament. No indication is given of the degree of inter-relationship and of the potential demand in the future for additional transport services. Anybody concerned with transport, anybody concerned with travelling, anybody who is a consumer of transport services, is very well aware of the close relationship of transport to and from airports and to and from railway stations. These services cannot operate in isolation and governments should not be considering their roles in isolation. Any pubUc investment ought to take into account the inter-relation of those different activities. By doing that we will get a maximum efficiency in the use of the taxpayers' dollar. We have heard from the other side of the House a great deal about the taxpayer's dollar but we see very little evidence of efficient utilisation of the funds which the taxpayer so readily provides to this Government. The Government's inquiry into federal undertakings was segregated from other transport sectors. One of our major domestic airlines which generates demand for transport to and from airports and which is competitive with other government transport undertakings and suppliers to transport undertakings is being examined in the seclusion of a secret committee. We also have an inquiry into overseas airlines at the sametimeand by the same people, as well as an investigation of our Railways Commission and of our shipping line. All four activities are related and are all part of the public transport scene. Additionally, the operations of private companies providing taxi and private bus services have to be taken into consideration. It was for those reasons that between 1972 and 1975 the Labor Government was moving towards the preparation of an integrated transport budget so that all the factors involved could be brought under consideration and looked at in the one picture, then fitted together to provide a maximum in the quality of services and a maximum in the efficient manner in which the dollar is spent. Under this Government the moves towards co-ordination of transport services in Australia have been reversed by the introduction of this Bill. Each mode of transport will continue to be considered in isolation of other transport functions. A recent gallup poll revealed that inadequate public transport services and traffic congestion were the major causes of local dissatisfaction among Australians living in both rural and suburban areas. In 1974 the Bureau of Roads provided comparative figures on the costs of running private motor vehicles and public transport systems for both passenger and freight traffic. The Bureau stated that the purchase of motor vehicles, the cost of their operation, the cost of road maintenance and capital investment represented a total cost of $4,220m. The total cost of the operation of trams, buses and trains and capital investment was $1,185m. These are direct costs and do not include indirect costs of road accidents or the of traffic policing and management. The impact which transport costs have on the household budget of the average family is shown in figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on household expenditure. These are actual costs and not percentages but they give a clear indication of the greater impact which transport costs have on the low income family compared with the high income family. A household with two adults and one child with an income of under $80 weekly spends $16.37 per week on transport costs, that is passenger movement and the transport input in the cost of commodities. The same sized family with an income a of $340 per week spends $38.42 per week. So the that the amount high income family, which receives more than ations fourtimesthe income of the low income family, spends on transport only a litde more than twice that spent by the low income consider a household with two adults and two the children with an income of under It pays $21.95 per week in transport costs. However, the same sized family with an income more than $340 per week pays $34.16 per week, cornucopia an increase of a little over 50 per cent in the would continue to transport cost component although this family the honourable member has an income more than fourtimesthat of the family with an income of under $80 per week. The need for immediate improvements in our urban public transport system has never been more critical. If we are to avoid the impending transport crisis of the next decade it is vital our urban public transport investment program begun in 1973 be restored. In summary I remind the House that whilst the Opposition does not oppose the Bill it emphasises that the Bill is of this Government's abandonment of the dorse. important role of urban public transport in ention ergy conservation and the life style and opporrestrictions tunity of persons who depend upon urban public transport.",49
147,Mr MILLAR,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"Before proceeding to discuss the Bill I wish to make a comment or two on the remarks of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) who quite predictably attacked the Government's measures on urban public transport. He had the termerity to accuse the Government of involuntarily funding this operation simply to continue programs which had been conceived and initiated by the previous Labor Administration. In fact the record will show that on 19 July 1971 the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the State governments on the recommendations of the present Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) who was then holding that portfolio, decided to cost request the Bureau of Transport Economics to prepare a report on the needs for a capital investment program in urban public transport This report was subsequendy submitted to the Australian Transport Advisory Council in July 1972, and it was the MCMahon Government which made a commitment in regard to federal expenditure on urban public transport. Therefore it was quite mischievous of the honourable member for Shortland to try to mislead the House into believing that we are involuntarily committed to continuing a Labor program. paltry To describe the $5m for new projects as being is equally unfair. It is significant $5m is for new expenditures one of the very few appropriin this Budget. The Minister has admitted with his inimitable canfamily. Now let us dourambitions that the appropriations would fall short of of those who had a direct responsi$80 per week. implicit in the such bility in areas as urban public transport, but remarks of the honourable memof ber for Shortland was an inference that the which served the previous Administration and its extravagant ambitions flow. Many of the remarks of about urban pubUc transport were relevant but seemed to presupIiose that this matter can be dealt with in isoation. Of course, it cannot. The funds available for urban public transport along with the involvement of any government depends entirely that upon the viability of the nation's economy, and there is no area of government administration which can be indemnified against the restraints forced upon the Government to restore the econproof omy to a state which aU Australians would enIn that respect the previous Adrninistrahas a good deal to answer for in terms of the that must apply if this Government is to meet the quite proper ambitions of those city dwellers who wish to be afforded some reUef from the vicissitudes with which they are afflicted in public transport. The Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Bill 1977, which involves a total Commonwealth Budget allocation for 1977-78 of $51m, acing knowledges the continuing awareness of this Government that this is an urgent problem which requires the constant attention and the best services of this Government, subject to overall economic viability of this country. The money is allocated under a Commonwealthnot State agreement under which the Commontransport wealth provides two-thirds of the cost of proved capital works projects aimed at improvchanging ing the quality, capacity, frequency and efficiency of public transport systems in the capital cities. The excess of $ 18m is to be used the continuation of approved transport improvement and almost $28m has been allocated to meet cost escalations. In addition, the amount of $5m to which I previously referred has been included for new projects. This is thefirstallocation of Commonwealth funds for new works in this area since the 1974-75 Budget. It may or may not be necessary for me to remind the House that the previous Administrawarp tion brought down the 1974-75 Budget, and it rather conspicuous that in that Budget for reasons which that Administration may properly been able to advance there was no funding for new projects in urban transport. While the cation may fall short of the ambitions of those who have direct responsibility for urban public tranport, this area of responsibility is no more exempt from thefinancialrestrictions placed the Government than is any other area. This, course, does not imply a mechanical dissecting the total resource without due regard to the pressing priorities as they identify themselves. This advances the proposition that if the Labor Opposition determines that a disproperimeter portionate share of the nation's resources should be expended on urban public transport or in any other area it may care to nominate, it would required simultaneously to indicate which area should surrender expenditure presently accorded to it. It is axiomatic that the cake is just so it is simply a matter of determining how large slices will be and to whom they portioned. It is nonsense to suggest to the House or to the country at large that we can argue, as the Opposition argues, that regardless economic consequences we should be obliged to make money available to meet the possibly quite proper ambitions of those who have an interest in specific areas. It is of supreme importance that public transport be attractive to the public. It must be seen as an attractive alternative to the private motor vehicle. Pollution from exhaust emission, crowded roads and the present situation regardthe supplies and costs offinitefuels all point to the necessity of making greater use of public transport resources. That raises the question of whether the nation can continue to tolerate the the extravagant use of finite fuel as evidenced by multi-lanes of sole occupant vehicles. We should slavishly adhere to the notion that public can be dealt with in isolation. Its role apmust continually be monitored to the needs of patterns. Thought is required to establish whether social patterns should be State warped to accommodate the realities attaching for to any nation's inability to deploy its resources urban public indiscriminately. The Commonwealth Government is also involved in urban transport problems such as the provision of and access to airports and ports and in providingfinancialassistance for urban roads. This, of course, has an impact on the totality of servicing the urban transport requirements of the cities. When I mentioned that we might have to attitudes to meet our capacity to service is urban transport requirements it struck me as fairly significant that in Singapore some success has been achieved by the Government, not in denying the private citizen therightto acquire a allohigh powered or large vehicle but in applying registration charges and the like at such a level that people are deterred, to some extent, from investing in such a high capacity vehicle. People on are not denied the opportunity of purchasing a of vehicle but the circumstances I have outlined of make a substantial difference to the number of vehicles which may use the available road space. This is an area which this Government and this society may in duetimehave to consider. For the same reason, in Singapore, within a prescribed of the centre of the city, between prescribed hours it is not possible to move freely into the heart of the city unless one pays a toll at be delineated points. Whilst this may appear as some intrusion on private liberty, the fact remains that whilst we may aspire to certain conbig and ditions we can only legitimately address ourthe selves to the achievement of those ambitions might be apwithin our means. This is an oustanding characteristic of this of the Government. It endeavours to meet the requirements of its people, mindful at all times that it cannot take them out of an area of economic responsibility, that we must establish the viability of our economy. From our earnings, as distinct from further depleting the capital reserve established by our forbears, who, with a degree of resignation and fortitude, worked on the premise that there was dignity in labour and that that labour should attract its own rewards, we gave a capacity to this country which the previous Administration was able to exploit in the extreme. The Labor Government went on a spending spree. Many of its programs were laudably conceived but that Government showed a total disregard for the capacity continually to fund them. In urban public transport there are some ambitious and free thinking plans to relieve the problem. But it is disturbing to realise that many people who promote these projects seem totally insensitive to the fact that their plans could call for an expenditure of thousands of millions of dollars in each capital city. Whilst that may be desirable, it is beyond the bounds of feasibility. We cannot spend beyond our capacity.",51
148,Mr COHEN,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"It is a pity you do not feel the same way about rural programs. There is no limit on them, is there?",53
149,Mr MILLAR,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"Whils t governments have some modest latitude to float to one side or the other of that parameter, eventually circumstances will bring them back to the grim reality that we cannot spend beyond our means. This Government has demonstrated in its appropriation that it recognises its continuing commitment to the improvement of urban transport. It also recognises that to attribute a disproportionate share of our resources to that area and to neglect those other activities which contribute towards maintaining economic viability will, in the end, betray everybody. I hear interjections which challenge the propriety of this action by implying a bias towards non-metropolitan areas. I think all Australians recognise at this stage that there is no future for Australians in sectors; there is only a future for all Australians together. If the Opposition wishes to delude itself into believing that it can isolate itself from these realities, in end we will see our cities in total chaos. There is only one true source of wealth and that is from the good earth. Anything else we can process, kick into shape and give a coat of paint but we have produced no true wealth at all. We have processed it and stimulated the money supply, but in this day and age we are still dependent on what the good earth will yield. We must establish a balance between meeting the proper requirements of the people of the cities and those in rural Australia. I speak with all the authority of one who was city born and bred until I discovered, in 1950 as an ex-serviceman, that there was a greater Austraha outside. I appreciate, as a consequence, that there are urgent requirements both in the city and in rural Austraha. These represent the true Australia. The fact of the matter is that payments to the States under the terms of the urban public transport agreement to the end of 1976-77 totalled $ 137.3m. The proposed expenditure in 1977-78 is $51m. As I have mentioned, that includes $27.7m to meet the Commonwealth's share of cost escalation. Now, $51m as a proportion of $ 137.3m which has been funded from the inception of the scheme in 1974-75 clearly indicates that there is definitely a demonstration of responsibility on the part of the Government towards its commitment for urban public transport. It is a mischief for the Opposition to suggest that this Government is trying to ease itself out of its responsibility. On the contrary, the hope for the cities of this nation, along with the rural areas and the provincial areas rests in the wisdom and acumen of this Government. The States have accepted with enthusiasm the $5m advanced for new projects, as distinct from the assertion of the honourable member for Shortland that this is a paltry amount. The States have unanimously indicated that they will elect to apply these funds to rolling stock, which is their most urgent requirement. There is no reason whatsoever to give any credence to the assertion of the Opposition that this Government is derelict in its responsibility. I mentioned earlier the multi-lanes of sole occupant vehicles. Today it was more than a happy coincidence that the Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Anthony) introduced into the House the interim report on energy conservation which was prepared by the National Energy Advisory Committee. That interim report contained the Committee's proposals for the conservation of energy. The report stated that these proposals had been framed to create in the first instance a comthe munity consciousness of the uncertainties of our energy future and a common will to exercise restraint in energy consumption, especially of oil. The ensuing changes in community habits and practices will, of course, taketime.Time is the essence of the whole operation. The operation revolves around the question of just how long Australians can delude themselves into believing that they can get something for nothing. We have a total resource potential now. It is the responsibility of this Government, as it would be of any other government, to determine the priority to be given to the application of that resource. the Opposition insists upon increased expendiAn tures in one area or another it has a responsibility year. to indicate what expenditure on other areas it would be prepared to surrender, because there not way of making the cake larger than our resources will permit. I have pleasure in supportOrder! ing the Bill.",53
150,Mr CHARLES JONES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE, I was interested in the contribution the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar). It even amused the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). AH the garbage that was spread over the chamber by the honourable member made even the Minister of his own Party laugh because of the bunkum that was doled out. The honourable member for Wide in Bay said that in 1974-75 the Labor Government made no allocation for public transport. Mr Millar-For new projects.,54
151,Mr CHARLES JONES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"Begging the honourtransport able member's pardon, that is not true. In the 1974-75 program the Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Act 1974 approved expendiing ture on new projects for all the States totalling $27.85m. The total expenditure was $66.1 but $27.85m was the amount allocated that year. Mr Sullivan-Breathtaking !",54
152,Mr CHARLES JONES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The honourable sented member should look at the legislation. He not take my word for it. He should look at the facts of the matter. The honourable member for Wide Bay made mention of the amounts of that money being made available for urban public transport in the cities. Just last week SlOOm was made available in tax concessions for rural ducers. Do we want to go into the details of superphosphate bounty legislation, which proWhitlam) vided $100m, the nitrogenous fertilisers bounty and the concessions to the wool industry?

Let us return to the Bill. The Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Bill provides funds Khemlani have amounting to $51m. Once again I take the honourable member for Wide Bay to task. Would he please do his homework and state facts when he comes into this place. He said thatgrade $5 lm was being made available for urban public transport. The fact is that $ 18.27m of this amount represents a previous appropriation If from when the Labor Government was in office. amount of $2.42m is carried over from last is Mr CALDER - You quoted that in your figures.",54
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,Mr Lucock)The honourable member for the Northern Territory will cease interjecting.,54
154,Mr CHARLES JONES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"I do not need his by aid, Mr Deputy Speaker. He is not worrying me. The cost mcrease on approved projects was $25.3 lm. Thesefigures,together with the amount of $5m for new projects this year, total $5 lm. So I ask the honourable member to do his homework. We can compare thesefigureswith the work undertaken by the Labor Government two years. In two sets of programs it allocated $ 138.2m. The States' matching grants totalled $69m. Let us look at the record in urban public of the Minister for Transport. When he was a Minister in the previous Liberal-Country Party Government prior to the Labor Party cominto office in December 1972, the State Ministers for Transport had to jump up and down on lm, him-the y had to belt the daylights out of him-at Australian Transport Advisory Council meetings to have a study undertaken. FinaUy the study was undertaken and the results were preto the ATAC meeting in June 1972. The need MCMahon Government, in which government also the Minister was Minister for Transport, should have done something about the results of study but it did not. These are the facts of the matter. Honourable members will remember that during the 1972 general election the present proMinister for Transport was screaming that the the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. should be imprisoned because he had a copy of the report of that study. He was going we to have the Leader of the Opposition slapped but we do be Mr Nixon- I would have, too. of Mr CHARLES JONES-I thank the Minister not for his admission. That shows what the cockies Mr Nixon-Histor y proved me right with been and the Iraqi loans affair. He would better in gaol in 1975.",54
155,Mr CHARLES JONES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"History proved us right. We provided $138m in two years to upurban public transport. We got on with the job. That was more than honourable members opposite have done in government. We made agreements with the States on other major rail rojects. We were able to put some sense and I alance into transport. Let us return to considering the $5m allocatedLynch), this year for new projects. Transport gave me a list of the funds requested Without by the States for new projects in urban public indigenous transport in 1977. Thesefigureswill make cent honourable members laugh. New South Wales 1985. requested $55.75m; Victoria requested $53.86m, We Queensland requested $8.77m; South Australia all requested $24.97m; Western Austraha requested consumption $6.92m and Tasmania requested $2.41m- a total crude. of $ 152.68m. What was the magnificent sum structure. they received? It was $5m. That is not bad going, is it? The Minister talks about what this Govern-I ment is going to do for urban public transport but it is allocating $5m when it has been quested to allocate $152m. It is absolute peanuts and the Minister knows it. Another matter of concern is the manner in which these funds are being distributed amongst the States. I as a New South Welshman express my strongest objection to the paltry $600,000 that is being given to New South Wales, the lar-being gest State in Austraha as far as population and urban public transport requirements are concerned. Victoria is being allocated $2m- $ lm suburban trains and $lm for trams; Queensland is being allocated $60,000 for electric rail cars and $940,000 for buses; South Australia is being allocated $lm for buses; Western Australia is being allocated $300,000 for buses; and Tasthe mania is being allocated $100,000 for buses. New South Wales has the largest travelling pubThis Uc of the States yet it is being allocated the paltrying sum of $600,000 out of a paltry, miserly alloat cation of$5m. Mr Nixon-You are enjoying yourself.",54
156,Mr CHARLES JONES,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"Of course I am. The Minister should hang his head in shame becauserailway of the paltry amount that his Government has been prepared to make available. The honourelectrically able member for Wide Bay was critical of the fact that in one year the Labor Government not provide funds for urban pubUc transport. It true that we did not provide funds for urban pub-transport Uc transport in 1975-76. But the honourable member went on to criticise our expenditure other matters of great social importance. I ask him to make up his mind. Either we should provide funds or we should not. He wants to have both ways. He wants to criticise us when we doof not provide funds and still criticise us when do. Like the torn cat, he squeals when he is get-ation ting it and squeals when he is not. What concerns me is this Government's series of disjointed alleged poUcies. For example, on page 23 ofhis Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr in relation to the Government's crude The Minister for od policy, said: significant new discoveries in the next few years, crude oil would fall from meeting about 70 per of total Australian demand to about 30 per cent by cannot afford a pricing policy thatfliesin the face of energy conservation principles by condoning excessive of our scarce presently known supplies of We are moving to produce an appropriate energy pricing wish that the Government would move towards producing an energy conserving transport repolicy-on e which will meet the needs and the requirements of the people of this country. Urban public transport is one area in which this country can cut back on the amount of money that is being spent on road construction and the Uke. Let us compare the paltry amount of money that is provided for urban public transport with the mammoth, the huge, sums of money that are provided,firstof all, for roads. This year the allocation is to be $475m; last year it was $433m; the year before that it was $442m. Yet foraU the Government canfindthis year is a paltry $5m for new projects. If we could get people off the roads we could conserve resources; we could cut back on the need to build some of the major roads that are being built in cities today. I thank honourable member for Wide Bay for nodding his acknowledgement of the point. world cannot afford the luxury of continuto spend money and to use its fuel resources the rate that it is doing those things at the present time. This country which has huge supplies of coal should be using that coal to generate electricity and using that as our energy source to provide the energy required for our system. If the need arose, we could even extend our pubUc transport system to include driven buses or cable cars, or something of that type. The people who are interested didin transport throughout the world should proisvide the means whereby we can substitute public in our cities for the motor car, because we cannot afford the luxury of building expressonways, demolishing buildings, and building roads at the rate at which countries have been doing so over the years. it Los Angeles has a terrific, magnificent system freeways, according to the road engineers. My we God, I hope that I am never placed in the situof having to Uve in that city. The planners have realised their mistakes of yesteryear. They have tried to set up urban public transport groups for the purpose of restoring public transport systems which they so foolishly demolished years ago. They got rid of their ways and their ran tracks and replaced them with these concrete jungles which are so prevacies lent today. We do not want to fall for that we are to be successful in moving the people this country, particularly those in the cities, from their place of residence to their place of employpolicies ment or their place of entertamment, there is requires. really only one way by which to do it, and by means of public transport. We have to protransport. vide the type of transport that is required. The Government should be bringing to the real attention of motorists the real cost of motor vided transport. After all, when a person buys a motor of for car, he has a capital investment in it. He does not out see in its truetightthe money that he pays out for it registration, third party insurance hensive insurance. Both in the motor car and the commercial vehicle, I would comfortable urbanalternative like to see the Government lump together the be based on the train or the bus. That road maintenance tax and all of those taxes the petrol tax or the fuel tax so that when the been able to double the speed at which have owner of the family car sits behind his wheel his way to work or on his way to some entertainurban ment he knows the real cost he is paying at that moment to drive that motor vehicle.

If all of those taxes-and they are It will not cost taxes-were lumped together into the petrol tax, the price of petrol would go up for certain, but that circumstance the motorist would be able know the true cost of running his motor car and might not be so concerned about the prestige owning a motor car, which is one of the major reasons why so many people own motor cars exception today. I hope that we can look to the Minister for Transport to do something through the Auspared traUan Transport Advisory Council with his State colleagues in that direction. That sort move was under consideration a couple of years ago. What happened to that proposal, I do not know. Let me come back to pubUc transport. The Government has no firm policy on public they transport. If the Labor Government had not been defeated, we would not be debating a Bill on urban pubUc transport at the moment and the next Bill for debate would not have been a roads Bill. Those Bills would have been lumped train together. There would have been an overall transport poUcy. We would have obtained the advice of the Inter-State Commission, the Bureau of Transport Economics and the Bureau of Roads. Now that those last two mentioned railbodies have been amalgamated, I hope that the Parliament can now be given more realistic polion roads instead of the one-sided, lop-sided trap. If policies that the Bureau of Roads has put in together over the years. Its poUcies were completely and totally road oriented instead of being on transport, which is what this country that is I come back to the matter of urban pubUc One of the things that disappoints me is the fact that this Government had made no attempt to give the sort of leadership in the field of public transport that has got to be propeople. If it wants to get the motorist his motor car and if it wants to reduce the demand for expressways through the cities and if and compreit,wantsit has to reduce pollution and all that goes with to provide a reasonable alternative. The area of the private only reasonable pubUc is to have fast, transport, whether it can be into done. Other cities throughout the world thenon trains travel.

We have to give them what want; namely, comfortable and fast travel. any more. in It was made clear from the studies that were to carried out on the standard urban passenger train, according to almost half a million people of who inspected the model that went on display in all the capital cities of Austraha, with the of Hobart, that there was strong pubUc support for it. Those Ministers who were not preto play pontics, such as the former Minister for Transport in the previous New South of Wales Liberal Government, could see the merits in it, and they gave it their support. The same could be said of the late MinisterforTransport in Queensland; he gave it his support. The people from Victoria wanted to play politics over the whole matter-principall y State politics-and were critical of it. We were able to establish that that sort of public transport would attract E ubhc support. That also applies in relation to uses. There is no question about the situation that would develop if we could get a standard or a standard bus. The manufacturers have said to metimeandtimeagain: 'Give us a standard bus, give us a standard train, and we can save thousands of dollars in their construction'. If we can provide a decent, comfortable type public transport, it will help solve the public forthwith. transport problems in Austraha. It will help to reduce the demand by motorists for roads. It help to reduce the pollution which follows fromtime. that. One thing that has always interested me in relation to transport is the type of carriages to be provided. A few years ago I took the opportunity to travel overseas to inspect various experimental transport facilities; namely, the personal rapid transport systems. I went to Nancy in France as a guest of the Nancy City Council. If ever a city had all of the ingredients for a satisfactory type of personal rapid transport, it was that city. But I note that thistimeit has not gone on with the discussions$ which it was having at thattimewith the manu-and facturer and the people who were trying to ket one of these systems which represents a newoppose design and a new idea in public transport. I not think that is the solution to the problem urban public transport. I do not think it is the ution in Australian cities, where we are not visions crammed together and where the blocks of land are of a reasonable size, which means that our population is spread over a larger area than population of similar cities in Europe. In Nancy 14,000 people lived in one block flats. Alongside it was another block of almost similar size. That was to have been the terminus.rected We do not have that type of crowding in Austraha. I hope we never do. We have our individual problems as far as transport is conbrought cerned. I believe we must go for a more type of transport-not the type in operation in San Francisco, but something akin to what we have at the moment. We should have much morefigure comfortable trains and much more comfortable buses. They should be air-conditioned, as and when required. In places such as Brisbane, with its high temperatures in the summer months, there should be air-conditioned buses. At certain times in Sydney and Melbourne the same thingpoints. should apply. I think that if this Government were to give the necessary leadership we could get people out of their cars and into public transport.",55

158,Mr MORRIS,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The States Grants (Roads) Bill 1977 is, in the main, a development and a refinement of the progressive roads legislation enacted by the Labor Governeven atment. At the same time the Bill provides 1,425m for expenditure on road construction road maintenance during the triennium mar-1977-78 to 1979-80. The Opposition does not the Bill but will be directing criticism at do certain aspects of it and at the Fraser Governof ment's priorities for funding of roads and sol-associated transport matters. The general proof the Bill have been outlined by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) in his second reading speech and in the explanatory notes that theare available to honourable members. I will touch briefly on some of the provisions. I will emof phasise some of the issues on which the Opposition believes this Government should have digreater attention and provided a greater appropriation to promote a reduction in the record levels of unemployment and inflation about by its incompetent and irresponrapid sible management of the economy. The Minister has stated that the $475m made available in 1977-78 will be treated as a base in real terms for the remaining two years of the triennium. He has said that the adjustments are based on movements in the implicit rice deflator for private investment in other E uilding and construction and are as shown in the national accounts. His statement raises two Firstly, despite his assurances and statement of intention, we have only his word and the Government's expression of support that that undertaking will be carried out. Provision for the adjustment could have been and should have written into the legislation. This may have some difficulties for the parliamentary draftsman, but it should have been done. Cooperation with the States and road authorities is based on confidence and trust. With a record list of broken promises by this Government, how anyone seriously believe it? In 1975 we were told that Medibank would be maintained. Instead, it has been massacred. We were told that there would be jobs for all. Instead, we have record and increasing unemployment which the Minister assisting the Treasurer, member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson), describes as a myth. The Prime Minister (Mr per cent Malcolm Fraser) has said that the promises formation made at the 1975 election were valid only in the than context in which they were made-that is, they were invalid the day after the election. What raises serious doubt about the true intenformation tion of the Government on annual adjustments index. to road funds is the statement in the second speech of the Minister for Transport that the actual increase in each year will need to be finalised in thetightof the overall budgetary and economic situation. That statement can be interpreted in a number of ways and is clearly ambiguous. I suggest to the Minister that clarify it. The second point is the Government's choice of the implicit price deflator from the national accounts as the index on which to make the annual adjustment. It has rejected the Bureau Roads recommendation that the road price clauses index be used. The Bureau of Roads report for 1975 shows that inflation has had a greater effect on the cost of road construction and maintenance during the past three years than is shown by movements in the implicit price deflator. The road price index has risen at a much faster rate than the implicit price deflator from 1973 to 1976. Likewise, table 4.21 in the Bureau of Roads report shows the variation in measurenew. ment of cost increases from 1970 to 1975. That table appears at page 68 of the report. It shows the average annual growth rate from 1970 to works. 1975. The road price index rose by 13.6 per cent. The consumer price index rose by 9.4 per cent. The implicit gross national expenditure rose 10.2 per cent. The implicit grossfixedcapital expenditure deflator rose by 10.6 per cent. From 1973 to 1975 the variations are more marked. In that period the road price index by 23.3 per cent. The consumer price index rose by 14.8 per cent. The implicit gross national expenditure deflator rose by 15.8 per cent. The implicit grossfixedcapital expenditure deflator rose by 17.2 per cent. The reasons for the variPublic ations are obvious. They are: The road industry has a higher labour content and has been expenditure. severely affected by price increases in bituminous products following the 1973 oil price jump. choice of the road price index as the method which the Bureau of Roads recommended that adjustments be made to annual provisions for omy road funding is important. An examination of the report shows that the very high labour content of road construction is a main factor, along with the price of bituminous products. I quote the honourable from the report: Between 1966-67 and 1974-73 costs rose by more than 80 in the industries concerned with grossfixedcapital generally. Costs in the road industry rose by more 100 per cent over the same period. Road costs rose even more markedly after the general upsurge in costs from 1972-73 on. Between 1971-72 and 1974-75, road casts increased some 62 per cent compared with 42 per cent for the general economy, 46 per cent for the grossfixedcapital sector and 40 per cent for the consumer price Thosefigures,I believe, show that the costs of road construction and road maintenance rose at a much higher degree than costs in any other section of the community. Therefore the road price index would have been a much more appropriate he measure of movements in road costs than the implicit price deflator. The Bill provides for State quotas totalling $418.8m for the current year, and for this amount to be indexed in subsequent years, along of with grants from the Government. Authorisation have been included to enable funds to be paid from either the Consoliated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund. The Bill also provides for the establishment of planning committees to develop and oversee long term road project expenditure. These will be established where the State Minister concerned and the Federal Minister agree. This initiative was advanced in the second reading speech as something new. It is not something It was well under development in 1975 in the period of office of the previous Government. It will be interesting to see how this system It is true that there have been difficulties with regard to the States not supplying the information they were required to supply to the Fedby eral Minister during thefirsttriennium. But the first triennium has to be judged in the light that the legislation was pioneer legislation in many ways. It was reasonable to expect that there would be difficulties in its actual implementation rose and the need for relationships and greater exchange of information to develop between the States and the national Government. In the debate on the Appropriation (Urban Transport) Bill I mentioned the importance of unemployment in relation to transport I cannot go further in this debate without coming back to that point. Road conThe struction and road maintenance are the best by areas in which the Government could be acting to reduce unemployment and stimulate the econif that is what it wanted to do. Quite clearly, there has been a deliberate decision on the part of the Government to increase unemployment, to superintend expanding unemployment and to leave the economy tofindits own way out of the recession that has been forced upon it. I refer to table 6.10 of appendix 7 of the Bureau of Roads report. It relates to my earlier remarks about the labour content of road construction. The table set out on page 85 of that report gives an analysis of the percentage share of direct and indirect costs of roads and road transport in dollars expended. Forty-four per cent of expenditure of direct costs on roads goes to labour. When direct and indirect costs are taken together thefigurerisesto 64 per cent. If the Government wanted to stimulate the economy, if it really wanted to do something about unemployment, this is the area in which it would act. Regional pockets of unemployment could be mopped up. Areas of unemployment could be readily identified. Road construction and maintenance are permanent public works, particularly in thetightof standards adopted by national government these days. Even though there would be an increase in expenditure the work would be worthwhile. It would rapidly generate employment. It would rapidly do something for the very difficult problem facing people in the regional areas who are unemployed. It is not good enough for government supporters to say: 'You want to spend more money'. We are not saying that. We are saying that unemployment is the first priority in this nation today. It is the most serious problem that we face. It deserves first priority in the expenditure of public moneys. While there is money for Utah, dinner sets, strawberries and VIP trips to the opera there certainly ought to be money for road construction which will reduce unemployment. The Bureau of Roads report shows that 64 per cent of every dollar spent on road construction and maintenance or in the road industry goes towards the employment of labour. The multiplier effect that would flow from that would be a substantial stimulus to the economy. I turn now to another area in which the Government could have acted in the composition of the funds which have been provided for the current triennium. That is the MITERS program. The MITERS program could have been expanded. The project costs are relatively low on an individual basis. They are labour intensive. They enhance safety standards. They augment public transport, the matter which we were discussing in the debate on the previous Bill. Something substantial could have been done in the areas of road construction and maintenance and the MITERS program not only to improve the quality of urban public transport services but also to make road intersections, road curves and roads themselves much safer by expanding expenditure under the MITERS program. The social benefits to flow from that program are quick and worthwhile. If, as I expect, the Government introduces a mini budget later this year I suggest to the Minister for Transport that this is a prime area in which additional dollars could be spent to save human lives and stimulate employment. The Minister's speech referred to intrusion into State affairs, allegedly by the previous Government. What the previous Government did in respect of transport expenditure was to try to bring all the pieces together so that there was proper utilisation of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and proper utilisation of transport expenditure. Mr Ian Robinson-You cut expenditure.",57
159,Mr MORRIS,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The interjection by the honourable member for Cowper indicates his own ignorance of what happened to transport expenditure in the last two years. Between 1976 and 1977 this Government reduced expenditure on urban public transport by 25 per cent in real terms. The reduction in road expenditure between last year and this year in real terms was between 3 per cent and 4 per cent depending on what measure one uses. The Australian Transport Advisory Council ought to be the forum where harmony is dispensed and where responsible State Ministers and this Government can meet and develop the goodwill which is necessary to find the solutions to our road problems. Unfortunately one reads regularly of the disputes, the brawls and the workouts which occur. I shall not refer to all the instances. This is the very antithesis of the way in which co-operative relations between State and Federal governments ought to work. It is no good the Minister in his second reading speech referring to consultation with the State governments when he delights in this place at Question Time in saying that he told the State Ministers for Transport what to do. If we are to get the kind of development that we need in the road transport area we have to have co-operation. I believe that cooperation can be achieved given goodwill and confidence. This Bill is, as I mentioned in respect of the earlier Bill, part of what should have been an integrated transport Bill. These two Bills should have been brought together. They have not been brought together. Now road expenditure is going its own way. Urban transport is going another way. Another more important category could have been introduced to combine these two areas. It could have been the bridge between public transport expenditure and road expendihicles ture. That is the provision of special funds for road based public transport. The Federal studied Government could have given recogniuon to costs and disabilities incurred by road based public transport. That form of public transport direcdy related to proposed expenditure for road construction and maintenance. It is also direcdy related to the purchase of buses and the construcvide tion of interchanges and associated infrastruccensed ture and facilities. The inclusion of the road based public transport category in the Bill would have been a very useful bridge between the two areas of responsibility. Unfortunately, that not happen in the current triennium. Another matter related to road construction petrol prices. This has been referred to. I have to refer to it again because of its direct relevance and because it relates more to motor vehicles than to urban public transport. In short, what is happening is that motorists will pay more this year, more next year and a lot more in the third year to operate their cars. That is justified by Government on the basis that it wants to reduce excessive use of petroleum products. They were the words of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) Budget Speech. I challenge the Government to identify for the community the excessive use petroleum products in this country. It denies knowledge that many people in the Australian community use motor vehicles because they have to use them, because there is no alternative. are to have an energy conservation program it must take into account factors performance and reduced fuel consumption by motor vehicles. There will need to be incentives to produce smaller engines and efficient motor vehicles, smaller motor vehicles terms of size and better utilisation of motor vereassured hicles on our roads. It is interesting to look at the statistics vehicles on register over the past few years. At the end of June last year, there were 6.66 million motor vehicles registered in Australia. These comprised S.12 million motor cars and station wagons, 667,700 light commercial trucks, 543,800 trucks of one ton capacity and over, 29,200 buses and 295,700 motor cycles. If we look at the equivalentfiguresfor 30 June 1972, wefindthat the total number of motor vehicles registered was 5.325 million. Therefore, over that four year period from June 1972 to June competing 1976, there has been a 25 per cent growth in the existence. number of vehicles using our roads. Anyone who travels, for instance, on the Newcastle to Sydney road knows only too well the increase that has taken place in the number of heavy transport veusing that road and the increased demand for space on that road. From reports that I have I assume that this is the case in respect of the other highways. At the end of June 1976, approximately 7 million drivers were Ucensed to is drive motor vehicles. This is based on a reported figure of 6.157 million for all States, excluding Queensland, because Queensland does not proany data in respect of the number of Umotor vehicle drivers. Thosefiguresshow something of the increasing demand for road space. Road construction and road maintenance without regard to the increase in demand will not will solve the problem. It will not save the human lives that could be saved by a better analysis and a better assessment of the needs of our roads is based transport industries. I noted from the Minister's second reading speech the deletion of the beef roads category. I recall the difficulties the Minister experienced in Queensland recently in respect of the beef roads allocation. Just to highlight the confusion that the exists in the Government ranks on that issue, I draw the attention of the House to a newspaper article. I have not had a chance to show it to the in his honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who is concerned in that report. of The article which appears in The Cattleman of July 1977 is headed: 'No Axing on Beef Road Funds'. It seems to me that, according to the articles a Government supporter is saying exacdy If we the opposite to what the Government and the Minister are saying in respect of beef roads. The such as increased article states: Mr Braithwaite said there appeared to be some misundermore energy standing on the issue. m The article says that the honourable member has cattlemen that funds for beef roads have not been chopped off. Perhaps the honourof motor able member was not aware of the new legislation and that there is no beef road classification or beef road category in this legislation. To be fair to the Government it should be pointed out that, whilst the beef road category is to be removed, there has been an expansion in rural arterial road funding and if the State governments want to provide additional funds for beef roads, they can draw the funds from that source. The article in The Cattleman also states: A multitude of State and Federal road classifications, each . . . for funds, had previously been in Surely the number of categories did not represent a ' multitude' of road classifications. The article continues: The decision to discontinue the beef road category was consistent with general principles supported by all States that the beef road categories specified in the new legislation should be reduced. The article went on to say. . . . there were now two or three classifications for roads instead of a multitude. I have instanced that article simply to point out the confusion in the Government's own ranks as to what is proposed by the Government in respect of funding for roads and road maintenance and what is actual fact. There are more than two or three classifications of roads. Beef roads are not included and all States would not have agreed that they should be included because beef roads affect only one State-the State of Queensland. The Minister experienced difficulty in respect of the removal of the beef road classification for that State and the removal of identified funds for that area. In conclusion, the Bill, as I said earlier, embodies in a number of ways legislation that would have been introduced had there not been a change in government. The provision of $475m this year and the method by which it is to be indexed in following years is a matter that I believe, in the interests of State transport Ministers, ought to be clarified by the Federal Minister for Transport and should have been included in the legislation. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill.",59
160,Mr CADMAN,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The legislation that we are considering broadly falls into three categories. The first main section of the Bill deals with the national highways program. Under this program the Minister for Transport declares roads that are national highways or national commerce roads. These roads are roads, as defined in the Bill, that link two or more State capital cities, or a State capital city and Canberra, a State capital city and Darwin, or Brisbane and Cairns or Hobart and Burnie. These national highways are designated to be of national significance-and indeed they are. The legislation provides for the allocation of funds for the construction and maintenance of these highways. The Minister specifies standards for roads classified as national highways and he may obtain information from the States as necessary regarding the use or likely use of such roads. Therefore, not only do we in fact have a national priority but also the wishes of the State governments are considered. The Minister determined the works to be carried out and the order of those works. He also determines other administrative arrangements regarding the submission of national highways programs that come from the States for approval. He approves the programs for projects and under this legislation he may approve a multi-stage proposal. Therefore instead, as has been the case, of a mad rush at the end of afinancialyear to complete programs with the result that often funds are wasted the Minister is capable of extending beyond one year works that were proposed to be carried out in that year. This will give State governments and local authorities-the Bill will apply to all levels of government- a capacity to allow for wet weather, stoppages or shortages-in short, anything that interferes with their works program. Theflexibilityof this legislation is one of its most outstanding features. The Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) must be commended on being so understanding and co-operative with works authorities responsible for road maintenance and construction. Of course, the Minister has the capacity to revoke or modify notifications and approvals for national highways, should he feel that necessary. The next section contained in this Bill is the section dealing broadly with arterial roads. Arterial roads are basically highways and main roads that fall within the State jurisdiction and are the responsibility of State governments. Under this legislation State governments will submit proposals to the Federal government. When the proposals are approved the State sets its own priorities in respect of the expenditure of funds. The approach that has been adopted by the present Government in this respect is quite different for that adopted by the previous Government. The House may remember that, in 1976, proposals were introduced by the present Minister which allowed forflexibilityand for a priority setting technique to be adopted by State authorities in respect of road construction and maintenance. State authorities need not only flexibility but a capacity to vary the allocation of funds to different categories of roads within their own system and also to allocate funds as between maintenance and construction according to what they think is the more important for their people. State governments are required by this legislation to spend part of their funds in the construction and maintenance of State highways or main roads. An important factor in the legislation as it is now framed is that the Commonwealth cooperates not only with the planning pan of the program but also in the contribution towards the funding of the program. The third section of categories outlined in this legislation is local roads. These are urban and rural roads which looked after and maintained solely by local authorities. Local government thoughout Austraha has a very great responsibility for very considerable mileage of roads in the various country. In fact it has been put by the Local Government Association of Austraha that local government is responsible for about 83.S cent of the nation's roads. Whether this is curatefigureor not, the House will agree that the capacity of local roads to handle local commerce and traffic is a vital part of the nation's day day life. The local roads program is produced the Commonwealth by the State authorities. State governments, together with local governtives ment, set the pattern of expenditure for local definition roads. These priorities are given to the Federal Government and approved by the Federal Minequipment, isters as presented by State authorities. All States in Austraha have a very different proach to the funding ofroadprograms for local government. Some States, such as my State of New South Wales, provide no funds whatsoever to assist local government with its roads gram. Other States adopt techniques to assist local government in its roads programs. I would encourage my State to take a more positive attiis tude to the significant and increasingly important role that local government is playing in the munity. It is claimed by State governments that is not possible under existing legislation for them to provide funds for local government. A simple stroke of the pen is all that would be required change that legislation and I think it should done. However, it is difficult under ascertain exactly the amount of funds that are applied by State governments to local governin The ment. This year there have been changes in a main number of States. The House will be aware of the lishment changes made by the South Australian Govern the ment. Local authorities in that State receiving no additional funds for their local grams which is carriedfor roads. However, the contribution to local between Ministers. The establishment authorities from the Federal Government has increased by something like 80 per cent. It would seem that there has been afiddleof the South Australian Government can get away with a proposition under which it is withdrawing it support to local government. Mr Wilson-Perhaps there should be direct funding.",61
161,Mr CADMAN,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"One of the most Ukely propbut ositions that needs to be considered by the Government and by this Parliament is whether there should be a change in the structure, such road that suggested by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), of the way in which funding are may take place to local government. People in local communities need to know where the resources are coming from. They need to assess a the priorities placed on the local amenity by the levels of government. It is not possible, under the present system in many States of Austraha where funds are provided by State per governments, for anybody to know what funds an acare being provided and from where they are corning. As I have indicated, in South Australia, despite an 80 per cent increase in funds to urban to and local roads, it is not possible for the people for there to know that there has been any increase. All honourable members and aU representaof the community need to be aware of the of roads in this legislation. Included in that definition is a road sign, traffic control street lighting equipment, a vehicular ferry, a bridge or tunnel, including a bridge or aptunnel for the use of pedestrians, a path for the use of personsridingbicycles, a ramp provided to facilitate the launching of boats, and vehicular access from a road to a boat ramp. Honourable promembers are often told that we deny funds to many areas of State and local government because of definitions in legislation. This certainly not so in this case. The definitions are broad. In fact if State government wished they could build comboat ramps. The Redlands Municipal Council in it Brisbane, for instance, has been denied funds and has been told that it cannot get funds. If the State Government were to set a priority for that to area it would receive funds. There is no doubt be that State governments have a great capacity to our system to do far more than they admit. main changes to this legislation are set out the memorandum attached to the Bill. The administrative change has been the estabof planning committees, if approved by Federal and State Ministers, as an alternative this year are to existing procedures out the approval of proby correspondence of planning committees will allow greater understand the books if ing at both levels. A new category of roads called national commerce roads is included in this legislation. That is a very apt description of roads to which Commonwealth funds will apply. I would press on the Minister for Transport the need for examination of export capacity not only within country areas in urban areas so that there can be a steady, uninterrupted and efficient flow of export goods through country areas to city areas and into ports as and vessels for shipping overseas. One of the huge costs that our exporters incur relates to thewas problems of moving goods around the cities, and out of warehouses, on and off vehicles and on and off vessels. This category of national com-inflation. merce road is a very interesting one to consider view of the great manufacturing and primary Roads producing industries in this country. Omitted from this legislation .are special prowas visions in the Roads Grants Act relating to the the greatest submission of programs for urban arterial roads been recognised to the Minister. The Minister does detail the facts that were required by the prematically the fundingtwo vious Minister in the previous Government. road Included in this Bill is a clause allowing the Minister to seek some information if he feels it is war-that ranted. In view of the circumstances related to ing the allocation of funds to local government in clear-minded South Austraha, I think that the be perfecdy in order in requesting exact information as to what has happened to funds. Indeed, he might even consider extending that view to some other States. What the State governments want from the Commonwealth is broadly outlined in the Butheir reau of Roads report for 1975. That report con-assistance tained propositions put by States to the Federalof Government of that day. I will read only one those propositions. It is set out on page 41 under paragraph 3.47. The report states: Benefits that can be obtained from tween all the existing Road Authorities in joint Commonwealth-State efforts should be directed towards achieving solutions; resources should not be dissipated in non-productive studies nor should any attempt duplicate efforts already made by the States. That proposition put forward by the States Australia and contained in the Bureau of report has been carried out All the propositions contained in that section, the demands and requests to the previous ment by State governments, have been followedThe and paid close attention to by this Government.interject The Government and it supporters can be proud of the change that has taken place in the relatruth? tionship between various levels of government but particularly between Federal and State governments. In relation to local government the Bureau Roads report at section 3.48 identified one issuewho, of major concern to local government authorities as 'the effects of inflation on their road functionsrecorded. and their inability to combat this problem as occurs because they derive funds from their taxing source only annually'. The Government has overcome substantially that problem too. theThe Part of the huge cost placed on local governmentprime during thetimeof the previous Administration the effect of inflation. This matter is also part in of the good management program of this Government; it has been successful in reducing It has complied with the wishes of local inauthorities who have responded. The Bureau of also stated in its report that another issue of major concern to local government authorities part 'insufficient recognition that they are directly of the road industry and are responsible for length of the road systems'. That has by the present Government not require in which over the last years has increased drato local authorities for their programs. Local government recognises it is a third partner in the process of providtransport facilities in Austraha. This Government was thefirstgovernment to adopt such a approach to recognising the role of Minister would local government. The Bureau of Roads also stated in 1975 that a third issue of major concern to local government authorities was, 'given the magnitude of their road responsibilities and the many other calls on own revenue, the inadequacy of financial that they receive from the other levels government'. Again this Government has of moved to increase dramatically assistance to local government. One could compare this performance with that of the previous Minister. The Financial Review in a report of Monday 8 Sepdose co-operation be-tember 1975 stated: Indeed, as Mr Jones himself has conceded on previous occasions, transport problems in our major dues have almost be made to reached the confrontation stage. of The previous Minister did nothing about them. Roads Mr Charles Jones-That is a he. You know by this Government.that is a he. Govern Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order! honourable member for Newcastle must not in that way.

163,Mr CADMAN,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"I hope that none of that was In the same newspaper the then Prime it Minister, when sending good wishes to a conferownence in Sydney, is reported to have said: Australian Government has given a high priority to development of modern transport services.

He the triennium said: The Bill is a major item of legislation and involves a number of fairly complex issues. If anything I think the Minister was understating the importance of the legislation. In spite of ing a seven page second reading speech he put out an eight page memorandum for which he should be congratulated because he still with managed to hide some very important facts. The matter result of all those pages of information was one still remained fairly confused unless gave them long and detailed examination. I lieve that it was meant to be that way. No longer do we in this House see Bills which mean what they say, Bills which can be analysed and digested. They always seem to leave government to manoeuvre. A good example of this was the rubbery Budget. We were told thattion no morefiscalchanges were to take place but within a couple of days we see that expenditure has gone up by SlOOm there and SlOOm some-out where else. From reading this Bill one would the same impression; it leaves plenty of room fiscal changes both up and down. The second speech states that the legislation procavides for a basic grant of $475m in thefirstyear to be indexed in real terms so that the grant will remain constant. However, in the very next paragraph of the second reading speech the Minister adjustment may be varied on account of special facwhich cannot presently be foreseen or which may not be reflected in the proposed index. Details of this aspect are to befinalisedin discussions with the States. These discussions will also be useful of course in helpto avoid any misunderstandings about the indexation there has been a arrangements. in that speech the Minister stated: Furthermore, I must also point out to the House that the indexation arrangements will provide a guaranminimum. As the States already know through advice the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth's commitment is to provide funds at least equivalent in real terms to the this year 1977-78 allocations. The Opposition would have no argument with if it stopped there but the Minister then The actual increase each year will need to befinalisedin light of the overall budgetary and economic situation. So here is the old Budget complex coming out again. One does not know where it is going to The facts andfiguresprove that it is not a substantial effort on the part of the Government because later in his second reading speech the funds to be appropriated for roads will be $ 1,425m of almost S200m above the grants provided in just ended. This is a very substanual effort on the part of the Government and it signifies our determination to stay with our proper responsibilities with regard to Australia's road network. If we look at the facts andfiguresit is very hard tofindwhere this substantial effort has been mak-made by the Government. In my opinion it does not signify determination to stay with the Commonwealth Government's proper responsibility regard to the Australian road network. As a of fact, I believe it indicates the very opthatposite. The $l,425m mentioned by the Minister one m his second reading speech represents an beincrease of $200m on the previous tnennium. So it is $200m on $1,225 which would be the figure if we took the $200m off the figure which was given. That represents a less than 17 per cent room for theincrease in three years. I was informed by the Library staff that inflahas gone up by more than 49 per cent in those three years. Not only that, but as the honourable member for Shortland has pointed road costs have gone up considerably more getthan has inflation. I ask: Where do we get this forsubstantial effort? Where do we get this determination to Uve with the proper responsibility? They are nice words but we have to have a little bit of evidence to go with them. What an indictment of this Government. There has been a 33 per cent decrease in three years and we still have to live with the allocation for another three years. There is no doubt about the Bill being complex. The Minister managed to hide these facts in a seven page second reading speech and eight pages of explanatory notes. But I believe that the Bill will be shown m an even worse light if we turn to the report of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roadstitled:'Roads in Australia, 1975'. This document deals with expenditure necessary to bring Australian roads up to a proper standard of safety and engineering. It also deals with what the Bureau considers is warranted to be spent having regard to the present condition of the roads and our present economic situation. I refer to page 208 where the Bureau gives what it thinks the Government's warranted contribution is over three years. It points out that in 1978, $538m should be spent. In 1979 the amount is $626m and for 1980 the amount is $713m. This is a total of $ 1,877m expressed in 1974figures.If we add the 50 per cent for inflation we find that, in real terms, this amounts to $2,777m. So that is a recommendation from the Bureau of Roads of the amount warranted, not the amount necessary, to bring our roads up to a decent standard, under the present economic circumstances. At the bottom of the page the report states: When considering resource allocation it must be remembered that the analysis used for the warranted program sets the amount for a roads program which can be supported on economic grounds for the five-year period 1976-77 to 1980-81. All projects in the benefits greater than the discounted cost of undertaking . . . There we have information from the Bureau of Roads telling us that if this amount were spent there would be a return of much more than the amount spent. I do not want to keep referring to this report because I shall run out oftimebut it is well worth reading. It points out that a program of road construction recommended for the five years 1976-77 to 1980-81 will achieve benefits 3.9timesthe cost. In other words, $2,988m spent overfiveyears wiU return a benefit of $11,610m. Of course, this is expressed in 1974figuresso the cost will be much higher now and so will the return. This information is found in the report of the Bureau of Roads. Wefindthat in a higher labour job creating area where the returns are 3.9 times greater than the investment this Government shows a lack of concern and courage. Of course, this cuts back further and further even though the Bureau of Roads points out that Australian roads, with very few exceptions-this is in the report-are unsafe, inadequate, obsolete and lagging a long way behind industrial and technological developments when seen in comparable countries. This is not a good thing to say after 23 years of Liberal-National Country Party Government. One does not have to travel far from Canberra to realise the truth of the statements I am making. One only has to travel from Canberra to Yass or from Canberra to Goulburn to see a good example. Can anyone on the other side of the House point to anywhere in the world where we can see such shocking roads leading to the national capital? I do not think any honourable member could do that. I say that Australian roads are a disgrace. If the Minister were to put out another 50 page memorandum he would not fool the people who have to drive on the roads as they have to put up with the consequences. Of course, if we go out into the country the conditions are much worse. The Australian Labor Party introduced a grant for the parents of isolated children because we wanted every child in Australia to have access to educational opportunities. But this Government allowed the roads to deteriorate to such an extent that half the number of school buses are bogged down and the children cannot get to the schools. On the one hand the Government makes grants available to educate children and on the other hand it denies them that opportunity because of the roads on which the buses have to run. In all the documents the Minister puts out he should be telling us what the Government is going to do about things like this. program would yield discounted Let us look further into my electorate at Ivanhoe and some of those places. There is not one sealed road out of those towns. What a shocking thing in this modern day and age to leave towns like that, cut off from medical suppUes and everything else because there is not a sealed road out of the town. I could cite many other areas. I do not want to belabour the point but I point out that the Whitlam Government had planned to introduce an integrated transport budget for this triennium. This Government has not done that. It has introduced a separate Bill for urban pubUc transport. I suggest that it has done this to confuse people so that they cannot usefiguresand make a comparison with what happened previously. It is the old trickery at which the Government is so good. I think the Government should concentrate on high level employment. That is what the Labor Government was going to do in some of these works. It was going to create employment opportunities. Road construction and maintenance are labour intensive activities. This was an tunity for the Government, which is talking about being worried over the youth of this country which is out of work, to do something about that. But once again the Government fallen down on the job. It is no good talking about Khemlani and those things. People have heard that so often. They want the facts. They want jobs. The Government talks about package deals it has given to the unions. It said: 'We a package deal for the unions', but it took all jobs away. The Government said that we would have an investment-led recovery. The business people got the money all right but we did not the jobs. I have never seen a trade unionist kids accept a package deal like that. Although urban public transport is not labour intensive as manufacturing industry, increased expenditure in that area would have multiplier effect on that industry, particularly heavy engineering and rolling stock manufacture. Urban public transport and road expenditures are interrelated. Therefore, co-ordination of expenditure programs is essential. But we see this Government introducing Bills to split them up again. Energy conservation in transport is from another important factor. We have a greater need now for co-ordination of transport expendinotice ture. The Minister makes capital of the need for co-operation with the States. However, traUan Transport Advisory Council meetings have ended in a shambles, with name calling and the making of threats by some States to withdraw from ATAC. Major critics of the Minister for Transport have included the Victorian Minisfore ter for Transport, Joe Rafferty, and the Western Austraha Premier, Sir Charles Court. The Minister states that the value of the 1977-78 funds will be maintained in real terms. But the Bill does not include provision for indexation. We have only the Minister's assurthe ance on that. I think this will be like the stateonly ment by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). How can rely on it? How long was it before the amounts cited by the Treasurer went up another SlOOm? Unfortunately, on this occasion I think it will case of the amount going down. That is what are worried about. I want to emphasise that road costs have increased at a faster rate than the implicit price deflator. Thefiguresfor the past triennium will prove this. The honourable memgeneral ber for Shortland (Mr Morris) has pointed this out already. Petrol price increases will yield another for the Government this year. It could use some of that money to create employment. The ond Government has asked us where the money opporwould come from. It could have obtained another $24m from Utah when it lifted the coal tax. The Government asked us to teU it where the money was going to come from. It could use that has money to create some jobs. The Minister ought to have another look at this. He ought to view it in the perspective of aU the problems facing Austraha. I have outlined an opportunity for creating jobs. If the Government have is sincere its supporters should go back to the the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and say: 'The Opposition has told me what to do. There are plenty of roads out there. get Work on them would create jobs. We will get the back to school. We will not have them bogged down in the country. They can do their as studies. We will have a better road system as well. We will do as the Bureau teUs us. We will a gain a 3.9 per cent increases on our investment'. Debate interrupted. STATES GRANTS (HOUSING ASSISTANCE) BILL Notice of Intentiontopresent a Bill The Acting Deputy Clerk- I have received the Minister Assisting the Treasurer a ting a of his intention to present at the next sitStates Grants (Housmg Assistance) Bill. the AusSTATES GRANTS (ROADS) BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed.",63
164,Mr SIMON,PUBUCATIONS COMMITTEE,"The Bill be the House is the States Grants (Roads) Bill 1977. By way of this Bill the Commonwealth wiU contribute funds for the construction and maintenance of roads in Austraha. The payments will be made pursuant to section 96 of the Constitution as non-repayable interest free advances to State governments. These funds form part of the total contribution made by States and we local governments for roads throughout Australia. For each of the three years the Australian Government will provide $475m. It be a should be noted, however, that the Government we has undertaken to ensure that the sum of $475m in 1977-78 will be repeated in the two ensuing years in real terms. The actual increase in the next twofinancialyears will be determined in a budgetary context but will be at least equivalent in value to the current year's funds. I must refer here to the comments made by the $ 180m honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) who quoted selectively from the secreading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) in relation to the indexation of grants for 1978-79 and 1979-80. But the honourable member omitted to quote one significant paragraph, which I should like to quote. The Minister stated: Generally I would not anticipate any drasdc alterations the adjustments derived by use proposed and the overall effect of the proposed arrangements will be a substantial basic guarantee to the States. It is worthwhile noting the emphasis which granted. should be placed on the word 'guarantee', as a guarantee has been given by the Minister to the States for those two further years. Honourable members will be aware that the State governments will be required by this legislation to match the Commonwealth expenditure on a quota basis. To the $475m from the CommonNew South Wales wealth the States will be required to contribute Victoria . . . . under this quota $418.8m. Payments have been made to the States for road expenditure since Western Australia 1923. In that year $lm was paid to the States on a dollar-for-dollar basis. It is obvious that since that time the Commonwealth contribution has increased substantially. It is true also that State and local government contributions for roads have increased substantially since 1923. In this speech I shall deal only with local government responsibihty for roads in Victoria. Rural Arterial roads . . In 1975 the old Bureau of Roads recommended Rural Local roads . . that the Commonwealth contribution towards Urban Arterial roads road funds be 33 per cent, the State government Urban Local roads . . contribution be 36 per cent and the local governMITERS . . . ment contribution 31 per cent. In 1975 the Federal Government, with a $ 15,264m income, paid 32.8 per cent of road costs in Victoria. The State Government, with an income of $2,965m paid very 35.9 per cent of road costs in Victoria that year. Local government, with an Australian income $852m, paid 31.3 per cent of the road costs Victoria that year. The municipal Association of Victoria suggested a plan-the MAV plan- of which required the Commonwealth to contribute 50 per cent, the State Government 35 per cent and local government only 15 per cent. In supgovernment port of its plan the Municipal Association of toria argued that municipaUties could expand road building without increasing rates. The Minister, in announcing the 1977-78 funding for roads, identified the problems which local government had been experiencing in the past in coping with its responsibihty for roads, particularly in the rural arterial, rural local urban local road categories. Accordingly the Government increased the funds for rural arterial roads in Victoria by 158 per cent, for the rural local roads category by 78 per cent and funds for the urban local roads category 93 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave incorporate in Hansard two tables, one which sets out the Government's untied grants to local government by way of the 1.52 per cent share of personal income tax collections and the second, to which sets out the road funds allocated in of the price deflator Victoria.",66

166,Mr SIMON,VICTORIA,"The intention of the Commonwealth in allocating substantially increased funds for local government road responsibihty is clear. However, in Victoria the local government authorities have not received percentage of increases in the categories to which I have in referred. In some cases the councils have not received sufficient funds to meet increased costs construction and maintenance. This situation arises because the State Government has chosen to allocate its quota of funds away from local into other road categories. Let me Vicmake it clear that the State Government had everyrightto do so. However, I make the point to ensure that local government authorities are aware that the Commonwealth Government's support for the local government road funding has been frustrated by the State Government's reallocation. Funding for roads in the local and government categories has fallen away over the past four years. Local government does not have the same capacity to raisefinanceas have the funds State and Federal governments. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads gives an excellent sumby mary of the problems of local government in its to report. In paragraph 3.48 the report states: The issues of major concern to the Local Government Authorities are: (a) the effects of inflation on their road functions their inability to combat cause they derive funds from their own taxing only annually. (b) insufficient recognition that they are directly the road industry and are responsible for the length of the road systems; and, (c) given the magnitude of their road responsibilities the many other calls on their own revenue, equacy offinancialassistance that they the other levels of Government. The increase in cost of road construction has been rapid that that ofinflation . . . The position of local government is further heightened if we consider that municipaUties have direct responsibility for 83.5 per cent of the nation's 822,000 kilometres of roads. The Australian Council of Local Government Associations submits in its road policy for 1977 that the Commonwealth's share of funding has fallen from 2.9 per cent of all outlays in 1969-70 to 2.3 per cent in 1975-76. On the other hand, the States' share has fallen from 5.3 per cent in 1969-70 to 3.7 per cent in 1974-75. Despite the restraints on pubUc spending and our desire to control inflation, the Government has increased Commonwealth spending on roads by $38.3m in comparison with its allocation last year. Honourable members will recall the terms of the Budget with regard to payments to the States. The Treasurer said, in Budget Paper No. 1: In line with the offer made by the Prime Minister Premiers' Conference in July, provision has been made for the States to receive $4,336.lm under the tax sharing rangements in respect of 1977-78. I note that this is over $90m more than the estimate what the States would have been entitled to under sharing legislation. Despite the increase in the funds made available to the State governments and despite the fact that the Victorian Government completed the consult lastfinancialyear with a surplus, it has refused take note of the urgent need for funds in those categories of roads for which local government responsible. The Victorian Minister has chosen to explain the position of the State Government in the following terms: . . . in order to ensure a responsible approach toria's road requirements overall by preserving a balance road funding and to maintain the road assets already place, the State Government has been forced to allocate its own funds so as to redress the obvious inequalities Commonwealth funding. Unfortunately, that statement is rather typical of the State Government's spokesman whose appetite for Federal funds can never be satiated. One must ask the question on behalf of the 811 incorporated local government authorities whether governments take an objective view on the subject of road funding. Roads falling within certain and categories are generally the responsibihty of one this problem as it occurs besource or other of the three spheres of government. There are some overlaps. For example, national part of roads are the responsibihty of the Commongreatest wealth and local and rural arterial roads are in general terms the responsibility of local governand ment authority. Roads form one part of the total the inadresources of our community. In the total area, receive from Commonwealth, State and local governments have shared duties and responsibiUties. Might it more not be prudent therefore to define clearly the areas of responsibility for particular road categories and for the Commonwealth to make whatever arrangements are necessary to ensure that local government, for example, receives the funds allocated to it in the proportions determined by the Commonwealth. That does not represent a breakdown in federaUsm; it is a recognition that local government is the third tier of government in Australia with a hefty responsibility for road maintenance and construction. The fiscal entitlements of local government should be assured rather than be subjected to the whims of its two government partners. It is not beyond the wit of government to compute the means by which local government receives a percentage of the gross national receipts for distribution in road categories, pursuant to the expert analyses of the respective States Grants Commissions. The Commonwealth Government at the need not and, indeed, should not be involved in arinquiring into detailed priorities or programs of works to be undertaken by local councils. of Detailed work and planning must be left in the the tax hands of local government and road board authorities in each State. This Bill provides for the establishment of planning committees. The Federal Minister will State Ministers on that initiative. It will to be up to the States to implement the terms of the Bill. The planning committees may be estabis lished as an alternative to the present system of program approval. If that is done, local government must be represented on those committees and receive an entitlement to membership proto Vicportional to its area of responsibility. I commend in the terms of this Bill to the House but in conin clusion I register my concern that the position of of the local government in the total road funding structure be guaranteed.",67
167,Mr CHARLES JONES,VICTORIA,"In the few minutes remaining to me to take part in the discussion on the States Grants (Roads) Bill, I want to confine my remarks to a all few particular points rather than to develop a complete transport policy or to emphasise how roads should fit into a transport policy. Obviously the Government does not have a transport policy. The former Labor Government was endeavouring to draw up an overall transport policy so that transport would be looked upon as having one identity rather than as being a series of transport modes, including aviation, rail, road, and sea transport. A country such as Austraha cannot afford that sort of luxury. I regret very much that the Minister for Transport (MT Nixon) has not proceeded with the Inter-State Commission. I have an idea that he would have liked to have the Inter-State Commission in existence today. The Bill which proposed the establishment of the Commission was introduced by me, but it finished up the Minister's Bill. We accepted the amendments which the Minister proposed because he allowed the Labor Government to have what it wanted, namely, a transport interstate commission. The sooner this country gets an interstate commission the sooner we will get a much better transport system under which the mode of transport which needs assistance will receive it; the mode of transport which is most economical will receive the assistance and the support of the Government To continue with the hit and miss policy that is being pursued today and which was pursued over the 23 years that governments of the political complexion of the present Government were in office can lead only to disaster for this country. We need an efficient, economically operated transport system because of the large part that the cost of transport plays in the overall price structure in this country. Once again I regret that the Government has not done something positive about putting together a genuine, integrated transport system with oversight by an interstate commission which has the power to issue directions as to what should be done and to give very good, sound advice to the Australian Minister for Transport, whoever he may be. In that way we could overcome the situation as exists in Tasmania in which wefiddlearound with the problems associated with transport and do a lot of pork barrelling, not only in the transport area but in other areas. I come back to the Bill. I have not paid the Minister the courtesy of showing him a table have here and which I shaU seek to have incorporated in Hansard. I did not know that I wouldsued. get to speak in the debate. The table shows the amounts of money that have been allocated over the last 23 years for roads and the amounts money collected in fuel tax. I seek leave to haveget the table incorporated in Hansard.",68

169,Mr CHARLES JONES,COLLECTED ON AUTOMOTIVE PETROL AND,"I thank the Minister for his courtesy. The table also shows, incidentally, a percentage calculated according to the amount of money aUocated and the amount of road funds collected. Whenever we discuss a Bill concerned with roads I think that that sort of information should be brought clearly to the attention of the community as a whole. Attention should also be drawn to the amount of money being raised by way of petrol tax, to use the name by which it is commonly known, and the amount of money that is allocated for roads. I do not know whether the Minister is still proposing toI go ahead with the roU-on or roU-over program rather than to pursue the old poUcies that we purUnder those policies a program for three years or five years, whatever it may be, is drawn up. At the end of that time everything comes to a ofhalt, and the States and the Commonwealth then into a hassel over what wiU happen in the following three years. The result is that interim legislation is introduced into this place, and rushed through the Parliament. That is the ation which arose when we introduced an interim Bill to give the States money for the quarter of thisfinancialyear. That was done back in June 1977.1 hope the Minister will use the planning provisions of section 18,1 to give that sort of continuity to the States so that at least they, as the road constructing authorities, will know where they are going and what moneys they have. The economic planning be well prepared in advance so that they can on with the job. Another matter to which I wish to refer is amount of money that has been provided for national highways. I am delighted that Government is still adhering to the Labor Wollongong, Government's policy of the national Governser ment accepting its responsibilities in planning, financing and developing national highways. the responsibihty of the Australian Government to make sure that this country has a genuine national highway No. 1. A few years ago I took thetimeto drive from Cairns to Brisbane. For three parts of that journey- I refuse to call road-it was a series of potholes. from Townsville to Cairns in particular is a onetrack road which is in one holy hell of a mess. That is the only way it can be described. That allocation members representing the area are doing nothtrue ing about it is beyond my comprehension. I am pleased that the Government has done somesay, thing positive about it by including in the national highways program a reasonable thought amount of money for it. No doubt the States will be complaining that they are not getting relation sufficient for their local roads or for their roads. The facts are that this Parliament is a national national parliament, and it should have national transport policy. If we are to have national roads, someone must build them. The way previous governments were progressing and with the Hume Highway prior to 1972-at the rate that New South Wales and Victoria were upgrading the road- I think we worked it out thattimethat it would take them something like 130 years to upgrade it. With the amount money that is provided now, at least they will able to get on with the job. I am pleased to note that the Government has square allocated a reasonable amount for the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program. This was one of the Labor Government s initiatives in road safety, to make sure that adequate money was being proroads. vided for road safety improvements. I give the previous Liberal-Country Party Government degree, credit for agreeing to the setting up of the House situof Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. It was re-appointed during our first term of government. It has been re-appointed again. I think that Committee is doing a good job in bringing to the attention of the Government think it is, various aspects of road safety. I do not know whether the Minister will avail himself ofhisrightto reply, but I would like from him some explanation on one matter that concan cerns me. Why has New South Wales been get allocated only $3.3m, when Victoria has been allocated $3.5m and Queensland has been the allocated $2.6m? New South Wales is the most populous State, with the largest concentrations the of populations in Sydney, Newcastle and as against Melbourne with, to a lesdegree, Bendigo and Ballarat. It seems strange to me that Victoria should be getting It ismore money than New South Wales. We tried to apportion the money on the needs of the States, without playing politics in any way whatsoever. I would like some explanation as to why Victoria is entitled to $200,000 more for road safety it a improvements than what New South Wales has The section been allocated. The other point I make is that the Labor Government was criticised because it reduced its to the States for rural local roads. It is that we did. We created a new category called urban local roads which, I am pleased to the Government has maintained and for which it has allocated a reasonable amount. We we had an understanding with the States that they would pick up their responsiblities into rural local roads and that we would urban withdraw from that area and concentrate on roads. I believe it is the responsibility of a the Federal Government to concentrate on national highways, their maintenance and construction, major commercial and export roads the construction of main roads in the form of urban and arterial highways; the States should pick up the responsibilities for the local urban at roads or the rural urban roads. They did not. They left us holding the bag, so to speak. The of Government has got square with them now. It be has provided large sums of money for their rural local roads but has cut back the States on their other arterial roads. The Government has got point. with them in another area.

Dur Mr ing the debate which preceded the vote of the House on his motion I reminded the House that the incorporation of unread material in Hansard is a matter on which the Speaker may exercise discretion. Even though the House may agree the incorporation of a document, it is the practice for the Speaker to reject any document which is illegible, is so voluminous that its incorporation would unduly delay the production of the daily Hansard or would be too costly to produce. The question of whether it contains exyou pressions which, if used in debate, would regarded as unparliamentary is a different issue. chamber. The Speaker may exercise discretion when the incorporation is by leave, but when, as in this case, the House by motion, after suspension of Standing Orders, votes for the incorporation of a document, the discretion which the Speaker exercise on that consideration is overridden. propose to bring this latter point before the Standing Orders Committee. I have examined the document which subject of the motion moved by the honourable member for Mackellar. Certain parts of the script are illegible. Other parts carry handwritten emendations or alternative phraseology. discussed the matter with the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, and he has assured me that the document would not be accepted by the Government Printer for inclusion in Hansard, on the basis of technical considerations.

Mr Street replied: I do not know where the honourable member got his figures for the petrol consumption of the cars. I replied: From the Commonwealth drivers themselves. The Minister said that he would check the matter country out. This morning a report in the Daily rectly. Telegraph stated: A spokesman for the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Withers, who manages the government nied the claims. He said the Government was moving away from eight cylinder cars into more economical sue and four cylinder vehicles. The Fairmonts were bought recently to replace Fairlanes, the spokesman said. It is Then Senator Withers made the stupid sort of remark that we have come to expect from him. I checked with the Commonwealth car drivers to find out whether what I had been told was true. What happened before was that I noticed that there were a number of new cars in the Comthe monwealth pool. I asked the drivers what they were like. Three of them said the same thing on different days. They said that they were beautiful cars but they had tofillthem up at least twice a day. They had to go back to the bowsers and fill up because they were doing 11 to 12 miles per gallon. That was the basis of my question in Today I asked two drivers about the cars. They both made the same statement as was made the They said the cars were consuming at a rate of between 11 and 14 miles per by comparison with the previous cars consumed petrol at 23 miles per gallon. Perhaps this is a minor issue. It seems to be fairly It is significant because this ADJOURNMENT Government at the moment is apparendy basing whole uranium policy on the shortage of energy. The President of the United States of America, Mr Carter, sawfitin April this year to issue an energy statement in which he made a significant attempt to remove from American roads vehicles which consumed a considerable amount of petrol. I quote from an article in the Australian of 22 April 1977 which referred to the energy policy introduced by President Carter. It tax would begin at $52 on cars that get 18 miles to the gallon and progress to $449 on cars that are less fuelEach year the efficiency standard would go up by one mile in conserving per gallon and the tax would increase. At the same time, buyers of 1978 cars which do 18 miles to cars the gallon would get government rebates of $47. The rebates would progress to $473 on cars which are more fuel-efficient, with efficiency standards and rebates going up from year to year. I refer to President Carter's energy statement. He said: The citizens who insist on driving large, unnecessarily powerful cars must expect to pay more for that luxury. We can be sure that all the special interest groups in the will attack the part of this plan that affects them diThey will say that sacrifice isfine,as long as other people do it, but that their sacrifice is unreasonable, or unfair, or harmful to the country. If they succeed, then the burden of the ordinary citizen, who is not organised into an carfleet,deinterest group, would be crushing. The point is that the Government must set an example in fuel consumption. Unless it does, the ordinary people of Austraha will not bother to Ford buy vehicles which will consume less petrol. This is a disgraceful example of the hypocrisy which occurs in government. It is telling the rest community to conserve energy while it is purenue chasing cars consuming 11 to 12 miles per gallon.allows",72

I suggest that whatever money was expended by the Civic Reform team and, for that matter, independent candidates in the New ParSouth Wales elections, would have been an expended out of their own pockets and from is in fund raising activities. I suggest that the for Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr as Frank Walker, the member for Georges River, not necessarily raise his funds in that manner.

All honourable members know and the people of New South Wales know that it was because of the Liberal National Country Party Government in this place that the rates in New South Wales were kept to a basic minimum. He went on to tell the electors in Georges River that it was because of what the Wran Labor Government had done. He solicited support and votes for Labor candidates in Georges River. He was only one. The Labor member for Ashfield did the same thing. He used taxpayers' money by using parliamentary stationery to canvass votes for Labor candidates. What is more, the Labor member for Ashfield possibly bordered on an infringement of the Electoral Act because he solicited postal votes in his electorate. What about the Labor member for Hurstville, Mr Kevin Ryan? He did the same thing. This type of activity would cost money for the Civic Reform team. They are honest men. They use their ownfinances,unlike the Labor Party candidates who use taxpayers' money to solicit votes. My colleagues on this side of the House are absolutely astounded. I am not astounded. It is what we have come to expect from Labor candidates in New South Wales, whether State, municipal or, with respect, Federal candidates.

I was very displeased at the way the honourable member for Evans attacked Ministers in the New South Wales Government. After the Civic Reform Party was formed the numbers in the City Council were 17 to three. There had to be a change but the honourable member for Evans seems to think that he knows more than I do about this matter. What he said was petty. He knows that he is a oncer. I am a bit disgusted that he says these things so seriously. Tonight I wish to discuss an issue of importance in Sydney; that is, kindergartens. There are 12 kindergartens in the electorate of Sydney and approximately 520 kindergartens are controlled by the Kindergarten Union of New South Wales. There are many more run by religious and private organisations. Correspondence on the matter of inadequate pre-school funding was sent to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) in August and September. I have received an acknowledgement but no answer. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard copies of correspondence and telegrams to the Minister for Social Security and a table of statistics relating to the allocation of funds to pre-schools in Australia. I have shown these documents to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) who is at the table.",75
197,Mr SPEAKER,COLLECTED ON AUTOMOTIVE PETROL AND,"Order! Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The documents read asfollows15 August 1977 Senator The Honourable M. G. M. Guilfoyle Minister for Social Security, The Senate, Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600 Mr Dear Minister, I am writing to you urging your reconsideration of the recent Budget decision to limit recurrent pre-school grants for the next financial year to the 1976-77 level. In addition to this I ask that measures be taken immediately to prevent the continuation of the serious funding disadvantage which has been experienced by New South Wales in the past. In the 1977-78 Budget no provision has been made for the indexing of recurrent pre-school funding with the CPI with the result that pre-school funding over the next financial year represents an overall decrease in real terms. In regard to New South Wales in particular the grants for the present quarter are now being distributed and represent a rate of 53 per cent of salaries as at 1 November 1976 (or 49 per cent of actual current salaries). If allowed to continue this cut in pre-school funding will have disasterous consequences for pre-schoolers and their families in Australia. In New South Wales 520 non-profit kindergartens will either be forced to double their fees or half of them will be forced to close. At greatest risk are those centres built with Australian Government funds in areas of high need that is Mt Druitt and Macquarie Fields, where the present parent contribution is already at optimum level and the increases necessary to bridge the gap will place the pre-school beyond the reach of all but a very few families. For these reasons I ask you to seriously reconsider your decision regarding pre-school funding in the coming financial year, especially funding for the deteriorating and long neglected New South Wales pre-schools. Only then will the Government's responsibility for this area be honoured and an imminent crisis m pre-school education be averted. ToMSGR NA NA Parliament House, Canberra, ACT In less than 20 months your Government has progressively abandoned its responsibility for adequate preschool funding by reducing preschool teachers 49 per cent. In my electorate all of the preschools are facing a fee rise from about $5 to $17 a week a rise which will force most inner city children away from the preschool because their parents just couldn't afford to pay that much. The result will be either the replacement dren of wealthier parents or the closure of many of the preschools. I urge you to take immediate action to stop preschools from once again becoming restricted to those who can afford them rather than being made available to those who need them.

The honourable member for Mackellar has already read enough to show that this is the same document which was tabled in the Senate in April last year. document would clearly not be able to be read now because of the sub judice rule. Since that time proceedings have been set down in the preme Court of the Australian Capital Territory involving the matters which are the subject of this document.

One of them has already been set down for trial. I say that because I have checked with the Senate papers and the document which has now been already. tabled in the House is, insofar as it is legible, identical with the document which the President that of the Senate refused to allow to be incorporated in the Senate Hansard but which, pursuant to a of the Senate, was tabled in that place on April last year. A reference can be found in Hansard at page 1373. At that stage it might have been said that the sub judice rule did not apply because, although writs had been issued, pleadings had not been concluded and causes had not been set down for trial. Now there are about half a dozen causes which have been set down for trial. Accordingly, I submit this is a very clear case of the sub judice rule applying. Once a speech is recorded in Hansard, including quotations from other documents, that speech and those documents can be reported in the newspapers.

In those circumstances, while the honourable member for Mackellar is reading only from that document, I would contend that irrespective of the issues that might subsequently have been issued in the courts, this matter is not That sub judice; it is a matter which is already published. It is already a matter which is available and therefore we are in a position where, Su-while the honourable member for Mackellar is reading from that document, it should be capable of being read into Hansard in that way. of duty Mr LIONEL BOWEN - On the same point of order, I appreciate your lack of patience at times but I want to draw attention to the fact that the motion says that the honourable gentleman is to read the document. Therefore, we are not talking about the reading of the document; we are talking about comments being made in of a debate this afternoon, which is a much wider discussion. It can well be infringing the sub judice rule. Therefore, the point of order we are making is that it is in no way related to the reading of the document; it is related to the canvassing of a debate that has taken place here The point of order that has been taken is that it is encompassed by the sub judice rule. It is in no way related to the actual reading of the document.",82
286,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The point that the honourable gehdeman makes about referring to an earlier debate has been covered by the motion, which enables the honourable member for Mackellar to refer to a debate earlier today. As to the sub judice point, I will listen to the honourable member for Mackellar and if I feel it necessary to interrupt, I will do so. I call the honourable member for Mackellar. Mr Morris-On a further point of order, Mr Speaker.",83
287,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,It continues: We participated in the 197S Baghdad International Trade Fair,83
288,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Shortland is taking a point of order. Mr Morris- Mr Speaker, my point of order relates to the document that was tabled by the honourable member today. I understood that under the forms of the House the documents were tabled for the benefit of members of the House. I have sought without success to examine the document. It is not available to members on this side of the House who wish to see it ",83
289,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is only one document. It was available and I am sure was seen by the Leader of the Opposition. I have it now in my possession. There is not point of order. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.,83
290,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"The document continues: We participated in the 1975 Baghdad International Trade Fair and introduced 40 major Australian companies to the fair with the purpose of developing trade in the area. As a result of this, I spend most of mytimein Middle ern countries. I was resident in Beirut until the Civil War there made it impossible to operate from Beirut. The trade activities were actively encouraged tralian Government of the day and were well known to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and the Treasury and various other Ministers as well as the Trade Department officials and the ambassadorial staff of the Australian embassies of the areas concerned. We therefore knew Mr Whitlam very well and we kept him informed of our projects and prospects and so forth. During the elections I received a phone call from Mr Reuben Scarf, Chairman of the Scarf organisation, who informed me that Mr Whitlam wanted to meet him regarding funds and possible help from friendly sources to help in the elections. I then replied to Reuben: 'Well, you know him better than I do. Why don't you contact him?' Mr Scarf said: 'It seemed a litde more involved than that. I don't want to see Mr Whitlam. You see him'. Mr Scarf talked from the home of Mick Malouf, where he was spending the afternoon. During that afternoon Mr Bill Hartley arrived at my home in Blues Point Tower and said he wanted to talk to me about a very important matter, and it was better to go in the park and talk rather than to stay in the apartment, because of CIA bugging these days. We walked near the harbour park outside the building. He then expressed disappointment that Mr Scarf would not meet Mr Whitlam and thought it was somewhat of an affront. I then mentioned to Mr Hartley that Mr Scarf would definitely not meet Mr Whitlam as he had talked to him on the phone and had asked me to see Mr Whitlam in his stead. Mr Hartley then left, apparendy to talk to Mr Whitlam. Mr Hartley said it was very important, as the CIA was pouring millions into Austraha, and the Labor Pany had no money and therefore would welcome assistance from friendly countries like the Arab world. He said the party needed $2m. Mr Hanley said: 'Of course, it would be difficult to get money from Saudi Arabia but we could get money from Kuwait, Libya and Iraq. He would write to Yasser Arafat to get his endorsement so that funds can be quickly provided by the Arab leaders and time would not be wasted in order to quickly bring funds to help in the campaign. Mr Keith Johnson- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It seems to me that the Government of this nation has far more important things to deal with than to listen to a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale from the honourable gentleman.",83
291,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order. The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.,83
292,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mr Hartley continued: ' I will go and see Mr Whitlam now and will not tell him that Reubenrefusedto see him' . . . Mr E. G. Whitlam- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My name has now been mentioned in the document which the honourable gentleman is reading and I again draw you attention to the Eastsub judice rule. I have taken proceedings against the Murdoch papers and the Fairfax papers on the basis of allegations to which this document, by the Aus- unsigned, annotated by an unknown hand, refers. Very clearly, if this document is allowed to be read in the Parliament and thus appears in Hansard it can be reported in the papers and prejudice the fair trial of causes which have been set down for hearing.",83
293,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I am very concerned about the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Quite clearly-and I have said this before in this House-the application of the sub judice rule should not be such as would prevent discussion of matters of national importance in the Parliament but it also should not be such as would prejudice the fair trial of an issue. The Leader of the Opposition has told me that this is a civil action set down for trial and ready for trial. I am very anxious that dice the fair trial of that matter. I do not what the allegation is that has given rise to the action of the Leader of the Opposition. This material being presented by the honourable member for Mackellar would be admissible in evidence in any action which Leader of the Opposition has brought against anybody other than somebody who has used these terms.

Details of other staff changes are not immediately available. However, consistent with Government policy, there has 531,500 been a reduction in the number of positions in Departmental libraries overall. d.

The unclas^ available to the able member's questions: (I) The Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education recommended a program of assistance to State TAFE systems and institutions for the period July 1974(Question No. 1392) December 1975. The program was later extended to December 1976. Under the new three-year rolling program further allocations have been made for the of TAFE in the States for 1977 and 1978, with indicative planning guidelines for 1979 and 1980. The following table sets out the amounts paid to the States for what works did the TAFE since 1 July 1974. GovernGRANTS TO THE STATES FOR TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION (a) $m Recurrent Capital Total and what assistance has it 1974-75 . . . 24.6 20.4 45.0 1975-76 . . . 40.1 24.6 64.7 1976-77 . . . 44.2 33.7 77.9 1977-78(b) . . . . . 44.9 41.3 86.2 (a) Includes expenditure under programs of assistance commenced prior to the establishment of the Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education, e.g. capital grants under the States Grants (Technical Training) for, CommonAct 1971-73. (b) Budget estimates (Figures are in June 1977 price levels and do not include amounts to be paid on account of cost supplementation). and (2) Comprehensive national information is not available on therelationshipbetween gross enrolments (some students enrol in more than one course) and individual student parnumbers in technical and further education. Gross enrolments in TAFE courses administered by government eduauthorities in the States and Territories during 1975 numbered 684,380, of which 514,642 were enrolments in vocationally oriented courses. From information provided by TAFE authorities in five States, the then Technical and River; Further Education Commission estimated the number of individual participants in TAFE courses in 1975 at approxi550,000. In the same year, 148,338 students were enWambo, rolled in Australian universities. Any comparison of these statistics should take account of the differences between universities and TAFE institutions both in the basis of their statistical reporting and in the nature of the courses for which students enrof Statistics of university studentsrelateto students enrolled as at 30 April of a given year; enrolment statistics in the TAFE sector refer to all enrolments registered in TAFE courses at anytimedur(Question No. 104) ing the year up to 31 October. Moreover, the latter include a substantial number of enrolments in courses of less than one length, as well as a considerably higher proportion of part-time enrolments than in universities. (3) and (4) The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations prepares short and medium term assessments on of employment prospects in a wide range of professional, semi-professional, technical, skilled and semi-skilled occupations. These assessments, which are prepared primarily to assist the operation of the Government's major manpower programmes, are published. Copies are available in the Parliamentary Library.
