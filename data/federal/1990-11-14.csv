2,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"1 start by lodging my protest at the use .of the guillotine on this very important pIece of legislation, the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990. We are talking about the acquisition by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia of the State Bank of Victoria in a deal worth $1.6 billion, one of the biggest in Australia's corporate history, and yet we get an hour or an hour and a half to discuss a matter of very considerable moment. It is a damning indictment of this Government that it cannot· so organise its affairs that we can have proper parliamentary scrutiny of this important legislation. Thirty-nine Bills being rammed through the Parliament shows an absolute contempt for the Parliament. As I say, the Government deserves the sharpest possible criticism for its management of the business of the House. There is inadequate time to consider this Bill. We had a great raft of legislation brought in on Thursday night. Many honourable members had busy commitments in their electorates over the weekend. We have barely had time to read the legislation and we certainly have had very little opportunity to discuss it amongst ourselves. We had virtually no opportunity to confer with the third parties who will be very °much affected by this legislation. Lastly, we had very little time for proper debate within the Parliament. This is a recipe for bad legislation. The Government thinks that it is saving time but it is not. That is false economy. What will happen with some of this legislation is that we will be back here in three or six months cleaning up the mistakes made by the inadequacies of the process and opportunities provided for honourable members to properly examine this legislation. In most cases I must say that it is incompetence that brings us into these circumstances where inadequate time is given to review this legislation. On this occasion it is not just incompetence; it is also laced with political convenience. How it su-ts this Labor Government to try to restnct and gag debate on the very important question of the future of the Commonwealth Bank and its partial privatisation. The Government does not want to debate it for the very simple reason that it is torn apart on whether or not it ought to be supporting this measure. Where is the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker)? He ought to be in here. He has been full of talk about how he is opposed to privatisation. I see that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) is here. I hope he brought down that sign that he has in his office window which proclaims his support for the Commonwealth Bank. Let us hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh calling for a division. Let us see whether or not these Labor members really do have a sense of political conviction. It will be a very significant test for these people. What will it be? Convicti-n and commitment to what they have saId that they stand for, or political coward-ce? Their moment of truth arid crunch tIme is about to come. The honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), the ex-Minister, said that it was the blackest day in a hundred years for the Labor Party that it should undermine and erode the two jewels in the crownthe Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Commonwealth Bank. Where is he? This is another test, a test of his political courage or political cowardice. The former Minister, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), said that the Government has absolutely no mandate for this proposal. Let us see the ex-Minister come into this Parliament and tell us whether he is a man of political courage or a man of political cowardice. These people are full of talk and rhetoric about their political views. Let us see whether, after a lifetime of politics espousing these views, they really do measure up to their past stated positions. Whilst for some members in Labor's Left it will be a matter of principle and a very harsh test in the end, I must say that matters of principle are of very little interest to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). They have had a lot of practice at hypocrisy in recent years. The Prime Minister was the one who said on 21 September 1989 in an address entitled the 'Light on the Hill' - honourable members should hold their sides when they hear this one: What in the name of reason is the jus.tification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas . . . But as the people of Australia come to realise the extent of the economic and social vandalism proposed by our opponents-and indeed as party of the process of promoting that awareness-it will be necessary for us-Ben Chifley's heirs and successors-to keep fresh and green the memory, the example and the experience of this great Australian. That claim went out the door. Here is the man who said that it would be social and economic vandalism if we sold the Commonwealth Bank, and here is the legislation to do that. The Treasurer is great on hyperbole. Exaggeration knows no bounds when it comes to the Treasurer on issues like this. He said back on 23 May 1985: No matter where one looks, whether it be at TAA or the other authorities, there is no case fo'r Opposition's argument in economics, except simply to indulge ideologically in Thatcherite, vandalistic splurge to try and destroy these authorities. Five years ago we had the Treasurer saying that there is no case in economics, but he is back in here promoting the very sale of the Commonwealth Bank which he said was economic vandalism. It just shows what the Treasurer knows about economics; saying one thing one day and another the next. What did the Prime Minister say to the people of South Australia. on the question of privatisation back in November 1985? When it comes to running a political argument for political purposes, there is no equal to the Prime Minister. He said: . . . privatisation would be an expensive and disastrous experiment. That is just a few short years ago and yet here he is proposing the opposite stance. What hypocrisy it is for these people to come in and put this proposition. I will just ram home the point. When one has been Treasurer for seven or eight years, a lot of comments are on the public record. Here is another one from the Treasurer. He said: (The sale of) the Commonwealth Bank or . . . the Australian Industry Corporation or Trans Australian Airlines . . . is simply vandalism of Australia's great public authorities . . . I want the Treasurer to explain his hypocrisy and reconcile the absolutely conflic-­ ing remarks that he has made on thlS important subject.",9
3,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,Tell us your position.,10
4,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"I will be very interested to here from the honourable for Banks. He is full of talk about how he is opposed to privatisation. Let us see him call for a division and walk across to this side of the House; let him start his political career that way. Let me challenge, invite and taunt this member. He is a new member full of idealism about what he will do for the great Labor cause. Let us see him put his money where his mouth is. I bet him two bob that he will be sitting with me when the time comes for voting on the this legislation. That is something that he ought not forget. I would be very interested to hear him go down and explain his hypocrisy to the people who thought that they were putting in a traditional Labor member when they put him into this place.",10
5,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,The people of Banks: not the private banks. .,10
6,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"If the people of Banks really knew the honourable member, he would not be here. In May 1985 the Treasurer said in this Parliament: The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth. Again, there is page after page and transcript after transcript of hypocrisy, day in and day out from this Government. I challenge honourable members on the Government side. Let them demonstrate what it is going to be: political cowardice or political courage. Of course, it is not just a question of hypocrisy; it is also a question of integrity. We had an election in this country only a few short months ago-in March 1990. In that election, there was a debate about privatisation. The position of the Opposition has been absolutely consistent all along the way. We have certainly led the debate on privatisation. We have had a clear policy in support of privatisation going back some years. But in the last election, the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, the bank employees' union, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), asking whether the Government was in favour of privati sation. He wrote back and said that this Labor Government was opposed to privatisation. Union members, like the fools that they must be, believed what the Prime Minister said. He gave the answer to them in writing and, of course, gave a promise to that union, which has egg on its face after spending its members' money on a campaign, only to find that the bank has been privati sed or partially privati sed lowing the election. In considering this Bill, the coalition has effectively disregarded many of the motives and reasons that have been advanced and which have, in fact, motivated the Government to take the action that it has. There is much wrong with this proposal. There are many deficiencies and inadequacies in it. I must say that the Government, in a sense has, for all the wrong reasons and in all the wrong ways, come to a decision which, however, in the end we will support. It is a shoddy political deal just to cue the Premier of Victoria. She has the real problems, as I am sure that most Victorians and now most Australians understand. One of her problems is the massive losses and huge debts which were incurred under the Cain Labor Government. As a result of that, she has been under some real fiscal pressure to do something about her Budget and to meet the liabilities which her Government has incurred. For her, that is a very difficult thing. So we saw the farce in the last Victorian Budget. The Government said that it would cut back on government expenditure and that it would cut out 8,000 jobs. Then we found that some of those jobs had never actually been filled. They were a complete figment of her imagination. The Treasury has been saying that this is a banking crisis. That is absolute nonsense. There was no banking crisis here. The only one was the one engineered by the Treasurer to suit the political convenience of the State Government in Victoria. The CrISIS has been in the administration of Victoria and the Government's woeful record in creating debt. The fact is that the Treasurer, in going this way, has only gone part of the way. We, as an incoming government, will certainly go for 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. The tendering process is a highly questionable process and one which I think should bear much closer scrutiny. I was not involved in the tendering process. In that sense, it is difficult for me to assess. But I come to a pretty obvious conclusion folthat, if we put two and two together, the truth is that in the end the Commonwealth had no choice but to be the instrument to perform this rescue of the State Bank. Whatever is said about the tendering process, it seems that not enough notice was given. The whole process appeared to be biased to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank finally picked up the State Bank in this deal. Why was that? The reason for that is straightforward. If Joan Kirner were to deal with the socialist Left in Victoria, she could not sell the State res- Bank to anybody but the Commonwealth Bank because for her that would be the adoption of privatisation, which would be absolute anathema to the Socialist Left. As everybody knows, the Socialist Left reallY calls the tune in Victoria. Joan Kirner is the first Socialist Left Premier that we have had. She and John Halfpenny, in tandem through the Labor Party, run Victoria. That is why Senator Robert Ray, the Government's own Minister for Defence, described Victoria as 'the Albania of Australia'. It is a backwater: Dr Charlesworth-Where do you come from?",10
7,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"We get the best and worse from Victoria. I must say that it is a matter of some ,concern-the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) ought to take the smile off his face because the deteriorating economic situation in Victoria ought to be of concern to every Australian. The recession, in a sense, started in Geelong and Melbourne. It is wiping out the traded goods sector in this country. Investment is dropping like a stone. If people are worried about their living standards, they ought to be worried about the productive capacity of this country to eventually trade its way out of the debt problems created by Labor. It is the Socialist Left, the people of the Kirner ilk, who have much more to answer for in that case. I think that this deal is shoddy and inadequate because basically the Government is still in control of this bank. The whole concept of privatisation is to get these business enterprises out of the hands of governments and into the hands of people in business who have a motive and an interest to promote efficiency and better administration. If we read the legislation before us day, we find that proposed section 27L talks about the ownership and control by the Commonwealth of this bank. It makes the point as clearly as that. So there are all the shackles of government control and influence over this bank. For example, the Government has control over dividend payments. It still has a cap on the capacity of this bank to acquire additional funds. If a business is to grow, it needs access to additional capital, which is still limited as a result of this process. We ought to be encouraging these enterprises to have much more flexible industrial relations practices. That would boost their efficiency. This is very important in a service sector industry, such as this. Of course, with partial privatisation, we still have the dead hand of government over this bank. As representative of the dead hand of control, we have the Secretary to the Treasury as a nominee on this bank's board. I see that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) approves of that, and that is because he is opposed to privatisation. If the Government believed in privatisation not just for some sort of ideological bent but as a means of actually producing for its customers, the Australian public, better products, quality and services at lower prices-and that is the objective in this whole exercise-it would go the whole way. In looking at what is wrong with this deal, I am concerned about the shoddy deal that has been done to acquire the support of the union. The union spent a lot of its members' money opposing privatisation, so I wonder what deals have been done---,-although I must say that I do like to see that concept of employee share ownership schemes. That is mentioned in this legislation. Again, that is another policy initiative that the Opposition has promoted in recent years. We ought to give employees a chance to own shares directly in the bank-not through a trustee or some union official owning the shares on behalf of the union members, but the union members actually owning the bank directly. That would be very beneficial for people's motivation. It would have treto- mendous economic benefits, as well as being good in terms of enhancing people's interest in and motivation towards work. On the positive side, the truth is that this is a step towards privatisation. Cor-' poratisation of the bank is a step in the right direction. In fact, the concession by the Government of the benefits of,privatisation-reluctant as it might be, kicking and screaming as it is dragged into the debate, into the great battle of ideas that goes on year in and year out on the question of economic management-is a victory for those who believe in privatisation. For us privatisation is a major issue. It is a major element in micro-economic reform-not ideologically, but for the practical reason of improving the efficiency of these businesses, boosting their productivity. We know that in the public sector productivity levels are about half those of the private sector. Just that simple fact exemplifies the real potential for improvements in productivity through privatisation. As I said earlier, if we want businesses to grow and to prosper, they need access to capital. That is the reason why we ought to be encouraging privatisation. I say to those on the other side, as we snuff out Labor's light on the hill in promoting privatisation, that the coalition turns its powerful light of rational economic policy onto the inefficiencies of Labor's failed economic policies. Who benefits? We say that the beneficiaries of privatisation are the customers, the people who will get a better deal for a lower price, and the employees who get a chance to really have a say. The Government believes in workplace democracy. This is its chance, it ought to take this opportunity with both hands. For those reasons we support 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. When we go into office after the next election we will have a very clear mandate to see the privatisation of the other 70 per cent. I say to the Australian Democrats, who are as usual obstructive and making all the sort of left wing nonsense noises that we get from them, that it is a clear policy commitment of ours and they are going to have to face up to a few democratic principles. The Democrats are keen on saying how they are going to keep the politicians to their promises. This is one promise that we make unequivocally and we expect when we are elected to have the Democrats support us in that. There are some aspects of this Bill to which we foreshadow making amendments if the guillotine provides the opportunity to go into committee. Certainly in the Senate we will move a number of amendments. It is nonsense for the Government to say that it is going to have partial privatisation but it is going to away that 70 per cent in perpetuity. We will oppose that; we will move the deletion of that clause. It cannot bind future parliaments. This' is just playing to the left wing in its Caucus, which is somehow consoled by this. That is a false dawn for the Government. This is just the start of privatisation, and we are looking forward to the greater employment of privatisation policies in the future. With relation to foreigners it is the same thing again. The populist Treasurer who wants to be Prime Minister is just saying to the left wing, 'Look, these nasty foreigners, we will put a stopper on that'. The Treasurer ought to come in here and explain why we are treating this bank differently from other banks when it comes to foreign ownership. He has no explanation because he is just following the dictates of the Caucus resolution. I understand the politics of that but it says very little for the Treasurer. It is just a policy of appeasement, a policy of compromise. It obviously will not work. We will oppose that. We say that the ordinary laws of t- land ought to apply. It is nonsense to say, as the Government does, that we cannot sell the first lot of shares to foreigners but anybody who buys a share tomorrow can sell it to a foreigner. What is the sense of that? It will probably just decrease the price that we will get for the shares. It is probably the only real implication of that. Dr Charlesworth-It increases?",12
8,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"No, decreases the price. It is obviously nonsense. The ordinary laws of the land ought to apply, and we will move an amendment to that effect. I ask the Treasurer also whether it is a consequence of this Bill that foreigners could end up with the 30 per cent that he is putting on the market. Mr John Scott-Yes.",13
9,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh accepts that proposition. That just shows that he has been fooled. Why would he go along with it if that was the consequence? It just shows how naive members of the Government are. I ask lock another question: Do not foreigners now own large slices of the existing domestic banks? Of course they do. Those opposite should wake up to themselves and their own inconsistencies. Finally, I refer to the 5 per cent limit. Why do we have special rules for the Commonwealth Bank? Again, it is just to appease members of the Government. They have no economic sense. There no consistency in that.. We say that they ought to stick to the existing rules-the 10 to 15 per cent rules. They are quite adequate; there is no argument to suggest that they are inadequate. It is just populist Treasurer promoting that propobusiness sition. For Labor this is just a last resort. It is where not the start of an alternative economic policy that this country so urgently needs. There is no integrated policy response; is just another deal like that given Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd or to the wharfies or to Bill Kelty or to the banks on interest rates, or to Burke, Dowding, Bannon, Field or Unsworth. It is just anof other deal. We have a recession. We need a decent policy response to our problems instead of the inadequate responses as emplified by this particular legislation. This Bill is a step in the right direction, however reluctantly it is taken by the Government. We look forward to finishthis ing the job in government.",13
10,Dr CHARLESWORTH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS," Once again from the honourable ber for Flinders (Mr Reith) we have a lot of hot air, a great deal of unction, all of concern about consultation, the time for debate of the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill and how unfair it and yet in 25 minutes standing at the dispatch box he spent five minutes talking about the legislation and 20 minutes talkBudget ing about everything else that concerns him. The suggestion that he made at the end that in some way this relates to any sort of policy response in macro-ecoIt nomic terms is equally absurd. He talked about the Victorian Budget and difficultingencies ties that the Victorian Government has and he talked about privatisation but hardly a word was said about the legislaownership tion-hardly a word because he might not know or because he does not want to talk about it; I am not sure. There are commercial contingencies that brought about this legislation. If members of the Opposition wish to be consistent, how could they stand in this place last night and oppose part of their policy? I see the honourable member for Bass (Mr is Smith) getting up to leave now-the shadow Minister to prevent privatisation. That is what he is here for. Yesterday the Opposition in this place opposed a move taken by this Government to put on a a commercial basis one of our government enterprises. There is no consistency in its position. It is swinging from one side to the other and it cannot decide it wants to stop. . This legislation is about making stronger it a very large and growing national instituto tion, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The suggestion that it is vandalism is just dishonest. Before this the Commonwealth Bank represented 18 per cent all deposits in this country and 17 per cent of all lending in this country. After this it will become the largest domestic exbank in this country, with 26 per cent .of all deposits and 23 per cent of all lending. Th- Opposition is talking about actually making this great national institution even greater. The suggestion that in some way is some sort of attempt to do as it . would wish to do-to sell off 100 per cent or to sell off enterprises and slip the memmoney in its pocket-is absurd. We have seen what Mrs Thatcher could sorts do. She took the easy money from privatisation. She created a false Budget situation and the easy money is not available is, any more. What do we find? We find a Budget in the United Kingdom which has no ongoing savings built into it as our does. Inflation is now running at 11 per cent in the United Kingdom and there are terrible economic· difficulties. This is not part of our policy prescription. is necessary when we talk about this legislation to consider the economic conthat brought about this event. I can understand members of the Opposition having concern about public because that is its ideological bent. Earlier this week I sat in a petroleum inquiry. that this Government is holding and quizzed some very large companies that are involved in the retailing and distributing of petroleum-BP Australia Ltd, Ampol Petroleum Ltd and Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd. All of them want to own service stations. They want a window into the market. They want to know how the standards are produced and how to measure what is happening out there in the market. The Commonwealth Bank represents exactly the same oppo-tunity for the Government; for the Government to forgo it would be stupid. We are making the Bank stronger. The fact that we have union support for this proposal and that the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association supported it suggests that they are progressive-much more progressive than those opposite-because they understand the detail and why it had to come about. It is something important that needs to be considered by those opposite. This Bill does three things. With the complementary Victorian legislation, it passes to the Commonwealth Bank the rights, property, staff and liabilities of State Bank of Victoria. Secondly, it restructures the statutory entities of the Commonwealth Bank Group and converts the Commonwealth Bank to a public company. These things are perfectly consistent with what we have been doing with other government business enterprises. Thirdly, the Bill establishes special restrictions on foreign subscriptions, restrictions on the holding of voting shares by other banking entities and restrictions on the size of individual interests-:-and, indeed, the proportion of voting shares and power held by persons other than the Commonwealth. The Bill confirms the public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank and confirms the Commonwealth Bank in a stronger position than it was in previously. It is salutary for us to look at the way in which banking developed. The first bankers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries-and I am sure you would be aware of this, Mr SPEAKER - were goldsmiths. In that time of insecurity and lack of law and order it was necessary for people who had assets and wealth to find safe places for their assets. Indeed, many of the assets that people ,. held were in gold, so the goldsmith, who had a very substantial safe and security network, was the person who held these assets. Once one had deposited one's valuables with the goldsmith, the goldsmith found it necessary to give that depositor a receipt for them. After a time he established that only about one in 10 people actually wanted their gold back at any time, so he found for himself the possibility of lending some of the other gold that he held and earning interest. Over a period, as one deposited gold with the goldsmith, he would give the depositor a receipt which said 'To the Bearer', so the bearer would get a receipt from the goldsmith and such receipts became tradeable. Eventually those receipts became banknotes. Banknotes in the United Kingdom carry the heading 'Pay the Bearer'. After a time, people who were in receipt of assets and in the business of providing credit and lending out capital at interest decided they would offer interest the in orde- to attract more assets, and so over a length of time a banking system developed whereby the bank or the institution would bid for the money at an interest rate and lend it out at a premium. The important thing thilt one needs to remember about this structure is that the liabilities of the bank were much greater than the assets. This is why banks are vulnerable and why a bank can find itself in trouble if there is a run on it or if it gets itself into a position where its liabilities and assets fall outside what is accepted and prudent. That is exactly the situation that we found in the State Bank of Victoria: through Tricontinental Corporation Ltd, its merchant banking arm, it made very significant losses. As a result of that and as a result of the changes in the structure of debt within its banking structure, it was under threat. It was sensible and prudent for the Victorian Government, when it became aware of the circumstances, to look for a solution. The eventual solution was to sell the bank. This is not new. In his second reading speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made a point about the way in which the State, Savings Bank of New South Wales in 1931 was disposed of. It was disposed of not in the sensible prudent way that has occurred in respect of the State Bank of Victoria but in a very untidy way. The Bank was allowed to run down; there was a run on its capital base and there were losses on both sides. In the current ci'rcumstances we find that the State Government, with the Commonwealth, determined that there was a difficulty, decided on a course of action and put the Bank up for tender. The Commonwealth Bank has been the successful bidding bank. As a result of that, all of the difficulties that could have occurred as a result of a run on bank funds and the insecurity and the uncertainty in the Victorian circumstance have been avoided. These aspects are outlined; What we see here is an emerging Commonwealth Bank which is stronger, bigger and better than before; it will be more flexible and more able to provide services for all of us who are depositors. That can only be good. I have already mentioned, but I say again, that with 26 per cent of all deposits this bank will now be the larger domestic bank in Australia; It will hold 26 per cent of all deposits and be responsible for 23 per cent of all lending. Prior to this the Commonwealth Bank was in a position where it held only 18 per cent of all deposits and its lending was declining, at 17 per cent. In Victoria in particular, the Commonwealth Bank had not been able to establish itself. Whereas it had establiShed itself in New South Wales as a result of acquisition of the State Savings Bank of New South Wales and represented 30 per cent of depositors in that State, in Victoria it had only 11 per cent of depositors. This Bill provides the Commonwealth Bank with a base nationwide and a strength that is consistent throughout the country. It puts the bank in a position where it can really establish itself for all time as our biggest and strongest bank. We on this side of the House do not resile from that. We understand that there are those who ideologically believe that we should maintain 100 per cent ownership. Mr John Scott-Hear, hear!",14
11,Dr CHARLESWORTH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"I respect the view of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but the contingencies of this situation are that it is necessary for us either to find the money from Consolidated Revenue or to sell a share in the bank to the public. What does that mean? That means that the employees of the Commonwealth Bank will have the opportunity to be share owners in the Commonwealth Bank. That is something that even the honourable member for Flinders endorsed, and those of us on this side of the House see it as a very positive move. But, more importantly than that, people in this country who respect the Commonwealth Bank as an institution, and as something that they have seen as solid and reliable for a long time, also have the opportunity to buy shares. The honourable member for Flinders is concerned that Australians should have first bite of the cherry. I do not have any difficulty with that. Indeed, it is something that we should be ensuring. I hope that the Commonwealth Bank, when this share issue is floated, will approach all of those who hold accounts with the Commonwealth Bank and give them the opportunity to be share owners in the bank. What Margaret Thatcher has done in England, unfortunately, is take the money and run. There are no ongoing savings and no strategy or philosophy behind het privatisation. We in this country are saying that we want to have a strategy behind it. I believe there should be greater share ownership. At present, 9 per cent of Australian adults are shareholders or share owners in the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that the percentage will rise to 20 per cent. If that is the case, the Commonwealth Bank will benefit, the shareholders will benefit and the interest that Australians take in this great institution will increase. The Bill offers an opportunity for Australians, including employees and Australia's great institutions, to hold shares. There are caveats on the amount of ownership by any particular institution, but these things will not preclude an interest in shares. These shares will be an important pait of any portfolio that large investors want to have. The possibility of shares being traded eventually, the suggestion that 30 per cent foreign ownership could occur, is only theoretical, because it will not happen. Anybody who suggests that it will occur is being malicious. The fact that these shares can be traded to foreigners in an ongoing way in the future only increases their value and increases the ability of Commonwealth Bank to raise this capital and to raise this revenue. This legislation will make the Commonwealth Bank the largest domestic bank in this country. It will make what is already a great Australian institution even greater. It will strengthen and improve the flexibility of the bank and the ability of the bank to trade throughout the nation. It will give the bank a solid footing in Victoria-the sort of footing that it has never had. Indeed, this legislation has my wholehearted support and I believe it should have the support of all members of this House.",16
12,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"It is an utter disgrace that the Government has chosen to use the guillotine on the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill which is before the House at the present time. This is the largest corporate deal in Australia's history. I want to bring to the attention of the House the figures that are involved in this deal. We are talking here of a forced merger between two of the biggest banks in this country for a price of $1,600m. A circumstance has been forced on the Commonwealth by a situation in Victoria which is very clear and well-known to the people of Victoria, but probably not as well-known to people throughout Australia. Let me refer to the story of what has happened in Victoria and what the Commonwealth has had to do with this situation. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth)-and I am sorry that he is not in the House to hear thiskept making the comment, 'It is necessary'. Why is it necessary? What is it about? It is about trying to save the inept, incompetent, hopeless and irresponsible Kirner Labor Government in Victoria. I ask: Why save this group of dunderheads who set out to wreck the State of Victoria with their interventionist policies from 1983 to 1984, and who made such spectacular failures? I refer to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, the Victorian Investment Corporation, the National Safety Council, the Tricontinental Corporation Ltd, the Pyramid Building Society debacle, and the transport losses. The Labor Government in Victoria has brought what was once a prosperous State to its knees. It is in an absolute shambles. The Kirner and Cain governments set out deliberately to implement interventionist policies in the State of Victoria, to interfere in the processes of business in an effort to try to pick winners. We know now that what they did was pick losers, one after the other. There was a lack of supervision, a lack of responsibility and a level of incompete-ce which we have never seen before in this country under any government. This has been done by the Cain-Kirner Labor Government in Victoria. The honourable member for Perth said, 'It is necessary'. Of course it is necessary. We have had thrust upon us a very dubious deal-a sham. I understand that the result of the tendering process was apparently fixed right from the start. The other banks were invited to tender simply to dress up this shonky deal so that the public would think that it was okay. There has been no real opportunity in this tendering process for the best and most competitive price to be offered for the State Bank of Victoria. From the outset, the hidden agenda of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was to ensure that this bank came under the Commonwealth Bank. The State Bank of Victoria is a huge bank, with 4,347,000 depositors. It employs over 12,500 people and, when merged with the Commonwealth Bank, will have more than 50,000 employees. Let us look at what the Government is offering. It is offering a so-called public company. Thirty per cent of the shares will be held in aggregate by other persons and, theoretically, those will be able to be sold to the public. Seventy per cent of the shares will be held by the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Government will prohibit the bank from selling any of its 70 per cent of the shares. In other words, 70 per cent of the shares will be held in perpetuity. Let us look at the rights of the people who buy the 30 per cent of shares held in aggregate. These people will have very limited rights and powers. No more than 5 per cent of the shares will be held in one single ownership. There will be no foreign investment allowed. The Commonwealth Government talks about privatisation. It is really a half privatisation; it is not a proper privatisation at all. One could ask: Who is likely to invest in this merged bank and who will take up the shares? I would hope that the employees would be given the opportunity to participate in the shareholding of the total enterprise, but who else would be prepared to invest, particularly when one reads the powers that the Treasurer has in the exercise of control over this bank? The Government will have the power under section 11 to overrule the board, not only on policy matters, but also on the bank's corporate plan. In other words, if the Treasurer disagrees with the way the bank is running the show, he can go to the executive council, and his will shall be paramount. The Treasurer can override the people who have bought those 30 per cent of the shares. Who will these people be? Perhaps some insurance companies could be coerced, forced, encouraged or given preferential treatment by the Government to take up shares in the total company. It is more likely that the union movement will take up the shares. It is more likely that in the long term union superannuation funds will find their way into this banking area. Mr Lee-So what? What is wrong with that?",17
13,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"That is fair enough, but I would like to see greater encouragement given to wider public participation. The Government should not just look after its mates, but allow wider participation by the general public. If members of the general public are going to be encouraged to take up shares, why not privatise the bank 100 per cent and open it up to each and every Australian to participate in this great banking enterprise? Is there something wrong with citizens of Australia having the opportunity to invest, or is it just a case of the Government's mates controlling this bank? Whilst the Commonwealth Bank may be a good ·bank, it has not been exempt from the effects of the history of the last few years. In fact, in the last 12 months it made provision for approximately $500m of bad debt which it incurred during the past trading year. The Commonwealth Bank has made investments overseas which have not been terribly satisfactory. The bank lent money to a United States of America stockbroker, and $37m was written off as a bad debt. So the Commonwealth Bank is not so good at picking winners. We need to look at a proper privatisation of this bank, because this amalgamation means that the bank will have the largest share of the Australian market by way of branches and outlets. The bank is going to be competing with all of the private banks, yet the exclusivity of the shareholding means that it will remain in very limited hands. The people who are involved will have few powers and rights and, of course, the ultimate exercise of control will fall back to the Government and the Treasurer. I think that the suggestions and the amendments that have been put up by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are very worthwhile. I believe that the House should support these amendments because they are spelling out our concerns, particularly in the area of the 70 per cent entitlement which the Commonwealth Bank will control and which will not be able to be sold off at any future time. In other words, that 70 per cent will be retained in perpetuity in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank and controlled by the Government. We also believe that the 5 per cent ownership limit for any individual group or person should be extended, and that the Commonwealth Bank should be subjected to the same 10 to 15 limits applying to other banks under the Banks Shareholding Act 1972. The true question of the whole exercise is that it has been nothing more than a bail-out for a failed Labor Government in Victoria, a government that has exercised no control, no management skills, no responsibility, financial ineptness and carelessness. In fact, the State Government of Victoria is thoroughly disgraced. The Cain-Kirner Government has embarked on this course. It is not as though it has happened by accident. All of this was very carefully planned in a document put out in late 1983-84 which spelt out the economic steps that the Cain Government would take in Victoria. Certainly, it followed that course to the letter. Right from the outset, it was told by the Opposition in Victoria that this course would be fraught with all sorts of dangers and difficulties. It ignored that advice and went on down this path, and we now see the result where the State of Victoria is $32 billion in debt. It would not be necessary for this Bill to be before the House if it were not for the facts of that situation. What we have seen, of course, has been a level of incompetence which is unparalleled in Australia's history, and now we find that the Commonwealth Bank has been forced into this situation through a deal which really leaves as many questions unanswered as have been answered in the method of the tendering process. We have seen that other competitors, other likely tenderers, have been' virtually excluded from the tender process and found that-whilst they were prepared to pay more money to acquire the bank than the Commonwealth was prepared to pay for it-they have been excluded from the deal because the deal did not suit the Government and the friends of the Government who will want to exercise their control over the future fortunes of the Commonwealth Bank. I will leave those comments at this time and, because of the nature of the guillotine, I would like to allow time for my other colleagues to speak to this Bill.",18
14,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"I wish ·to start off by confessing to the Bouse that I first became attached to the Commonwealth Bank as a young student at primary school, when the Commonwealth Bank was able to persuade m,e and most of the other students that we should start banking at a young age through the Commonwealth Bank at our local school. I understand that some students from my electorate, from Chittaway Bay Primary School, are in the galleries this morningand I would assume that the Commonwealth Bank is still maintaining its campaign to encourage young students at Chittaway Bay and at other schools to save. Of course, that is something that all of us would encourage, and it is something which the Commonwealth Bank has been very successful at in years gone by. So, as a customer of the Commonwealth Bank, I am someone who strongly supports the Government maintaining its majority ownership in the Commonwealth Bank, because I believe it is important that the Federal Government does have significan-nfluence in one of the major players in our banking system. Of course, the Opposition has made it clear that if it is elected at the next Federal election, it would be its intention to sell 100 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank to the private sector. In a few minutes I will explain why I think that is something which is not good for the Australian economy. The Government has had a few blues with the banks, and that is no secret. The Government has believed that the banks have been too slow in lowering interest rates, for home borrowers when interest rates are falling, and a little too quick to jack up their interest rates when interest rates are on the rise-and that works to the disadvantage of those home mortgagees who are often in difficult circumstances. If the Commonwealth Government does not have that influence with one of the major banks, then how can the Federal Government endeavour to lead the way, through the use of the Commonwealth Bank, to try to make sure that banks are treating their customers fairly? It is not only on the question of interest rates for mortgagees, but also in the area of charges which the banks have decided to levy on their customers. The Commonwealth Bank is the only one of the major banks that still tries to treat accounts which are held by pensioners in a concessional manner as far as fees and charges are concerned. The Commonwealth Bank, I believe, is to be congratuated for continuing to treat those battlers in a proper way-and I would hope that, in years to come, perhaps the other banks could have another look at their social obligations in this area. But, if the sition had its way and sold off all of the shares of the Commonwealth Bank to some of the major corporate players in Australia, I would suspect that in a very short time we would see a 100 per cent privati sed Commonwealth Bank charging pensioners, low income earners and school children full rate bank fees and charges, and that is something which I think should be avoided. The Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill provides for the Commonwealth Bank to purchase the State Bank of Vicoria for $1,600m, and the Opposition seems to have developed a bit of a split personality on this proposal. That is exemplified by the contribution here this morning of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who started out by telling us that this particular measure was 'a shoddy, poitical deal', but finished up by telling t was a step in the right direction. So I found it hard. to understand how it could be a shoddy political deal and a step in he right direction all at the same time. Mr Elliott-I had trouble understandng that.",19
15,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"The honourable member for Parramatta assures me that he had trouble understanding that logic as well, as did all honourable members. The member or Bendigo (Mr Reid) of course had no difficulty, but I am sure that he will inue to work hard at understanding the speeches of the honourable member for Flinders in this House. The point I am trying to make is that the Opposition is trying to walk down both sides of the street at the same timewith not much success. Honourable members opposite are trying to say that they oppose parts of this particular Bill because they think that they can score a few political points by criticising the economic management of the Victorian Labor Government and, at the same time, trying to come up with reasons why they will have to vote for this particular proposal. We had the ludicrous position last night where the Opposition voted against the privatisation of the Pipeline Authority. Oppo- Honourable members opposite would say that they are the advocates of privatisation and free enterprise, but today they are trying to tell us why this particular measure is a shoddy political deal. Mr Elliott-Voting against their own policies. ,",20
16,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"As the member for Parramatta indicates, they are voting against their own proposals. Mr Bilney-They're all over the shop.",20
17,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"They are all over the place, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, who is at the table, says. So it is no· wonder that people a-e confused and it is no wonder that people who suspect that perhaps the Opposition has a chance-albeit an outside chance-of winning the next election are starting to look at what the Opposition's proposals would be if it were elected at the next us election. The Opposition has made it clear here today that if it is elected at the next election, it will sell the remaining 70 per cent-and the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) makes it clear by nodding his head that he agrees with that. There will be some other changes in the way the Commonwealth bank's capital structure will be organised. The Opposition has made it clear that it believes the Government is being too restrictive in the limits that we are putting on foreign owncon- ership of the shareholding of the Commonwealth Bank, so there is another area where there is a clear difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition says we ate being too restrictive on foreign ownership. The Opposition has also made it clear that it opposes the 5 percent ceiling on any individual shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank. That is another area where there is a clear difference between the Government and the Opposition. Anyone. who is concerned with the operess ation of the Commonwealth Bank and with the Government maintaining its stantial influence on one of the major banks has every right to be a little bit Bank of Victoria. worried about what the Opposition is putting forward. As a customer of the Commonwealth Bank, I do not want one of the major corporate players in Australia to domipeople nate the Commonwealth Bank. I do not want some share owner in Japan, the United States or Switzerland to decide assets whether the Commonwealth Bank will continue to offer concessionary rates charges and fees for pensioners and low income earners in Australia. Of course, the Opposition has made it clear that it does not share those concerns. The Opposition spent a lot of time critender ticising the tender process. The honourand able member for Flinders has said that the Commonwealth Bank was forced to take over the State Bank of Victoria, it was a shoddy and inadequate tender process. The honourable member for Bendigo also said that it was shoddy that there was no opportunity for fair tendering. The Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, in an article the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 August made the following comments: I have to say it strikes me as totally unbelievable that the chairmanthat is, the Chairman of the Commonsure wealth Bankand the other very reputable people on the of the Commonwealth Bank would allow themboards selves to be used as pawns in a political bail-out. He went on to say: If buyers were interested in the State Bank of Victoria, its sale should be conducted openly fairly and ""not on some sort of Labor Party, old mates network bail-out-and that's exactly what this looks like"". I have never thought that the Westpac Banking Corporation was part of the Laployer bor' Party's old mates network. For Greiner to say that there was no proper tender process except for the Labor ty's old mates network and for the they honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Bendigo to say that there was an inadequate tender procor that it was shoddy, ignores the fact that the Commonwealth Bank and Westsubpac come within $55m out of $1 ,600m in tendering the same price for the State Some people say that Mrs Kirner should have awarded the contract to Westpac, but the Opposition, being the Party which tries to promote the interests of business in Australia, should be quite aware that it is very common in business when a company is seeking to dispose of its Jor it not to take the highest bid. If it thinks that the second highest bidder of offers greater synergies or some advantages, it is very common in business for a company to take the second highest or the third highest bid. So to say that this is shoddy, rigged or that it is not a proper process is just ignoring the factsthe Op-ition should concede that. Some of the other comments that have been made here today also concern me. that The honourable member for Bendigo said that the Government was wrong to try to encourage union superannuation funds to and take up shares in the Commonwealth Bank. I think the expression that he used was that we were simply trying to look in after our mates. I find it hard to understand how union superannuation funds can be seen as some system that works for the benefit of unions when this Government has gone to great lengths to make that, where there are trust funds which hold, look after and manage the board superannuation funds of unionists, those act in the interests of the members who have invested their superannuation funds. The Government usually provides-I and think in all the cases I have seen of union the superannuation trusts-for half of the trustees to be representatives of the unionists and the trade union members and half to be representatives of the emorganisations. In some cases, they Mr also have an independent chairman. To suggest that those trustees are part of some ParLabor Party old mates network or that will do something that will disadvantage the people who have invested in those superannuation funds is just not practical. It is just an outrageous slur on those people who are the trustees of those union superannuation funds. So it is a bit hard to understand the Opposition's comments on this. I am sure that the next time the Commonwealth Bank comes to the Chittaway Bay school and encourages those students who are in. the gallery today to invest in its savings accounts the fact that in a few months time 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank will be owned by private shareholders will not discourage them from doing their best to make sure that they increase their savings. .",20
18,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,Maybe you will open up the sharehplding for those children.,22
19,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"I am sure that the honourable member opposite would like to have schoolchildren at Chittaway Bay investing in the Commonwealth Bank, and I am sure that the students of Chittaway Bay will be keen to invest in the Commonwealth Bank. However, I am sure that everyone on this side of the House will be concerned if, as the honourable member for Bendigo said, residents in Tokyo, San Francisco, Zurich or other places end up with a massive controlling shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank. That is something I am concerned about and something that this Government is trying to make sure does not happen. Mr Bitney-It won't happen under this Bill.",22
20,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"It will not happen under this Bill, as the Minister at the table suggests, because we have put in very strict rules. As I started out by saying, the Opposition seems to have developed very strange views on this. On 24 August, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: The planned partial sale of the Commonwealth Bank is nothing more than a bail out to prop up the tottering Victoria Labor Government. On 24 August, the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Bass, said: All taxpayers are being asked to bail out the socialist Left by subverting the equity base Commonwealth Bank. So it is a bit hard to see the Opposition now voting for a proposal that a few months ago it said was subverting the equity base of the Commonwealth Bank. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said that it is a sleazy, grubby deal and not in the best interests of the people of Australia, yet here is the Opposition voting for it today. Of course, we have had the classic from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) saying that it was a shotgun marriage between Mrs Kirner and Paul Keating, or certainly their banks. He was more concerned that economic restructuring might take place in rural centres in Victoria. So the Party that says that there is not enough economic restructuringthe Party of the economic rationalists-is limited in its comments to its concern about employment in some country towns in Victoria. We have had the Opposition saying that this is a terrible step, that this is-to quote the honourable member for Flinders-a shoddy political deal, but of course it is a step in the right direction at the same time. So I encourage the Opposition to continue down this path in the development of its split personality.",22
21,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,They don't know whether they are Arthur or Martha.,22
22,Mr LEE,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"Opposition members do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha, as the honourable member for Banks says. Of course, every day the public gets a chance to see that the Opposition is not prepared for government and not prepared to take the decisions that are needed for this country. I think that the Government's actions in ensuring the stability of our banking system by acting in a rapid and proper manner will ensure that the Commonwealth Bank will continue to grow stronger and stronger as the years go by.",22
23,Mr SMITH,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"1 start by perhaps stating the obvious. This debate from the Australian Labor Party is going in the wrong direction. It tends to assume that people on this side of the House are, of the in some way, doubting the value of the Commonwealth Banking Group. Far be it for me to point out the obvious that that is not the case. We are arguing, and have been arguing since this deal came to light, that the Government is in fact tainting the Commonwealth Bank in the way that it coerced or forced it into this deal to relieve the financial pressures that were on Victoria. That is the basis upon which this matter was entered into. If we start from that premise and then move to the ultimate outcome-that is, whether a level of private equity to be involved in the Commonwealth Bank is good or bad; and we say that the answer is yes-that is why we are supporting this proposal. However, that does not remove the point that we have to look at the processes that brought this deal about. One of the fundamental things that must be understood about privatisation is that it is not about bailing out people or capturing up front early a big cash price to accrue to government to save budgetary problems. Privatisation, when it is properly employed, involves efforts to achieve a range of activity. As the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) interestingly said, one is trying to achieve broader share ownership. We only have 9 per cent share ownership in this country, and it would be desirable to increase that level. One is also trying to get off the backs of people and remove the need to raise taxes to provide government services that would be better placed in the private sector. That is one of the reasons why we say that 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank is desirable-and in fact that has been our policy for some considerable time. The premise put forward by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), that there is some concern about the Commonwealth Bank is a misplaced sentiment put into this debate. We were concerned initially with why this particular issue was driven the way it was, and why it came about. It was a deal, it is a deal, and it is recognised as a deal. We criticised that at the time. There is not a heck of a lot we can do about it at the present time other than to criticise it and make sure people understand this is happening because it is a bail out. It provided a convenient opportunity for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to do what he knows is necessary-that is, for Australia, in common witI' some 83 countries around the world .0 go down this path of asset sales and privatisation. It has to be done by achieving better benefits to the consumer, it has to achieve long 'term sustainable benefits, and it should not be done to achieve temporary support for budgets in trouble. That is why I make this point at the outset. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) went into some detail about our policy on privatisation so I do not intend to refer to that issue because it is stating the· obvious. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) made the point-and it was a very good speech by the honourable member from Victoriathat this is a rescue of a government driven by all the wrong reasons, a government that wanted to be interventionist in the marketr:\ace. It wanted to pick winners, but it has fallen on its face and now it will carry the can. What I said about subverting the. equity a base of the Commonwealth Bank stjll stands. The Government will be entering into attracting equity to buy an asset that is of decreased value. It may be strategically important for the Commonwealth Bank to have the State Bank of Victoria (SBV), but it has entered into a purchase at a time it was not contemplating a purchase. The Commonwealth Bank has had to be restructured completely to provide the opportunity for Victoria to rescue itself. In that sense other Australians. who are de facto shareholders now due to the fact that they are taxpayers, are seeing their equity diluted, in a sense. Turning to some of the more interesting issues regarding the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, I would commence with the issue of due diligence. Due diligence is a technical procedure undertaken at the time of purchase where a purchaser goes in and has a look at the net tangible assets of a bank to determine whether or not what he has contracted to buy is in fact there-for example, debts, accounts, taxation liabilities, trading and credit arrangements, provisions against loans and legal liabilities. It is an opportunity understand what one is buying. The due diligence undertaken by the Commonwealth Bank in relation to the SBV has revealed a great deal of concern, to the extent that whether or not the deal would proceed was put in question. At reason that time. I publicly raised the if due diligence showed they should not be proceeding with the price of $1.6 bilthis lion, then the Commonwealth Bank ought to be able to act in a commercial way and walk away from the deal so that the ter could go back for tender and Westpac or others might come in and bid a price truly reflecting the value of the SBV. I am concerned that if the price of billion, which was in fact geared towards resolving the economic problems of Viclegislation toria, meant there was going to be a fall, who would pick it up? Was there to be a further subvention of cash from Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue to make up the shortfall so the figures added up? I do not believe that would be priate. I do not think the taxpayers of Australia ought to be bailing out Victoa rian taxpayers who had the ill fortune elect people who did not know what they were doing. How was this problem solved to make sure the deal proceeded? Effectively they drew the guarantees forward that were being given by the Victorian Government for $500m-odd, and said, 'We will pay these out now so as to maintain the $1.6 billion price-tag'. That means that the Victorian Government will borrow $500m at about $60m a year in interest payments to effect the completion of this deal. That is another cost which has not been talked about in ensuring the completion of the eign deal. The taxpayers of Victoria ought to Bank. ownership be aware of that. Mention was made of the level of debts of banks. The National Bank had a protion. vision for bad debts in its recent accounts with an increase of 100 per cent. The provision for bad debts in the Commonheld wealth Bank in its recent annual report was up by 54 per cent. I believe there be provision for bad debts in the Auspage tralia and New Zealand Banking Group the Treasurer said: to Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation, and there certainly was provision for bad debts in my home State bank, the Tasmanian Bank. This is reflective of what is happening in the economy. It is not a brilliant time to be buying banks. For that also I raised the issue of the forced point that nature of this marriage. There are others who wish to speak in debate, but I will turn to some of the other issues I believe are important. An issue raised in Caucus related to continumating the Commonwealth Bank in public ownership. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has stood here and said that the big debate is going to be in relation to $1.6 privatisation-whether or not we have public or private ownership. This piece of attempts to invite a 30 per cent shortequity stake from outside government sources, but it wants that amount kept in perpetuity. We have moved this amendment because we do not believe it is appropriate at all. Of course our policy is approfor 100 per cent privatisation. That clause is silly, and in a sense it is sop to the Left. It is to enable the to Treasurer (Mr Keating) to get the matter through Caucus. It is a rather feeble and transparent attempt to bind future governments. The sovereignty of Parliament means that that clause can be overturned by future governments, so the exercise is really designed to dress it up and make it more attractive in a political sense. The activities of future governments cannot be bound in the manner this Bill seeks. It is for that reason as well-that it is a nonsense-that we are moving an amendment to extract that clau-e from the Bill. Another interesting issue relates to forI might of the Commonwealth mention that 70 per cent remains to be privatised by us when we come to government after the next elecSeventy per cent is locked off; 30 per cent will be available. The management structure of the bank will still be and controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Indeed, in the secwill ond reading speech of the Treasurer, at 7, a corporate plan is discussed, and Section II, providing for an annual corporate plan to be prepared and given to the Treasurer, and containing a power for the Government ultimately to prevail in the circumstances of mal difference of opinion, will remain. So the control of the Commonwealth Bank is still going to be vested with the Commonwealth and with the Treasurer because the Treasurer will approve the corporate plan. As I have said previously, if we are going to corporatise government bodies and allow them to act commercially, we have to let them act commercially. If we stand behind them and look over their shoulders every time they do something, we will not get the disciplines the market is demanding, and particularly not the disciplines investors will demand. We would have a limited capacity for people to enter into shareholdings in the Commonwealth Bank-only 30 per cent. Government control would be maintained by virtue of section 11 with the Treasurer looking over their shoulders. The Treasurer also has the ability to appoint the Secretary to the Treasury to the board. In market terms what that does is limit the value of the shares. The shares go to the marketplace and investors, whether foreign or domestic, will say-if they are sophisticated investors-there is unlikely to be any major changes to management structure going beyond what the Treasurer might desire; they will be locked into the accord arrangements, locked into all the inefficiencies government enterprise has indicated. Indeed, in the Industries Assistance Commission report on rates of return in the telecommunications sector, the rates of return for private enterprise and the like were shown to be about 16 per cent, and for government enterprise only 3 per cent. Investors need to make sure that the management has the ability to manage. This Bill constrains management. The efficiencies we desire to have from full privatisation are not going to be achieved, and effectively what is happening is that the share price is being discounted. That is regrettable. What I am argujng, and what the coalition is arguing, is that a fully blown privatisation on the model in France and on the model in the United Kingdom and elsewhere will give investors the opportua fornity to invest in a bank that is going to be a growing bank. The Commonwealth Bank is going to become a very large bank; it will be the largest in this country, with a massive number of employees. I ask: what was the deal to make sure that there would be no job reductions or rationalisation in the SBV upon the acquisition by the Commonwealth Bank, and what is the view of the Commonwealth Bank management, which has over time done a reasonable job to get the bank going, and it is going quite well? What are going to be the limits upon management to deal with the investment that has been forced upon it? That will be an interesting issue. What is the deal there? Mention was made of employee share ownership programs (ESOPs), which everyone all of a sudden wants to embrace. W-brought a Bill into this place some years ago providing for such programs-and who voted against it? The honourable members on the other side of the House, who now form the Government. Today we had the interesting spectacle of the honourable member for Perth a Government spokesman on this matter, standing up and saying that employee share programs are a good thing. They certainly are. But have not Government members changed their tune! What are the terms going to be? Will they be more attractive than anything we have ever seen before? Is that part of the buy-out and the acquiescence that has come from the Australian Bank Employees Union, which only a little time ago was funding an antiprivatisation campaign during the last election? Indeed, I remember that in my own electorate members of the Australian Bank Employees Union were outside the bank demonstrating against me during the last election. Now that union has changed its mind completely. So one would want to look at the employee share ownership program to make sure it is generous and attractive and provides incentive; but we do not want it to be excessively so-such that it will detrimentally affect in any way the overall share values of the Commonwealth Bank. Other aspects of the second reading speech of the Treasurer relate to the shares listing .and the first public issues. The honourable member for Flinders raised the matter that the first issue will not be able to be subscribed to by foreign shareholders. That is regrettable, and that is why we will be moving an amendment to remove that provision. Reference was also made to the fact that the limitation on the amount of shareholdings will not be in accord with that provided for in other banking legislation, and that is why we will be moving an amendment to lift that shareholding to accord with other bank shareholding levels. It is regrettable that the legislation has been framed in this way, but it is more reflective of Caucus demands than of any appreciation of the commercial reality that needs to be entered into. There is one other interesting item in the Treasurer's second reading speech, and that is that the legal structure of the monwealth Development Bank, which is a specialist bank to assist small business, will become a full subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, as is the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I would make the point, and give notice, that I will be investigating the Commonwealth Development Bank, as I suspect the Treasurer may be doing, to see whether or not it might be able to be spun off and privatised separately as a specialist, small ness, private bank in this country. That is a matter for investigation which I will be undertaking, and given that it is in this Bill, I suspect that this legislation foreshadows that that might be contemplated by the Treasurer himself. The technicalities of doing that and the equity base required for it to continue the good work that it does need to be addressed, but certainly the matter bears investigation. I make the announcement today that I will be actually doing that. There are a lot of other matters that could be raised, but I shall just make the point again that privatisation will happen in this country. It has been embraced by the Treasurer. It has been prostituted by the Treasurer; I mean, we are not seeing a proper privatisation. The Treasurer has used the word but has discounted the term in the actuality of what is being done. There have been examples, and yesterday we saw one, of proposals for assets sales crashing on the reality of what the law means and the integrity required to be employed when disposing of government assets. The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill has come adrift, and after this Bill, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill, which will also enjoy the support of the coalition, is to be debated. This Bill enjoys the support of the coalition. Although it certainly is not what we want and not what the Australian people deserve, it is a start. However, it does prostitute and use loosely the term 'privatisation', and for that reason, I regret it. The whole underpinning of and the reason for the Commonwealth Bank's purchasing the SBV and to be now looking for 30 per cent outside equity is all Com- driven by a need to address the economic problems that the first real socialist government in Victoria created in its market intervention policies. That is to be regretted, because the Government is privatising for all the wrong reasons. Because it is privati sing for all the wrong reasons, it may not get the result which it desires to get. The broader the share ownership that we can have in this country and the more busiwe can encourage people to take a stake in these enterprises-and they are good enterprises, they are reasonably well managed in this country now and they can be better managed so that we can all get benefits from that-the less will be the demand on government to raise taxes to service the equity needs of these investments, and they will return a benefit to those who actually invest in them. There will need to be a mix, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in a speech recently, of Australian and foreign equity. We do not want to believe we can do all this without the involvement of foreign equity. There will be arguments about the level as it relates to particular enterprises but, believe me, it will be necessary. It has been necessary. The level of foreign equity in our private banks now would bear investigation to find out exactly what it is. I do not think it is the big bogy that those on the left wish to paint it as. Unfortunately, this legislation reflects the realistic fears within the left on this issue. It will happen, it has to happen, and the sooner the full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank takes place, the better it will be not only for the employees of the Bank, who are I hope going to get reasonably attractive ESOPs, but also for the depositors. As the honourable member for Bendigo said, why not offer depositors the opportunity to take shares? It has been done in other countries and it seems to me that it would be a very attractive way to go about things. We need to market that concept extremely well. I can assure the Treasurer that, being the person on this side of the chamber charged with the task of looking at the technical aspects and the processes and methodologies of privatisation-and that really is where the debate is coming to in this country: how we do it, how we get the long term beneficial effects that we want-I will be ensuring that the lessons we learn over the next two years from the way this Government does it will be learned well. We will ensure that when we get into government and finally privatise this entity and all others, we will make sure that we get what we set out to get the best possible benefit for all consumers and all taxpayers, wherever they might be, in this nation. Although we in this country are a late starter, we will ensure that privatisation, when it happens, is to the benefit of everyone.",22
24,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"1 start by indicating that I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill. However, I want to highlight a few of the inconsistencies in what we have just heard from the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and before him from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) on this particular legislation. On the one hand we are told that this is a shoddy d\!al and a totally unsatisfactory arrangement to bail out another bank. The Opposition also claims that there are all sorts of other things wrong with the tendering processes and so on. Yet at the conclusion the Opposition says that it will support the legislation. The honourable member for Bass un- said he had praise for the actions of the Commonwealth Bank and so forth. Yet most of his speech could be interpreted as little else than a run-down of not only the Commonwealth Bank but also the management and the board of the bank and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association-all of which, given the history of this matter and the bank's past performance, are arguments that do not stand any form of scrutiny. Most honourable members have recognised over the years the real contribution that the Commonwealth Bank has made to Australia, particularly to those who are less well off, such as pensioners and the like. One of the things I have noted is the very\ positive contribution of the Commonwealth Bank throughout large parts of our community, be they schoolchildren or the aged. The Commonwealth Bank has stood by people and worked well with communities in ways that private banks have not. In arguing that to achieve results in this area we need a 100 per cent sell-off of the bank, the Opposition seemed to place in the area of irrelevance all those worthy objectives that the Commonwealth Bank has fulfilled, not only in urban Australia but also in rural Australia. I reject that. This legislation ensures 30 per cent private equity in the Commonwealth Bank, certainly to take account of the purchase price for the State Bank of Victoria. That $1.6 billion that is needed to ensure that purchase has strategic value in itself. That is one of the things that I think is very important to highlight in this debate. Far from being some sort of shoddy deal, even looked at purely in a financial sense it represents a very good business investment so far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned. That is the reason why the Commonwealth Bank board, which is a very strong board, obviously was prepared to lend its name to this particular process. What we are creating with this new arrangement, with the Commonwealth Bank purchasing the State Bank of Victoria, is our largest domestic bank. As the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) said, the bank will have 26 per cent of deposits and 23 per cent of lending in Australia. It represents a very major growth in and strategic development of our financial system. It should be something that is welcome on those grounds. It should not be the case that the Liberal Party ideology says that 100 per cent of the bank should be sold and irrespective of its strategic market relevance that is going to be the position. Indeed, we saw last night the inconsistency of the Opposition in these areas anyway, which highlights the sorts of problems it would have should it ever be in government again. We will have a bank which is larger and more embracing. It will have more scope to provide services to the community and it will encourage the general community to participate on an equity basis. Commonwealth Bank officers and others have conducted themselves in a very responsible manner throughout what has been a very difficult period because of the problems of Tricontinental Ltd in Victoria. The worth of Australians being able to invest in one of the major institutions in Australia will be recognised. At the same time, we are recognising that in the national interest the particular worth of the Commonwealth Bank should and will be maintained. I have no difficulty at all with the factor indeed, I welcome it-that the Government in this legislation is giving a guarantee to maintain a majority owned Commonwealth Bank in perpetuity. I think that is a perfectly commendable proposition, one that should be welcomed by all who are really interested in Australia's national interest. Those people, of course, who are driven by the Thatcherite model of financial arrangements obviously would oppose that sort of initiative, but we are concerned to operate in Australia's national interest. We will not be driven by the Thatcherite New Right sort of thinking we heard earlier today. It is really important, I believe, that we accept that the Commonwealth Bank has a strategic worth for Australia. We have to review our government business enterprises on a case by case basis to get the best possible result. I have no doubt that maintaining the Commonwealth Bank as a majority publicly owned institution is going to be in the collective interest of all Australians. In the last couple of weeks I have noted the changes that have been occurring relating to deeming of pensioners' incomes and so forth. The Commonwealth Bank, in conjunction with the Australian Pensioners Federation, has produced a booklet and is conducting seminars on the needs of pensioners and how they should structure their financial arrangements. The Commonwealth Bank has been proud to be involved in that initiative and I commend its professional service. It recognises its importance in fulfilling its obligation to provide services to pensioners and other ordinary Australians. I think it is perfectly reasonable, given all those circumstances, that the Labor Government maintains its principle, its view, that a government business enterprise like the Commonwealth Bank is worth retaining in a majority public ownership because it is going to be able to deliver most effectively the sorts of services that most ordinary Australians rely on for their banking operations. It is very clear that this legislation, which sets real safeguards on issues such as the amount of control that individuals individual corporations can hold in the bank, the amount of equity an individual shareholder can have, the amount of foreign ownership that is going to be restricted, is sensible. Its provisions are not shackles, as suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith). Rather, they recognise the importance of· maintaining a strategically relevant financial institution but at the same time one which is able to act for the benefit of ordinary Australians. I firmly believe in the strong view of the Government-for instance, on the foreign ownership question-that we should encourage the ethos of more Australians wanting to take out shareholdings in the bank. There is no doubt that as time goes on it will be a very sound and viable institution right across the nation. The purchase of the State Bank of Victoria creates a' Commonwealth Bank which has a market share across Australia which can only be said to be worthwhile and financially viable for all concerned. Given the difficulties that there have been and the problems that there were with the State Bank of Victoria, it was important for this Government to act decisively and to work effectively with the State Government of Victoria to overcome those problems. Honourable members opposite have said that it was a shoddy deal. I would have thought it was acting responsibly in the national interest. It was acting in a way that ensures the ongoing continuity of our financial system and ensures security for all Australians. Why should people see that as a deal which is other than a very . worthy one, a very valuable contribution to ensuring that public confidence in our financial institutions is maintained and that the collective interest of all those people who rely so heavily for their ongoing financial commitments on the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria was secured? That is what happened in the case of this arrangement. It was an important decision that had to be taken. Confidence and integrity in the financial system was critical and this legislation, I think, is an important element in ensuring that a Commonwealth Bank, majority publicly owned, is there for all Australians to be able to feel confident and secure about. They can feel confident about its future and its government guarantee, which is so vital to so many people who have relied on it for services since its inception. So I strongly support this legislation. I believe it is setting up an institution which will have the capital base and the viability to be a very strong institution and it is one which I think will be in the collective interests of all. I categorically reject the notion of the Liberal Opposition that the sell-down of 100 per cent of the bank would be anything other than a fire sale of gross miscalculation of its worth as a national institution. Therefore, I strongly support the Bill before the House.",27
25,Mr BRERETON,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990. I do so secure in . the knowledge that this legislation will strengthen the corilpetiti ve position of Australia's largest government-owned bank and, importantly, it will project the Commonwealth's status as a publicly owned institution in the face of the ideologically driven pledges of the Opposition to fully privatise the bank. With the enactment of this legislation the spectre of a government-owned bank competing with, and even outperforming, similar institutions in the private sector will remain a permanent feature of the Australian financial landscape in terms of service, charges, and, most importantly, margins. All Austra:' lians will be better off as a result. Following the enactment of this legislation Australians can participate in the ownership of the bank in a much more direct fashion, for the 30 per cent of the larger bank's <;apital which will be floated will be open to all local investors, large and small. In all likelihood, it will be the large life offices, the large superannuation funds, which will absorb the bulk of the available capital, with each entity being "" restricted to some 5 per cent holding, an amount insufficient to threaten public control. In this way the accumulated savings and nest eggs of thousands of ordinary Australians will be channelled into what is a truly national institution. With provisions guarding against foreign investment, the bank will remain a Wholly Australian institution of which we, the taxpayers, can be justifiable proud. We can also rest assured that the control of the bank's voting capital, rather than being threatened by this legislation, is in fact guaranteed in perpetuity. The bank will therefore be protected from any. future fire sales that may be undertaken by governments with less concern about the public interest. It is public interest rather than ideological dogma which dictates our approach to all micro-economic reform sues. , In terms of the commercial performbanks, ance of the Commonwealth Bank, the islation will be of great benefit. That not to say that the bal1k has been perernment benches. forming poorly in recent times. On the contrary, it has delivered some rather profits and dividends t,O the Government and it has certainly ensured that the debts situation is not similar to that which we have seen from its major private comserve petitors. .It has often been the first lower mortgage and prime rates following the official easing of monetary policy. Following the enactment of this Bill thorising the acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria, formerly the fifth largest in the country, the new Commonwealth 'Bank will be Australia's largest domestic bank with 26 per cent, as has been said, of all bank deposits and 23 per cent bank lending. More importantly, it will have acquired a significant branch presvested ence in what was hitherto its weakest State-that is, Victoria. In doing so it be able to provide a more effective petition to the National Australia Bank Ltd and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) on their home territory. By allowing for a limited private capital injection to fund the acquisition, the Government has also ensured that the Commonwealth is not saddled with the extra huge debt that would be involved any other form of increasing a bank in its size and, to this extent, market power. we look down the track, it will certainly put it in an excellent position to compete and, in connection with its acquisitions in New Zealand, to become potentially truly international Australian-owned bank. All that is being achieved without threatening the people's control of Commonwealth Bank. By limiting private capital injections to 30 per cent and' dividual shareholdings to 5 per cent, the Government has ensured that no interest can challenge its control over the directions and the policy of the bank. preventing other banks from owning shares, the Government has also laid to isrest the undoubted merger or even purchase intention of the three major private which we all know would be keen legto buy the Commonwealth Bank if the is people sitting opposite were on the GovThis legislation will. serve to block the fine incestuous cross shareholdings and the anti-competitive merger plans that domibad nate the thinking of the private banking oligopoly. By so doing, the legislation will to guarantee ongoing competition into the Australian banking industry. This legislation will also establish special restrictions on foreign participation auin the initial float of the Commonwealth Bank's shares. Those restrictions will serve bank to preserve the bank's Australian character and make the way clear for the - uper­ annuation and life funds to absorb that $1.6 billion in equity which is to be raised of with this float. I can think of no more desirable place for the funds to be inin than in this great bank venture. The Government's concern with prowill tecting the independence and the wholly comowned character of the Commonwealth Bank stands in marked contrast with the stated policy of the Opposition which is to flog off the bank to the highest bidder. In its ideological quest to emasculate the whole public sector, it would have no qualm's about selling the Commonwealth Bank, whether it be to the Westpac Banking Corporation, Citibank Ltd or whoever. in In the same manner, the Opposition would sell Telecom Australia to foreign interests If so long as it enabled it to cover the revenue holes in its tax policy. Despite all its talk about competition and free markets, the Opposition would allow the Commona wealth Bank to fall into the hands of its competitors, just as it would have permitted the ANZ to pilfer the superannuation the funds by merging with National Mutual. Likewise, it would hand over our national intelecommunications carrier and the largest bank to foreign interests in return for private a one-off boost to revenue. At a time when we see many large AusIn tralian companies having been sold to forits eign buyers because of the greedy and foolhardy activities of overgeared entrepreneurs, the Opposition is willing to do the very same thing with core government assets. This blatant disregard for public interest and the obsession with right wing dogma has never been more clearly underscored. The Australian people can rest assured that it will be our Government which will exhibit a far greater concern for their interests when introducing reforms to public sector enterprises. The Government showed similar concern for the public interest when it acted quickly and decisively to bid for the State Bank of Victoria when its losses became apparent. The Government was well aware that the Commonwealth Bank lacked sufficient capital for the purchase. Not wishing to saddle the Commonwealth Bank with this great debt, the Government made a very difficult decision, but a correct one, to allow the bank to seek private capital injection equivalent to the purchase price. At. the same time, we were able to obtain the support of the staff of both banks for such a merger and in the proc-ss guarantee jobs for all affected. By offenng revenue compensation for dividend income forgone, the Hawke Government boosted the appeal of the Commonwealth's successful tendering bid. Putting all those arrangements into place, before the State Bank of Victoria announced its disastrous annual results, the Government was actually able to avert a. financial cri.sis of unprecedented magmtude. There IS no doubt at all that if the State Bank's $1.7 billion in losses had been reported before that sale, a run on the bank would have eventuated. The State of Victoria would have been obligated, under its guarantee, to redeem up to $25 billion in deposits, something clearly beyond it. One needs to remember the difficulties the State experienced in partly compensating the depositors of the Farrow Group to appreciate that fact. That such a crisis "",:,as .averted to the satisfaction of all tIes mvolved speaks volumes for the management skill of this Government and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Although put together in unusual circumstances, the merger will have the happy consequence, as the legislation says, of boosting the Government's long term return from its investment in the Commonwealth Bank. The Australian taxpayer should be pleased with the outcome just as the management and the staff of both organisations are. The only people it has not pleased are the honourable members sitting opposite and their friends in the large private banks. Their complaints only underscore the desirability of the reforms enacted through this legislation. I commend it to the House.",29
26,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"1 too a?1 pleased to have the opportunity to nse and support the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1900. The restructuring of the Commonwealth Bank is very\much a question of market share and ensuring better competition within the banking sector. As with other reforms in Australia's banking sector in recent years, this Government has certainly acted responsibly and appropriately in viewing the future of the Commonwealth Bank and also in protecting the depositors of· the State Bank of Victoria. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), paid credit to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for his very important role. in this whole process. I would also like to pay credit to the Treasurer, who has handled this matter in a very proper way and taken into consideration the depositors and the employees of the State Bank of Victoria in particular. Indeed, it has certainly been the diplomatic handling of this transition for the Commonwealth Bank by the Treasurer that has resulted in a big boon for banking depositors. The restructured Commonwealth Bank will certainly be the 'largest domestic bank in Australia, as other honourable members have already said. It will certainly be very much a people's bank. It will remain a majority publicly-owned bank and will be parbetter known as the people's bank of Australia. The critics of the Commonwealth Bank restructuring have ignored the real issues of industrial relations. For instance, had the State Bank of Victoria been taken over by one of the three major private banks, I do not think that we would have had the opportunity to protect too many employees who currently work in the State Bank of Victoria. Certainly there would have had to be an unnecessary reduction in staff, particularly if one looks at the size and the market share that the private banks have at the present time compared with the Commonwealth Bank in Victoria. In fact, the Commonwealth Bank will be well served by being able to increase its market share substantially in the State of Victoria and hence protect the depositors' funds in that area. In contrast, clause 125 of the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990 specifically provides for the continued employment of all officers previously employed by the corporation. Importantly, this is being done without .affecting their terms and conditions of employment or their entitlements to benefits and is preserving the continuity of their employment. One wonders whether bank employees would feel so secure under the proposal that has already been offered by the I Opposition to sell off the Commonwealth Bank wholesale. It makes one wonder whether the Opposition has any idea of what that would mean to the banking industry in this country. I doubt very much that existing Australian banks would take the opportunity to purchase the Commonwealth Bank. We would probably find a very large international bankone of the Citibanks of this world-buying into the Commonwealth Bank quite substantially. That would not necessarily be in the interests of the very stable ing system which we enjoy in Australia today, which we have certainly enjoyed for some time and which we will continue to enjoy in the future with the reforms that have been made by this Government. This Bill certainly creates a great tial for the proposed restructuring of the Commonwealth Bank to take industrial relations in the banking area one step further. Honourable members may not be aware, but there are actually two banking unions in the banking industry: firstly, there is the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, which covers Commonwealth Bank officers; and, secondly, there is the Australian Bank Employees Union, which traditionally covers the State and private banks. I hope that those unions will be able to get together on this proposal now and move towards the amalgamation so that we finish up with just the one union in the banking industry. I think that, that would be a wise way to go, and it is probably an opportune time to do this. I know that those unions have been moving that way for quite some time. Having been so closely involved with reforms within the banking sector for some time, I am certainly pleased to put that suggestion. I hope that the unions will take it up. The planned restructuring will give the Commonwealth Bank greater freedom in the banking sector. It is far preferable to the build up of the three major banks that I have already mentioned. Let us not forget that the Commonwealth Bank, certainly traditionally, had a weaker market share in Victoria. Because of that, I think that the restructuring is going to be a great opportunity for the Commonwealth Bank to expand. As I mentioned earlier, the Commonwealth Bank has always been considered as very much a people's bank and it will continue to be that in the future. These points certainly combine to produce a stronger competitor. If one of the private banks had actually taken over the State Bank of Victoria, we would have had a very large monopoly, which would have created a lack of real competition in the industry. Contrary to the cries of some, bank- the changes proposed for the Commonwealth Bank do not constitute a sell off, but a real restructuring, which will be to the betterment of us all. When talk of changes to the Commonwealth Bank's existing structure were first potenmooted, doubts were certainly expressed in some quarters as to the benefits that would or would not flow from such a move. At this time fears were instilled in banking customers. Certainly, I hope that that no long term problems have resulted from that because I think that confidence in the banking industry is very important and this process· will certainly maintain that confidence. I do not want to speak too long because I understand that another speaker wishes to join us in commenting on the. Bill. I would just like to wrap up by quotmg the last words of the Treasurer in the second reading speech the other day. He said: We shall have created from the existing Commonwealth Bank and State Bank of Victoria a whole new force in banking, while protecting State Bank's depositors and the wider community - of Victoria and averting a financial calamity. I think that the final point the Treasurer made is extremely important in adding to the understanding of what this process is all about. The whole process will turn out in the longer term to be certainly in the best interests of bank depositors and in the longer run for the Commonwealth Bank. I can only commend the Bill to the House.",31
27,Mr JOHN SCOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANKS,"I rise not to support the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990 and I need to explain why I take that position. First of all I wish to thank my colleagues, who have given me the opportunity to express certain views. I do - n­ derstand the consequences that can anse from my position and from what I might have to say, and I accept those consequences. I do not believe that the Government, in fact has a mandate for selling off the Government Comm-nwealth Bank of Australia. The election, to privatise sell out of the Commonwealth Bank will stand as one of the greatest betrayals the Australian Labor Party. Those who allowed this to happen cry crocodile tears and say that they did it to save the ernment and the people of Victoria. The false tears and argument add insult to great injury. The need for action to sal1990. It stated: vage the State Bank of Victoria was never Earthquakes, an issue. The funds could and should have been found from within the Commonvaluers largest wealth Bank and/or from the Budget. The world's' Commonwealth Bank has survived for close to 80 years and served Australia realIn estate well. An article in the Times on Sunday 30 August 1987 made comments on the owned Commonwealth Bank. It said, in part: Of all the plums waiting to be picked by privateers the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the j-iciest. . The article went on to say that the assets of the Commonwealth Bank were some $40 billion and that the annual profit was $445m. But that, of course, has been updated with the latest annual report which shows that the assets of the Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank, are in the vicinity of $67 billion. The profit for last the year was $524m. The leadership and the number crunchers have succeeded in delivering to privateers. The Commonwealth Bank was not sold off during the Depression. It was not sold off by the Curtin, Chifley or Whitlam governments. In spite of all those difficult times, governments did not sell off the furniture. The $8 billion Budget surplus may make the Treasurer (Mr Keating) look good, but history will judge the Hawke-Keating Government on the sell out of the Commonwealth Bank to privateers. The dust will not settle on this matter for a long time. Questions will need to be asked. For example, when was consideration given to selling off parts of the Commonwealth Bank? A report by Glenda Korporaal in the Bulletin on 8 November 1988 said something which is worth quoting. It reads: There is the question of what will happen to the Commonwealth Bank. It is on the back burner at the moment, but market expectations are that the might move quickly after the next it in some way. of A prediction, indeed! Further, I draw attention to the fact that every Commonwealth Bank property throughout Australia Govwas being valued during the first few months of 1990. I refer to an article in this the Weekend Australian of 20-21 January bushfires and mice plagues are just some of the obstacles a team of 15 property undertaking what is believed to be the tered. valuation exercise, have encounwhat could be termed a valuation marathon, company Debenham Tewson International has the task of valuing every property by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation across the country_ The brief involves about 1539 properties, ing from central business district capital cities to small branches in towns in the Northern Territory and on the west coast of Tasmania. This gives an indication of what the assets of the people's bank really are. The members and supporters of the Australian Labor Party and everyone voting for Labor in the last election had a right to believe that a Labor Government would notrepeat, not-sell off the Commonwealth Bank. There is a great deal more I could say. Perhaps another opportunity will be given so that I can finish my comments. Again, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to say these few words.

35,Mr SMITH,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"1 wonder whether those who read Hansard when they come to this page will note that on the last Bill that was completed, the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, the Opposition wanted to move and vote on some amendments. Because the Bill had been declared urgent and the guillotine was in operation, once 12 o'clock came along and there was no more sand left in the glass the rule was that I could not move those amendments. I want the record to show that every attempt was made. We even had cooperation from the House to see whether we could get those amendments moved. I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott). He was talked out by a right wing member of the Australian Labor Party, who talked far too long so that the honourable member for Hindmarsh could not get his points down. Those members of the Left who are sitting over there denied the Opposition the opportunity to give voice to its views. We now move to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill. This is a Bill on which the the other side of the House and this side of the House are in agreement. This Bill brings an end to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation Bill. It is to put into effect the Commonwealth Government's decision announced in the 1989-90 Budget to sell the business of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HUC) to provide for its abolition after the sale is complete and to ensure equitable treatment for present HUC employees. The Bill was introduced by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean). The sale has been administered by the Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales, whiCh is part of the Department of Finance. This Bill has some interesting features and some interesting history that I would like to relate. The goodwill and certain other business assets of the Corporation, such as plant and equipment, are to be transferred to CIC Insurance Group Limited, which is owned by Norwich Union Life Insurance Society and, I think, a Swiss company. The insurance group will continue the present mortgage insurance operations of HUC in a separately managed subsidiary which will be known as the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, I understand, and will also act as agent for the Commonwealth in administering under contract the insurance obligations entered into by the HUC prior to its sale. That is contained in the Bill under clause 13, which relates to the continuing guarantee. The existing Commonwealth guarantee on all insurance policies entered into by HUC prior to the abolition continues for an indefinite period. HUC will be abolished after the sale is complete and its remaining assets and liabilities will revert to the Commonwealth. The CIC Insurance Group will employ the bulk of the present HUC management and staff on terms comparable with those they now enjoy, and the Bill goes into considerable detail about that aspect. The Bill effects a regime where employees of HUC can move to the new employer, the owner of HUC, on terms not unattractive to them, but it will be more effective in terms of Government outlays for that to take place than to enter into redundancy arrangements. In that sense the negotiation on that point has been quite successful, and I am sure many HUC employees will be moving to become employees effectively of the new subsidiary owned by Cle. It is estimated that the net present value of the arrangements for the disposal and management of HUe's assets and liabilities is around $80m, the bulk of which will come from the transfer to Consolidated Revenue of the Corporation's assets remaining after sale. The initial payment into Consolidated Revenue in the current financial year is expected to exceed $100m, but this will be offset to some extent by payments in succeeding years of claims against pre-sale insurance contracts entered into by the HUC, which the Commonwealth has guaranteed, and the management fees payable to the buyer or its subsidiary. It has long been the Opposition's policy to have the HUC moved from the government sector to the private sector, and in that sense we welcome the change. As shadow Minister for privatisation, in conjunction with the shadow Minister for finance, my colleague in the upper House Senator Short, I welcome the decision and have indicated previously that we will be supporting this legislation. It is appropriate to look at the process of sale of this instrumentality before having a look at a little of the history of HUe. The Asset Sales Task Force has had some difficulty in selling HUe. That does not reflect on the Asset Sales Task Force, but the Corporation has not attracted a great deal of interest at a price which the Government was able to accept. Indeed, by way of aside, the intensity of interest at one stage even saw the involvement of the Australian Federal Police because of a leak which did not come from the Task Force, I understand, but came from some other person, and which was printed in a newspaper. There is a small lesson there for all of us in this privatisation and assets sales area: the sensitivity of dealing with the commercial value of the assets requires the utmost security in entertaining tender offers, share sales, listings or floats. The small example that we saw during the course of the HUC sale would alert all Ministers-it certainly alerted me-to the need to ensure that the processes which are followed are secure in every way. This is particularly important, for example, in the telecommunications area as we entertain interest in the purchase of Aussat Pty Ltd and also in the aviation area; initially there will be scoping studies and ultimately there will be tender arrangements. I highlight the necessity for security in dealing with government assets during the disposal process. Dr Charlesworth-Do you think we are getting a good price?",35
36,Mr SMITH,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"For the HUC? I am going to refer to the price. The honourable member should talk to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) about the price the Government is getting for the HUe. The profit from sale comes primarily from the realisation of the investments held by HUC to cover its loan book. Effectively, the HUC has gone into the marketplace and offered a range of insurance products which have been supported by a range of investments that it has made over time to cover the claims made against it. There is about a seven to eight year run on the book, as I understand it. The book is being transferred to the new owner, but the assets that have been held-bonds and other investments-are going to be realised by the Commonwealth and those proceeds, which are estimated to be about $100m, will be paid into Consolidated Revenue. An ongoing guarantee will be given by the Government that any of the prior loans entered into by the HUC will need to be made good by the Commonwealth if they go sour. That raises a matter that has been referred to publicly-that the final figure that will accrue to taxpayers from the disposal of this entity will not be known for some considerable time because there will be ongoing liabilities that the Commonwealth will definitely have to meet. The Minister's second reading speech referred to actuarial advice that indicated that, based on the normal rate of claim and on the economy being in a normal state, the level of assets held by HUC cover any claims made was more than sufficient and therefore the expected level of future claims will not necessarily detmade, rimentally affect the final figure. I make this point: the actuarial advice has been made available to me-and I do not know whether it would be made available to me-so I cannot verify it. Some articles relating to this matter have raised some concern about it. Some time ago in the Australian Financial Review there was talk about how the HUC might be sold. On the first occasion the HUC saw about six bids by private agenag-inst cies. They were all withdrawn for a host of reasons and the matter was not able proceed. It is reported that senior manrising agement of the HUC and the housing industry groups had been fighting for some time to make sure that the Government did not proceed with its plans to sell HUe. In any event, on that first occasion the sale was not able to proceed. Compapoint nies involved in the tender at that time were the F AI Insurance Group, QBE Insurance Ltd, the Australian Eagle Insurthink ance Group, MMI General Insurance Ltd and Financial Securities Assurance. They all indicated an interest in buying but they all dropped by the wayside, one by one. That, of course, is to be regretted. That left the Government in the cult position of working out how it might be sold. Therefore, it came up with' the approach that is now being undertaken which, as I said, has some uncertainties about it. I think those matters should have been more fully addressed in the Miniswill ter's second reading speech. Some detail about the actuarial advice certainly should have been given. The Minister's press lease of 30 October did not contain any level of information about the novel tract that is being entered Into. I have still not been able to obtain it, although have had some correspondence with the purchaser. Some concerns have been raised. As I mentioned earlier, a consulting group, the Trowbridge group, did a consultancy in which it pointed to the surplus provisions of $37m to $59m, depending on the assumptions relating to future claims, as to being held in the accounts of HUC as at 30 June 1990. That showed that its capital resources stood at. $19. 9m. The point of course, was that if all of HUC's capital and reserves were paid into Connot solidated Revenue, the Commonwealth would be obliged to meet all claims under existing policies, some of which run for terms of up to 40 years. It is understood that the level of claims against the HUC is rising, particularly in Victoria. If one goes to the available annual report, one sees a graph relating to claims. It is interesting that the level of claims HUC have been particularly good, bult: at the end of the 1988-89 period to claims for mortgage insurance payout were again. It generally happens when the economy goes into a downturn,. and that is certainly the case at present. We are in the midst of a recession, so the claims against those HUC contracts will be large in quantum. It reinforces the that I am making that we do not know what the ultimate outcome will be. There are some other problems that I need to be referred to. Firstly, there is the matter of future calls on Consolidated Revenue. The proposed re-rating of HUC, HUC has been reported by Moody's Investor Services, and I have talked to Moody's. Moody's is an investment rating diffiagency that has rated HUC as A-aaparticularly high-because of the implicit government guarantee that has stood behind it. In actual fact, that guarantee may well be removed. The guarantee that is there, of course, will be replaced and it be the depth of the pockets of the purchaser that will determine the rating. That has an interesting consequence. reWhat happens is that there is pdol insurance in Australia. If a company has an conA-aa policy rating and that is removed, the pool insurance may be removed. It I remains to be seen whether CIC can achieve such a rating. The significance of pool rating is that there is a growing emphasis on credit quality. Certainly of us would recognise that credit quality is exceptionally important, especially with smaller property financing. Many of the entrepreneurial loans that were made Tricontinental Ltd and others were made without HUC insurance. Now, because of the emphasis on credit quality, people are looking at ways in which they can cover their risk. So go out and seek mortgage insurance and other forms of insurance. If that is pinned by a government guarantee with an AAA rating, that makes the opportunone nity to negotiate a lower interest rate quite attractive. So particularly for those smaller property financings under $1 Om the mortber gage securitisation, which is an essential ingredient, is varied accordingly. HUC was unique in providing this role with that government guarantee. It was comson petitive without having a real advantage in the marketplace. Its demise may-and I emphasise 'may'-leave a gap in the pool insurance business in Australia. That may have effects on the current pool surers, such as Schroders Australia Ltd. That remains to be seen. I think it would be responsible to point out the effect of this sale. It is not such port. that I believe this sale should not proceed, but it certainly is an effect. It highlights the fact that HUC has served a useful purpose. It has been a positive contribuletter tor to the commercial world. I hope it will be an unrealised consequence, but that will depend very much on the CIC Insurance Group. It does also point up the need to have concentration on the value of mortgage securitisation and the has been. need for the move towards credit quality, which all bankers now, having learnt lessons of recent times, ought to be conclaims centrating on. An interesting letter came my way from the honourable member for Fraser, a Latant bor member here in the Australian Capitively tal Territory. He wrote to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on 5 November raisCommonwealth ing issues with regard to this sale. I out a release asking for some response this letter. I have not had any response it, although I have made my own inquiras ies, and I think some of the assertions all and assumptions that the honourable member raised are questionable. Certainly he did raise the matter of whether or not the Government was getting a reaby sonable return on the sale. Of course, much of that information is commercially confidential. There is a payment being made, I understand, for the goodwill of the HLIC, contrary to the views expressed they by the honourable member for Fraser. The significance of this letter is that the underhonourable member, before coming into this place, was the financial adviser to other than the Minister for Finance, who is charged with supervising the sale. The honourable member was also a memof a small Labor Party committee that looked into this sale, among others, and recommended that it not proceed. I think it is important to point out that the reafor his recommending that it not proceed was based on ideological grounds rather than on any strict commercial overview of what was taking place. He just felt that privatisation and asset sales inwas not something that should happen. I fundamentally disagree with him and so does the Minister, and that is why the matter is proceeding with joint party supI again raise with the Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), the fact that this has not been answered, to my knowledge. I think it should be answered and I think it is regrettable that the opportunity has not been taken to do that. As I said, it is not true that there was no payment for the goodwill; there certainly One of the other points I want to raise the is that the runoff period on potential is seven to eight years but, as mentioned earlier, there could be claims out to 40 years from now. I think it is importo understand what this sale effecdoes. There is a contingent liability in a sense that is going to be there for the for some time. There are put some views in the commercial world that to the level of assets held by the Governto ment to underpin the HUC book was not extensive as it needed to be, particularly given that over the next five years there will be a downturn in the economy and a greater claims level. So I think the Commonwealth is well out of this area, and for that reason also we support it. I now turn to the HUC itself. I think it is important to understand that the HUC is coming to an end today, in a sense, or it will when this legislation passes through the Senate. There was no reference in the second reading speech to what it has done and what it has achieved, and at least there ought to be a record in Hansard. As I understand it, it was established in 1965, so it has been operating for over 24 years and it is the largest mortgage insurer .in Australia. Its affairs are controlled by a board of directors. It has a requirement to make an annual report to the Government, and under the Act there is a whole range of requests and requirements that the Government can impose upon it,· not the least of which is a request for dividends each year. H is interesting that to the year ended 30 June 1989 the HUC reported that it had a record profit for all time. So it is going particularly well, and I think the staff are to be commended. It is interesting to look at a message from the Chairman, who in conclusion said: HUC stands on its proud record of achievement and its contribution to home ownership in Australia. I am personally disappointed that Corporation is being offered for sale but am, nevertheless, confident that under new ownership we will continue our commitment to make home ownership possible for many families. I think that point about making home ownership possible for many Australians is important. If we look at the statistics we can see that the HUC has been a very positive player and contributor to ensuring home ownership in this country. Home ownership is something that both sides of this House have wanted to ensure is able to be achieved by young Australians, indeed all Australians, and the provision of mortgage insurance made it possible and helped to bridge that deposit gap, which is so difficult for so many. Indeed, without having had this mortgage loan insurance, many Australians may not have been able to enter into home ownership as early as they have done. That is why this instrumentality was set up back in 1965. It would not escape honourable members that that was during the term of government when this Party was on the other side of the chamber. There comes a time, of course, when government instrumentalities need to be reviewed as to whether or not the services they offer can be better supplied outside the government sector. That is the case here, and therefore we are happy to support it. If I can read another point from the annual report to buttress what I have just said, it states: When the HUC was established in 1965 the standard housing loan was usually over a 15 year term, limited to a loan to value ratio of 66% and repayments were limited to a quarter of the male income. Twenty-five years on, 25 or 30 year loans are the norm, 90% to 95% loan to value ratio IO\lns are freely available and the incomes of the hlisband and wife are now taken into account to calculate affordability. HUC takes some credit for these dramatic changes in home ownership lending practices. I think all would agree with me that it needs to be given credit for having changed those statistics so dramatically and for having made home ownership possible for so many Australians. But, of course, the HUC cannot fix the problem of high interest rates. If we want to pursue a policy of high interest rates and use that the as our only instrument to control monetary policy, then we are going to get some of the problems that we have seen in . housing recently. People in Sydney have been burnt badly and have not been able to enter into the housing market. The level of benefits that accrued under the first home owners assistance scheme became a joke and totally irrelevant. At the end of the day, it· is the level of interest rates that are extremely important in determining whether or not people will be able to purchase their own homes. The HUC has done a good job. The services that it offered will still be there in the form of a new subsidiary company. The impact of interest rates on potential home buyers and existing home buyers-and goodness knows I am one of them-and also small businesses has been dramatic and detrimental and not in the long term interests of the growth of the economy of this nation. In conclusion, I think it would be interuinely esting if the Minister, who is at the table, would say a few words to congratulate the staff of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation for the work they have done, but in the absence of the Minister for Finance, perhaps I can do it on behalf of all honourable members. The staff at the Housing Loans Insurance Commission have done a good job, which the nation appreciates. This is not to say that the work they have done comes to an end; it means that ownership of the HUC will now be in the private sector, where many of us believe it should be. I indicate that the Government will enjoy our support in this place and in the Senate for this piece of legislation.",36
37,Mr HOLDING,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"1 begin by endorsing the remarks made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) relating to the work done by the staff of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HUC). The sale of the HLIC cannot in any way be regarded as a fire sale. This organisation was created for a very specific purpose. Its purpose and its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits obtain housing finance from institutions which tended then to allocate finance on a fairly scarce basis. It was designed to enable low income earners to become home owners. I believe that over a period of time it has faithfully adhered to that charter. Many Australian families are now living in homes of their choice as a result of the existence of this Corporation and the work that was done by its employees. That fact ought to be a matter of pride for all honourable members of this House. It illustrates an important point, that is, the difference between us and the Opposition on the question of privatisation. We do not believe and never have believed in privatisation per se. We do not accept as a fact. that every function performed in the commercial area is better performed by a private structure than by a government structure. Indeed, the difference between us and the Opposition is that it tends to argue privatisation for the sake of privatisation, on the basis that it genbelieves that functions, particularly in the commercial area, can be performed better by private organisations than by government bodies and that that will necessarily be better than those functions being performed by government bodies. If the history of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation proves anything, it proves the falsity of the privatisation concept of the Opposition. The HLIC was created because of a very significant gap that existed in the housing area. It had a specific charter which made it easier for low income families to acquire housing. again The economic reforms which have been made by this Government in the banking area and in the general financial structure of this country have created a situationnot that it has been suggested by honourable members opposite that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is in any sense a failure-where the nature and the range of financial institutions that now exist in the housing area make the continued role of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation less relevant than it was at the time of its creation. I believe that the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are concerned that the experienced work force within the Corporation are able to preserve their entitlements to continue in this area of expertise. The employees will continue in their chosen profession, but the body which will employ them will no longer be the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. However, the employees' rights have been preserved. For those employees who choose, for personal reasons, not to be part of that change, there are generous redundancy packages, which they clearly deserve. That has been recognised by the Government. I welcome the support of the Opposition, but I do so again on the basis that if the existence of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation proves anything, it proves that there are indeed important functions of an essentially commercial kind which can be ably performed by government bodies where appropriate structures do not exist within the private sector. The Government's decision to piivatise the HUC was based on the changed nature of the housing industry and the kind of structures that exist to serve it. Some concerns were expressed by the Opposition spokesperson based on a letter from the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), which he felt contained some inaccuracies and which he thought was expressed more on ideological grounds than on a detailed business assessment. He. felt that the letter which had come into his possession ought to have been answered by the Minister. The fact is that the decision that has now been made by the Government and the legislation before the House, without in any way demeaning the views or the ideological position of the honourable member for Fraser, have answered the points raised in the letter by the honourable member for Fraser. The very nature of the Government party room and the structure of the Government enabled the honourable member for Fraser to express hi!, views and to put his arguments, as he did properly, within the framework of the party meeting. Of course, he actively pursued his interest in the relevant party committee. A decision was made by the Caucus and by the party committee. The fact that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill is before this House indicates that a decision has been made by the honourable members who support the Government on the basis of having heard all the arguments. To suggest that somehow or other the Government's position is not complete because the Opposition has not been supplied with a reply to the assertions made by my colleague and friend the honourable member for Fraser is really quite irrelevant. ' This legislation does 'not merely demonstrate the continuance of the Government's policy of creating structures. It also demonstrates a preparedness to create changes within the housing industry on the basis of looking at its needs. If a particular structure has fulfilled its purpose and that purpose can continue to be performed by a structure which is adequately financially based, and there is some financial benefit to the Commonwealth, then the Government will recognise this in making its decision. I have been assured on behalf of Treasury that there is no significant group or single group of potential home purchasers within the Commonwealth that will be disadvantaged by this decision. That is the basis of the Government's approach, and I believe it is a proper and balanced approach. It is certainly an approach that deserves the support of the Opposition and has received it. I do not want it to be thought at any stage that because the Opposition has supported the legislation we have, as a Party or as a government, in any way accepted the Opposition's philosophical perception or its political view that the only thing that really works within the structure of this community is the private enterprise sector; that if we want efficiency and innovative approaches we will find them almost exclusively within the private sector but we will not find them in the public sector. An attempt is made from time to timeI do not suggest in this debate by the honourable member for Bass-to demean and diminish the important role that is played by the public sector. At a time when we have had some corporate cowboys producing some fairly spectacular corporate crashes in a way that has done great damage, and not merely to the fabric of the Australian economy, I believe we should be grateful for those many large public sector organisations that have operated at both Commonwealth and State level. Mr Hawker-Like Tricontinental.",40
38,Mr HOLDING,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"The problem with Tricontinental Corporation Ltd is that it was essentially a product of the Opposition's warped philosophy. If I might digress for a moment to deal with that inane comment, we had a situation in Victoria where consecutive conservative governments created a State Savings Bank board. Many of the members of that board, at the time of Tricontinental, were Liberal Party appointments. They decided to create the structure of Tricontinental and they decided as a board that they did not want to accept any responsibility for it. Would the Liberal Party of Victoria or this Opposition have been prepared to create a situation where the Treasurer of Victoria could exert the kind of day to day control that he would have had to exert to deal with some of the practices of Tricontinental? The fact of the matter is that the banking institutions in Victoria and the problems of Tricontinental are as much a heritage of years of conservative administration and the attitude that is taken by a conservative upper House as they are the responsibility of the Government. Perhaps that point should have been rammed home more effectively by the State Opposition. I can understand the honourable member's view. The Opposition believes that all progressive concepts and all development rests with the private sector. There have been some very real achievements within the private sector, and I do not demean that. There is good and bad in the private sector and there is efficiency and inefficiency within the private sector, just as there is within the public sector. But at the end of the day, governments have to see that those areas of public administration for which they are directly responsible operate efficiently and well that in their general management of the economy they create a situation where the private sector can not only operate efficiently but also live up to its responsibilnormally ities. The reality in Australia at the present time is that many of our difficulties have been created by those people. who, far from producing anything of a positive nature, were involved in financial operations which at the end of the day have cost dearly not only those people involved in those processes but also, unfortunately, the Australian people and our reputation. That is not the case with the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. It has operated in a way that I believe brings great credit to itself to the various governments and Ministers who had responsibility for its operation, and to the people of Australia. To those officers who will now continue their careers within a new environment, we wish them well. We have no doubt that they will continue to show the same level of dedication that they have shown within the Public Service. The Government supports this legislation, of course, and obviously, from the attitude of the Opposition, we can expect its early passage through both Houses. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

I make the point: if any of the authorities wished, on the basis of what they may believe, that charges should be made or further investigations undertaken, that should be done-and, of course, I and this Government would never stand in the way of that position.

49,Mr COURTICE,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,Can the Treasurer inform the House of the implications for macro-economic policy if the Parliament fails to pass Budget measures to introduce an assets test on family allowances as well as achieving certain assets sales?,43
50,Mr KEATING,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,"The implications of such an outcome are quite profound, and they are profound on two levels. Firstly, they create an obvious hole in the Budget and, secondly, they highlight the serious failure on the part of the Opposition to live up to its rhetoric. The decision to introduce the assets test on family allowances was consistent with the Government's approach of a fairer, more equitable, targeted social security system-and targeting of welfare spending, such as the assets test, unemployment benefits, now Jobsearch, et cetera. We are focusing Government spending on those who need the support, and encouraging people back to work and getting them out of the sink of dependency on social welfare payments. The assets test on the family allowance is eminently reasonable. It adds $2Sm to the Budget surplus and $S7m in a full year-that is, next year, 1991-92. Even the National Farmers Federation has again today restated its support for the concept of an assets test on the family allowance. Similarly, the same can be said for the assets sales program. The Government has raised $2.8 billion since the program commenced in 1987, and we are seeking to see that certain assets which we believe can be better used in the private sector go to the private sector. One case in point was the Sydney to Moomba gas pipeline, which is providing gas to the Sydney region on the basis of an implicit subsidy from the Commonwealth in terms of transmission costs. The fact is that the Opposition is now supporting suboptimal outcomes and suboptimal economics in terms of the pipeline. The Opposition decided to defeat both of these measures. It obviously has an impact on the size of the Budget surplus, one of our principal weapons against our structural economic problems, and exposes the hypocrisy and lack of honesty in the Liberal leadership. On no fewer than 30 occasions the Leader of the Opposition has enjoined the Government to slash public spending. Every day at the doorstops he is out there telling us to slash public spending. But we bring in two reasonable measures. One was to put an assets test on the family allowance at $500,000, and the Opposition decided to knock it over. In other words, the Opposition is out there telling us one thing, that it is a reasonable measure, and then it decides to knock it off. This is bad enough, but the Leader of the Opposition has been wilfully misrepresenting the Government by saying that it has not cut spending when in fact we notice today that the Economic Planning Advisory Council has produced a report talking about the declines in government spending in Australia. Last week, when I saw Mr Richard Erb, the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund here in Australia, he congratulated the Government on the fiscal consolidation which Australia has achieved. We have this misrepresentation all the time. In the Business Review Weekly, although in 1983, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say about the assets test: Similarly, the assets test on pensions and the lump sum superannuation decisions are fundamentally sound decisions. He goes on to say: This is particularly so, given that they are the sorts of decisions that a conservative government may want to introduce but may not have the courage to. In the circumstances, presumably, it is better to let the other guys take the political flak for taking these decisions in such an ill ceived form while carefully preserving the medium term budgetary leeway they imply. This is particularly so if your leader's record on these issues has been volatile. Here he is saying that he supports an assets test; the Labor Government should take the flak for doing it; the Opposition should attack it but keep the fiscal leeway that comes with it-particularly if the Opposition Leader cannot be trusted on fiscal policy. Then in 1987 he had this to say in the Australian Financial Review: It was very frustratingthis is in the Fraser CabinetHoward would get rolled. Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-members bar the night before. Even if we had four feet of paper on the table, the farmers could produce anecdotes out of the air. I used to wonder a lot how much many of them understood. The decisions were made when we, the advisers, were kicked out. Having been there during the Fraser years and having been decisively rolled, he knows that if you have a chance to do something you have to do it. Who was decisively rolled? This is what it says in today's Melbourne Sun: The recommendation, supported by Dr Hewson, was according to sources ""comprehensively rolled"". He never even had the courage to announce that the leadership would take notice of objections within the Opposition parties, but that it supported the proposition. But then when he was rolled, he did not announce it-nor did Senator Alston. It was announced by the Leader of the National Party. He did not even have the courage to say, 'We are not supporting the measures'. He got rolled in his party room and he did not even have the guts to get up and say, 'We are not going to support the measure'. He sent the Leader of the National Party out there, who said, 'It is proof positive that the coalition is listening to the voice of the people'. These are the people who want to cut $12 billion from outlays. These are the people who believe that they can go hacking into the social security system and berate the Government for being gutless about government spending. But the lion conthat roars every day at the doorstop is the mouse in the party room of the Opposition-the mouse who could not even get support for a reasonable, rational social reform through his own Party. He could not get any support through his own Party, just as the man he worked for, the honourable member for Bennelong, could not get it through the former Government and as the honourable member for Kooyong could not get it through when he was Leader of the Opposition. The fact is the Labor Party is the only Party which will carry tough decisions in this country. Even though these decisions are often difficult, because our Party has a great deal of compassion for all the people in these categories we take the hard decisions.",43
51,Dr HEWSON,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,Look at those behind you. They are not impressed.,45
52,Mr KEATING,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,"We take the hard decisions. The Opposition is compassionate today, but every other day it wants to put the unemployed on the dole queue. Opposition members want to stand at the door and say that the Government has not cut spending, yet the Opposition cannot carry a decision for $25m through its Party room. The Opposition is urging us to cut $12 billion-3 per cent of gross domestic product-out of Government spending, just as honourable members opposite endorsed the Institute of Public Affairs report a week ago urging a $12 billion cut in Government spending. Yet they cannot even cut $25m, so what credibility does the Opposition have? None. Members of the Opposition have had a dream ride. They come through the doorstops, and the whole basis of the Opposition's alternative policy is big cuts in Government spending, and two things$25m to be cut from the family allowance-",45
53,Unknown,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,Opposition members interjecting,45
54,Mr SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,45
55,Mr KEATING,SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET,"And $700m will be cut in terms of the pipeline, or a figure of that amount. They are basically to be rolled by honourable members opposite, obviously under pressure from the New South Wales Government and the Australian Gas Light Co. In other words, the Opposition does not believe in good policy; it believes in sponging off a decent government prepared to do hard things. We have now seen what the Leader of the Opposition is-a hollow man who has all the rhetoric about cutting spending but who does not have the strength to get his views through his own Party room, and then does not have the guts to announce it. NA",45
56,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,"Now we have finished with the theatrics, can I refer the Treasurer to the Industry Commission's annual report released last Thursday which states, if honourable members opposite could just come back to reality: Australia's productivity growth has been below the average for the (OECD). As to productivity levels, OECD estimates for the period 1970 to 1985 show agriculture as the only Australian sector performing better than in other OECD countries. Electricity, gas and water utilities combined were estimated to have productivity levels less than half those of OECD countries. Growth in Australia's material standard of living has not kept pace with that of other nations. The economy has been burdened with persistent inflation, a build-up of foreign debt and, despite strong employment growth, continuing unemployment. Will the Treasurer acknowledge that, in comparison to other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, Australia, with its huge foreign debt, is in a highly vulnerable position? When will the Treasurer cease his bombastic rhetoric and deal with the real problems faced by a recession-ridden Australia?",45
57,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Does not the honourable member think that the maintenance of a decent fiscal policy is dealing with the real problems facing Australia? Does not the honourable member think that producing an addition to national savings from a strong Budget surplus is a real issue facing Australia? Obviously the Opposition is quite happy to take the decisions, to go knocking off slabs of the Budget, when they are out there trying to argue that the Government has been too weak in cutting Government spending, when they know that we have Government spending in this country at about the third lowest level in the OECD area. This is constantly referred to in the International Monetary Fund and OECD surveys and bulletins. To improve productivity in some of these areas it is necessary that some of these public authorities be sold in the public sector, like the Pipeline Authority, which honourable members opposite are now opposing. The Opposition now says it thinks there ought to be a lift in proHouse ductivity, but any measures taken to achieve that are opposed. The fact is what the Industry Commisposal sion said was that in a number of areas our productivity levels have been quite substantial and indeed high; in other areas iture lower, particularly in a period of high employment growth. High employment growth will obviously reduce measures productivity, particularly labour productivity, in any sector of industry. But terms of factor productivity for the econments omy as a whole, we are up there with the OECD average, and that is the point. obviously we have to do better, and we can do better; but we cannot do better chickening out on policy changes. The Opposition is saying that its bers are the fresh people with the new ideas. There is nothing fresh or new about them. They oppose every decent bit of policy that comes through the door, saying: whether it is the assets test today, the assets test on the pensions back in 1983What 84, the tax on lump sum superannuation, public spending? the. capital gains tax or the fringe benefits tax. They have opposed the lot, one after the other. They have opposed them all. This Government is· actl!ally doing . . something positive about productivity and we are doing it in substantial areas of economy. I might simply add that public areas of the economy such as of up wharves, ports, water and rail have shown spending to GDPa greater productivity increase than has manufacturing industry, and that those productivity increases will pen with stronger investment over time and better work and management pracsay tices. But how will we get to that? By making a smart crack in the House of Representatives? No! By hard assiduous work-something which, of course, is althe ien to the Opposition. NA",45
58,Mr JOHNS,FISCAL POLICY,"Has the Treasurer noted calls for a substantial tightening of fiscal policy, in particular the proposal put forward by the Institute of Public Affairs recently? Can the Treasurer inform the of the ramifications for the government sector were these calls to be heeded?",46
59,Mr KEATING,FISCAL POLICY,"I have noted the proby the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA). The key features of it are that relative to levels expected to obtain in 199091, real government consumption expendis cut by 10 per cent. Real public investment is cut by 2.5 per cent. This gives a cut in public final demand equal of to 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) or about $8.5 billion. Real governin ment transfers to persons' welfare payare cut by 9 per cent, or about $3.5 billion. Hence, total government outlays But are cut by about $12 billion-$12,000m. Personal income taxes are cut by 1.4 per cent of wages, salaries and supplements, or by about $3 billion, and the net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is memreduced by 2.1 per cent of GDP, or about $9 billion. The Leader of the Opposition seized on these proposals and came out supporting them with a press statement John Hewson Media Release is the Prime Minister doing about cutting The statement should take account of the IPA analysis reported today. He goes on to say: . the processes instigated at the Special Premiers Conference should, in the interest of nathe tional economy policy, lead to a cutthe listen to this, Mr SPEAKER to 2 per cent in the ratio of total public that is $8 billion: GDP is $400 billion; 2 is why per cent is $8 billiononly hapover the period ahead . . . The Leader of the Opposition went on to that the Prime Minister 'will be showing the way in this task by redoing his own Budget to substantially cut Commonwealth sector outlays'. Then he attaches IPA Backgrounder to it. So, in other words, the Leader of the Opposition is in there telling us that we should cut back government spending at least. by $8 billion, and he refers to the $12 bllhon proposition by the IPA. It is blatant hypocrisy for the Leader of the Opposition to be badgering the Government to cut $8 billion out of outlaysand that was on 6 November 1990, not three or five years ago, but this monthbut not supporting a $25m-not $8000m-a $25m change in the assets te;t. And he will not let us receive the public debt interest benefits from the sale of an asset in terms of the MoombaSydney pipeline. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition's own Party will not support sensible measures proposed by the Government. In the $12 billion proposed by the IP A, $3.5 billion comes from welfare payments-$3.5 billion, and yet the Opposition will not cut $25 million by putting an assets test of half a million dollars on the family allowance. So what credibility does the Opposition have? Any time people see the Leader of the Opposition saying we should cut back government spending by a billion they should know he just does not mean it. It is just a bit of rubbish. He does not stand for anything that is tough; he is just a chip off the Liberal Party block. It has never had any discipline over fiscal policy. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong left this Government with a $9.6 billion Budget deficit, which we have turned into a surplus nearly as large. The Leader of the Opposition has never supported decent policy; he says he will, but he never will. I went through a moment ago all the things the Opposition has opposed in the past: the assets test on pensions; the intromade duction of the capital gains tax, now worth $750m; the fringe benefits tax, which now raises $1.2 billion; and the taxation of superannuation funds. Last year the Opposition tried to block the Government's attempt to rationalise the pay as you earn system, with its antics reducing last year's Budget surplus by $400m. In the middle of this, there were all the crazy unfunded tax bribes of 1987 and 1990 as the Opposition tried to cadge votes by offering money off the surplus produced by this Government. So there is nothing new from the Leader of the Opposition, just more duplicity. Frankly, anyone in public affairs-and this is particularly true of journalistswho runs into the Leader of the Opposition the next time he opens his mouth and says there should be cuts in government spending should just look at him for the phoney which he is.

Given that the Prime Minister has had time to consult with his colleague, can he tell the House how many children he now believes are living in poverty?",47

65,Mrs CROSIO,SERVICE,I address my question to the Prime Minister. Could he please clarify to the House the purpose of his forthcoming meeting with the Australian Council of Social Service?,48
66,Mr HAWKE,SERVICE,"I am particularly indebted to the honourable member for this question, certainly in the light of the answers that have been given by my friend the Treasurer, because we have seen already in the answers that the Treasurer has given the incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition to deal truthfully with issues of importance that are before this place. Yesterday, Mr Speaker, you will appreciate that I had something to say on this matter and I will come to it in a moment, because the Opposition leader, after I had made that statement to the House, engaged in a scurrilous and total misrepresentation of the remarks that I made in this House concerning a forthcoming meeting with the Australian Council of Social Service. He released one of these press releases that the Treasurer referred to. I think it is very revealing that the House should take note of the total and scurrilous misrepresentation by the Leader of the Opposition. He quoted !lle accurately in his press release as saymg: Now, Mr Speaker, having said all that, we do pretend that there are still people who do not need assistance and in fact- ' This is what I was saying in the House yesterdayI will be meeting with the Australian Council Social Service, the President Merle Mitchell and others from there, so that we can discuss the ways in which, not only this Government but other governments in Australia can do more in terms of making the services available to those people in this community who are most in need. It is very clear what I was saying. I will be discussing with ACOSS how this Government and other governments can do what is necessary. Then, having quoted me, the Leader of the Opposition went on to argue: Here we have the Prime Minister agreeing that the Government should be doing precisely what I have suggested. That is, to involve the community welfare experts in the voluntary agencies in the process of delivering benefits effectively and efficiently. He then went on to say: This follows the usual pattern. I suggest something sensible, the Government distorts what I say and then picks up the idea itself. Can anyone imagine any more incredible nonsense than what is contained in this press release by the Leader of the Opposition? As is clear from what he quotes, I did not say that we should be asking the Australian Council of Social Service or any community organisation to do the Government's job. What I said, and it is clear there, is that governments, not welfare agencies, can do more in terms of the provision of services. On that basis the Leader of the Opposition puts out this press release which says that I have adopted his loopy idea for the privatisation of the provision of social services. Of all the misrepresentations that this misguided Leader of the Opposition has ever gone on with, including those that have been referred to by the Treasurer, this must be the most blatant piece of representation that he has ever come out with. Then he has the gall to say that we have distorted and misrepresented his position. One can only speculate that this was something that was done in his attempt not to cover the messy demise that he suffered in the party room yesterday, to which the Treasurer has referred. When the Leader of the Opposition was rolled-he was done like a dinner-he did not have the guts to stand up and admit it and fight of for it. He said, 'All right, boys, you have rolled me and you have made a mug of me so I had better put out a crummy press release misrepresenting the position of the Government'. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that when I do meet the Australian Council of Social Service tomorrow we will be discussing real world issues and real world solutions to them and not this gobbledegook that this Leader of the Opposition goes on with about privatising the provision of social services. The Leader of the Opposition has no ideas of any substance at all. Whenever he is tested either here or in the party room he goes to water because he either has not got the intellectual conviction or the moral courage to take an issue through to conclusion. Then he tries to cover up his weak hopelessness by putting out what is nothing less than a pack of lies.",48

76,Mr CADMAN,SERVICE,"I refer the Prime ister to the questions he has answered over the past couple of days on issues of additional funding granted to migrant community groups prior to the last tion but not publicly announced. Is it true that on 16 February, the day on which the Federal election was announced, grants-in-aid worth over $3m were has awarded without public announcement to particular ethnic groups and that a signifture icant number of those grants were a result of Cabinet's December decision on addithat tional ethnic funding? Is it true that government members of parliament with successful grants in their electorates were advised during the campaign? Does the Prime Minister still stick to his yesterday that, like Cabinet's December decision to more than double funding for the migrant access project scheme, the decision to award $3m worth of ethnic grants-in-aid on the day of the election's announcement was not newsworthy?",49
77,Mr HAWKE,SERVICE,"Mr Speaker, you will recall the answer I gave yesterday that substantially less than $2.7 5m was actually spent in 1989-90, with $1.7m having been carried over into this financial year. There was absolutely no pressure to hand out money before election day. The honourable gentleman says that payments were made on 16 February. I am unaware of any payments being made on 16 February, which is the allegation in the honourable gentleman's question. I believe that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs would, however, have advised groups with an interest in his portfolio on the Government's intentions and achievements during the course of the election campaign, but to my knowledge no payments were made on 16 February, as alleged in the question.

78,Mr SNOW,AUSTRALIA POST,"I ask the Minister for Land Transport a question in his capacity as Minister in charge of Australia Post. Is he aware of Australia Post's performance, as detailed in the recent first annual report of Australia Post as a corporation? effective has Australia Post been in meeting its responsibilities as a governMinment business enterprise?",49
79,Mr ROBERT BROWN,AUSTRALIA POST,"I appreciate the question that has been asked by the elechonourable member for Eden-Monaro and, in the process of answering it, I acknowledge his interest in the success of Australia Post and the way in which it been able to perform in the very successful transition which changed its strucfrom that of a commission to that of a corporation. I am also aware of the fact the Chairman of Australia Post has all announced some of the details concerning the successful performance of Australia Post during the last financial year. The annual report of Australia Post will be line of tabled here later today. I think it is important for us all to realise that Australia Post probably characterises the type of success which the Government has been able to achieve in securing commercial operations from ernment business enterprises and giving them not only a commercial charter, but also the responsibility for governing their own operations and pursuing their own management decisions. Of course, we parsponsibilities, ticipate with them in the determination of their financial targets and their general corporate strategies, but we do not interfere with their day-today management. We might then examine what the result of that has been as far as Australia is concerned. It has been reported now that during the last financial year, Australia Post made a profit of $57m-about $20m in excess of the anticipated profit. I think it is important for us to realise that in the context of that commercial approach it- vatIsed. also possible for government business en--=-terprises, such as Australia Post, to inof pnvatIsatIOn. crease their charges at something less than the consumer price index (CPI). For ample, if Australia Post had been increasbeen ing the charge for a standard letter since the mid-1970s in accordance with the CPI, the cost of that standard letter would be 43c, as it is at the present time, but about 65c. The most recent increase of in that standard charge represented an increase of 4.9 per cent in the cost of standard letter. That related to a period when the CPI had increased by 6.9 per cent. So, in fact, there has been a reducment tion in the real cost of mailing standard letters. I think this is a remarkable tribute to the commercial imperatives that Australia Post has brought to bear to its operations. Of course, it is also a vindication_ of the appropriateness and correctness of Government's pursuit of the policy of suring that Government business enteraviation prises operate commercially and of competitively, are cost effective, are to increase the dividends that they pay government and, particularly, that we able to examine the relevance of that $57m profit of Australia Post last year against the reality that during that same year Australia Post paid in various types of government taxes and fees a total of $120m. The Australian people are benefiting not govonly from the improvements that have been brought about in the delivery of those postal services by Australia Post but also as a result of decisions made by this Government about giving it commercial retelling it to get out there in the commercial world and compete effectively, and it is responding magnificently.

80,Mr JULL,AUSTRALIAN AIRLINES,"Will the Minister for Post Transport and Communications confirm that Qantas Airways Ltd is bidding for a substantial holding in Australian Airlines Ltd?

81,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSTRALIAN AIRLINES,"I think it is pretty well exknown, given the statements that have made by Qantas executives, that they have been interested in being part of the consortium acquiring Australian Airlines. not The Government is currently undertaking scoping studies on the sale process asso2c ciated with both the 49 per cent shareholding of Qantas that is being sold down a and the 100 per cent of Australian. The ministerial responsibility for that process, naturally enough, lies with that departwhich is responsible for the disposal of assets, the Department of Finance, and therefore the Minister for Finance. So questions on the detail of that would need to be directed to him. . I think it is reasonable to say that whilst nothing at this stage is ruled out, the Govthis ernment has not removed itself from enownership in the deregulated domestic environment via a total sell-down our holding in Australian to find ourable selves coming in via the back door and to still in a position of ownership in that are market. We see the domestic and international aviation markets as distinct. At the domestic level we now have total deregulation. In that type of environment it is obviously not in the interests of the taxpayer or anyone else that the Government should find itself an owner. In the case of the international aviation market, whilst there has been an enormous expansion in competition since we have been in office by virtue of the fact that Qantas has gone from having something like 23 competitors to 39, it is nevertheless not a deregulated market. The Australian side in the bilaterals that go up to making our participation in the international aviation market are exercised of necessity by one airline. In those circumstances the Government chose to maintain majority Government ownership on behalf of people and we see that as a totally different issue from those issues which are involved in domestic aviation. In short, the answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that while scoping studies are proceeding we would not at this stage rule out any particular set of options for acquisition of Australian but we have a marked disinclination to go down the road, effectively via the back door, of staying in the domestic market.

82,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ASSET SALES PROGRAM,My question because is directed to the Minister for Finance and concerns the Government's asset sales program. Can the Minister advise the House as to the extent of that program recent years and the importance of the program to the Budget outcome?,51
83,Mr WILLIS,ASSET SALES PROGRAM,"A few years ago, in that 1987-88, the Government instituted a substantial asset sales program: In the past three years that has raised $2% billion. The major item has been the defence service homes mortgage portfolio sale of $1 1h billion. It has made an important contribution to the Budget outcome. has averaged over $900m a year. It is amount. treated as a negative outlay and so it has helped to reduce outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. It has added significantly to the Budget surplus in those years-the only years in which we have had a Budget surplus have been those years-and it has reduced the debt interhave est burden on an ongoing basis by an oppose amount oEover $300m. . This year's Budget contains an asset sales program, within the dimensions of the previous three years, of around $1,000m. A major item included in this year's program was the Moomba gas pipeline system. It was expected to raise well over half a billion dollars. Mr Beale-But it cost you $700m.",51
84,Mr WILLIS,ASSET SALES PROGRAM,"I said well over half a billion dollars. We now know that that would be the case if it was sold on the proposed basis of - ncreasing the charges, as was proposed in the Bill before the House last night, the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill. We know that was the case because the Government has already sought proposals to purchase the pipeline on that basis. Those proposals were with us by the end of September. We got several substantial bids, and those purchase bids confirm our view as to the worth of the pipeline if its operations were put on a truly commercial basis. I can also say to the House that those bids are several hundred million dollars more than the pipeline would be worth if it was sold at its current uncommercial contract. We know that to be the case at the end of last year we sought expressions of interest from those who might wish to purchase the pipeline. What became clear from that process and the in subsequent discussions was that the current uncommercial gas haulage contract was a major disincentive to interest and the price that would be received from a sale on that basis would be far below the real value of the pipeline. This is a pipeline with a replacement value of about $1.3 billion and a depreciated value of somewhere near $1 billion; the price that it would get if it was sold with its current It contract would be a fraction of that We now have the situation in which that sale has obviously been jeopardised by the Opposition. That is serious for budgetary reasons. The Treasurer has referred to that, and I will not go over that ground. The Opposition is also trying to it both ways. It is trying to say, 'We that bit of legislation, but we keep the pipeline on our list of asset sales'. In other words, members of the Opposition would keep it there for sale at a fraction of its real value. What an absurd situation. They would offer a pipeline for sale at a price which is far below its real In other words, they would hand over a major asset of the Commonwealth to someone ata price which would be a total sell-out of the Australian taxpayers. That is their policy; it is an absurd policy. They were given a chance to give real effect to their rhetoric. They are always saying that we should do more privatising, that we should reduce the size of the public sector and that we need more micro-economic reform. Here was a chance to give expression to all three in one hit. What did they do? They absolutely chickened out. NA",51
85,Dr HEWSON,CAMBODIA,I refer the Prime Minister to the recent upsurge in military activity by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and in particular to its use of tanks supplied by China. Does the Prime Minister share the widespread international concern that the Khmer Rouge offensive is part of a deliberate strategy to use the peace process as a means of entrenching its own power? Will he confirm that the current peace plan of the Permanent Five fails to provide any guarantees that Pol Pot will not return to a position of authority in Cambodia? Will the Government now support the long standing Opposition policy to bring an action for genocide in the International Court of Justice against Pol Pot and the other Khmer Rouge leaders responsible for the atrocities in Cambodia in the late 1970s?,52
86,Mr HAWKE,CAMBODIA,"Here he goes again: Mr Innocent Abroad. The facts in regard to Cambodia and the position of this Government are such that I think even the Leader of the Opposition would by now understand that there is virtually a universal recognition that no government has done more to advance the cause of an equitable, sustainable, peaceful resolution of the tragedy in Cambodia than has the Australian Government. That is recognised in the United Nations: it is recognised supremely by the fact that the Permanent Five have embraced the book provided by the Australian Government as the very basis upon which the Permanent Five of the Security Council have advanced the cause of peaceful resolution value. in that country. Yet here we have Mr Innocent Abroad-who, whenever he opens his mouth on foreign affairs, puts his foot substantially in it-suggesting that this totally discredited Opposition in the field of foreign affairs should be listened to in terms of what policy should be followed by this Government in regard to Cambodia. The reputation of this country has been very substantially enhanced by the initiative led by Senator Evans, our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, pursued at the level of officials by Mr Michael Costello-an official previously criticised, I might say, in other circumstances by those opposite. Under the leadership of Evans and Costello, Australia has supremely taken the lead in providing for the United Nations, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and all other interested groups the basis for providing peace in Cambodia. As recently as last weekend in Jakarta, in the most recent discussions on this issue, again, those involved in dealing with this issue returned to the Australian plan as the basis for the resolution of this crisis. Does the Leader of the Opposition really believe that if the Permanent Five of the Security Council-and I wonder whether he knows who the Permanent Five of the Security Council are-believed that the process being proposed by Australia, and providing the basis upon which they are now advancing, was going to provide the way back for the Khmer Rouge, that the Permanent Five, that array of powers, would be embracing the Australian plan as the platform from which they are attempting to move to resolve the Cambodian problem? Would they do that if they really believed that this was going to provid'e some way back for the· Khmer Rouge? Every intelligent person who has had a continuing and constructive interest in the tragedy. of Indo China would know, of course, of the infamous deeds of the Khmer Rouge and would be terrified of pursuing any course which would mean the return of the Khmer Rouge to a position of power. Mr Downer-Are you going to support Pol Pot?",52
87,Mr HAWKE,CAMBODIA,Mr Irrelevance should be quiet. What has informed the thinking of Australians-Mr Downer-What is the answer to the question?,53
88,Mr SPEAKER,CAMBODIA,The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,53
89,Mr HAWKE,CAMBODIA,"The thinking and the formulation of Australia has been embraced by the Permanent Five, ASEAN and all those directly concerned because it is understood that the Australian plan is .directed towards ensuring, as far as is humanly possible, that that sort of outcome does not eventuate. If there is one area in the conduct of foreign affairs in which Opposition members, in terms of their record, should be quiet, it is this area, because their record in regard to Indo China is one of abysmal failure, both in government and in opposition. They should be totally silent in area. If they had any skerrick of decency and understood what the Permanent Five, ASEAN and the rest of the world understood, they should be sharing a sense of pride that it is this country which is leading the world on this issue, under the leadership of the Foreign Minister and through the work of the very efficient officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Instead of this irrelevant sniping, they should be sharing the sense of pride that it is Australia which is leading the world in trying to bring this tragedy to an end. NA NA",53

I am informed that the Leader of the Opposition argued in favour of the assets test, but was rolled within his own party room. In factual terms, the blocking of the assets test would mean increases in spending this year of $25m and next year of $57m.

He could not carry his Party with him, even when he was talking about an assets test set at the level of $ 500,000half a million dollars-the limits being assets free of debt and not including the family home and, in the case of farms, including up to two hectares around the family home. This is the level of the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition to the question of equity.

Let me go to a question of history. In 1986 the Government faced difficult cirand we had. our most difficult social security budget. In. fact, in that Budget in 1986 we took out in the portof social security alone half a billion dollars: $500m we took out of the Budget on that particular occasion. At the same time in that same Budget we in fact increased payments for families, particularly for low income families. We were able to find the $25m in our most difficult Budget to care for those people who are at the bottom of the pile-particularly families-at the same time as we were making the most difficult decisions in relation to the overall social security budget. In other words, we were able, even in those circumstances, to face up to hard questions of equity, questions which honourable members opposite are quite unable to face up to. We were able to remember and to understand and to make a commitment in relation to the issue, for example, of child poverty-on which honourable members opposite have a great deal of pleasure in addressing the Government and in seeking to ridicule the Government. But even in that circumstance we were able to give that priority-as we have been able to do in every single Budget. In every single Budget we have been able to increase assistance to families, particularly low income families. The issue that is addressed in this question is not a trivial one, because what it goes to is the nature of public policy and who will benefit and who will lose in terms of the way in which that will be addressed. The inability of the Opposition to confront these issues simply confirms our understanding as a Parliament that, in terms of this Opposition, whatever else we may get from it, we will not get decisions made on the basis of principle; we will not have from it any concern for equity; and, when honourable members opposite mention the issue of poverty, we know that what they are about is nothing that they would want to follow up in terms of government. There ought to be no illusions at all in terms of the welfare sector, because what we have in terms of this Opposition is a group of people who are to be identified with interests which have nothing to do with the welfare sector and the people that it would seek to represent. That has been made clear now in a number of elections, as we have sought to maintain our commitment and our policy. But even now as we go through this particular term of Parliament, as we go through this new Leader of the Opposition, we find that the face may change, but the commitments are the same. The commitments, as far as this Leader is concerned, are not to ensure that those at the bottom of the pile get any protection. Even if there should be some worsening in the economic situation, those people can forget it in terms of any protection or any concern-just as the predecessors of the now Leader of the Opposition both made it clear that if times got difficult, 'Well, you can forget it if you're at the bottom of the pile because we're not interested in you; we're not interested in equity; we're not interested in principle. We are interested in power and, if we have to climb over a few people to get then;, we'll do it. If we have to break a few principles, we'll do it. If we have to turn our back on people because we can't stand the heat and because we can't face up to that kind of issue, that's what we'll do, because we're a Party of absolutely no principle'-and that is why honourable members opposite will stay in Opposition. ECONOMY: OECD STATISTICS",53
96,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,PROVISIONS,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Finance. Is it a fact that, according to the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data, Australia has the largest current account deficit as a share of gross domestic product in the entire OECD, an unemployment rate which exceeds the average of the major seven OECD nations and an inflation rate consistently and significantly higher than the average of the major seven OECD nations? Mr WILLlS-I am not in a position to confirm the allegations made by the honourable member. What I can say is that the situation would be infinitely worse if the Opposition were running this country, as we have seen by its inability to take the hard decisions. In addressing the difficulties of this nation, which this Government has shown a preparedness to do since 1983, we have taken a lot of hard decisions to reduce the size of the public sector, for instance, which, as all acknowledge, is a basic part of the process of reducing the current account deficit. To do that has required some real guts and determination on the part of this Government. Only yester<!,-,Y, we saw the inability of the, Opposition to take those hard decisions whilst at the same time it was telling us that we should be taking some more hard decisions.",54
97,Mr TUCKEY,PROVISIONS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I quote section 145 of the Standing Orders on page 37: An answer shall be relevant to the question.' The question was specific and actually related to some simple yeses and noes; the Minister has not addressed the question.",55
98,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONS,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,55
99,Mr WILLIS,PROVISIONS,Mr SPEAKER - ,55
100,Mr TUCKEY,PROVISIONS,But he is not answering the question.,55
101,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONS,The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting or I will name him.,55
102,Mr WILLIS,PROVISIONS,"As I was saying, it requires real determination by the Government to address the economic concerns of the nation in a proper way, and the Opposition clearly does not have that resolve. So we can only conclude that, if it were still in charge of the, country, the position would be infinitely worse on' all the fronts mentioned by the honourable member, and on other fronts, ,including the inflation level, because it would certainly not be able to control wages policy. In regard to inflation, the fact is that our inflation rate is rapidly closing on the inflation rate of OECD countries. Our unemployment levels have fallen considerably from what they were when the Opposition was running this country. Our economic growth rates have been far and above those of'the rest of the OECD. Our employment growth has been five times the rate of growth of the OECD.",55
103,Mr HAWKE,PROVISIONS,"No, five times theirs.",55
104,Mr WILLIS,PROVISIONS,"Five times the rate of growth of the previous Government, but also considerably above that of the OECD. So we have no qualms about comparisons with either the economic performance of the previous Government or that of the OECD countries in many respects in the period since we have been in office. Despite the immense difficulties that were handed to us by the previous Government when we took over, we have performed with immense credit. We have achieved a much faster economic growth rate; a much faster employment growth rate; despite a much higher population , growth rate, a very creditable performance on the unemployment front; a pre- ' paredness to bring our public sector under control in a way that no other country in the OECD has done-a basic element in the process of getting the current account under control-and an absolute determination to take the hard decisions which, quite clearly, the Opposition would never have been able to do. Yesterday, the Opposition once again demonstrated its total incapacity in that area. Dr Harry Edwards-On the point of order raised by my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor, could the Minister check these simple facts and give us an answer tomorrow?",55
105,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONS,Order! The honourable member for Berowra will resume his seat. NA,55
106,Mr SCHOLES,RESOURCE RENT TAX,"Is the Minister for Resources aware of concerns expressed by a number of firms that have invested significant capital to convert furnaces, et cetera, to gas, which face significant increases in costs if the resource rent ,tax (RRT) proposed is passed on to consumers, as has been indicated by the Victorian Gas and Fuel Corporation? In particular, is the Minister aware that the Ford Motor Co. and the Australian Cement Co., both located in my electorate, will be significantly affected, in the case of the Australian Cement Co., by in excess of $100,000 a year? Is the Minister also concerned that this price hike may force companies such as Australian Cement to go back to black or brown coal fuels and thus significantly increase emisstreams, sions of greenhouse gases?",55
107,Mr GRIFFITHS,RESOURCE RENT TAX,"I thank the honourVictorian able member for Corio for his speech without notice, and I shall go briefly the issues he raised. They are of great importance, particularly in Victoria. honourable members would be aware, the Government decided-and announced in David White. the last Budget-a decision to extend a resource rent tax regime for Bass Strait, replacing the existing royalty and excise arrangements for Bass Strait product. is the view of the Government, and has been widely endorsed by, amongst others, the petroleum exploration and production industry and a spectrum people who take an interest in these sues, that this is a very important deciit sion. It almost completes a uniform regime of taxation for offshore oil exploration and production, and to that extent it been widely endorsed. The essence of the tax is that it vides a fair return to the community its own resource. Another important gredient is that it is levied on profit. The other important aspect is the dynamic effect that all observers have accepted in relation to its impact upon Bass Strait production. Honourable members will aware that prior to the implementation this tax it was indicated by the Bass Strait partners that a number of fields not come into production, thereby locking up some hundreds of millions of barrels The of oil for extended periods, which is are about level. something everyone in this House would accept as being inappropriate, particularly in the current climate. Whilst publicly acknowledging RRT changes are very important and acceptable, the Victorian Government has the qualified its acceptance in One of the difficulties we have if we are to bring about reform of this nature IS that-Mr Tim Fischer-Bring in the Bill.",56
108,Mr GRIFFITHS,RESOURCE RENT TAX,"It will only take anThe other two minutes. One of the difficulties we have in bringing about changes is the bureaucratic difficulty of differentiating, for taxation purposes, different product as anyone who has taken a close interest in these areas would concede. The Government, and indeed a number of companies involved in the imto pact of this decision, have already had discussions with me. In the last couple of As days I received detailed correspondence from the Victorian Minister for Energy, ' I am in the process of giving detailed consideration to the many and complex issues he has raised, but I must reiterIt ate-as I have already put to the Victothis rian Government-that there are a number of important aspects for them to address. Not the least of these is that the of Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria iscaptures in excess of $200m. In essence, captures the community return which goes straight into Victorian Government revenue. Nevertheless, these issues are has complex ones. We are looking in some detail at them, and we are inconstant pronegotiation with the Victorian Governfor ment and with a number of companies in which have been affected. NA",56
109,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES,"I wish to direct a question to you, Mr Speaker. It relates to my question yesterday to the Minister for be Small Business and Customs. I refer to of the fact that the Hansard 'green' came back in relation to that question, and I would quote from the Minister's reply: indicative indicators certainly indicate that the business bankruptcies that can be identified I now refer to the Daily Hansard of yesterday, Tuesday 13 November, at page 3830, and quote the same paragraph to that the honourable members-magically: The historical indicators certainly indicate that business bankruptcies that can be identified relation to gas. are about level. I also refer to a copy of the transcript of the actual tape where it is very clear indeed, Mr Speaker, that the Minister in his jumbled answer in fact said: indicative indicators certainly indicate ... I would invite you, Mr Speaker, to take this matter up with Hansard, and advise the House what changes were made in relation to the tape of the matter. This goes to the very important matter of bankruptcies in small businesses.",56
110,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES,"I am happy to give the Leader of the National Party an answer now. Yesterday, the Minister for Small Business and Customs answered a question without notice from the Leader of the National Party. An article in today's (Sydney Morning Herald referred to a change the Minister made to the Hansard 'greens' for that answer. I am advised that the change submitted by the Minister was accepted by Hansard to avoid repetition and to clarify the Minister's reply. As such, the Minister's changes were within the guidelines under which Hansard operates. These are encapsulated in the second sentence of the cover sheet which all honourable members receive with their 'greens'. That sentence reads: Necessary corrections may be made, but alterations of sense or the introduction of new material are not admissible. In the view of Hansard, the Minister's change was consistent with that injunction. Honourable members will be aware that traditionally the Erskine May definition of Hansard reporting has been accepted as the guiding principle for Hansard's operations. Erskine May defines the Hansard report as: . . . a full report, in the first person, of all speakers alike, a full report being defined as one 'which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report, with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes corrected, but which on the other hand leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.' JOINT COMMITTEES: IN CAMERA NA",57
111,Mr SCHOLES,EVIDENCE,"Mr Speaker, I wish to ask you a question relating to the position of members of the House of Representatives on joint committees. You will be aware that there is a great deal of disquiet about the status of in camera and confidential information provided to joint committees. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you can discuss with the President of the Senate or examine any means by which honourable members can be certain of their position in respect of agreeing to take in camera evidence or to accept in the committees of the House confidential material and to be certain that without their approval this will not be released through the processes of the Senate.",57
112,Mr SPEAKER,EVIDENCE,"I understand that joint committees operate under the Senate Standing Orders where they are inconsistent with ours. I must say that the point raised by the honourable member for Corio has been. raised with me by other honourable members, that committees of this House tend to take the view that once a committee has accepted that it will take in camera evidence, that is the end of it and we do not publish that in camera evidence. The Senate does have a standing order, however, that allows people in putting in a dissenting report to take into account and to bring into the public domain what was taken as in camera evidence. I do not know how we can bring the rules of the Senate into tune with our rules. My own view, which I am sure is supported by honourable members of this House, is that our rule is a far better one for witnesses because I think that witnesses should have an understanding that if they give in camera evidence, that evidence will stay secret. While I am the Speaker. I would. not like to preside over this House while honourable members attempted to bring into the public domain evidence that was taken in camera. I am happy to take up with the President of the Senate the matter raised by the honourable member for Corio. I should like to think that when I was doing that, I would take the view of all honourable members of this House that matters that are taken as in camera evidence should stay as in camera evidence.

The Treasurer was referring to my media release of yesterday with regard to the proper, responsible and in-touch decision to oppose the assets test on family allowance. I want to say simply that the media release I issued was issued of my own volition without reference to the Leader of the Opposition or his office. I would add that at about 4.30 yesterday afternoon, in the presence of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), Senator Richard Alston briefed the gallery in relation to this matter in accordance with the routine procedures so far as that aspect of this matter is concerned.

BUDGET MEASURES: PUBLIC NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",58
117,Mr SPEAKER,OUTLAYS,"Order! I have received letters from the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) proposing that definite m(!,tters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which in my opinion is the most urgent and important, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Canning, namely: The threat to the economy caused by the actions of the Opposition in seeking to defeat Budget measures designed to rein in public outlays. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the l1umber of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 107 relating to a matter of public importance and members rising in their places indicating approval of the particular MPI and the matters which it denotes for discussion. Whilst the honourable member for Kalgoorlie(Mr Campbell) was absent, the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) was present, yet he spoke on the floor of this House against the Government's decision on family allowances. He said it was a complete indictment of the Government.",58
118,Mr SPEAKER,OUTLAYS,Order! What is the honourable member's point of order? Mr Tim Fischer-How can the honourable member for Grey stand in support of an MPI in contrast to his previously stated position?,59
119,Mr SPEAKER,OUTLAYS,Order! There is no point of order.,59
120,Mr SCHOLES,OUTLAYS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As the honourable member for Canning had not commenced his speech, there is clearly an attempt to take up his time. Will you have the clock reset?",59
121,Mr SPEAKER,OUTLAYS,"Order! If the honourable member for Corio takes another point of order like that, I will name him. Mr GEAR Canning) (3.13)-It is unusual for the Government to move a matter of public importance (MPI), but we believed it was necessary to expose the duplicity, the weak leadership, the lack of direction or consistency of the Opposition, and to point out the fact that it cannot take the hard decisions, a point that was brought out in Question Time today. To see the duplicity of this Opposition, we have only to look at one of the measures that it has opposed that was announced in the Budget. ------ You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there currently is an assets test on the family allowance supplement, and the Opposition supports that. The family allowance supplement is paid to the poorest people, if one can put it that way, in the community, the low income earners on a single income. The Opposition is happy to have an assets test on· that, but when the Government rightly seeks to put an assets test on the family allowance, it opposes it-duplicity. It also says that this Government should rein in spending, have a tighter fiscal policy, and cut government sp-nding, yet when the Government-in a way which was totally unobtrusive if we consider.equity-proposed to put in place an assets test of $300,000 which, after consultation by the country task force with organisations like the National Farmers Federation and the Country Women's Association, it lifted to $500,000, the Opposition still opposed it in the Senate. As has already been pointed out, that move will cost the Government $25m. It is not a hard decision compared with some of the decisions that this Government has taken. Where was the Opposition when it was talking about cutting government spending? Can it be believed when it will not even take this measure which is equitable and necessary? The Opposition is also talking about slashing spending and cutting $3 billion from government outlays including $1 billion from social security. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has also endorsed the Institute of Public Affairs' proposal, as outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) today, which would seek to take .$3 1/2 billion off social security; yet the Opposition will not support the $25m. The question has to be posed: where will it come from?",59
122,Mr HOWARD,OUTLAYS,I must introduce you to Ted Ball.,59
123,Mr GEAR,OUTLAYS,"We will not find out from the honourable member for Bennelong because he just does not have the answers. He did not have them when he was in government and he does not have them now. The simple fact is that when it comes to the tough decisions, where is the Opposition? We are looking· at equity too. The Courier-Mail of 14 November reports: The Opposition social security spokesman, Senator Alston, said the coalition opposed an test on the family allowance because it was inequitable. It is all right to have an assets test on the family allowance supplement but all right to have it on the family allowance. Where is the consistency and the equity there? If the Opposition believes that the family allowance supplement should have an assets test, why does it not believe that the family allowance should have one? Then we can look at the Moomba gas pipeline. This is a classic. The Opposition is continually calling on the Government for more commercialisation and privatisat ion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) was up here this morning spruiking exactly that in the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990. The Opposition talks about the smaller public sector and more rapid micro-economic reform. We give Opposition members the chance to prove all those things that they are talking about and what do they do? They oppose them. One really has to ask why we should take Opposition members seriously. Why should we listen to them get up and talk about all the wonderful things that they would like to do which they were paralysed from doing when they were in Government? Honourable members opposite are world beaters when they are· in Opposition. They talk about their ideas, but when presented with the chance to put words into action, they buckle. Opposition members, when talking about the Moomba gas pipeline in terms of privatisation, say that if they get into government they will negotiate with the Australian Gas Light Co. One could imagine the negotiations; Opposition members would be really tough. They would bowl up to the boardroom and say that their Government was here to discuss the gas pipeline. The Opposition could not put an assets test on family allowances but it would try to get the best bargain for the Government with the Moomba gas pipeline. The Opposition is a joke yet it wants us to take it seriously. Let us have a look at the weak leadership. It was reported by Niki Savva in the assets Melbourne Herald-Sun that at the joint party meeting yesterday: . . . the leadership would take note of their objections and the Opposition would not now opit is not . pose the Government. Apparently the Opposition had a meeting of the shadow Ministry prior to this decision and the members of the shadow Ministry agreed that they would go in there and support the Government. They were gung ho and all had hairy chests. They bowled into the party meeting and got rolled. It is a joke. Weak leadership is what it .is all about. If the Leader of the Opposition really believed that measure was necessary, why could he not carry that simple proposal through the party room? What was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) doing? He is laughing now, but where was he and the rest of the shadow Ministry? They could not even roll their own back bench. What a great mob the Opposition is. As if getting rolled is not enough, let us imagine this. It is reported in the Australian of 14 November that: An angry Dr Hewson complained to a later meeting of Coalition Mps that the news of his rebuff had leaked out. How embarrassing can it get! The Leader of the Opposition gets rolled in the party meeting by the back bench but, what is worse, somebody learns about it. Is it not awful? What leadership do we have? Mr Lee-He is a wimp.",60
124,Mr GEAR,OUTLAYS,"Of course he is a wimp. Let us look at the Leader of the Opposition before he got into politics. He was pretty good with a pen. Back in 1983, when he was talking about the then Opposition, he wrote, in part: Similarly, the assets test on pensions and the lump-sum superannuation decisions are fundamentally sound decisions, economically. Surely the best tack here would have been to criticise the form rather than the substance of the schemes proposed. For example, to suggest how such decisions may have been implemented more effectively and/or more equitably. Opposition members are all nodding their heads like golliwogs. He continued: This is particularly so, given that they are the sort of decisions that a conservative government may want to introduce, but may not have the courage to. He got it in one. He is a prophet. He wrote this in 1983 and it came true this week. He could not get it through his own back bench. Could you imagine the Opposition in government,· Mr Deputy Speaker? Some of the decisions that governments have to make are pretty awful and really take a bit of guts. Can you imagine going into a Liberal Party Government meeting and actually saying, 'Listen, fellows. We have a tough proposal here. We have to do it', and the 'jellybacks' on the back bench saying, 'Oh, no. You can't do that'. What would the Leader of the Opposition do in government? I think we had a fair indication yesterday of what he would do in government. He was rolled. He could not carry the back bench. But, of course, he always has the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) to back him up. With friends like that, who needs opposition. In a media release entitled 'Coalition Rejects Assets Test for Family Allowance', the Leader of the National Party says, in part, that the National Party's position on the family allowance is: . . . proof positive that the Coalition is listening to the voice of the people. I know which people he is talking about-those on the back bench. That is who it is listening to. Thank goodness the Opposition appoints its front bench and does not have to elect it. He goes on further in his own press release: The necessary funding required to facilitate no assets on Family Allowance will be found in the Coalition's policy commitments. We would not want to hold our breath waiting for this one. It is just fobbed off. Of course, this statement is from the gentleman who defended his predecessor's postage outrage. Mr Courtice-How much was that?",60
125,Mr GEAR,OUTLAYS,"Well may you ask. It could have given everyone in this House a fax machine in pis or her office. Of course, the Leader of the :National Party blew that. But he did come clean as is shown in the following extract from the Sydney Morning Herald tllis morning: Asked how a Coalition government would replace thisthat is, a number of measures such as the one we are talking about todaythe Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said that answer would be included in a detailed Opposition tax policy which would cut $100m from annual spending on Aboriginal affairs, $100m from aid to nations beyond our region, and $500m from dole payments. One does not have to be an Einstein to know that that is all poll driven. If one ever wants to curry some favour with the electorate, just put the boot into some of the most disadvantaged people in this nation and beyond. That is one way to go about currying a little bit of favour. It is cheap old trick, but, of course, any cheap old trick will do when one is asked to come up with proposals on how to fund some of the things the Opposition is talking about. Then we may look at the fact that there is no direction or consistency in the whole Opposition approach. I quote from the Herald-Sun, which said: Later Senator Alston refused to discLlsS his recommendation when asked by the Herald-Sun. But he defended the party room decision. This refers to the decision on the assets test. Senator Alston said: It's just a reflection of the fact that people regard the family allowance as sacrosanct and therefore deserving of special treatment. Therefore, if we declare a policy sacrosanct, we cannot touch it. That is just another way in which the Opposition tries to squirm out of explaining to people why it did not make that tough but necessary decision. Let us go back to the Leader of the National Party. He would be the Deputy Prime Minister if the Opposition were ever elected. Government members-Oh, no!",61
126,Mr GEAR,OUTLAYS,"Unfortunately, I have to say that it is true-that is, unless the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) can do a job on him. The Leader of the National Party said to the Federal National Party Council: I am referring to policy decisions in relation to the reduction in protection to negligible levels by the year 2000so get rid of protectionismto the introduction of a goods and services tax and to the total privatisation of government owned airlines and Telecom. Then he comes to the great little part of his speech where he says: I am strongly committed to each .of these decisions in their entirety. I also belIeve that as a strategy there is a great benefit to be gained the clear perception that the coalition of 1990 is not scared of taking courageous decisions. That is what he said to the National Party. We give it the chance to take brave decisions and where is it? It cannot hold the backbench. Let us just remind the Opposition of some of the tough decisions that it has opposed. Do honourable members remember the assets test on pensions? It is a necessary test, one which the present Leader of the Opposition was happy to endorse, as was the present honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). In Government they change their tune. They would be good leadership material for the Liberal Party if they could bend and sway with the breeze, and both of them have not. We also brought in the capital gains tax. Getting the capital gains tax in place was nol a bed of roses; we had to go out and fight for that. The people who were opposing this all the time were the old jellybacks on the other side. The same happened with the fringe benefits tax, which we had to go out and fight for. We had no help from the Opposition, although it retains the benefits of it. I think the crowning glory was when we ended tax deductibility for business lunches. There was nobody in the Opposition at the time who did not put out a press release prophesying doom and gloom, saying that it was the end of life as they knew it. They said that the restaurants would not fill up and there would be mass uriemployment. Honourable members opposite should look at it today; the industry has never been in·· better shape. The simple fact is if it had not been for decisions like that we could not have brought in the tax cuts that we have. The Opposition opposed everything. It opposed every bit of decent policy. The pity is that even in opposition when honourable members opposite are presented with the realities of their policies, with the realities of their utterances, they squib it. They cannot hold the backbench. We really have to ask ourselves the question: If they were ever fortunate enough to be elected to government what would from they be like on this side? This week was a classic example. The Australian people got a taste of how those opposite would operate .were they ever mad enough to elect them to government. The simple fact is that confronted with the reality of their own proposals they buckle. They buck.le in opposition and they would buckle In government and for that reason I do not think the people of Australia, when presented with the possibility of actually electing them to government, will do it.",62
127,Mr REITH,OUTLAYS,"When at about 12.15 p.m. somebody passed me this matter of public importance and said that the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) had . proposed it, I looked at the subject matter and thought to myself, 'Who would put George up to. this?'. As part of my opening remarks I decided to make a simple point, that is, that we on this side do consider the economy and threats to the economy to be matters of serious public debate and consideration. I was going to make the simple point that as evidence of that I would, on behalf of the Opposition as Deputy Leader and as shadow Treasurer, stand to respond to what the honourable member for Canning might say, and my very capable colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), the shadow Minister for privatisation, would respond to what might be said about the Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL). I leant across the table and said to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), 'Who is your second speaker?'. What did he say? He said, 'I don't know; they're running it'. That was the answer. This is parliamentary tactics being led from behind. This is a classic. We had it in the last election. If the Government cannot run its members, it cannot run the country. I say to the Government and to the Leader of the House that if they cannot run parliamentary tactics they cannot run the country. This is an important matter. We treat it importantly. As soon as the honourable member for Canning got to his feet who did we see walk out of this Parliament? It was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He knew what to think of what the member for Canning would say. He shot through. That shows us how serious he thought this matter was. What a farce. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is responsible for the economy. Do honourable members believe that people are going to take any notice of the Government's proposition? The matter of public importance states: The threat to the economy caused by the actions of the Opposition in seeking to defeat Budget measures designed to rein in public outlays. We had a very strong performance from the Treasurer; he was very indignant about this at Question Time. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) was very concerned about this in Question Time. As soon as the matter came on for debate, members on the Government side walked out in droves. The honourable member for Canning had a word with somebody who had obviously said to him, 'I'm going, George; have a good MPI' and he said, 'No, you don't; you have to stay'. That is the sort of thing he can do as Whip; it is the only way he could keep people in here. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) went off; he was not going to hang around to hear what the honourable member for Canning was going to say. People would think the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) would be a bit interested in the economy-not that he knows much about bankruptcies after yesterday. . Mr Costello-- He is busy correcting his 'greens'.",62
128,Mr REITH,OUTLAYS,"He is off to collect his 'greens'. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) shot through as soon as the honourable member got to his feet. The Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin) did not hang around. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand)-I will give him his due-stayed; he talked half of the time to the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and half of the time to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). The Leader of the House does not take this matter seriously himself. On a day when he is using the guillotine to ram through important legislation, he ought to have made some time to debate the economy. From that point of view, we welcome this opportunity-in fact, we delight in having the opportunity that the Government provides us-to expose the bankruptcy of its position. There is no better evidence of that than the fact that the Government passed parliamentary tactics to none other than the back bench and the honourable member for Canning. Let me acknowledge that the Treasurer has come back into the House. Presumably he is going to respond-that is a change-and no wonder, given the remarks that have just been made. Unlike the honourable member for Canning, we are prepared to debate the substance of these issues. He spent about two minutes on the AGL and about two minutes--,--not much more-on the social security matters. Let me go to the AGL, the pipeline decision. Those opposite have been trying to sell the Authority for years and have so far botched it on every occasion. It is a saga well worth canvassing, as will be done in greater detail by the honourable member for Bass. But let me just recount the fact that the Government has been dragged into the courts and has had an injunction taken out against it. It has been shown-and there is very strong evidence-that it is breaching contractual arrangements. The only threat around is the Government's policy threatening the viability of a number of businesses in New South Wales. It is a matter of very considerable significance. Sure, it is a matter of policy difference, but those opposite can hardly deny the significance and the implications of some of the things that they are doing. If they want evidence of that, just go to the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance when, on the question of breaching contractual obligations, he said: There is no question that overriding the present unsatisfactory pricing provisions in the existing contractual arrangements is a very significant step ... It is a significant step. We adjudged it to be of such significance that we have taken the decision we have. Government members may debate that, and I do not say that it is not debatable. I do say that it is clearly significant. In the Government's own Party members on its own back bench have been concerned about it. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) was so concerned about it that he went public to oppose the stance the Government is taking, and there was a lot of concern in the Caucus when the Minister for Finance admitted thatthis proposal could increase gas prices in New South Wales by 9 per cent. If people were not concerned enough already, their concern was exaggerated by the fact that not so long ago the Minister for Finance was saying the impact on prices would be only 1112 per cent. When people make mistakes of such a magnitude, obviously they raise concern. There is also concern in the Government's own party room. The remarks of one Labor member of parliament were reported to the effect that the vote in the pipeline decision was one of the closest votes there has been in overturning a Caucus decision. There were only five votes in it. Those opposite cannot deny that this is a matter of real concern. Our careful assessment of the consequences of the actions that the Government has taken is well justified. The senior adviser to the Minister for Finance-the adviser who is now the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore )-stood against and oppos-d this decision, as did many others. As a result of actions the Government has taken, the matter has been botched. This issue is not about whether the pipeline ought to be privatised; it is about the manner in which the Government proceeds. We think that unconscionable actions in terms of breaching contract well justified and substantiated the position that we had taken. In Question Time today, the Minister could not give us an exact figure, but his argument was that there was $500m dangling there, ready to be put into Consolidated Revenue. That is absolute nonsense. This matter is going to be bound up in a series of legal wrangles over a long period of time, as has already occurred. For the sake of a fair debate, let us accept for a moment the Minister's argument or proposition. Even if we accepted his proposition, he has not answered the simple fact that his actions will give rise to a number of compensation claims from producers and from AGL. It is all very well for the Minister to talk about the great pot of money that is available; that if it was not available, it would have an impact on the Budget surplus and therefore on the economy and economic management. The whole matter is really founded on a false premise. If the Government does the right thing in respect of AGL and it goes through the proper processes, then it will have our support. We have led the debate in this country for many years on the importance of privatisation and we will continue to lead the debate. I say to the Government: the matter has come to this point as a result of its own incompetence. This is a classic case of how not to privatise an asset. If we were to look at this matter in the political context, the truth is that for years now the Government has had an opportunity to undertake this privatisation program. It was only the scaremongering campaign that the Government ran in 1985 in the South Australian election that in effect put off the day on which it could establish a proper sale of this property. Of course, the Government has moved from a situation where asset prices were rising to a situation now. in the economy, as a result of its induced recession, where asset prices are faIling. I conclude on the subject of AGL by saying that this whole argument is fallacious. The manner in which the Government Whip put the matter simply demonstrates that fact. The evidence does not support his proposition. No wonder he spent so little time on it. In regard to the family allowance, there were three measures in respect of the assets test. In respect of one out of the three, we have taken the view that we would oppose the implementation and the introduction of-",63
129,Mr KEATING,OUTLAYS,Why?,65
130,Mr REITH,OUTLAYS,"I will come to my argument. We will oppose the introduction of an assets test on the family allowance. The Treasurer said this measure would introduce greater fairness and he talked about targeted welfare. We have a genuine disagreement with the Treasurer's view and his description that this is welfare. We do not agree with that. We do agree that it is a matter of equity, as the Minister for Community Services and Health said when he stood here- Mr Compassion; trembling and nervous, terribly excited, as usual-during Question Time. Yes, it is a matter of equity. It is a matter of horizontal equity, between families with children and families without children. Honourable members opposite can debate that until the cows come home. The fact is that it is a substantial policy position. It is a policy position which we have held consistently for many years. If those opposite want to talk about history-somebody referred to 1986-they ought to go back to 1975 when the Fraser Government introduced changes to child endowment and tax arrangements in order to introduce the family allowance. We went into the last election with a tax policy that said there ought to be a clear bias towards families. That, I think, was warmly received in the community. Sure, we did not win the election, but the point that I make-Dr Charlesworth-Second again.",65
131,Mr REITH,OUTLAYS,"Government members can stop their silly interjections and listen to a substantial point, and that is this: we have had a consistent position in respect of supporting families. At a time when families are under real pressure because of the deliberate inducement of a recession as a result of the Government's policies, we think the Government ought to take real notice of the impact of its policies on families generally. In this measure, in particular, the Opposition has effectively targeted families in rural Australia. Of the 93,000 families likely to be affected by this measure, 52,000 are rural families. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has stood here and talked about a rural 'recession' - the word that the Government does not want to use because it does not want to acknowledge the failure of its own policy. But honourable members opposite ought to go out to some of these crisis meetings-as I went out to Parkes the other day-and talk to some of these Australian families who are suffering as a result of that rural recession. They should go into the electorate of the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey). They should talk to some of the women who live in her electorate in rural Victoria about some of the hardships which they are suffering as a result of that rural recession. We say that it is a perfectly respectable and proper position for us to oppose the introduction of the assets test on family allowances. The honourable member for Canning says, 'Oh, this is going to have a tremendous effect on the Budget'. I do not accept the Government's figures, but its full year figures were $57m-$57m out of social security expenditures this year of $24.4 billion. That is a 12.7 per cent increase-a massive increase this year-and, of course, $57m out of a total of $93 billion. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me also put this matter in a broader context. I think it is just impertinence for these people to come into the Parliament today and say that the Opposition's well justified substantial opposition to these two particular proposals threaten the economy. I am amazed that it comes from these fellows-they are not about threatening the economy: they are about burning it to the ground. The Treasurer ought to jump in his VIP plane and go down to Victoria again to have a look at some of the factories, the small businesses and the infrastructure of this society being burnt to the ground by his high interest rate policies. I say the Government-by putting up the honourable member for Canning, and matched by the substance or lack of substance in his proposition-does not treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves. I am sorry we have not had a decent debate on the matter and it says much about the Government and its attitude to economic management.",65
132,Mr KEATING,OUTLAYS,"The first seven minutes of the defence of this issue by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) was that it was proposed by a backbencher and, therefore, lacked substance. He does not understand that the Standing Orders do not permit a Minister to propose a matter of public importance. A matter of public importance cannot be proposed by a Minister. That is why it was proposed by a backbencher-",66
133,Mr CADMAN,OUTLAYS,Why don't you come in and make a statement?,66
134,Mr KEATING,OUTLAYS,"By a non-Minister. That is why, when the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) proposes a matter of public importance, he does so as a non-Minister and that is why you, Mr Speaker, receive them and accept them. That is why. So the whole case of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for seven minutes was not worth a bean. He did not even understand the Standing Orders. That is point one. The second point is: never have I seen the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who scurried out of the House, looking so poorly after a question period. He was forlorn. He was like an old sock. He reminded me of that quote, 'Oh what can ail the, wretched knight, alone and palely loitering'. Alone and palely loitering he was in Question Time. Here he is every day at door stops and in press statements urging the Government to cut public spending in the social security system by billions of dollars-yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'What's $57m in $93 billion? That does not matter. What's $57m?' It is the $57 millions and the $25 millions which have reduced Commonwealth outlays by 7 percentage that points of gross domestic product or $28,000m a year since the Opposition was in office. It is all those fives and lOs 'and 20s and 50s which have made the work of this Government so laborious in getting the profligacy the Opposition left us with back into something that is in reasonable shape. The Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) today in its media releaseMr Broadbent-Here we go.",66
135,Mr KEATING,OUTLAYS,"Here we go, dummy. The document deals with the size and efficiency of the public sector and states: Australia's general government sector is smallThe share of general government expenditure in the Australian economy is low compared to most OECD countries. . . . and getting smaller-In recent years, government outlays have been declining proportionally more in Australia than in most OECD countriesIt goes onGovernments becoming more efficient ... There have been significant improvements in program effectiveness Evidence collected by the Office of EPAC shows that in the second half of the 1980s there has been a marked improvement in efficiency in many GBEs, with productivity growth exceeding that in the private sector. There is the commentary and there are the charts on Australia in terms of general government outlays collapsing well below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average. Yet this turnaround, which we have succeeded in and presided over, is disparaged by honourable members opposite while they have the absolute gall to stand up at the door or put out statements like this: 'What is the Prime Minister doing about cutting public expenditure?' - and enjoining us to pick up the Institute of Public Affairs backgrounder proposal which is for a $12 billion reduction in outlays, $3.5 billion of which is in social security. They cannot even stand $57m. They are cowards. The duplicity of them is unbelievable. They talk about how they can be tough with spending. Let me just analyse for a moment the proposal which the Opposition is going to reject. The Deputy Leader just talked about horizontal equity. He talked about families with children and families without children. He said it is not welfare-but it is government assistance. Do honourable members opposite remember the chairman of their party, Mr Elliott, two years ago saying, 'I get family allowance cheques; I don't need them; I don't want them' before we introduced a means test on the family allowance? Here we are with a proposition-and this is the proposition: that someone who can receive $60,000 a year of income, but who has assets excluding the family home and net of debt of half a million dollars, not receive family allowance. That is $60,000 a yearDr Charlesworth-Plus the house.",66
136,Mr KEATING,OUTLAYS,"Plus the house and half a million dollars net of debt-but the Opposition cannot support it; it is too tough. In other words, what the Opposition is in favour of is just trowelling money on to anybody and, if it was someone down at the bottom end of the system, it would kick them to death. If it was some unemployed person, the Opposition would send him to a soup kitchen. But if one is on $60,000 a year, which is the means tested figure for the family allowance, and owns one's house and has half a million net of debt-savage, according to honourable members opposite; they have to oppose it. What happened is that the National Party turned them over-that is the truth-like they have always turned them over. The National Party turned the Opposition over. Here it is: the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), of all people, rolling the Opposition. Dr Hewson was the person who was to come up with the new management style-he was going to come up with, he said, a wheel in the administrative ability, a new management style. We have seen his management style in operation and he cannot even roll, basically, a nonentity like the Leader of the National Party who rolls him out on an issue of $60,000, half a million, free of the house, net of debt-and the Opposition cannot support it. Members opposite have the gall to talk about equity. The Leader of the Opposition is a joke, an absolute joke. How can anyone in Australian journalism, the media or the public take the Leader of the Opposition seriously any more on public expenditure? How could anybody say, 'Well, this man's got something to offer; he's got some veracity in his claims; he's got a commitment'. What commitment? He cannot even agree with the Government-not himself, but with the Government; we are taking the burden of the change-introducing an assets test at half a million, free of debt, excluding the should house. Somebody could have a house worth $200,000, $300,000 or $500,000, have $60,000 a year of income and still have half a million, and we say that beyond that point they do not need horizontal assistance; no, that is too tough. That is what Opposition members stand for. They stand for nothing. They are just like they have always been. . That is why I picked up the $9.6 billion prospective deficit when the Opposition left-because it has no strength; it has no fortitude. The Opposition just does not have the will to do the job that has to be done. But we have this parading stuff that the Leader of the Opposition is somehow above politics, and he gives the straight answers, and he is the new style. This guy does not stand for anything. He is the hollow man. It takes time, but honourable members opposite all get found out in this place. The hollow man: the hollow man who stands in the end and cannot even get his party to support an assets test of half a million, free of the family house and net of debt with $60,000 a re-r. That is the position the Opposition IS m. Is it any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition has slunk out of the House? For the benefit of the Opposition, let me read what the Leader of the Opposition said when commenting on the FraserHoward years: We had success at the margin, but the whole thing was the big decisions were not taken-Was it any wonder? He continued: . . . the consumption tax, industry protection levels, fiscal policy restraint measures. It was frustrating. Howard would get rolled. Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-members bar the night before. Even if we had four feet of paper on the table, the farmers could produce anecdotes out of the air. I used to wonder how much many of them understood. The decisions were made when we, the advisers, were kicked out. But having been there during the Fraser years and having been decisively rolled, he-that is Mr HOWARD knows that if you have a chaI1fe to do something you have to do it. Those are the views of the Leader of the Opposition. After putting those views down, he gets rolled in his own party room by the National Party or the few agrarian Liberals who now remain. In relation to the Pipeline Authority, that is mentioned in the Economic Action Plan. But when the Opposition has to do things-Mr Reith-Hear, hear! MrKEATING-Yes, you would like to give it away. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is saying 'Hear, hear'; he would like to give it away to the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) for a song. That is the sort of game that the members opposite are in; they are not concerned with benefit to the public good and the Commonwealth by making certain that decent economic haulage prices are charged. But the Opposition will not support something that allows economic haulage prices to be charged. Hence, the Opposition then says, 'Sell it fornothing', on the basis of this historic contract which does not even recover costs. Mr Fife-You were in government and made the contract.",67
137,Mr KEATING,OUTLAYS,"We made the contract, yes, and it was a bad contract. It was made in the 1970s. It was a bad contract. If we want a proper economic and efficient distribution and reticulation of gas, we have to change the haulage agreement. But the Opposition would like to pass it to its mates in the AGL quickly and quietly for a song. That is what it is about. The Opposition is just the same old Party it has always been-looking after the privileged. The Opposition does not stand very for equity, or even decent public policies. So it should not get up here asking us to cut outlays again, because we know that the Opposition just does not mean it.",68
138,Mr SMITH,OUTLAYS,"The genus of this matter of public importance today came from the tactics committee on the back bench led by the Whip, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who came into this Parliament and said, 'We want to have a matter of public importance debate'. The SOS went out to get the hit man, the man who specialises in personal vilification, to come in here and launch off in the way he has just done, in typical fashion. Who was the man who introduced all those terms, about which we read so much, vilifying individuals in this chamber? It was the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who has just left the chamber. He is the specialist in personal vilification. He does not care about the reasons that underpin the decisions made by the Opposition. All he wants to do is dress up his speech with smart glib phrases to try to put it across, to capture a few colleagues up in the press gallery and persuade them to go off and write a flattering story for him yet again. But where has he been? Our concern on these two matters is about where this country is going and what the future is. Let us have a look at what is happening to the economy. That is what has driven our decision on the assets test. Has the Treasurer been out to Parkes like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith)? Has he been to talk to people in supermarkets? Does he understand the impact of his interest rate policy, his one dimensional economic policy? There is only one lever that the Treasurer knows how to pull, and that is the interest rate lever. That is what is impacting on people out there in rural Australia. That is why they do not have the income. They might be asset rich, but the Government had to move the rates up because these people do not have any income. Only yesterday, we had a debate about farm incomes dropping over 60 per cent. What does the Treasurer want to do? He talks about equity and compassion. Is he going to leave those people there and let them walk off their farms? Are we going to see the 1930s repeated? The Government's own members, those who are out in the electorates talking to their uents, know that people are under as great a pressure as they ever have been in this country and that we have a recession. The 'R' word is a fact, we do have a recession-and people have to respond to that. It is a matter of horizontal equity. We have always said, and we said it in the Economic Action Plan, that there has never been a more detailed response to the needs of fiscal policy in this country than there was before the last election. The Economic Action Plan gave the most major and detailed proposal for cuts and rationalisation in the Commonwealth that any political party has ever taken to an election. So do not come to us and say that we do not have the guts or the ability to do it, because the electorate knows that we do. The other thing that is dri ving this bate is the opinion polls. The Government back bench-and one only has to see them during Question Time-is not impressed with the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I know because I talk to some of the colleagues of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), who is at the table. They are not impressed with talking to and seeing the Treasurer. He is the most unpopular politician. We all saw the polls yesterday. The Minister for Transport and Communications and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has shot past him. He is on a fast track to the top. What is happening is that the right wing is disintegrating. We read yesterday that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) are leaving the right wing faction. Are they not leaving the right wing faction? Are they not sick of the thuggery, the evidence of which we saw in here a moment ago? That· is what is happening to the Australian Labor Party; it is disintegrating, and that is why the back bench committee here said that it wanted a matter of public importance debate today. Then the SOS went out, because the Leader of the House did not even know who was going to be the next speaker, for goodness sake. The Government has not constitaddressed the issues at all. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made the very point about the need for horizontal equity. We are a party that stands for families and supporting families. If ever there should be a bias in policy in this country, it is towards families who are in need. One identifies them and gives them the best assistance one possibly can within the constraints of the ability of government to pay. That is what drove our decision. This is not a welfare payment; this is recognising that the future of this country-something that this Government seems to forget-rests with its young people. One needs to help parents to lift up children and give them the opportunities, and that cannot be done when all their income is being taken in servicing high mortgage rates that are imdeposed upon them by the Treasurer. That is the family allowance issue and the assets test issue. Let us turn to the pipeline issue. If ever there was an ironic choice of a person to talk about the pipeline issue, it was the honourable member for Blaxland, the Treasurer. Who was it who sat at the feet of the foriller Minister for Minerals and Energy and said, very proudly, 'This is the man who taught me everything'? Do honourable members remember Rex Connor Snr? He was the man who took the pipeline away. The Government of the day did a deal at the time and said, 'All right, we will do a deal. We want to have a national pipeline grid in this country'. We all remember the stories and the vision, how Rex Connor went after Khemlani and got the money. Who was there right behind him all the way along? It was the honourable member for Blaxland, learning how it was done. What did the former Minister say in Hansard on 16 May 1973? Rex Connor said this: As to handling the matter expeditiously, we will do it strictly in accordance with our undertakings. The Government of Australia has never welshed on a contract, and that goes for the Labor Government, too. This legislation is all about the Government welshing on a deal. That is why I went to my colleagues and said, 'We cannot agree to that'. The Government is going to get the money, put it up front, put it in its pockets and say to the purchaser, 'You go and get it back again from the consumers in New South Wales and the businesses'. We are going to see a diversion of demand away from gas. We are going to see lbss of jobs. I have a whole raft of letters expressing concerns from producers of gas in the Cooper Basin; from Broken Hill Co Pty Ltd; from nitrogen producers in New South Wales; and from the Premier of New South Wales. Both sides of the Parliament in New South Wales, Liberal and Labor, moved a motion condemning this proposal. Mr JuIl-Frank Walker.",68
139,Mr SMITH,OUTLAYS,"The Government's own Frank Walker, QC, the honourable member for Robertson, wrote a letter, which he conveniently made available to everyone, drawing out the legal points about compensation. This is another issue that has not captured the immediate attention of those up in the gallery who write about the future of Australia. What will happen is that the Government will proceed, sell it, get the money, and then it will have compensation claims from the Australian Gas Light Co., which has had its rights taken away from it, and from producers. All of a sudden, the Government will find that the benefits that accrue to consolidated revenue will be dissipated in meeting compensation claims because the courts have endorsed this. Justice Gleeson, Justice Russell and others have already made comments about the lack of commerciality and the very dangerous precedent that has been established here, and also the questionable integrity of the Government that is going to embark on this process. So we will see the proceeds dissipated in meeting compensation claims, all for the sake of trying to fill a gap in this year's Budget. Last night I said that if we are going to have assets sales and privatisation, it has to be for the benefit of all concerned. We have to look at all the ramifications. Rex Connor would have told the honourable member for Blaxland that that was necessary. Did the honourable member for Blaxland listen? No, he is only interested in addressing the immediate concerns of his record on this year's Budget. He knows that our economy is under great pressure. But at times like these, one does not just have a grab for the cash, salt the mine and totally disregard proper integrity and the commercial agreements that governments have entered into and which were considered sacrosanct. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in his second reading speech admitted: There is no question that overriding the present unsatisfactory pricing provisions in the existing contractual arrangements is a very significant step. It is not one which was taken lightly. Half the Caucus agreed-43 to 39. The Government speaks about this side of the House and its decisions. What about the Government? Government .members were almost knocked off by their own Caucus. They know what is happening. They know this is a grab for .cash. They know that this is turning their backs on basic principles . of contractual arrangements between governments and commercial entities. And what happened· this morning? There was an article in the Australian Financial Review this morning headed 'Govt scraps $700m Pipeline Authority privatisation plans'. Is the Government going to scrap it, or is it going to proceed? There is no. evidence today from the Treasurer about the proposal. This matter cannot proceed, it should not proceed; it is bad legisiation. It has been conceived for all the wrong reasons and it will jeopardise in the commercial world any support for or faith people will have in this Government for a privatisation program and an asset sales program, and that is to be regretted. There have been independent studies done by the Centre for International Economics about this pipeline. It says this: The real beneficiary would be the Federal Govters. ernment which would take up front the monopoly profits. This is all about a cash grab, and the Government is asking the citizens of New South Wales particularly to pay for it. is regrettable, it is desperate, and it is the sort of legislation this country needs. in other areas. What the Treasurer needs to understand is that this side of the House will make tough decisions. This was a tough deciAct sion for us, but it is the right decision. What is important is that we are preAs pared to make the right decisions. We will stick to principles, we will stick to integtion rity and we will make sure we look after all Australians and not have special deals for special mates. That is the aspect that concerns us, and that is why members of the right wing are leaving. They can see the writing on the wall. The Leader of Government (Mr Beazley) is on the fast track to the top to be the next Opposition Leader, not to be Prime Minister, and the Treasurer is on the way out. Every Austant tralian knows it, and that is why this desperate measure has been brought into the House this afternoon.",70

We are trying debate 39 Bills this week, and while this may be one of the less controversial of the 39, nonetheless it is being rammed through under the guillotine and for that reason I think the Government stands well and truly condemned. Mr Beddall-It is important for Minis",71
142,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERS OF STATE,"It may be important to some Ministers, but the fact is it is being rammed through. I wonder why it· could not have been put on earlier this It month in order to avoid some of the presnot sures brought about by important debates As I said, this is basically a housekeeping Bill. It amends the Ministers of State to increase the maximum annual gross sum of money for payment for Ministers. all honourable members will be aware, Ministers' salaries go to the RemuneraTribunal, as do those of all members of parliament, and since the recommendation of the Tribunal is not being wholly adhered to, this amendment is necessary. It is worth noting that this amendment means that Ministers will not get the full the recommendation of the Tribunal, and I would hope that means Ministers can take some kudos for setting an example for the rest of the community. It is also importo note the Opposition wil- not be opposing this legislation, as this is a straightforward machinery provision, and I believe the House would be better served allowing a fuller debate on the follow.  ways a pleasure when the Opposition agrees with this side of the House, and I note the statement of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I support the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1990, which is correctly being described as a machinery Bill and which, following increases in emoluto Ministers of State, requires an Amendamendment to enable them to be paid that money. In that sense, it is a machin. I accept also the shadow Minister's sugguilgestion that the increases proposed are to quite modest and within reasonable bounds. It is a pleasure to support the Bill. I thought the shadow Minister may have strayed onto other matters or fashioned a new question to ask; I note he has not. In terms of the general conditions of employment, whether they be of Ministers or members, I would like to make a few brief remarks, since we are allocating more time to the next debate. The requirements of members of parliament and Ministers are changing rapidly, and it is important that we be given access to technology and facilities so as to match the increasing demands quite rightly being made upon members. It is very easy from time to time for us to take a partisan role in those changes, but I would hope in the future that both the Opposition and Government parties will desist from such an approach. From my personal point of view-and this may not be shared by all members of the Government-we ought to look realistically at the role Opposition shadow Ministers play, for example, and at what resources and facilities are made available to them. It is very important in our system of government that the Opposition be able to have the resources it needs to effectively develop its policies so as to present a strong and constructive opposition in this Parliament-or indeed in any other parliament. I should say for the record there have been great advances in my short time here, but I would be misleading the House if I suggested the facilities available to members, Ministers and shadow Ministers go anywhere near matching those available in outside organisations, whether they be public or private organisations. I look to the future when I can stand up in this Parliament and say I am well satisfied with all facilities, all emoluments, and all third time. the things being provided for ordinary members of parliament, for Ministers, and for shadow Ministers. Mr Bilney-The honourable member has done more than any other honourable member to bring that about.  Defence Science and Personnel is being very kind. The· view I am expressing is shared by people on both sides of the House, I believe, and I do hope we will see the Bill through to fruition. I support the Bill.",71
143,Mr BEDDALL,MINISTERS OF STATE,"in reply-I will not delay the House unnecessarily. I thank the Opposition very much for its support, but I would Eke to correct an article appearing in a number of newspapers, particularly the one in front of me, the Courier-Mail of 8 November which carries the headline, 'Federal Ministers will cost 80% more'. When I introduced this Bill into the House I made it plain that this was an acceptance of the Remuneration Tribunal's report in 1990 under which Ministers' allowances of office which were previously paid separately were actually transferred to salary, and Ministers would receive only the same salary increases as ordinary members of parliament. The press have interpreted this to be an 80 per cent increase in ministerial salaries. Perhaps they may wish to correct that. Certainly Ministers have acknowledged the restraint referred to by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate, and I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Beddall) read a BUILDERS LABOURERS' NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 November, on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time.",72
144,Mr HOWARD,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"The Opposition will support . the Builders Labourers Federation Legislation Amendment Bill, the principal provision of which is to extend for a further period of five years from April of next year the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). There has been no union in Australia's industrial history which has been more notorious and has behaved in a less responsible manner than the union formerly registered under the Federal Act as the Builders Labourers' Federation. The antics of that union in different parts of Australia over a long period have brought enormous discredit to the rest of the trade union movement. Although there are a number of things I should like to say about the motives of the Government in relation to this legislation and also about the state of the building industry, let the House remember that the initiative originally to deregister the Builders Labourers Federation was that of the Fraser Government. We are used, particularly at Question Time, to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Ministers rewriting history; we often get long and rather inaccurate history lessons. I want to remind the House that in 1981 the Fraser Government commenced proceedings to deregister the BLF, and one of the first acts of the Hawke Government was to delay that. One of the first acts of the Cain Government in Victoria in 1982 was to abort the proceedings to deregister the BLF. Yet at long last, in 1985 the Hawke Government and the Cain Government ultimately accepted what the Fraser Government had accepted and ad vocated as far back as 1981, namely, that the Builders Labourers Federation should be deregistered. That has remained the situation in respect of the Federation since then, and the proposal, which we support unhesitatingly, is a proposal to extend that deregistration for a further period of five years. Having said that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest it would be a very great mistake if the action taken by the Government were to be allowed to create the impression that all that has to be done to restore law and order in the building industry is to maintain the prohibition on the Builders Labourers Federation. That union is not the only rotten apple in the building industry barrel. There is a great body of opinion that the behaviour of the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU), which has essentially taken over much of the patch formerly occupied by the Builders Labourers Federation, and particularly in New South Wales, has been as bad as, if not worse than, the conduct of the now deregistered Builders Labourers Federation. The Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales, now under way and appointed by the Greiner Government, will be looking at the rogue behaviour of the Building Workers Industrial Union in New South Wales. It is not hard to see that much of the Government's agenda in this area and on this specific issue is driven by the grand Kelty plan for amalgamation of unions in Australia. The Parliament currently has before it a Bill to further the objective of having 20 large unions in Australia, and the Building Workers Industrial Union is one of those 20 large unions. I take the opportunity again, as I do on any occasion when I address this House on the issue of industrial relations, to remind the House of how inimical to the notion of enterprise bargaining is the concept of large amalgamated unions. If one believes in enterprise bargaining, one cannot believe in the Kelty vision of 20 large unions. The two things are fundamentally at odds with each other; they are fundamentally inconsistent with each other. I would be the first to acknowledge that the Metal Trades Industry Association (MTIA) is not an organisation that supports the industrial relations policy of the Opposition. Its Director, Mr Evans, and many other senior office bearers and I have had very frank, cordial and vigorous exchanges about the subject of industrial relations while I have occupied various positions in the Opposition over the last few years. Mr Evans and the MTIA make a very salient point, and that is that if one wants to have enterprise bargaining one has to have enterprise unions. I say to the Government: by all means let us have a sensible, intellectual debate about what is the best vehicle to promote enterprise bargaining in Australia, because I hear the Government and I hear the unions and I hear the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) leadership talking about enterprise bargaining. I say to the Government: if it is serious ab-ut enterprise bargaining, it has to be senous about enterprise unions. Yet it is going in the opposite direction. . In a sense, albeit a subsidiary sense, I gIve the Government credit for the fact that the principal purpose of the Bill is to prolong the deregistration of the BLF but in a subsidiary sense one of the - ther purposes of the Bill is to promote the Kelty vision of 20 large unions. One of those 20 unions is going to be the Building Workers Industrial Union. It is not only going to cover the construction industry, it is also hopefully going to cover the mining and energy industry as well. It is an extraordinary proposition to have one union covering all of those industries. How on earth could one hope to have enterprise bargaining when one has a union representing giant construction sites in remote areas of Western Australia and in the central business district of Sydney? The Government expects the Federal leadership of that union to understand the needs of a tiny construction company on the outskirts of Melbourne. It is a ridiculous proposition and it is pushing the whole structure of our industrial relations away from a focus on the enterprise. - he .real - inners out of this piece of legIslatIOn will be the Building Workers Industrial Union-make no mistake about that. My friend opposite, the honourable  knows where the bodies are buried on this subject, and so does the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). He knows where the cement pours came from as well, because he is out of the BWIU. Mr Bilney-Some of the bodies are still in the cement as well. .",73
145,Mr HOWARD,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"Some of the bodies are ' buried in the cement, the Minister for I?efence Science and Personnel is quite nght. We may joke about it in a very abstract way, but it is a symbol of the rottenness of much of the building industry in Australia that those kinds of remarks are taken as part and parcel of an exchange on the building industry. It is a symbol of the rottenness that exists and this Bill does nothing to cure the r-tten­ ness of the building industry. It merely extends the status quo; that is all it does. It extends the prohibition on the BLF. The only way that one will begin to tackle the rottenness is to do something about the monopoly on the supply of la-our held by the unions in the building mdustry, and that means ending compulsory unionism in the building industry. It means getting contractors into the building and construction industry. It means bringing the industrial practices of the home building industry into the construction industry in the central business districts of the capital cities of Australia. But of course that lot-members of the Government-will never do that. The former President of the ACTU now the Minister for Science and Techn-logy (Mr Crean), went absolutely troppo a couple of months ago when he was asked a question by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) about his failure to turn up at the 100th anniversary conference of the Master Builders of Australia. He did not turn up because one of the speakers a couple of days later represented an organisation of building contractors from the United States. In other words, he was not prepared even to associate himself with a conference which was address.ed by somebody who represented non-UnIon labour in the building and construction industry in the United States. That gives the House an idea of how far this Government has to travel and how steep a learning curve it has if it is to bring about any sanity or rationality in the building industry in Australia. What has happened on building sites in Melbourne, Sydney and other parts of our country is a living disgrace to everybody involved in the industry. I do not offer un stinted praise· to some of the employthem.' ers. Some of the ,employers have faciliwhere tated the misbehaviour of the unions. cation. Many of the major employers have been unwilling to do anything to stand up against it. The chamber will not find me, while I occupy this portfolio, coming and mouthing the platitudes of employer organisations or automatically picking the cudgels on behalf of individual ployers in this country, because some them have been pusillanimous and have been principals in much of the bad behavme iour of the unions. I experienced in lead-up to this legislation many of them coming to me and saying, 'Look, we know everything is crook, but for heaven's you've got to support the legislation-we don't want Norm back.' I accept that; nobody wants Norm back. They are not ganisation. Robinson Crusoes in not wanting Norm back, but I think it says a lot about some of the problems. Until everybody who concerned about this industry is prepared to tackle compulsory unionism, is preothers pared to do something to end the no ticket, no start rule that exists on all major building and construction sites around Australia and, in particular, is prepared to resist the monopoly on the supply of labour that exists in this indussation? try, we are not going to have any improvements. I say with all goodwill to the members of the Government and from the vantage point of indicating to them again that are supporting their legislation, 'Don't - magine for a moment that you are solvtoo, mg the problems of the building industry by simply extending the ban on Norm open Gallagher for another five years.' - s simple as that and they ought to know It. In the course of commending the Bill, there are a couple of other things about this legislation that I would like to draw to the attention of the House. These things have been the subject of discussions betion tween the Minister and me.' The Bill does have a retrospective effect. Some people may think that does· not matter. Some p-ople may say, 'Well, if you're dealing wIth rogue unions, it doesn't really matter what methods you use in order to handle Let me point out the two areas the Bill has a retrospective appliTo start with, the Bill operates in relation to any proceedings before the Indusin trial Relations Commission that were commenced before the Bill receives royal up assent. At the moment, there are two sets emof proceedings. The Western Australian of branch of the Builders Labourers Federation-a body that has been described to by somebody who ought to know as a the union whose conduct is better than the conduct of the Building Workers Industrial Union in the State of Western Aussake, tralia-is seeking to secure Federal registration under the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act as a Federal employee orThe effect of this Bill, if it is passed in its present form and the relevant sections are proclaimed, will be to is completely destroy those procedures. Honourable members opposite and many may say, 'So what? You are only taking away some possible rights.' If the the Government can trample on a contract made with the Australian Gas Light Company 15 years ago, why can it not trample on the rights of a mere employee organiSo that is what it decided to do. The other set of proceedings relate to a rules dispute between the BWIU and the BLF in Western Australia. It is a fight over bodies, a very frequent cause of diswe pute between unions in this country. Those proceedings are going to be aborted although, strangely enough, any future proceedings of the same kind will be to participation by the union that is It is not affected by this legislation. Those are not light matters. Frankly, I do not care how poor an opinion this Parliament may have of particular organisations, there are certain issues of natural justice involved. If we are serious about the role of this Parliament and the protec"": of the national interest, we ought to be concerned about the observance of the rules of natural justice, even to organisations that may be remotely associated with Norm Gallagher. The guilt by association principle should not be used too slavishly by anybody on either side of the House. I understand that the impact of some amendments that the Minister will move or have moved in the second reading stage of the debate in effect will suspend the time of proclamation of the clauses that I have spoken of, and it will only be in the absence of the Minister's securing some agreement between the relevant unions about what is going to happen with both the bodies and the FederaJ registration that those particular clauses might be pro- tralia. claimed. On that basis, the Opposition will not be pursuing any amendments in relation to those particular clauses. But I do not let the opportunity go by without saying that we are dealing with the union which has the worse reputation of any trade union, probably in the twentieth century. It is the only union in my living memory that has been subjected to this sort of legislation. Nevertheless, that union and particularly unions that are associated by name with it-perhaps, in many cases, not by deed-are also entitled to natural justice. They have rights; the people in them have rights; and this Parliament will make a very big mistake if it believes that guilt by association with a union that has been branded as a rogue union is justification enough for trampling upon some of the ordinary and basic rights. I simply conclude by reminding the House again that we support this legislation. We initiated the original drive to deregister the Builders Labourers Federation. The Hawke and Cain governments were dragged screaming, reluctantly, to do it, five years after the Fraser Government had commenced the proceedings. We were assailed and criticised. The former Prime Minister was called confrontationist because he wanted to do it. The now Prime Minister said, 'If you will only leave it to me, we will fix it up'. But in the end Old Jellyback, as the Prime Minister has been called by some of his colleagues, had to throw in the towel and say, 'Yes, I am going to deregister the BLF.' So we support the legislation but I say to the House that if it really wants to clean up the building industry, if it really wants to rid it of the chaos that now exists, it will do something about compulsory unionism. It will not hand it over to the Building Workers Industrial Union whose conduct in New South Wales has been outrageous and is one of the major causes of the royal commission that is now going on in that State. You will end the no ticket, no start rule and recognise that it means more than adding another five years to Norm Gallagher's industrial sentence to clean up the building industry throughout Aus honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has criticised the Government by saying that we were reluctant and hesitant in originally bringing down the Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. Basically, he is right. For a Labor government there can be no more serious step, I believe, than bringing in legislation to deregister a union. I believe that that is entirely appropriate. It ought to be introduced after every avenue has been exploited and when there are no alternatives. I know that the Opposition would have it otherwise .. When we set up voluntary organisations with memberships capable of changing rules and voting different organisations in and out, essentially we should leave the conduct of those organisations to their membership. The Opposition might be very unhappy if a government peremptorily introduced legislation deregistering the Business Council of Australia. Theoretically that could be possible. On both sides of the House we agree that the extension of the deregistration for the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) is necessary. I want to pick up a couple of the points that the honourable member for Bennelong made. All fault does not reside on one side of the industrial relations equation and, in fairness, I think that he mentioned that. But it takes two to tango. If we condemn the union, I believe that equally we should condemn the employers, particularly the early employers, who allowed some of these practices to be entrenched. When we look at other, perhaps less contentious, issues such as work practices, those work practices could not have been instituted without agreement on the other side. I condemn both groups. If there is some concern about the building industry, then let us not just load the gun and line up one victim-the unions. After all, how did unions form? Why do these things happen? Often militant unions develop because of practices like body hire where employees have no rights at all and gradually over time they fight, struggle and entrench their position. The original consideration was that of workers not being treated as human beings and individuals but merely people on a casual basis. The building industry is no better example of it. The employers state, 'Yes, we will give you one day but we will choose out of 20 and you will have no permanence, no rights, and no conditions'. This is what has bred militant unions in the past. No wonder there is a reaction on the union side. I fully support trade unions. They have a legitimate role in Australia, have done so for many years-over a hundred years-and they represent the legitimate aspirations of not powerful, wealthy and influential people but ordinary Australians. They represent men and women not on fabulous executive salaries but on salaries which allow them to struggle to bring up families and to educate their children. The point that I do not understand about the Opposition is that it constantly attacks the trade union movement. Why does it? Has the trade union movement failed to understand that Australia has to lift its game at the factory floor? I give credit to the metal industry, but in particular I give credit to the trade union movement that has led the way in award restructuring. If in 1981 the honourable member for Bennelong was trying to predict what would happen in the metal industry, he would not have anticipated the radical changes that have occurred today, Does he resent the fact that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) understands that trade unions will not only sur- the fact that-vive by their awards and protection of workers but also by the services that they deliver and by the need to be market oriented? Does he resent the fact that the ACTU is saying, 'We have to go out there and win young Australians, tell them of our proud union history in Australia, of the services that we offer and the need to attract them into the trade union movement'? Is that what the honourable member for Bennelong objects to because that is precisely the direction that the trade union movement is taking today? If there is a failure of vision in industry or services today, it is not coming from the leadership of the trade union movement. It is prepared to tackle the hard issues-demarcation disputes, work practices, increased productivity, more skills and more training. None of these items are off the agenda or are in the too-hard basket. For my part, if we were trying to look at this in a balanced way, I would say that it is the employers who are often dragging the chain, lacking the vision and not understanding that today in Australia we have to operate in time horizons longer than six or 12 months. If we want to talk about the power of people in Australia's economy, it does not rest with the trade union movement today. The trade union movement is not controlling the industries that we are going into and the level of investment that is being made in our general and service industries. These are all being made in the boardrooms of Australia. If we need to make changes, I suggest that the more fundamental, long term changes need to be made in the boardrooms of Australia. The honourable member for Bennelong talks about enterprise bargaining and that really what we need is a mushrooming of trade unions. I never accept that in Australia we should walk away from developing a unique approach, whether it is in industrial relations-where certainly we have-or any other field of endeavour. How does he account for the success, for example, of the German econo-y with so limited a number of trade unIons? How does the honourable member account for",74
146,Mr HOWARD,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"The Japanese have a couple of unions.  The Japanese have enterprise unions, but what degree of concentration should we have? Will we provide enterprise unions at every level of every enterprise, or will the Opposition and Government agree that in the running and success of business there is a real need for both the employers and employees to have an appreciation of what the fundamentals are? Does that require an enterprise union? I do not believe it does. I believe that we can and need to have these larger unions. If a union is to provide services to members, it will not be able to do so from a small base of membership. If the honourable member is suggesting that more and more medium sized companies are required in Australia-not smaller companies-why does he suggest the reverse for trade unions? I reiterate the point that the trade movement legitimately represents the aspirations of ordinary men and women in Australia. Yes, in the building industry there may have been some disruptive practices. The BLF is to be condemned in its actions. Often these disruptive tices are allowed to develop in a climate where both the employers and the employees contribute to their development. I do not agree that the trade union movement, when looking forward to Australia's national interests, is lacking vision in needs to be done or can be held accountable for retarding things like getting rid of increasing productivity, work practices, demarcation disputes and the need for skilling and in-skilling. In fact, I believe that the tardiness and reluctance has come from the employers. I believe that the Government is addressing the need to have awards and trade unions get down to the enterprise level. But that does not mean that we need to dismember unions so that we have a myriad of unions. The only people whom that will advantage is the employers. The only people who will suffer will be the ordinary men and women of Australia. From my own experience, I know that there are people who decide that they do not want to join unions. It is very interesting that they are always very happy to receive the benefits of any increased salaries, amenities or conditions of service that trade unions win for them. They never want to knock them back. Indeed, when this becomes a condition, they never want to opt out. They are happy to opt out of being a union member, but if there are some increases gained they want to be on the gravy train. Often the crunch comes when firms start winding down or dismissing staff. Then these people see the real need for trade unions to protect them. I support this Bill. I agree with the honourable member for Bennelong. I can confess to being dragged reluctantly into agreeing with this measure in 1986. I also share a measure of reluctance in 1990, but unfortunately there is no other way for this union. I do want to defend the right of free assembly, the right of people union to join trade unions and the legitimate role that unions play in Australia's economy, which ought to be recognised by the Opposition.",77
147,Mr BRADFORD,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"MCPherson) (4.41)prac- The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) attempts in some way to soften the blow on the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) by suggesting that employers are partly to blame. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, what if we are fairly even-handed about this, we may recognise that employers in some. circumstances do leave something to be desired. But let us be quite clear on what we are talking about today. There are few employers, if any, who have ever behaved as reprehensibly as the BLF. I suspect that no-one at all would want to work for an employer who treated l;lis employees with the sorts of tactics that members· of the BLF have adopted towards their employers. Let us be under no illusion about this. The history of trade unionism in this country is littered with cases of abuse of power. None is worse-though, as the honourable member for Bennelong said, some are as bad-than that of the BLF. The honourable member for Bennelong pointed to the role of the Building Workers Industrial Union, but we could point to union after union which has abused its position and its privilege of acting within the system.",78
148,The BLF,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"and that is what we are talking about today-has the singular distinction of being the only trade union which has been deregistered twice under the Federal industrial relations system. This. happened in 1974 and again in 1986. The major parties in the industry on both the union side and the employers side are strongly opposed to any reregistration of the BLF. About the only supporter the BLF appears to have is none other than that pillar of virtue, that first class citizen, that reformed communist, Halfpenny. He is quoted in the Age on Tuesday, 12 June as saying: The BLF was entitled to seek re-registration ; . . I don't think anyone would regard that as fair or reasonablethat is, the fact that it was to be excludedWhere does it end? We might well ask Mr Halfpenny: 'Where does it all end?'. The BLF has never expressed any regrets over the policies and actions which led up to its second deregistration in 1986. It is still led by basically the same group of officials who led it then, and, of course, it is still led by its notorious, perhaps infamous, leader, Norm Gallagher. It is apparent from the union's recent behaviour and policy statements that it will continue to act in exactly the same way as it has done in the past. The BLF's attitude was that it would be the sole judge and jury in its own cause. It would decide what obligations it would have regard to from time to time and which ones it would ignore. It was this reprehensible pattern of conduct which caused the Australian community to say eventually, almost unanimously, that the BLFcould no longer enjoy the privileges of a registered organisation. There have been enough incidents in recent years to make it abundantly clear that the BLF has learnt nothing from deregistration and that it will continue to act in the same old ways whenever it gets the opportunity. Just like the previous patterns of behaviour of the Federal BLF, some of the State-registered builders labourers unions have continued on occasions to openly flout the principles to which they have given their commitment. I note that the Minister refers to some of those instances in his second reading speech. One of the most odious aspects of the BLF's behaviour that brought it into such evident disrepute in the community was its propensity to use its industrial muscle in support of political or ideological campaigns. Once again, the union's ability to do this has been minimised since it has John been deregistered. However, all of the evidence points to the conclusion that, given the opportunity, the BLF will behave in exactly the same way again. There is no doubt-and I think that this is recognised on all sides-that the case against the BLF is overwhelming. That has certainly been conceded by the Government. The Bill is substantially supported by the Opposition. It would be a tragedy, indeed an act of economic vandalism, to allow this union a third chance to wreak havoc in the Australian building and construction industry. I refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). He says-I suspect while shedding crocodile tears: The Government finds absolutely no joy in having to take the action that this Bill proposes. These sentiments were echoed just a while ago by the honourable member for Chifley. The Minister goes on: We are a Labor government. We derive great satisfaction and great strength and I might throw in there great financial supportfrom our connection with the Australian labour movement. What about some of the other union activities that are evident around the country? I refer briefly to one or two other unions that have consistently abused the system. Let us measure their behaviour against the sorts of standards that have been set by the BLF. I refer briefly to the Cooke inquiry into union activities in Queensland, which highlights the extent of the rorts that are continuing within a number of unions. That inquiry revealed - the disgraceful spectacle of the Secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia (FEDFA), Mr Ken Goodhew, admitting that he used $52,000 of union funds without permission to buy a Gold Coast unit. He has not repaid any of the money, which he borrowed more than two years ago. The Cooke inquiry has also been told a number of other interesting things:· that Brisbane's prostitutes did a 'roaring trade' every time a trade union held a committee or management meeting; that several officials of the FED FA were paid $217,660 in tax-free wages, perks and allowances; that a building owned by the FEDFA was sold for $950,000 and was entered on the balance sheet as having been sold for $450,000; that $104,000 passed through Goodhew's secret bank accounts; that food parcel money-this is a real doozey-collected for sacked South East Queensland Electricity Board workers ended up in at least one union official's personal bank account; and also that Mr Goodhew's wife-the good union secretary's wife, Annette-had found $15,000 hidden in the kitchen cupboard of her home while she was looking for coffee. This was some of the evidence that was given to the Cooke inquiry. Further evidence involved the Federated Liquor Trade Union. There is another doozey in Queensland. A pattern of vote rigging, fraud and violence has been exposed. The Liquor Trade Union former State Secretary, Brian Elton, and the Assistant Secretary, Colin Hardie, have already been convicted and fined for being in wrongful possession of ballot papers from the 1986 union election. The inquiry has heard that most of the Liquor Trade Union elections have been rorted in the 1980s. An Electoral Commission officer, Mr John Curtis, told the inquiry that he had been subjected to intimidation and terrorist tactics by people acting for the Liquor Trades Union officials. Mr Curtis, who was responsible for supervising the 1986 Liquor Trade Union elections, said that his home was burgled on consecutive nights and that his home had also been threatened by a deliberately lit fire in rounding bushland. The intimidation came after he gave evidence in the Federal Court against union officials, Brian Elton and Colin Hardie, for election fraud. When Curtis contacted the police about the intimidation he was told that the people Elton and Hardie mixed with were more than capable of doing this. Elton and Hardie refused to supply their fingerprints, we might be interested to note, to the Cooke inquiry. I wonder whether they had guilty consciences. It gets even worse in some of these Queensland unions. The honourable member for Bennelong was talking earlier about bodies buried in cement. Let me relate one instance involving the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union. We still have the unsolved murder of Donald James MCLean, a former organiser for that union. He was shot five times outside a house shortly before the union election in 1986. The police said that the murder was a professional hit. They do not discount the possibility that his assassination was connected with his activities as a liquor trades union official. Whatever the reason behind McLean's death, fear still stalks the union. The question is, who does Hardie fear may murder him? This is Colin Hardie we are talking about now; he told the inquiry that his life could be in danger. The Cooke inquiry is going on. This is an amazing saga. The Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct almost pales into insignificance. It is no matter that the new Premier of Queensland is trying to put the kybosh on it. He is having a little difficulty because it is fairly cleaf that that would be utter and sheer hypocrisy for Mr Goss, who called for the implementation of the Fitzgerald report recommendations lock, stock and barrel. It is fine for the honourable member for Chifley to say that perhaps there have been a few bad employers, but let us put this in context. We are talking about a union which has wreaked vandalism on the industry in which its members were surworking. We are talking about the BLF. It is not alone in this country. There is, as I said before, a long history of union abuse. I am very pleased to be able to stand up here today and in a sense compliment the Government for having taken this action in extending the deregistration of the BLF. I wish to say a few words before I finish and allow my colleague to speak. In ream spect of the Opposition's position-I that the honourable member for Bennelong has already said something about this-our commitment to a dec enlieve tralised wage fixing system, voluntary trade unionism, secret ballots before strike action and so on goes way beyond anyis thing that the Government proposes do. It is ironic in my view that the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his sucassociation. cessor as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), are both now deeply involved in attempting to repair some of the damage they did when they were at the ACTU. The Opposition's policies on industrial relations are in stark contrast to those the Government. Whilst on the face of it the award restructuring that the honourright able member for Chifley spoke about-it is really only a euphemism-may be aiming to overcome some of the problems, is really only very much a Clayton's at the tempt. The Opposition is serious about addressing and solving the problems which exist and will continue to exist despite Government's weak attempts at what it calls award restructuring. In conclusion, there is no doubt mind that the trade union movement has a lot to answer for. We are talking ularly about the very worse aspect of it, . the sort of vandalism that has been wreaked on us by a union such as the BLF, which is not alone. That is the point I was making. This is not unique. There are many unions that behave like this. my opinion the trade union movement contributed enormously to the decline living standards which have now become a prospect for many Australians. I believe trade union rank and file members which are deserting their unions in droves, statistics show, seem to understand what is going on where their leaders and political masters appear not to.",79
149,Mr CHARLES,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"I am delighted today to have the opportunity to support the Federal Government in its initiative to continue deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). I also delighted to have the opportunity know to speak in support of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in terms of policy prescriptions which I beare vitally needed if we hope to drag this nation to the tail end of this century. I remind honourable members that this 1990. This is not 1790 or 1890. It is to long past time for us to have a much closer look at this concept of freedom of In my view the disgrace that is represented by the BLF in the construction industry across this country is caused to a large extent by the fact that unionism in the construction industry is tagged with no tjcket, no start-a closed shop. The closed shop is the problem. The problem is caused by the fact that individuals do of not have a right to not belong to a union. I have no problem whatsoever with the of individuals to belong to a union, to form associations. That is what democit racy is all about. My problem stems from fact that in Australia we seem to have grown up with this theory that if a union is formed everybody has to belong to it. the If we win-I want honourable members to notice the word 'win' - benefits from employers, then that win, that gain, is only due because of the union and anyone in my else who works for that company who does not belong to the union should not particreceive the benefits of such a win. I note that in the construction industry we have a tremendously competitive and productive operation in terms of the subcontract system which builds our housing In in this country. The housing industry in Australia is among the most competitive in in the world. That is one of the reasons for the high standards of housing. It is one of the reasons for the fact that the average Australian throughout the last as decade has been able to purchase and own his own home to a far greater extent than exists in countries of like economic circumstances. The subcontractor system enforces voluntary union membership, where side by side those who belong to unions, and those who do not, work together in a competitive environment of their choosing under contract to a builder to build a house. Next door to them, on what is deemed to be a commercial site or an institutional site, we have the no ticket, no start and we have one of the least competitive industries in the world. We pay for it. We cannot export our buildings and we cannot use them as import replacements. Our income, what we work for in this country, goes into building buildings and paying for land. If we are not productive we are wasting the productivity efforts of other industries. I make that point very strongly. In the construction industry we have two systems side by side. Basically one is free enterprise, voluntary union membership; the other is coercion, closed shop. One is efficient, the other inefficient. Perhaps we should briefly look at the history of industrial relations in this country. At Federation there is no doubt in my mind that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the concept of conciliation, and then if all else fails, arbitration, was an excellent concept. It was ahead of its time. It was unique in the world and it deserves its place in history. But that time has now long since passed. Other countries have become more productive while Australia has remained stagnant. Part of the failure to become productive, particularly in the manufacturing sector, in the produced goods sector, is due to the isolationism that we have built up with protective tariffs and protective walls around us and this unique industrial relations system that put employers and employees together across the table with a judge in the middle, a commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission, to settle their differences. An employer and employee are both really workers in an enterprise who do not have the opportunity to get together and meet each other face to face to sort out their problems and sort out what the wage component of business input costwill be so that the workers can enjoy the fruits of the profits of industry - nd so that management can be_ productive. We keep everybody apart. The honourable member for Chifley spoke about management and about employers dragging the chain in the great new brave world that we are building today. I do not disagree with the honourable member's comment that many employers have much to answer for in terms of modern management techniques, but our system itself seems to preclude management from working with people, so we have not developed the skills and talents that we need for direct person-toperson contact so that the worker can explain to management how to operate the plant better. Frequently it is the people who operate the plant, the men and women who are the blue collar workers in this nation, who have the best ideas on how to lift productivity with the existing capital plant. I remind honourable members that on numerous occasions the honourable member for Bennelong has told this House about the coalition's policy for industrial relations which he, as the Minister for industrial relations, will bring in after the next election. Under that policy we will retain the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the existing system for employers and employees who desire to remain within the ambit of the industrial relations club. We will offer as a second option to groups of employers and unions who wish to form a vertical association the opportunity to strike agreements across an industry and to register those agreements with the Commission. As a third method-and what we really hope will be the growing method-of solving industrial relations conflict in this country, we will propose enterprise bargaining. Enterprise bargaining offers this country the greatest opportunity to come out of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries into the tail end of the twentieth century and to head into the twenty-first century with a flying start. There are numerous examples today in small operations in this country where people have, one way or the other, managed to ignore the centralised system and where management and the work force have agreed on wages and conditions of employment. In general, we find in those enterprises a higher level of wages than exists in the general work force and productivity rates that far exceed anything in the existing traditional work force. I recommend to this House that we explore further this concept of enterprise bargaining and take outside the formal structure of our compulsory arbitration and industrial relations system as many companies and as many individuals as possible. All this, of course, has to be based on the concept of voluntary union membership. If, at the very start, we do not make freedom of association a part of the system, then we have no opportunity to make the system work; all we will do is continue to breed BLFs and we will be back in this House year after year debating whom we should deregister next. The honourable member for Chifley made an impassioned speech in which he said that unions represent the ordinary working Australians, the ordinary men and women of Australia. It is my view that today that is no longer true. I agree that once upon a time-as in the fairy tale-that' was true; the Australian Labor Party did represent the ordinary, average hard-working Australian. That is no longer true; the Liberal Party today represents working Australia and our industrial relations policy, which will take us into the twentyfirst century, is indicative of that support. All across the country we will reach a new threshold as people desert unions and welcome enterprise bargaining, and this Party, the Liberal Party, will represent the ordinary people of Australia.",81
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Cowan)Before calling the next speaker, the Chair would like to say that it is most discourteous of members to walk between the honourable member who is addressing the Chair and the Chair; the Chair requests members to refrain from doing so.",83
151,Mr COBB,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"The Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill effectively· extends the deregistration of the Federal Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) by extending the period during which the Federal organisation cannot apply for re-registration from 14 April next year to 14 April 1996 and, in addition, prevents any of the registered State branches of the BLF from applying for registration and prevents the Western Australian branch of the BLF from pursuing its application for Federal registration begun in 1986. In the limited time available to me in this debate, I would like to announce at the outset that I am happy, as is the coalition, to support this Bill, and to support previous coalition speakers by emphasising that the Bill does not go far enough. The BLF, led by Norm Gallagher, has a very sorry history in this country. Just before I walked in here to speak I picked up a newspaper clipping from the Sun in Victoria of 1 June this year. It reported on a meeting where Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia'(BWIU) and BLF officials debated a motion to suspend the BLF for its deal with the contract labour hire company Trouble Shooters Available, which used to offer labour to sites providing the workers were BLF members. That motion was debated and it was voted 175 to 68 to stop this arrangement. The BLF would not accept that democratic decision. The Sun says: Union delegates head-butted, kicked and punched each other in the Trades Hall Council chambers last night. . . . Building Workers' Industrial Union president Mr Frank O'Grady suffered a suspected broken nose and a black eye. . . . . . . he was taken to hospital. This is the classic part: BLF secretary Norm Gallagher, who was sitting close to where fighting began, left by a side entrance during the confusion. Some delegates left the building with bleeding noses, ripped clothing and holding their heads. . . . Antagonists exchanged head-butts, punches and kicks as people in the packed upstairs public gallery yelled abuse and encouragement.",83
152,Mr CADMAN,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,Democracy at work!,83
153,Mr COBB,FEDERATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, a complete rejection of democracy by the BLF, which has not accepted any democratic decision in this country for a long time. The less that decent Australians see of this organisation in operation, the better. It is nothing but. a rogue union with a history of violence, dominated by that byword for thuggery in this country, Norm Gallagher, who seems to symbolise everything that is rotten and coercive in Australian society. The BLF has been deregistered twice. It was deregistered back in 1974 and it was re-registered in 1976. Then, unfortunately, the Hawke Government withdrew deregistration proceedings against the BLF that the Fraser Government had begun in 1981. The Hawke Government eventually saw the light and deregistered the union in 1986, and it is attempting to extend it again now. The Federal Opposition has condemned this union and criticised the Government for not proceeding with deregistration earlier and not being sufficiently punitive. In 1986 the Opposition sought to have the BLF disqualified for 10 years. Now the Government has come back, having seen the light yet again, to extend deregis4 tration for a further five years. We in the Opposition urged the Government at the time to encourage the States to deregister the branches and confiscate their assets. We have seen recent abominable behaviour by this union at the Leighton site at 476 St Kilda Road in Victoria, with intervention of the Gallagher faction in this dispute, ·involving BWIU members and Leightons. This has led to the creation of a picket, attacks on drivers seeking to enter the site, sabotage of equipment, attacks on Leighton's executive homes, vandalism of other Leighton sites and pickets on other Leighton jobs around Victoria and interstate. What this union does is absolutely disgraceful and it should be banned for ever. In addition to that, we should have in this country the introduction of non-compulsory unionism and the banning of closed shops, and we should embrace the freedom of the trade union movement throughout this country.",84

159,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (5.13)Mr Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on the happy events of last weekend. The Opposition does not oppose the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill and the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill, but I do want to address a nU1llber of important aspects arising from this legislation. I point oui to the public at large, to members of the House and to those watching the proceedings of the House on the closed circuit television monitor0\hat these are two of 40 Bills being presented to the House of Representatives during this critical third last sitting week of the House of Representatives of the Parliament for 1990. It is an absolute disgrace that we have this sausage machine legislative process. We will have only 35 minutes in which to discuss two cognate Bills, one containing 85 pages of complex legislation and the other containing eight pages of complex legislation. Forty Bills in four days will go through the House of Representatives, including these two Bills which will go through in just 35 minutes. That is a good deal longer than was allocated to some education legislation earlier this week. Does the Government call that democracy? Does the Government call that an adequate parliamentary process for the examination of legislation? I submit to the House that it is not. The Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to this approach to legislation and reject the standard of parliamentary performance and procedure that it represents. I challenge the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, to respond-if he gets the chance to respond; because of the guillotine he may not-as to how he, in his own heart, can support 40 Bills being rammed through the House of Representatives in four days, including the two cognate Bills before the House in 35 minutes. I have indicated that the Opposition does not oppose these two important Bills. The first deals with the revamping of the defence service home loans assistance scheme, which has progressively been privatised since 1985. It has been revamped and rejuvenated and there have been a number of substantial improvements to the scheme. There is now, in a sense, more than just one scheme, with one part of its operation being administered by the Westpac Banking Corporation. The 72year-old defence service homes (DSH) scheme was sold to Westpac in 1989. The new arrangements involve subsidised housing loans of up to $40,000, with the other part of the scheme being administered by another bank, the National Australia Bank. A whole raft of new arrangements apply under this legislation. The Government originally embarked on this path in May 1985. It took a very long time before we saw real progress being made. Of course, we had the hiccup of the South Australian State elections late in 1985, when the front bench of the Government, and many key members of it, induding the Treasurer (Mr Keating), argued very strongly against privatisation, although they were proceeding down the privatisation path with regard to the defence service home loans scheme. The Bill includes as a schedule an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the· National Australia Bank which gives the bank the exclusive right to participate as a lender under the newer scheme. The Bill has a number of procedural and operational aspects to provide for the operation of the scheme. The monthly subsidy will be calculated on the basis of an amount borrowed up to a maximum of $40,000 for a loan period of 25 years. The subsidy entitlement is the payment of subsidy for a period of time which is equal to the number of completed yeats of effective full time service by the member beyond the initial service requirement. There are a number of other provisions which I commend honourable members to examine in detail which are laid out in the Bill and the explanatory memorandum to .the Bill. Under this legislation, we particularly welcome the provision made to allow two members who are married to add their loans together and take, in effect, a loan of $80,000 with the assistance provided for under the scheme. This removes a degree of discrimination in the circumstance. It is reasonable and is strongly supported by my shadow colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman, for whom I speak on this occasion in this House.. In the DSH scheme a married service couple are not able to both take their entitled loan for the same home. This is a particularly welcome change to provide for a doubleup, or add-up, given the high cost of housing in some areas where personnel ar- posted qround Australia, especially in Bnsbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. The fact also that the loan portability will allow a top-up to $-40,000 each time the loan is transferred is also particularly come. In the DSH scheme, for those postDecember 1987 loans that are portablethe Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill will handle this aspect; it will be debated at 8 o'clock tonight-the amount that can be transferred decreases with each transfer. Therefore, this top-up arising from this legislation is particularly welcome. I might add that the legislation also picks up on Gulf eligibility of the forces in the Gulf, and affirms again the Namibian eligibility. I take this opportunity to say that the House can be rightly proud of the contribution made by Australian service personnel in Namibia-the Australian Army and one Royal Australian Air Force officer, who thought all his Christmases had come at once when he got a posting to Namibia and served well. Of course, he is the only RAAF person in Australia carrying the Namibian ribbons today. So I guess when he walks into the Richmond officers mess he will get plenty heaped on him for that, and will probably get every extra duty officer that is being extended because of that circumstance. But, quite importantly, the Bill also picks up those who have been sent by resolution of this Parliament, by decision of government policy, to the Middle East in the circumstances now pertaining there. The coalition unreservedly supports the entitlements which have been extended in respect of that commitment embraced by this legislation and also, in part, the legislation later today. Also it accepts the assurance given by the Minister informally to me last week that, in fact, the two ships which have sailed this weekHMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney-will be exactly on the same basis of entitlement and allotment and commencement of payment of the additional entitlements as, indeed, the other two ships that sailed in August and that are going to rotate, and the supply ship that is staying in the Middle East at this time. I would appreciate the Minister taking the opportunity to reaffirm this, because it was raised with me when I went on board HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney last week. I immediately said I would find it very, very unwellikely that there was going to be any change. . The Minister informally confirmed that and, if he might formally do so, the coalition would welcome that. The reservist situation needs to be kept in mind, especially as the Government starts to look at aspects and implementation of the Wrigley report. It may well be that some reservists may be placed standby for the Gulf commitment if, parrun ticularly, sadly, that commitment-for one proper reason or another----:-becomes shooting match or some other developticular ment occurs necessitating specialist servist staff of one kind or another. For example, there could be a motor vehicle accident involving a naval vehicle utilised in the supply of our ships, such as alongside for refuelling and storage, with a vehicle of the Government of the particular emirate state. That, in turn, might lead to a requirement for lawyersing God bless their heart and soul-to go to the Middle East, be they in the militarythe legal profession as reservists in the or whatever category. Therefore, I ask Minister just to clarify the eligibility reservists who, for one reason or another, may yet be called up for and sent to duty in the Middle East during this particular contingent period of activity in the dle East. Let me turn to the second Bill involved in this cognate package: the Commonquate wealth and State Housing l\greement (Service Personnel) Bill. This legislation relates to the outdated agreement between the Federal Government and the States which has required review, and I would argue again that it does represent a modraised. ernisation of the arrangements long overdue. The Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has had considerable difficulty sorting out a number of practical tangles, especially with the maintenance of houses in places like Albury-Wodonga-particuto larly Wodonga in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), where houses were allocated to the defence forces, but tenance was the responsibility of the torian State Government. It just did work out. As a result, armed forces personnel being allocated houses where hot water would not be available for weeks on end; the family may have had a new baby the maintenance was so horrific and so inadequate that they had to move out the house and go elsewhere to shower and port them. to provide a proper situation for the baby. I recall the particular case where that on very much the circumstance due to the down in maintenance and the inability of the particular State government to a provide effective maintenance for a pargroup of houses allocated to the reArmy in Wodonga. It has been replicated elsewhere, perhaps not so far from your electorate in Queensland, Madam Deputy Speaker, in South Australia and elsewhere. I can only say that I see this as a breakthrough to eliminate that conundrum where maintenance got out of kilter with the requirements of a defence housauthority and, as such, a step forward. We support this new agreement with States which will result in the transfer Navy of housing assets valued in excess of the $600m, and we see it as a step forward. of But I would say this: we will closely monitor the performan,ce and impact of this legislation. In this country we tend to take defence too cheaply. We are reminded in Midthis year 1990, when we were expecting peace in the world, of how serious and how suddenly requirements for an adedefence force can arise with our ships in the Middle East. It is in that context that we are not opposed to this legislation, but we will certainly appreciate any response the Minister might like to give in response to the points I have",85
160,Mr LES SCOTI,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"It is alw<\ys good to follow the Leader of the in National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), because I know of his deep commitment the people in the defence forces. We have had some problems with housing for defence people for some time, of course, with consecutive governments-a lot of mainthose being conservative governments, Vicwhich I do not think really have adnot dressed the housing package over many, many years. The problems that the were honourable member raises certainly are addressed in the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill and the Commonand wealth and State Housing Agreement . (Service' Personnel) Bill, and I am very of pleased to have the opportunity to supThis legislation is of particular signifiwas cance and interest to me because of the large military base I have in my electorate of Oxley-that is; the Royal. Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Amberley. I am sure that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is seated at the table, recalls his visit to my electoby rate recently and, of course, the base at Amberley. He witnessed first hand the concern that defence personnel have with housing-particularly a lot of the spouses of our defence personnel. That is probably where the biggest concern is. I know the Minister has been spending a lot of time visiting as many bases as possible since he has been the Minister, and I know he makes every effort to get out there and see them. I am sure he finds the same everywhere; probably one of the most crucial issues to defence personnel is housing and, of course, the impact it has on the families. But this view overall is certainly shared by the Government, and the further improvements in access to adequate housing for defence personnel which will flow from this legislation is, indeed, evidence of this. This legislation is very much a continuation of the Labor Government's tradition of making life in the defence forces as attractive as possible for our personnel. It is worth noting that it was actually a Labor Government that extended the war· service homes scheme in existence back in 1972, changing the face of the scheme from one designed for repatriation and ease of settlement for service personnel to all members of the Defence Force who meet eligibility criteria. For what is required in catering for the unique needs of defence personnel and their families is a flexible housing structure which takes into consideration the specific characteristics· of the defence life. I put on record the proud achievements of this Government along this path. which has continued the lead of previous Labor Governments in the work that has been done to better the lot of the defence families. First and foremost, it was the Hawke Government which created a portfolio separate from the main defence portfolio recognising that the needs of defence families have specific demands not seen in civilian families. The creation of the Defence Science and Personnel portfoliowhich, of course, the Minister at the table holds-has done much to highlight these demands and make the non-defence community more aware of the sacrifices made defence personnel and their families. Frequent transfers mean that defence families have to be extremely adaptable. However, the Government has taken several steps to make these transactions much easier. Of course, I refer firstly to what is better known as FIND-the family information network for defence-which I believe has been very well received by defence personnel and their families; and, secondly, ADFILS-the Australian defence families information and liaison staff. Both perform a vital role in easing the pressures associated with transfers. There have also been significant increases in pay structures for defence personnel for the periods since 1983, in part due to the success of the defence force remuneration tribunal, formed in 1984, in its role of overseer of pay and conditions for defence personnel. For example, up to 1 February 1990, the smallest effecti ve total increase in pay scales between $20,000 and $50,000 per annum-when considering direct wage rises and indirect benefits through the tax system-was just under 22 per cent. This compares with a consumer price index increase of some 18.5 per cent for the same period. The establishment of the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) in 1988 reflects the Government's genuine belief that defence personnel should not be subject to any obstacles in choosing their style of accommodation simply because they choose a career in the defence forces. As proof of this, the DHA is at present involved in a program of disposing of a number of houses which do not meet the high standards set by the DHA and the acquisition, . by purchase, lease or construction, of replacement housing. A system of scales and standards, based on the size and quality of houses, is combined with an entitlement based on rank to determine the allocation of houses. For members housed to entitlement, rents paid range from $61 per week for a private or equivalent up to $102.30 per week for a colonel or equivalent and above. Members housed in the ever-decreasing number of houses which do not meet the high standards set by DHA pay even less rent. Further proof of the DHA's success can be seen in the figures for houses below DHA standards which have been disposed of in recent years. In the five years immediately preceding the establishment of the DHA, 1,940 of these houses had been disposed of, whereas in its initial two years· the DHA had disposed of 2,497 housesan annual improvement in disposals of more than 300 per cent. In addition, a large number of houses have been upgraded. In fact, the Government will spend a total of $1 billion over the next). 0 years on defence housing. During the financial year 1988-89 alone, the Hawke Government spent $135m on defence housing, including repairs and maintenance. This compares with an average of $35m for the last five years of the Fraser Government. The changes to the existing Commonwealth-State housing arrangements contained in this legislation follow the same thrust as other Federal Government policies in the housing area. The returning to the States of 50 per cent of the houses provided under earlier agreements contains a twofold benefit. Firstly, the Commonwealth will then be in a better position to provide housing to service personnel than the existing arrangements where service personnel's needs for housing are dependent upon a State's resources. With the States in line to resume ownership of the other half of the houses, they will now be better able to assess their own needs in the public housing area. The five-year time-frame set down for the handback to the States will provide for a smooth transition from the existing arrangements, with some 4,200 houses being transferred in the first two years and around 7,000 houses over the full five years. The legislation on which I speak today also ensures that the other side of the coin, that of home purchase, remains just as accessible to defence personnel. The measures for the provision of housing for defence personnel carry with them two important ethics-those of equity and accessibility. This feature is evident in the Bill's provision for continuity of entitlement to a subsidised loan for widows and widowers. It is only fitting, given the contribution of one or both partners, that that benefit be continued. Extending the time limit for widows or widowers of eligible persons to apply for an entitlement certificate to within two years of the eligible person's death or resignation, retirement or discharge-whichever is the earlier-essentially gives the widow or widower the same rights in respect of applying for entitlement as the original applicant would have had. To prevent a small number of personnel gaining unfair advantage in home purchase, special provision has been made in defining circumstances in which a person will be eligible for a subsidised loan. Subsidised payments commence only if the person does not own another house and if he or she is residing in the house being purchased. Through this rider, access to subsidised loans can be made available for the greater proportion of defence personnel who genuinely want to purchase or live in their own homes. This philosophy of maintaining equity in the provision of subsidised loans is also evident in sections of the Bill relating to portability conditions. To prevent exploitation of the scheme at the expense of another service member gaining a loan, portability provisions preclude a person from transferring their subsidy entitlement to another house more than once after leaving the defence forces. While a person remains ""a member of the defence forces, however, there is no limit to the number of times the person may transfer the loan. I am sure that will be welcomed by many members of the defence forces. This condition is a continuation of the Government's intention to make continued life in the Services as attractive as possible. As with other Government benefits and services, defence personnel will be given the right of appeal ensuring each application for benefit is given a genuine hearing. Once a decision is made, the applicant for a subsidised loan shall be notified in writing, along with the terms and reasons relating to the decision being clearly stated in writing. The applicant then will have access to a multi-stage review process, including access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, in the cases where a decision made personally by the Secretary is to be reviewed, access to the Minister. These review mechanisms reflect the Government's view that defence families, while being part of a unique community, are also members of the community at large and, as such, should have access to similar review mechanisms to those used in non-defence government departments. This has been shown in advances by the Government in education, heath, childcare and family allowances, to name but a few. This proud record was further exemplified earlier this year through the reform to superannuation for defence personnel. The new scheme, which will come into effect on 1 October 1991, contains both retirement and retention benefits for defence personnel. A key feature of the new military superannuation and benefits scheme (MSBS) is its equitable treatment of Australian Defence Force (ADF) members who serve less than 20 years, whereby they will accrue an entitlement to a substantial benefit in addition to the 3 per cent benefit. Under the new scheme, ADF members will have returned to them not only their own contributions but also whatever these contributions earn in the MSBS investment fund. So by modifying superannuation entitlements for defence personnel, this Government .has again demonstrated its sustained commitment to the members of our Defence Force. As has been shown in the months since our naval forces left for the Middle East on 2 August, we rely on men and women who make up our defence forces, both in times of peace and in times of conflict. The present conflict in the Persian Gulf has made a greater proportion of the Australian. population certainly more aware of this. I know the men and women stationed at Amberley RAAF base in my electorate of Oxley uphold the proud values of our defence forces that have been instilled over generations and, if called upon to serve Australia, would apply themselves to that task in the same way as the members of the naval force presently stationed in the Gulf. It is only fair that the calibre of Australia's defence personnel be rewarded with a lifestyle and remuneration commensurate with this dedication. I have mentioned some of the benefits put in place by this Government which' fit well within this ethos, and I am proud to stand up today and speak for further improvements to service conditions which can only better the lot of the men and women of our defence forces.",87
161,Mr TAYLOR,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"It is always a pleasure to support legislation in this place which removes detrimental provisions as they affect members of the Australian Defence Force and which provides the necessary incentives to attract and retain the best men and women to uniformed service. Although neither the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill nor the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill being debated this evening is, in itself, the magic pudding in either respect, together they provide further enhancement to the defence forces, gradually improving conditions of service, for which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, and his predecessors in this Government can take some credit. Nevertheless, that is not to say that we can rest on our laurels, and clearly much is yet to be achieved if the major asset of the Australian defence forces-and I refer to people-is to be optimised. On the first Bill, the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill, I have but one comment. I support any legislation such as this which brings the housing provisions for Australian Defence Force personnel into the twentieth century, finally putting unsatisfactory aspects of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement to bed and, at the same time, lifting standards out of the depths to which the defence housing stock had been allowed to sink. As the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has said, much of the credit for this reversal of form goes to the officers of the Defence Housing Authority who, in the two years since its formation, have done a great deal not only to improve defence housing standards but also to move progressively away from a defence housing ghetto mentality towards the desirable levels of integrating service ilies more comprehensively into the community at large. As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, it has been a pleasure for me and my Committee colleagues within this and the previous Parliamr;nt to take evidence on a numbeylof the Authority's projects right across the nation and recommend them to the Parliament. Without exception, it has shown a degree of foresight and comprehension of the Defence Force's needs not recognised or practised previously. I congratulate the Authority on its initiative and industry. Turning to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill, which, as the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) has said, the Opposition supports generally, I raise a number of specific points. Firstly, I commend the provisions which establish the eligibility of service men and women who do not have a loan under the existing service home provisions and who are serving in the Gulf. On that point I take the opportunity, as did the honourable member for Farrer to wish the officers and ships' companies of HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney God speed as they deploy to relieve HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide in dangerous waters. I have to say that despite some media and other attempts to play down and criticise the efforts of Darwin, Adelaide, and indeed of the replenishment ship HMAS Success, it behoves this Parliament once again to get behind their operational efforts in the broader national interest. None of us wishes to see the conflict manifest itself into a shooting war. All of us would support, I feel sure, diplomatic channels as the primary tool for resolving the impasse. Nonetheless I have little doubt that had the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) not taken the timely decisions he did, with indeed the strongest bipartisan support of this Opposition, the Iraqis would now not only be in Kuwait but also in large areas of Saudi Arabia. I recognise our naval contingent is a relatively small one, as indeed is our Defence Force contingent serving famon exchange postings with British and United States units in that region. However, Australia has made that tangible contribution, no matter how small, as a contribution by one independent sovereign state to an international effort which is a visible reflection of our total rejection of the flagrant violation of another sovereign state by Saddam Hussein. I hope that all in this place will join me not only in unqualified support for our deployed servicemen in that region but also in condemning Saddam Hussein for his indisputable and violent aggression. With the indulgence of the House I would like to read into the Hansard record a short media comment I made on 20 October about an associated issue, the decision that sailors should not wear uniform in public: That uniform is a symbol of national pride, patriotism and sacrifice in war. The Minister for Defence Senator Ray should not be allowed to dismiss that decision by hiding behind so called classified information and by protecting subversive elements in our society. Why give any sort of credibility to a spineless, ruthless, international terrorist group like the Saddam-backed Abu Nidal . . . Why let a group of fundamentalist assassins and a minority group of Muslim misfits hold our democratic nation Australia to public ransom. If we have a security organisation worth its salt, we should allow our Navy to get on with its jqb without political interference and should get rid of any non-Australian riff-raff. Just for once, let's have some guts. One specific reservation I do have with the extension of the loan provisions in this Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill to service personnel in the Gulf is, as the honourable member for Farrer has said, that reservists are apparently excluded. I feel sure that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, who is at the table, would not want suggestions of Defence Science and Personnel, who is at the table, would not want suggestions of a first and a second eleven. I hope therefore he will undertake to review this shortcoming, particularly as the Reserve component in, for example, medical units could be expected to be substantial. My second point relates to the long delays in getting to this stage, and to some of the financial aspects of the scheme set out in this Bill. In May 1985 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced that Defence Force personnel who joined after 14 May that year would not qualify for benefits under the existing defence service homes legislation but that a complementary scheme would be developed. In 1988 the Cross report into Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force was tabled in this place, and it made inter alia specific recommendations in the area of housing loans. In May 1989 the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel presented the Government's responses to the Cross report. Here we are in November 1990, over five years since the Government's original undertaking-hardly an example of rapid, equitable decision making by the supposedly socially aware Administration that we heard put forward this afternoon during the matter of public importance debate. I know of no other section of the community which could be expected to accept such delays, and I ask the Minister at the table why should the defence forces.

162,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"1 know the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) is anxious to comment on this Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill. I am very glad to give him the opportunity, but as I represent probably the largest base in Australia. I would like to put on record that I appreciate the two moves made by the Government in this regard. I think the fact the Defence Force's budget has been cut dramatically in spite of many reports recommending it be increased is very detrimental in many areas affecting defence personnel. I want to place on record that even though there have been some positive moves, the Government still has a long way to go before it gets housing and all things associated with loans, and barrack conditions, et cetera, up to date. A larger injection of funding needs to be made.",92
163,Mr BILNEY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (5.47)in reply-Perhaps I could commence with the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who has just spoken, and say the appalling situation which came about in service housing arose under the Government he supported, and the improvements spoken of by all honourable members in this debate have been brought about by this Government. First of all I thank honourable members for their contributions. Let me now speak briefly to some of the points made. I do agree with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) that there are various improvements in this Bill over the previous one in the areas of portability, efficiencies from using the National Australia Bank agency, and the amalgamation of the contribution of two spouses. I am glad to confirm for the honourable member the conditions which apply to personnel posted to the Gulf. On this occasion conditions are exactly the same as those which applied in the case of the first rotation. So far as the situation of reservists called up for service in the Gulf is concerned, my advice is that their situation will be the same as that of Regular servicemen in the Gulf. I thought when the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) spoke to me about this before the debate that he meant would reservists in Australia have those same conditions. They will, but only if they are full time. Ordinary reservists will not have those conditions. So far as the Commonwealth-State housing agreements are concerned, I welcome the remarks made about the situation brought about by the creation of the Defence Housing Authority by this Government. At the risk of being partisan, but in responding to the honourable member for Macquarie, I say th-t I h-ve seen. too much of the slu-s m WhICh servl.cemen were forced to bve under a prev-ous Government. DHA has made a yast .lmpro-ement, but I would agree there IS stIll a fair way to go. It is perhaps appropriate too to commend two of the people involved in this matter-Manfred Cross, for the stimulation he gave to this issue, and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who displayed not only his close interest in and expert knowledge of conditions of service but also gave his support for those many servicemen who live in his electorate.",92

166,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Dawson) (5.51)As I was saying yesterday on another Bill, once again at this time of the year we see this very important type of legislation on community services and health b.efore t-e Ho-se but we. have - mly 50 mmutes 1!l WhICh to do It Justl-e and to pas.s It ) through all stages. Agam I want to regIster my protest at the way in which a very important part of the community, the aged, have been treated by this Government. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) will have to be debated in haste, just as it has been prepared in haste. The Bill includes most of the Budget announcements relating to aged care but contains nothing in respect of the decisions on services for people with a disability-which one might have reasonably expected in an omnibus Bill dealing with community services. I mention this because it was only last week that I laid before the House a private member's Bill on disabilities, suggesting that changes were required in the Disability Services Act (DSA), and I named five areas where changes are required. One was to strengthen accountability, particularly in the bureaucracy. Another called for accountability by tabling principles, objectives and guidelines. It was also suggested that there should be three new service types introduced. I just mention that attendant care services was one and, as I understand, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) said prior to the Budget that this would be so included. He had the opportunity in this. omnibus Bill to introduce such. a type of service, but it is still not here. The other areas we are concerned about are the necessary extension of the transition date. The Minister had the opportunity to include that in this Bill, and also to provide some justice around the place by way of an appeals provision such as the one we are suggesting be included in the Disability Services Act. Here is the opportunity. Unless such amendments are made to the Act, justice will be denied to a very important element of our community. The ACROD Newsletter for June and July, under the heading, 'Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics', asked the Minister two questions: 1. Has the DAS been successful in supplying disability services required by Australians with disabilities? 2. Will Government funds keep pace with demand for services? The first conclusion was that DSA 'reaches only a small proportion of disabled Australians'. The second conclusion was that the DSA has a narrow focus of disability. The third conclusion was that effectively there has only been a partial implementation of the Disability Services Act at this stage. The fourth conclusion was that on the best statistical evidence available there is a large unmet need for disability services. It continued: We should not be surprised that ACROD members are reporting increasing waiting lists services. So in the haste with which the Bill has been prepared, an important element of our community-people with disabilities-is being denied answers to these questions on Government programs. As far as the funding is concerned, there is also a suggestion within the newsletter that while there is a powerful competition for Government dollars, the indexation factor is less than adequate and the growth factor will not close the gap between those with disabilities who are provided with services and those who are not. The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled (ACROD) is saying that the normal population growth-the net increase in people-assisted in this way is substantially less than the 5.5 per cent quoted. The Council goes on to say that in turning to needs-based planning, all this has done really is just change the chairs on the Titanic. and that all the Government is doing is reallocating the same funds. So I add my protest on behalf of those people who are an important but a forgotten part of the community as far as this Government is concerned. The Bill implements the Government's Budget decision to abolish hostel care subsidy in respect of residents of aged persons hostels, other than those who are financially disadvantaged. It also enables private organisations, as well as non-profit bodies, to be eligible to apply for recurrent funding, but not capital funding, for aged persons hostels. As from 9 January 1991, the payment of hostel care subsidy-currently at $2.50 a day-to non-financially disadvantaged persons will cease. The Government expects this cut to raise $27m in revenue in 1990-91 and $53m in 1991-92. It states that by extending their maximum fee scale, combined with the interest they receive from entry contributions, hostels will be able to compensate for the reduced funding. The Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations (AAVCA), the peak body representing hostels, does not agree. It argues that for some hostels the loss of for their the hostel care subsidy may mean the difference between survival and closedown. It states that hostels in some areas may be able to attract adequate funds through large ingoing contributions and a higher fee structure, but in many areasnotably country areas, which this Government forgets about-neither source of funding will be adequate to maintain viability. The AAVCA further states that these cuts will have a consequent impact on standards. Only those hostels with substantial volunteer support will have the potential for maintaining the standards which have been set by the Commonwealth. The retrospective aspect of this cut is obvious but it is very unfair to people already in hostels. They signed agreements that specified fees calculated at a particular level. Some or most of these organisations will now have to break those agreements and renegotiate with residents if they wish to raise the fees. These hostels, which are charitable in the voluntary sector, cannot, in all fairness, now increase fees beyond the 85 per cent of p-nsion or ask for a resident contribution. It is fair enough for those incoming residents who are yet to come to the hostels, but it is not fair. to those already there. For instance, from my personal experience, it is not an alternative to suggest that these people who are already in hostels can now be asked to sign contributions towards their stay. It is fair enough for those coming, but when they have arranged to come in on the basis of paying a fee and no entry contribution, it is too late now to do it, and I say this with the experience of being involved in a nursing home as a counsellor. A delegation from the AAVCA, I understand, met with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 9 October 1990 to express its concern at this and other Budget cuts. I understand the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) agreed that the abolition of the hostel care subsidy for non-financially disPrivate advantaged persons who are already in residence should be reviewed, and suggested that there could be a clause which would overcome the retrospective nature of the withdrawal of the subsidy for a certain period. This would have offered some relief, but no such clause is included in the Bill. So I wonder what that wording means in the industry at the moment. The decision to allow private participation in the Commonwealth hostel program would appear to be in response to the fact that as a result of government policy to reduce the number of nursing home beds in favour of more hostel places, the number of hostel beds required for the elderly are not being built at a rate sufficient to meet expected demand. The Commonwealth has failed to provide the incentive for private, operators to augment the supply of hostel accommodation that is needed. The cost of building the appropriate facilities without some form of capital funding subsidy is prohibitive and therefore financially unsound for those people who are making an investment of it and also for financing purposes. The present recurrent funding, especially in view of the abolition of the hostel care subsidy for those who are financially disadvantaged, is insufficient to meet the increasing standards or to allow for the cost of accommodation of more dependent residents entering hostels. Intending private hostel developers are immediately disadvantaged by having to pay rates, sales tax, payroll tax and income tax that industry counterparts, charitable and religious service providers, are granted exemption from, quite apart from providing the capital and servicing it. The other '}hing is that geriatric assessment team assessments will mean that admission of financially disadvantaged people to hostels will be a question that will have to be faced by these people. The question that I ask is: Will a $2.50 per day subsidy excite the private sector enough to become involved in the scheme? The Government should take on board the statement from the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals that: hostel operators will only consider outlaying capital and coping with the bureaucracy if the reward is sufficient. Currently, the offer from the Government is not attractive. The Bill also incorporates into the principal Acts as schedules the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities in Approved Hostels and the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities in Approved Nursing Homes. Although the charters have already been tabled, incorporation in the substantive Acts is intended to strengthen their legal power and emphasise their key role in the provision of hostel care for the aged. I foreshadow that in committee I shall be moving amendments in respect of the charters, in line with the amendments moved by the Opposition to the documents now lying on the table in both Houses. I also mention here that the charter included as a schedule to the Bill is not the same as that tabled in both Houses of' Parliament. I pointed this out to the Minister's office, but at this stage nothing has been done to rectify the fault. I emphasise to the Minister at the table that my understanding is that if the charters already tabled do not conform exactly to the charters in this legislation, there could be a legal challenge. As the Bill will be unever amended when it leaves this House it is very important that by the time it is debated in the Senate-tomorrow, I understand-the charter conform to the final form as laid on the table of the House and as amended. I just urge the Minister to take note of this and ensure that the charter as tabled and eventually amended is the same as the one in the Bill come the time it passes through all stages. This legislation will enable nursing home residents to have unlimited hospitalisation leave while still having home benefits paid while they are absent, thus ensuring that they have a nursing home bed to return to when they leave hospital. Under existing arrangements, nursing home residents can be absent from a nursing home for up to only 28 days a year for either health reasons or social leave purposes. This proposal has been part of Opposition policy for some two years and we have continually pressed the Government to make the change. The Minister eventually made his announcement in February in the midst of the recent election campaign. His premature statement said that 'from now on the Government will provide unlimited hospitalleave for nursing home residents over and above the existing 28 days leave per year'. What he omitted to say was that legislation governing leave arrangements would need to be amended and agreed to by parliament, which at that stage was not scheduled to sit until May. The legislation has reached this House only now, in November. The Minister's premature announcement was really an unkind political ploy in the lead-up to an election in an attempt to woo the votes of the frail aged and their relatives. I have to place on record here how cynical and hollow that announcement was. In order not to disadvantage residents or nursing homes, the coalition at that stage, through me, agreed that changes to the legislation be made retrospective to 1 March 1990. I remember a frantic call from the head of the Department reaching me in my electorate in the course of the election campaign to seek my agreement to that. . Further, the Minister could have introduced the amending legislation during the two-week sitting period in the House of Representatives. By not doing that, he has further disadvantaged some of those nursing homes which will now have to wait at least until December for reimbursement of the moneys expended up to nine months ago. Again, so much for the social justice policy of this Government, for there is little justice for the resident or the proprietor in the Government's announcement of this in a slipshod way and obviously in a manner designed to favour nursing it at election time. This Bill also supplements changes being made to respite care regulations to facilitate the use made of respite care provisions in nursing homes. Changes to the Act are necessary to allow nursing homes to charge prospective respite care residents a booking fee which is refundable on admission and to limit the size of that fee to 25 per cent of resident respite cost or one week's respite fee, whichever is the lesser. Current provisions in the Act prohibit nursing homes charging any fee prior to the admission of a resident. We welcome these changes. They remove the financial disadvantages of providing respite beds in nursing homes, and we understand that a geriatric assessment team coordinator will be appointed next year to develop awareness of respite beds and to develop respite referrals. We also welcome the establishment of more than one nursing home fees review committee in each State to help clear the backlog. I just incidentally mention in connection with respite referrals that there is still concern in the industry that the changes did not go far enough. The Government is still showing a disinclination to listen to those working at the coalface of the aged care industry. Finally, I just stress to the Minister the concern felt within the nursing home industry at the reduction in care aggregated module funding for nursing home categories three and five. The Government pre-empted the report of its own review committee on care aggregated module funding and acted unilaterally just as the committee was about to report its finding. In the 31 August newsletter of the Australian Nursing Homes Association it was called a 'Sham CAM' review. If the Minister reads it, he will understand the ing of the industry. The delicate balance between CAM hours and dollars available on one side and the capacity of proprietheir tors and staff to provide quality care the other has been gravely affected by this Budget decision. The Government has changed the rules in midstream. Theredents fore, there will be job losses and great stress will be placed on the staff of those organisations which will want to maintain the quality of care but which will then have to fund this additional loss from its own resources. Again 1 mention the failure of the Labor Government in under Medicare. connection with its social justice policy. We will move those amendments in committee.",93
167,Mr GIBSON,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I wish to concentrate my comments on one care. element of the Community Services be and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990, namely the incorporation of the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities. Over the last few weeks there has been a lot of ill-informed comis ment and criticism about this charter and its implications. We have heard some landish allegations made by some in the industry that this charter relates form of allowance of sexual activities, to euthanasia, and similar comments. Unforto tunately, these comments, which have been made by a small number of owners and operators of nursing homes and hosinitiative tels, have taken away from the very great significance of this charter and the imporsponsibilities. tance that it has for the residents of nurssaid, ing homes and hostels. There has been a last minute attempt by a small but vocal minority to derail the charter at the eleventh hour. They have attempted to build up an hysterical reaction within the community by allegin ing, quite incorrectly, that there is a range of outcomes in this charter that people would not want. But let us face the facts and hear the truth about what is behind some of these comments. There has been a hidden agenda by some of the owners and operHostels, ators of nursing homes-a very small minority, I might say; the vast majority of owners and operators of nursing feelhave welcomed this charter. A small minority have attempted to use other issues to hide their real agenda, and that is concern about one important issue on and part of the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities, which is the choice of doctor by nursing home resito serve their needs in the nursing homes. It is very important that that agenda be brought out on the table because a fundamental right of people in this Community is to have freedom of of hours choice of their doctor. Dr Bob Woods-They do not have it",97
168,Mr GIBSON,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"They do have freedom of choice in which doctor they go to under this charter as they do under MediIt is very important that that issue laid on the table because some people in the nursing home industry would rather have the choice of one particular doctor and not allow nursing home residents and patients to have freedom of choice. That neither fair nor reasonable. The Charter of Rights and Responsibilities for Nursing outHome Residents has made a very important issue of this and will protect the to some rights of those residents. A priority of this Government has been enhance the rights, status and living conditions of those Australians who do live in nursing homes and hostels. A key of this Government has been this charter of residents' rights and reIt does cover, as I have residents in both nursing homes and hostels. Another important and related initiative is the agreement between residents and proprietors of nursing homes currently being considered by this House and the other place. The residents' rights and initiatives, including the charter and agreement, are largely based on research presented by Chris Ronalds in the issues paper, 'I'm Still an Individual'. The recommendations of the final report Residents Rights in Nursing Homes and known as the Ronalds report, were published in 1989. The Ronalds report was commissioned as a result of the homes Hawke Government's firm commitment to social justice and to improving the lives of older people who are in varying measpower ures dependent on aged care services. The Ronalds report identified major issues of concern to our older people ing in nursing homes and hostels. These issues include how residents feel isolated from family and friends; that they feel they have lost the right to participate decisions affecting their lives; that they are unaware of their rights and how to protect them; they experience a loss independence and individuality, including a loss of self-esteem and a feeling of being unimportant; feelings of financial insecuridents. ity; a fear of retribution; and boredom and lack of variety in their lives at the nursing homes. It would be wrong to gest that all these issues are a natural consequence of living in a nursing home or hostel. I have a 'very good working knowledge of all the nursing homes and hostels that serve the people of my electorate of Moreton. I know that the vast bulk those nursing homes do provide excellent care and service for their residents. an issue which relates to a minority homes and residents but it is still an issue of importance to them'as it is to everyone in the community. In many ways these are issues which may be identified by any of us as a problem at various times in our lives and to different degrees from time to time. There 'may also be other factors involved such as socio-economic background, ethnic background, family structure or the feelperson ing as we get older that we cannot keep pace with modern society or that we do not want to be a burden on others. The initiatives of this Government aimed at redressing these issues and charter and agreement are one part of overall strategy of reform. Nursing home residents all over Australia, from Biloela to Bunbury, from Tennant Creek to ity and independence. Temora and throughout the suburbs of the electorate of Moreton, have the expecfact tation that they deserve the same rights as every other citizen. We have to ensure that all residents feel secure in their homes, they get the same high level quality care and that they have the same and knowledge to exercise and protect their rights. Since the release of the Ronalds report, liva great deal of work has gone into the development of initiatives that will address these difficulties and concerns of residents. As a first step in the protection in of rights, the Government has developed the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities which sets out the philosoof phy underpinning all the initiatives relating to residents' rights and which defines the rights and responsibilities of resA great deal of work went into discussions and negotiations with all interested sugparties in developing this charter. The words of the charter are not the words of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), the Department or the Government; they are the words of the people involved in the industry, both residents and operators alike. The people of most involved are the ones who have written the words. I place on record in It is this House my congratulations to the of Minister for his perseverance with this issue and the long and extensive consultation that he has undertaken with all fields in the industry to ensure that this charter, once adopted, does reflect the true views 'of all involved. The charter sets out the philosophy that fundamental rights, such as the right to be treated fairly by others and the right to autonomy, do not diminish when a moves into a nursing home or hostel, regardless of their physical or mental frailty or their ability to exercise or fully appreciate their rights. In certain aspects are of their lives oldtu people may become the more vulnerable when they move into a an nursing home or hostel. So the charter defines the rights of the resident in relation to issues such as privacy, individualThe charter recognises the important that while the resident requires the care and assistance provided by the nursing home or hostel, the nursing home or hostel is, nevertheless, their home. It is of very important that we recognise that nursing homes and hostels must provide that homely, warm environment. Different people may define what their home means to them in different ways, but most would agree that home is a place where a person feels comfortable and respected and where he or she would have some control over how it is to be. As well as setting out fundamental rights, the charter recognises that residents living as part of a nursing home or hostel community have responsibilities which they should fulfil, such as the responsibility to respect the rights of others. Together with the agreement, the charter aims to ensure that residents are aware of their rights and responsibilities. They can now be confident that legislation exists to protect their rights and that they know that the Government is concerned enough about the rights of frail, older Australians to introduce such initiatives. It is important to point out that this charter represents the first time anywhere in the world, as far as we are aware, that a government has instituted into legislation the protection and recognition of rights and responsibilities of people residing in nursing homes and hostels. Once more we are provided with an example of this Government leading the world in its initiatives, both in terms of aged care and in the overall implementation of social justice. This Parliament has the choice to accept the charter and show that we do care about the rights of residents in nursing homes and hostels or to reject or try to amend significantly the charter and to therefore send a message to our community that we really do not care about residents' rights. The charter and agreement will also play an important role in promoting an awareness of the needs of individuals amongst their family and friends, care providers, nursing home and hostel communities and the community generally. The charter will be displayed prominently at all Commonwealth subsidised nursing homes and hostels. Each resident will also receive a copy of the charter as part of an information package on the residents' rights initiatives that will be distributed to each resident. Residents' relatives will also receive a copy of the package. The Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities is attached as a schedule to the agreement for nursing home residents and proprietors which is currently before this House and the Senate. The legislation requires that the agreement be consistent with the charter. The charter is schedUled to the agreement to ensure that residents and proprietors are aware of the philosophy it sets out. As I said before, the agreement and the charter have been the subject of extensive consultations with consumer, union and industry groups over the past year. The initiatives represent a new era of understanding of the rights of consumers of aged care services. The initiatives also reflect the Government's aim to ensure that frail older Australians receive the quality care they deserve in an environment where their dignity and freedom of choice are assured. I am pleased .and proud to be a part of the Government that has introduced this Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities. I congratulate the Minister once more and I commend this Bill to the House.",97
169,Dr BOB WOODS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"We are addressing the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2). I really want to address some other aspects of that. Before I do, though, I cannot resist commenting on the inconsistency of the Government in terms of how important it seems to be for individuals in nursing homes to have the freedom of choice of doctor and yet under Medicare and in public hospitals they do not have that choice. I presume that if the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) is espousing this requirement that they have freedom of choice, he will be changing the regulations of Medicare to allow freedom of choice in public hospitals. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted to comment on that. The particular items I want to address in the Bill relate to the changes to the radiology practices of doctors in Australia. There are two important issues here. There are two problems which the Government is trying to solve. One is a very real problem; ,one is a somewhat nebulous problem. The real problem is with the association of a number of specialist radiologists with general practice medical centres and, in particular, I think it is true to say, bulk billing medical centres around Australia. That association between the specialist and the practice is, in fact, a very nominal association. It exists only in name, in as much as the medical practice usually owns the X-ray equipment, its own staff actually take the X-rays, and the referral the X-rays is done by the general practitioners (GPs) on the staff of the medical centre. All the specialist does is name to be used for bulk billing, which in many cases allows a higher rebate. Also for the licensing of equipment to meet many State laws, it is a requirement that a specialist radiologist or equivalent son be the licensee of that equipment. So it allows X-ray equipment to be set up that would not otherwise be allowed. In return for using his name, the specialist will perhaps read the X-rays at some time and will receive a percentage of the billswhich otherwise will go to the centre-as his cut, if you like, for reading those X-rays. The proposals very reasonably and sensibly extend the same sort of revisions that were inserted into pathology relationships with general medical practice centres. These insist upon an arm's length referral system between the GPs requiring the X-ray and the specialist doing the Xray. They also require an arm's length separation both in financial terms and, in many cases, in physical terms. In other words, the specialist's rooms are allowed to be geographically in the same situation as the medical centre, but only if and rates charged and the other expenses involved are normal commercial relationships. We have no problem with this. We believe that it is very appropriate because this legislation will actually prevent the kickbacks and the inducements to overservicing which do occur. One question which arises, of course, is how real this problem is. I believe that it is a real problem. Certainly most of the evidence is, sadly, anecdotal, but the number of anecdotes and the extent of the anecdotes is such that we believe there is a problem, as do the Government, the Australian Medical Association (AMA), the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists. I have to say that it is somewhat frustrating not to be able to quantify the problem to find out exactly how extensive it is. I realise that the Government has the same problems we have in this regard but I do accept the for Government's notion that there is a real problem here. We believe that the legislation will actually solve the problem in a offer his reasonable and fair manner. However, we think that the Government has the second issue wrong. This is the question of supposed overservicing by per- GPs taking their own X-rays of their clients .. In particular, this relates to spinal X-rays. If a full three-field spinal X-ray is taken, the rebate is around $120. The question which arises here is whether there is in fact overservicing and, if there is, how common it is and how much of a problem it is. Undoubtedly, there are some GPs who take spinal X-rays which do seem on the face of it to be unnecessary, but the problem is a very minor one. In the last figures we have, there were something like 25,798 GPs in Australia. In the last year for which we have figures, 1,172 of those actually took spinal X-rays. If we look at the breakdown and the numbers of spinal X-rays actually taken by those doctors, however, we see that only 109 doctors took more than one spinal Xray every week and only nine out of a total of 25,798 GPs took more than one a day. Quite clearly, the number of GPs involved in this rort, if we want to call it the rents that, is a very small number. What the Government seems to have offered here is very much a sledge-hammer solution to a very small problem because its proposal is to limit the type of X-rays which GPs can do. This is a change of years-in fact, decades-of practice. The Government's legislation will allow GPs to X-ray chest, abdomen, extremities and nothing else. Of course, it will specifically exclude spinal X-rays. I have to say that I think this is a good case of overzealous bureaucrats determining that GPs should be restricted to X-raying chest, abdomen and extremities and, therefore, restricting the exercise of doctors' professional and medical judgment as to what they believe they should X-ray. Doctors have exercised that judgment for decades, and I remain to be convinced that there should be any change now. It seems to me that the problem is not one of safety considerations because there are exclusion clauses. If one happens to be an isolated GP, one is allowed to continue with these X-rays. It is very much a question of centralised control being imposed on a practice which has been safe for a long time so that the Government can remove a relatively minor problem, in terms of the number of GPs involved. In passing, I just ask what the AMA is doing. There are 1,200 GPs potentially affected. Some of those will be excluded because they are isolated, but the AMA seems to be supporting centralised control over the medical practice and over the ability of GPs to decide what is appropriate for their patients. There seems to be an enormous inconsistency here on the part of the AMA. I presume that the only explanation for this is that the AMA did not do its homework and did not realise how small a problem it actually was and that it accepted the Government's statements at face value. Not only is this a small problem, but it is one which can be adequately addressed in other ways. There are profiles of these GPs which will allow us to pick out, in the case I used of more than one spinal X-ray a day, the nine GPs who actually indulge-if that is the right word-in excess spinal X-raying. It is easy to pick them out, unlike picking out specialists who are abusing the system. As all they do is X-rays, it is less difficult to pick an abnormal profile. Overservicing by GPs can be picked out in the current system. Indeed, the current system for investigating overservicing would actually cover these. More than that, the legislation includes a provision for a committee of peers. This is a proposal we support. The committee of peers will address questions of overservicing. In summary, it is a very small problem in terms of the number of GPs involved. The solution is inappropriate. It will effect major changes to general practice in Australia. Whilst we support the changes to the regulations governing specialists X-rays, we will oppose the changes to the regulations governing GPs X-rays. We propose to move amendments, the terms of which have been circulated in my name. I seek leave to incorporate the amendments in Hansard. Leave granted. The (lmendments read as follows(1) Clause 14, page 7, proposed subsection 16B (1), line 22, after ""subsections (6),"" insert ""(6A),"". (2) Clause 14, page 8, proposed section 16B, after subsection (6) insert the following subsection: ""[Exemption-professional discretion] '(6A) Subsection (1) does not apply if the providing practitioner was a medical practitioner: (a) who determined that the service was necessary; (b) who used professional judgment to determine that to render the service was within his or her expertise; and (c) whose patient the person was.' "".",99
170,Dr BOB WOODS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"We call upon the Australian Democrats to support this move in the Senate. The other factor in this legislation which we particularly support is de registered doctors not being allowed to receive Medicare benefits for practising in other States. If a doctor is deregistered in one State, it is obviously entirely inappropriate for him to be able to move to another State, to continue practising and, indeed, to continue to be reimbursed by the Government. Indeed, we support the Government's move to close up this loophole. It relates to one or out two particular doctors who have abused the system, but it is a loophole which needs to be closed. Indeed, apart from the amendments which I have circulated, we support the Government's initiatives in this matter.",101
171,Ms MCHUGH,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I am terribly pleased to be able to speak on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), even if it is only. for a minute or so now. I may resume my comments later. I am pleased because this is something for all Australians to be proud of. It is another example of the Government taking up that consultative process which it now uses so well to find out what consumers and potential consumers want in the nursing home and hostel area and to come up with what they have, in fact, asked the Government for. I am someone who knows nursing homes very well indeed. I go to them all the time to visit old friends. The ones in my electorate are particularly good. We have seen enormous improvements over the years since Australians really started to get concerned about what was happening in nursing homes. In some of them, we now know that there is really top care. Certainly, that is the case in the nursing homes in my electorate.",102
172,Unknown,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,102
173,Ms MCHUGH,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"As I was saying before the break, nursing homes are places with which all of us, especially someone like me who spends so much time in nursing homes seeing very many old friends, are very familiar. Many improvements have taken place over the years. In my electorate we are lucky because the quality of care is so good. There is none better than that provided by the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have the largest nursing home in my electorate and who have played a very prominent role in recent times in looking at this legislation. Not all nursing homes throughout Australia and not all nursing homes in recent years have provided that sort of care. In the best of all possible worlds they would all be as good as the nursing homes I know well and they would all follow the very high standards, not challenged by this Government and certainly praised by me, set by the Little Sisters of the Poor. A charter of rights should not be needed; there should be no need for such a thing for residents of nursing homes and hostels. There should be no need for an agreement between proprietors and nursing home residents designed to ensure that residents' rights are fully protected in the best possible world where top quality care was just assured for everyone. As honourable members know, this is not the case and it is a world in which older people in our community are sometimes misused, sometimes mistreated emotionally and physically imd sometimes are injured or put at risk as a result of that mistreatment. That is what this legislation is all about. It is about standards. Who are the residents of nursing homes and hostels? They are individual old people who have a right to expect quality care. They are human beings who should retain all the rights they had before they entered the nursing home or hostel. They are people who need additional protection of their rights because they are dependent to a very large extent on proprietors and managers of nursing homes and hostels for all aspects of their daily care and overall quality of their lives. This is what they have asked for during that very long period of consultation over recent years, not the last few weeks. In the paper 'I'm still an individual' these people said that most of all they were concerned about the sort of information they received both in terms of the availability of services which they would have if they were in the community and in terms of what to expect when they entered their nursing home or hostel. What they needed above all was choice. They wanted their life in a hostel to be like life in their home. They had many positive things to say about their nursing home or hostel, but there were many serious limits to their freedom. They were worried about their loss of independence. They were worried about privacy and things like the quality and type of food. They were worried about receiving dignity and respect as individuals. Above all, they wanted to be involved in decision making, but they felt they had little control over their own lives in nursing homes or that there was the possibility of losing that control. Dignity and respect, personal privacy, freedom of speech, the ability to maintain that control over personal things like finance and decisions are some of the fundamental principles underpinning the charter and the agreement and that is why it is needed. We can see that the agreement and the charter do not confer upon residents of nursing homes and hostels any additional rights which are not enjoyed, or even not taken for granted, by every other member of society. That is what we have to ensure for residents in nursing homes. That is a principle that all Australians would agree with. The Government is calling upon all in this House to demonstrate their outrage at the fact that it is still not assured every nursing home. We have to show that we want a better, more secure future for all Australians, otherwise unless we bring in something like this charter, we will be succumbing again. to the easy option of doing nothing to improve the status of older Australians. That is an option which is no longer acceptable to those of us who care for vulnerable older Australians.",102
174,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"in reply-I wish to table a supplementary explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I would like to close this debate by showing my appreciation to a number of people, including the people who have spoken in the House-in particular, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh)-and thank them for their commitment and their contributions to this debate. I would like to make a couple of points very quickly, because we do not have much time left. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) made a couple of comments in relation to what he claimed was the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations. I was at that meeting. I will check the Hansard to be sure of what he said, but the commitments that he said the Prime Minister made were not of the nature of what was said in that room. The Prime Minister promised to look at those issues that were raised, and that has been done. We will continue to deal with the issue of hostel recurrent funding. A review of that is currently under way. As far as the care aggregated module (CAM) review is concerned, I make the point that in 1988 the Government raised the resource level from an average of 17.1 hours per resident per week to 18. It had gone to 18.8. In the Budget the Government felt for a number of reasons that it was necessary to bring it back to 18.6. It did not pre-empt the CAM review, because the· terms of the review did not take into consideration· resource allocations of hours. There are a number of issues that in have been responded to already out of that CAM review, which members will be aware of and there will be more that we will consider again in the Budget context. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) compared the issue of freedom of choice for residents in nursing homes with that of patients in public hospitals, who do not' have that same opportunity to choose their own doctor or to take their own doctor with them into a public hospital. The basic point is that a hospital is a hospital and a nursing home is a nursing home. They are not the same, although there are medical procedures that often occur in both. Hospital care is usually of an episodic nature. A nursing home is an extension of that person's ordinary home in the suburbs. I would hope that in this day and age we could begin to give up the medical model of patients in nursing homes and consider them as residents. I think that would solve a lot of the problems that some people have in their minds. I would like to take the final couple of minutes to thank a number of people. What we have in this charter of rights and responsibilities of people in nursing homes and hostels, and in the agreement, is, as far as we have been able to ascertain, a first in the world, that is, as the honourable member for Moreton pointed out, for the first time a government has sought to enshrine in legislation the protection of the rights of people who live in nursing homes and hostels in this way. That is something of which all members of this House can be proud. I particularly pay respect to you, Mr Speaker, because of the role that you played as chair of the parliamentary committee in times past in bringing these issues so clearly and forcefully out into the public by using the Parliament in this way. Much has come from that. I also thank honourable members on the other side of the House who were involved in that. We have come a long way in a short space of time to deal with these issues. I pay particular tribute tonight to Chris Ronalds, the person who, with extensive consultation right around Australia, put together the paper that the honourable member for Phillip quoted from, 'I'm still an individual'. After a further national tour of consultation she also put together the final report from which the charter and agreement and many of the principles were then taken. Throughout the most extensive consultation in this area in Australia's history I pay tribute to the Australian Nursing Homes Association, the. Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations, the Australian Nurses Federation, the Hospital Employees Federation, people in the consumer organisations, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation and many others. Most particularly, the residents have participated. The impetus has come from the ground, from the people who live in nursing homes. It is perhaps not usually done but I would also like to thank the people in my office for the incredible work that they have done. I know it is not protocol to thank departmental people but without them this work would not have been possible. I commend this Bill to the House and I am sure that people will learn to respect the value of it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

As I mentioned during the second reading debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), I bring these amendments forward for the sake of consistency. The amendments that we are lodging with this Bill are exactly the same as those contained in our notice of motion. We have noticed that the charter that was laid on the table by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) 15 or 16 sitting days ago was not the same as the one that was in the agreement. I bring forward these amendments again with the hope that when this Bill is eventually passed through the Senate-and I field that through here-it will be consistent with the amendments that might take place in the Senate tomorrow. I stress that because if there is any deviation we believe that the whole exercise will be null and void. We are doing this really to do the Government's business. In actual· fact there is already a difference between that Bill and the charter here. We do not expect results but we are doing it for the principle of the thing and I reiterate that unless we are very careful with this procedure the work of the last 18 months will be down the drain.

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 November, on motion by Mr Humphreys: That the Bill be now read a second time.",105
177,Mr TIM FISCHER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (8.16)It is an absolute delight to address the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and discuss it in some detail in the time available under the guillotine. This is one of almost 40 Bills being rammed. through the House of Representatives during this sausage machine legislative week. It certainly creates enormous difficulties and pressures on honourable members to come to terms with complex legislation, let alone with last minute amendments which have been brought forward by the Government. Some five of these which have been circulated will be inserted regardless of the application of the guillotine under the Standing Orders and not necessarily with debate. The Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill relates particularly to measures flowing from the Budget and the Opposition will not oppose it-indeed, the Opposition will support the legislation-but will seek, subject to the guillotine, to move an amendment to clause 54 as follows: Page 29, clause 54, after proposed subsection 50C (2) insert the following subsection: "" '(2A) The reference in subsections (1) to $2,000 are, in the case of a married person, to be read as references to $1,500.'''. This too is a last minute amendment arising in part out of the guillotine process. It will be pursued in more detail in the Senate by my colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman, the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs. The Opposition is not opposed to the fundamentals of this legislation, which comes to the House in the seventy-fifth anniversary year of Gallipoli. Whilst there was a special motion in the House in the autumn session, there is a continuing and lingering positive impact from the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli. It was certainly a privilege to attend at Gallipoli, along with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and, more particularly, the 57 World War I veterans who went back to Gallipoli for that very successful pilgrimage. I reiterate my congratulations to the Minister, the departmental team led by Ed Attridge, and others associated with that magnificent commemoration. I hope that an excellent report from our deputation of parliamentarians will be acted on and picked up in due process, particularly by the Australian Embassy in Turkey, in relation to the need to make some effort, particularly with Lone Pine, each ANZAC Day. Having had that tremendous commemoration this year, it would be a pity for the Lone Pine commemoration to revert back to only a dawn service given the number of Australians who find them-elves at Gallipoli each and every year. I pass that on to the Minister in the context of this Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. That idea-an idea brought to the Minister unanimously by the bipartisan report of that parliamentary delegation-might further be examined. Mr Humphreys-I would like to say· thanks very much to you too for your support.",107
178,Mr TIM FISCHER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I thank the Minister. Turning to more serious mattersand (2) and that was a serious matter, too-in this year 1990, in this first year of a new decade, there is bitter disappointment that, buried in this Bill, the Parliament is in fact once again having to extend an area for eligibility for repatriation, eligibility for veterans' entitlements, because of operational activity by the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy in the Middle East. I alert honourable members to page 44 of this Bill which adds to the other provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in the following terms: ""10. The area comprising the following countries and sea areas: (i) Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Island of Cyprus; (ii) the sea areas contained within the Gulf of Suez, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; (iii) the sea area contained within the Arabian Sea north of the boundary formed by joining each of the following points to the next: They are listed as (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E). The legislation continues: (iv) the sea area contained within the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea east of 30 degrees E. I highlight to the House how serious that Middle East commitment is. Here again, in 1990, the Parliament is enacting legislation. At a time when everybody thought veterans' affairs would be in decline, that there would be no further need for veterans' entitlements to be extended to new areas, and the expectation was for a very sharp decline in the role and activities of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Repatriation Commission, here is a Bill before the House tonight which adds a whole raft of operational areas where Australian sailors and soldiers are located at this time, as we speak. I raise two points in relation to this matter. Firstly, the Island of Cyprus, as far as I am aware, is a great deal to the west of the operational area involving our ships. I understand that there is one Australian liaison officer on the Island of Cyprus who it was felt needed to be picked up by adding the Island of Cyprus to the other groupings of countries in the Gulf area. Secondly, there is a notable omission, because on the other side of the Gulf is Iran and it may be that some of our sailors, at short notice, because of some other circumstance, may yet have to go ashore there. I seek from the Minister an assurance thatwhere ships are briefly technically outside the defined area of this legislation and where some incident might occur outside that area-even if someone breaks a leg on the slippery deck of a ship or whatever-by the deeming provisions of this legislation, those service personnel would still continue to be covered. I understand that that may well be the position, but I seek confirmation from the Minister in regard to that particular aspect of the inclusion of Iran and the inclusion of the Island of Cyprus. I think the Parliament is entitled to know just why those aspects have been so dealt with in regard to page 44 of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. . Turning to other specific aspects of the Bill, the House earlier today discussed the defence service home loans legislation. I will not dwell on that again, except to say we are t!ot opposed to those moves or to the portability being granted. It is a policy steal from the coalition. I was proud to be shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs for 4112 years and to be involved in debating these points with good people, including my friend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in conference after conference. Mr Taylor-A great shadow Minister.",108
179,Mr TIM FISCHER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member for Groom for his comment. It was our printed policy in the last election. I am delighted that the Government has accepted this magnificent idea from the coalition. It is a logical extension of the defence service home loans situation. I might add that it also reflects the great mobility of the armed forces, and, more particularly, of ex-service personnel. Even with the economic difficulties we face, Australia in the 1990s is a much more mobile place. Members of the population think nothing of travelling great distances for a weekend, from one place to another. More particularly, they think nothing of living in four or five locations in the course of a 1O-year period-more so, the retired category of the population and those who have served in the armed forces. This provision allows them to pick up the balance of their loan and move from such places as the coast and elsewhere to the magnificence of places like Albury, Deniliquin, Boree Creek and other locations in the electorate of Farrer. I know that you, Mr Speaker, would understand that people would want to move from his electorate to experience the fresh country air along the Murray,) Mr Speaker, I commend to you the border belt because it is growing in terms of tourism, recreation non- and retirement population-the club belt way, the border belt way, from Albury to Wentworth. It is a sensible provision, and it is one that the Opposition welcomes. The extension of the war widows' pension to veterans receiving extreme disablement adjustment, again, is a logical extension, along with the indexation of allowances for certain disabled veterans. The legislation also contains deeming provisions. I want to emphasise one point: we were taunted today by a Treasurer who was in danger of losing his sanity, I thought, at times, about the fact that we had taken a very sensible decision on another matter which is beyond the scope of this Bill. I want to see Government members go out to Emerald and Tamworth-into provincial Australiaand face, eyeball to eyeball, those people who are suffering so greatly at the moment, who have zero income and who would have been denied the family allowance in respect of their circumstances. The deeming provisions in this legislation are equally controversial. They are patterned on the social security legislation and extend into this veterans' affairs area. I simply say that we have played a very responsible, non-mischievous and. correct role with regard to that matter. If the Treasurer (Mr Keating) wanted any credibility, he ought to have given us· credit for that. In fact, he ought to have followed the example of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The Minister for Resources actually got it right. He sent a circular to all Labor members saying that, with regard to fuel pricing and the windfall arising from the Middle East situation, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia were absolutely correct. Government members ought to be made aware of that. So our credibility on that particular matter was recognised by the Minister for Resources. Our credibility on the deeming provisions is equally important and stands for all to see. It would have put balance into the Treasurer's irrational arguments today. The matter of pharmaceuticals is also raised. In a related context, I point out to the Minister that there are many country towns with just one pharmacy. They have a particular difficulty associated with icing their veteran clientele. Some of them are going to be required to pay a levy associated with the rationalisation of pharmacies. Clearly, if a town is a one pharmacy town in the first place, there is no rationale for it to be afflicted with that levy. I believe that is a matter which the relevant Minister has undertaken to look at. It is worthy of him that he has undertaken to examine that relevant matter. The legislation also deals with rent assistant thresholds, finalisation of applications to the Veterans' Review Board, the indexation of the income test free area, and Gulf personnel. I have already referred to the Gulf personnel. This legislation deals with their allotment for duty period, and operational service and qualifying service. I signify to the Minister and his advisers that that matter will also be pursued in more detail in the Senate, when we will have more time and information available.to see what are the true ramifications and impact of that measure. As I said, on an overall basis, the Liberal and National parties support the Veterans Affairs' Legislation Amendment Bill. I remind the House of the quote by the former Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, who said, 'Upon this Parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right shall be done for those who served their country in time of war'. My colleagues and I reiterate that in the context of seeing, in reality, that they are looked after as they deserve to be and that the extended families associated with veterans are also looked after. I signal again our amendment to one particular category relating to clause 54, a copy of which has been made available. I note the Government's late amendments to the legislation which I understand mirror other amendments in the Veterans' Affairs legislation. Again, these will be examined in more detail in the Senate.",109
180,Mr LES SCOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is interesting to follow the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). He was almost gloating about the way in which honourable members opposite rolled the Leader of the Opposiservtion (Dr Hewson) in the party room yesterday. It was quite amazing how he linked that to the plight of the veterans in his speech tonight - It was amazing, was it not? When we speak in this place on veterans, it is always important. I am always very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on legislation which, amongst other things, recognises the rights of war widows in particular. Last Saturday night I had the opportunity to attend the annual reunion of the Goodna Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) sub-branch in my electorate. This is relevant to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, of course, because I am going to talk about the war widows. That particular sub-branch always extends an invitation to the war widows to come along to their annual reunion. This year in particular was the best attended reunion for many years. There were more than 100 people there. Last year there were only about 60 or 70, I believe. The sub-branch always recognises and remembers the war and veterans' widows and invites them all along. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) probably knows the gentlething man to whom I am going to refer. But there are always many guests at these functions and the president of the Colmslie RSL sub-branch, a chap called Ernie Adsett-who I am sure is well known to the Minister-actually spoke-Mr Humphreys-Yes, I know him well.",110
181,Mr LES SCOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Yes, the Minister would know Ernie well-good fellow, good credentials. Anyway, Ernie responded behalf of the guests there and he paid particular tribute to the fact that the sub-branch at Goodna had acknowledged the widows and the veterans' widows particular, and invited them along to functions. Of course, Ernie is take that on board when he goes back to his own RSL sub-branch and he will invite them to future functions. I thought that was quite an important thing for him to do. There is always a lesson for us and I commend the Goodna RSL for its great work in recognising all veterans in particular, the widows in this caseportfolio and I know Ernie does as well. This legislation contains amendments olitionbenefits to a number of Acts currently providing a start ofwas benefits to veterans-these being the VetThis waiting certainly erans' Entitlements Act 1986; the Defence Service Homes Act 1918; the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940; ing the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs House, Legislation Amendment Act (No 4) 1989; that actually and the Public Service Act 1922. The legislation will ensure that the efits veterans already receive from these Acts are extended even further in line with commitments made by the Hawke ing Government earlier this year. These provements demonstrate the Government's recognition of the contribution made by the men and women of Australia's defence forces and that these people should be justly rewarded for their efforts. It is an issue of quality of life and the and just right to such an entitlement. Evidence of the Government's ability to adapt to the changing needs of an agewidow's ing veteran population is in the provision of this Bill which will extend portability of defence service home lQans to those loans commenced prior to 9 December 1987. It is estimated this will benefit 140,000 loan holders. An associated amendment also brings to an end the possibility of eligible sons losing their benefits through the transfer of a loan to an ineligible person. Fitting in with the more diverse needs of veterans in retirement, with an increasing number of veterans wanting to move into retirement homes in preference to conventional housing, is the provision to exon tend the defence service home loans scheme to cover entry into retirement vilRSL lages-a very important area. Such moves are fitting of the contribution given to in Australia by the men and women of our its defence forces that they have access to going to dignity in retirement. This quality of life ethos is also evident in other initiatives introduced by the Government over recent years. To put the all, current proposals in perspective, these should be noted. The sale of the Defence and, Service Homes Corporation mortgage to the Westpac Banking Corporation in 1988 helped to deliver more to veterans-in particular, the abthe 10-month waiting period for a great initiative. period cost many veterans several thousand dollars in bridging finance. From my own experience of workin a bank prior to coming to this I certainly saw many cases where happened. The sale also gave veterans access to top-up finance, beyond benthe defence service home loan of $25,000, within one first mortgage. More than 400,000 people have been granted housassistance through the defence service imhome loan scheme since its inception. This legislation builds on these initiatives in a number of areas: the provisions relating to the eligibility of pensions for widows of veterans. To date, widows. of fair veterans who were entitled to receive disability pensions increased by the 'extreme disability adjustment' have not been entitled to the automatic grant of a war pension on the death of the veteran. Provisions contained in the Bill would extend automatic eligibility for widow's pension and related benefits, including treatment and pensions for desome pendants to the widows and dependants of deceased veterans who were receiving or were entitled to receive 'extreme disaperbility adjustment' prior to their death. Recognition of the unique needs of the members of Australia's veteran community are evident in other provisions such as those relating to the payment of recreation transport allowance. Section 104 of the principal Act provides for the. payment of an allowance to veterans to assist them in travelling for recreation where war-caused disabilities adversely affect their power of locomotion. As was highlighted by various members when speaking on defence related Bills earlier today, veterans and the current members of our defence forces are also members of the community at large, and this is a point not forgotten by the Government. There are many benefits which flow equally to veterans as to other pensioners via the Hawke Government's retirement incomes policy .. There is the earnings credit scheme whereby veterans are entitled to an 'earnings credit' to allow them to undertake paid employment on a short term or intermittent basis without affecting pension or entitlement to fringe benefits. This vision is being further expanded in this legislation to allow more effective utilisacertainly tion and application of the earnings credit provisions by enabling married service pensioners to effectively combine their earnings credit to $1,000 each. This would enable one of the married couple who is working to utilise the unused portion of the spouse's credit. So as not to give some veterans an unfair advantage over less financially well-off veterans, the revised earnings credit provisions would preclude those people whose service pension is assessed under the assets test provisions and who receive an additional pension for a child. Another element flowing from the Government's retirement incomes policy is that relating to automatic indexation of the income test 'free area'. Among other things, this section, 198B of the principal Act, provides that the annual amount of income that can be received before service pension is reduced is to be rounded to the nearest dollar. Clause 89 would provide for this amount now to be rounded to the nearest $26 for ease of administration and to enable clearer service to veterans themselves. To bring veterans into line with other pensioners, a similar amendment is being made to the Social Security Act 1947. As I mentioned earlier when I visited the annual reunion dinner of the Goodna RSL Sub-Branch in my electorate of Oxley, I am proud to stand up for these and, in fact, all veterans and war widows in my electorate and I am pleased to see them truly recognised for their part in making Australians the proud race that we are today.",111
182,Mr BRADFORD,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"MCPherson) (8.38)The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, as has already been said by speakers on both sides of the House, has a number of commendable features which the Opposition fully supports. One could observe, I suppose, that many of the changes that are being implemented here have not occurred before time. As has already been said, for some time there has been an inconsistency in the nonportability of defence service home loans protaken out prior to 9 December 1987. The correction of this particular problem will be welcomed by the 140,000 eligible borrowers. Defence service homes have been particularly helpful to many returned servicemen over the years and, in these days of high interest rates, the accessibility to a $25,000 loan at substantially below mar-_ ket interest rates is in fact very attractive. In my own experience, the defence service home loan that we got was a definite factor in my being able to afford the home we now live in and, indeed, the previous one from which we transferred our defence service home loan-a loan that had been taken out after 9 December 1987. It is also pleasing to see that this Bill make defence service home loans available to assist in meeting the cost of entry charges for retirement villages. There remain, I would expect, a significant number of returned service personnel who, up until now, have not been able to take advantage of or gain access to a defence service home loan, and they may well now be able to do so for the purposes of entering a retirement village, whereas before they were, for one reason or another, unable to purchase a home. I see that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table, has been agreeing with me up to now. He may shake his head the other way when I say that there is a sense in which this Government stops short of a real commitment to veterans' affairs. I have found in my short time in Parliament that many aged veterans are involved in constant confrontation with the Department of Veterans' Affairs about what they honestly believe to be their entitlements. It seems to me, for instance, that the Veterans Review Board could be a lot fairer in some of its determinations by giving the benefit of any doubt to the veteran. I point to the recent fiasco over the lifestyle questionnaire as an example of the Government's big brother approach towards our ex-service men and women. It was very intrusive and proved to be a totally inaccurate measure of the far-reaching consequences of mental and physical injuries suffered as a result of active service. I am pleased that it is not being continued with any longer. The Opposition in government will consult fully with veterans' organisations before making any significant changes to the repatriation system. It is evident to most people that those who have served their country on active service are very special people indeed. Anyone who has seen active service will know what a price it is to pay-and for many, perhaps the fortunate ones in some respects, the ultimate price. I recall that my own late father gave up four years in the prime of his life to serve originally with the 6th Division of the 2nd AIF in the Middle East. He served in Greece, Syria and Crete, amongst other places, and it is somewhat ironic, in a way, that once again Australians are on active service in that region. I also observe that my father ultimately died from war-induced illness. As a Vietnam veteran, I was privileged to witness at first hand Australian servicewait. men in action, althougb I hasten to add that it was from the relatively safe haven of Vung Tau. Nevertheless, I learned-and I am sure that many Australians would be extremely proud-of the way in which Australians acquitted themselves in South Vietnam. I am very pleased to recognise that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) served there on our side, as did the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), who is not currently in the House. The servicemen who served in Vietnam did so in the very best traditions of ANZAC; yet many Vietnam veterans still bear the scars of their experience there, and many will do so until they die-and many are dying prematurely. I recounted in Parliament some months ago the suicide death of a Vietnam veteran in my electorate who had suffered extensi vely for many years. I believe that many Vietnam veterans are still suffering. Positive counselling for veterans and their families, compensation for injuries suffered as a result of serving in the Vietnam war and the recognition of the effects of chemical exposure are vital to help those who served our nation in Vietnam and still suffer the consequences. I am pleased that the Opposition is wholeheartedly committed to veterans' affairs. It is one area of policy which I believe is very important, and I am pleased that we have a very strong commitment to it. I mentioned earlier the Australian service personnel who are presently in the Gulf. The Opposition has strongly supported the Government's decision to commit troops to the Gulf. Here again, as in the two world wars and in Korea and Vietnam, Australia holds its head high on the world stage by demonstrating our willingness as a country to play an acti ve role in support of our allies and in the defence of what we judge to be right. The Gulf personnel are playing a vital role. We can be very proud of them. The world has been united in its condemnation of Sad dam Hussein's invasion of KuThe United States must be supported in its attempts to right the wrong. It may well be that our servicemen in the Gulf will experience combat. If they do, it will be in the knowledge that they are fighting not only to restore Kuwait as a sovereign nation, but also to set back the designs of a man whom President Bush has quite appropriately compared to Hitler. Civilised people deplore Sad dam Hussein's use of chemical weapons in his war with Iran and even against his own people. His renewed threat to again use chemical weapons is disgusting, and it may well be that our forces there will have to defend themselves against such attacks. One can only contemplate the awful consequences of what Saddam Hussein would do if he had an arsenal of nuclear weapons. I am pleased that the Government has taken steps to extend full repatriation benefits to members of the Defence Force allotted to service in the Gulf, including of course immediate access to defence service home loans. There remains some confusion-and I hope that the Minister in reply will clear up that confusion-in respect of the definition of 'hazardous service'. A couple of other matters also concern me about the legislation. For instance, a number of operational areas have had their commencing and closing dates altered. One of these, of course, is Vietnam. This change is retrospective back to· 1986, and it is not dear to me at least how many veterans will be disadvantaged by that change. Finally, I emphasise again that, for me and certainly my colleagues who have returned from active service, veterans' affairs is a most important area. I am very proud that we on this side have a very strong commitment to the ongoing welfare of veterans in this country. In my view, it is vital that a modern Department of Veterans' Affairs be maintained.",112
183,Mr MARTIN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is with pleasure that tonight I join colleagues on both sides of the House in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, which of course goes to a very important issue for our community-and that is the protection of veterans. I have to say, of course, that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table, well knows the requirements of the veterans community and, in particular, it is very pleasing to see the extension of the automatic grant of war widows' pensions and benefits to widows and dependants of veterans receiving extreme disability adjustment. As honourable members on this side of the House certainly know, he can speak from experience, as I understand that his mother is in fact a war widow. To that extent, I think it is most important that somebody in the Government does have the ability to relate to the sorts of issues which are of concern to the veterans community. I, too, am pleased with the commitment contained in this legislation in respect of our servicemen who are presently engaged in Middle East conflict. I find myself endorsing the comments of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) in respect of the need to look at that specific issue in a positive way. From time to time in the evening I watch news reports and see the efforts and announcements of people who had been members of this place and the Senate and who decided to go on some media junket, media splash, to different parts of the world to try to sort out difficulties, when perhaps they might best serve the needs of Australia and those people over there by staying at home. I find the comments that the honourable member for MCPherson made about our personnel over there to be quite appropriate. However, I just clarify one or two points. Of course, it is not just the Americans who are being supported by the Australian action. Too often, I think, people hold up that it is the Americans leading the charge when in fact there are many other nations involved in the action there. I do not think that we should ever forget that. We are part of a United Nations inspired action. It is not something inspired out of the White House but by the United Nations-and I fully support the actions of our Government in participating in the way that we are. With regard to some of the comments that have been made, particularly the final comment made by the honourable member for MCPherson, I hope that the commitment that he has expressed tonight stays with him during his term as a member of this Parliament of Australia. It is an unfortunate circumstance that, for quite some length of time-and I am still not sure whether it is still the policy of the coalition-the Department of Veterans' Affairs was in fact to be merged with the Department of Social Security. In view of the stance of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on how social security should be administered in the future, if the Opposition is ever elected to government, I wonder whether veterans are aware of what that would mean to them. On the whole, the provision in the legislation of payment for pharmaceutical allowances and so on goes to the very needs of the veterans community. They should not be frightened by some of the nonsense that occasionally gets peddled in the community, particularly by some pharmacists, as to what the consequences of this legislation would mean to them. I certainly commend the legislation to the Parliament.",114

We must never forget them whilst ever they are there, and whilst those other adopted. Australians are being held against their will in Iraq or Kuwait.

I think the question is relevant, not only to this legislation to other legislation discussed earlier in the evening. I raise specifically the question in relation to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill which we debated earlier.

190,Mr HUMPHREYS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"in reply-Firstly, I would like to thank all those honourable members and the Leader but of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) for their contribution to this legislation. I thank them fot supporting it. I must point out to the honourable member for Groom that his question should be correctly answered by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), and I will pass that on to him so that he may answer it. The Leader of the National Party did ask some specific questions. I would like to say that Cyprus is within the operational area as designated by the Department of Defence, and of course incorporates the whole of the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. Iran is not within the operational area and those outside and en route to the operational area are covered by full benefits under the islation. Should operational areas in the Middle East extend beyond the current area defined as operational, the Act would be amended to extend the operational area accordingly. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) asked some specific quesI tions. I will answer those questions in detail in writing for him so as to allay fears. I also thank the honourable memmotion ber for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) for their contributions. It is great to see that they support the veterans' community. I know the honourable member for MCPherson is a Vietnam veteran who genuinely wishes to ensure that we mainsition tain the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I am sure those officers working in Department of Veterans' Affairs would support him, and I also would like to just thank them for their hard work in bringing this legislation before the Parliament. The honourable member should talk to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) debate that. in relation to what he is saying and in relation to what we should and should not be doing. We should find out whether the Leader of the National Party and Leader of the Liberal Party agree with what should happen to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I know that he will port those points of view. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.

191,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise tonight on behalf of the Opposition to respond to the quite wide ranging amendments that have been placed before the House by the Government and in doing so I represent specific shadow Ministers-the honourable member for leg- Wannon (Mr Hawker); the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney); the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A Brown); and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), all of whom have some interest in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. They all thought it was a terribly good idea that actually represent them here tonight and make the speech. So I will do so, and as his a result of the Government's guillotine that was carried in the House earlier this week, the comments that I will make will be fairly brief in order to get on with the rest of the business of the House and to give other honourable members who follow tonight a chance to have their say as well. I commence by saying that the Oppowill not oppose the amendments put by the Government. However, I forethe shadow one amendment we will move tonight. I understand that it was circulated after dinner and it relates to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. I will deal with that further in the committee stage of the debate, given that we do have time to The legislation deals with a range of issues affecting some areas such as the Air Navigation Act. Most of the matters relatthe ing to the Air Navigation Act are very minor or procedural. For example, one aspect of the Air Navigation Act which is supbeing amended will change the way air accident investigations are carried out. Another change to the Air Navigation (Charges) Act will see differences in the way penalties for people who do not pay their accounts are implemented so that people are encouraged to pay their accounts to the Commonwealth more readily. The Civil Aviation Act will also be amended to basically better define what an aircraft is. There are some environmental protection aspects to the amendments to the Civil Aviation Act. The aviation industry will have to bear the cost of environmental protection activities and the Opposition does not oppose Mr Tim Fischer-Will that help get the third runway?",117
192,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"It will not help get the third runway up, and I am glad that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) raised it because this is an issue which is causing a great deal of concern right throughout country Australia, as well as through the tourism industry. It is a great shame that the Government will not go on and build the third runway. I noticed the former Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, getting stuck into the Government only last week, saying that it was lax in its attempts at micro-economic reform because it just would not get on with the job of doing what everybody knows needs to be done-and that is building that third runway. Every day that the Government delays is a day that Australia misses opportunities for its tourism industry and, as a result, loses opportunities for income, job creation and so forth. Act 1987.

Indeed, in November 1982, the former coalition Government made up its mind it would construct the-",118
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION, Order! I hope the honourable member is going to leave the third runway and get back to the contents of the Bill.,118
194,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I only moderately wandered from the Bill. I am glad you reminded me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to get back to the business of the House. Further amendments contained in the legislation relate to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. This will give the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) more discretion in allowing nonstandard motor vehicles to be registered. The Bill also amends items in the Broadcasting Act. It gives the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications, who currently has the power to approve the text of medical advertisements, the power to delegate that function to a medical officer of a State or to the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia or, indeed, to other bodies related to research into medicine. As with the other amendments referred to, the Opposition has no problems with these amendments and, indeed, supports them. There are some minor amendments to the Telecommunications Act relating to the Australian Telecommunications Authority, to which once again we have no particular opposition. Then we come to the area that is of somewhat greater interest to me and that relates to the shipping and the maritime environment. There are a number of changes that flow as a consequence of this Bill that affect that area-there are about four items, I think, off the top of my head. The first one relates to the Navigation Act 1912; the second to the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986; the third to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983; and the fourth to the Ships (Capital Grants) Those areas fall within my shadow portfolio and I might take a few more moments to deal with them specifically. The first area, the Navigation Act 1912, deals with sentences for seafarers. It corrects some anomalies in the legislation. It ensures that seafarers who are affected by alcohol or drugs in the carriage and performance of their duties will be eligible for a sentence of up to one year in prison if they are found guilty of being either under the influence of alcohol or drugs whilst in the carriage of their duties. They will also be subjected to a sentence of up to two years imprisonment if they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs whilst in the performance of their duties and as a result of their reduced performance they cause death, injury or damage to ship or cargo. It is another version of the old song, 'What will we do with the drunken sailor'. It brings a standard of behaviour and discipline to seafarers which would be expected of other people in responsible positions in society, and that reason the Opposition does not oppose this aspect of the legislation. The amendments to the Protection of the Sea Amendment Act of 1986 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 present no problem to the Opposition. Those amendments do a number of things but notably in the first of those two items they implement a user-pays principle for environmental damage caused at sea. The purpose of that is to try to ensure that polluters pay the cost of polluting and we do not oppose that. The shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce, has looked at this aspect of the legislation and is quite happy with it and finds it consistent with the Opposition's policy. So there are no problems there. The Opposition does have a problem, though, in relationto the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This, of course, runs hand in hand with the Government's shipping industry reform program. The Government has engaged in a reform program for the shipping industry, which is designed to bring matters such as Australian manning levels into line with the average Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development levels for manning, and to that end there has been some notable success. Looking at the Government's performance in micro-economic reform of coastal shipping and the waterfront, we find that its greatest area of success has been in shipping. It has had some notable reductions in manning levels from the low thirties towards the low twenties. The Government should be congratulated for that-we must give credit where credit is due because this is a notable change. Much credit should go too to Pat Geragty of the Australian Seamens Union, who I think is one of the most outstanding individuals in the industry at present and will long be remembered for his contribution to these reforms. That really has been good but there are some more areas to tackle. The Government has not been up to scratch in anyone's estimation in the area of coastal shipping and waterfront reforms, even though there have been some for significant gains in coastal shipping. In judging the Government's performance in this area, I draw on the latest Industry Commission Annual Report 1989-90, which was tabled in this House towards the end of last week. I quote from page 92 under the heading, 'Assessment of waterfront and coastal shipping reform'. The Commission says: The pace of change has been set independently of what takes place in the rest of the economy or the rest of the world, It is unlikely that restructuring that is isolated from competitive pressures will yield productivity gains as great as those achievable through exposure of the industries to competition. It goes on to say: . . . the nature and pace of change may not be adequate to address inefficiencies in Australia's coastal shipping. It goes on further to say: Crew to berth issues on Australian ships have yet to be fully investigated . . . the scope for effective competition is difficult to determine given the conditions which apply and absence of price considerations as a criterion for the availability of permits. So, all in all, the Industry Commission is saying that the Government is moving nowhere near fast enough or far enough in its reforms of coastal shipping, which this legislation partly deal- with. Criticisms from the Industry Commission and from people throughout Australian society enforce the fact that we need to go further, whether it is in waterfront reform or coastal shipping reform. The big hurdle that the Government has not been prepared to tackle is the issue of cabotage. Cabotage, as the Industry Commission highlights in previous annual reports, is costing Australia dearly. For example, cabotage on the trans-Tasman route is costing Australia $11 Om per annum. Indeed, the paper that was put forward by the Business Council of Australia to the Economic Planning Advisory Council a year or so ago indicates that reforms from waterfront and coastal ping will net Australia an extra $860m year in extra income. So there is considship erable gain to be had for the Australian econ()my if we have a government that prepared to tackle the hard issues. The removal of cabotage is one of those hard issues. The removal of the union-to-union unofficial bans on foreign flagged vessels that ply the trans-Tasman route between Ausus tralia and New Zealand is something that this Government has done nothing about. It has talked a lot about it but done ing. Earlier this year Labour Ministers from New Zealand were over here when date, closer economic relations (CER) negotiaAustralia tions were being carried out. They were privately very disappointed with the Fedin eral Government's reforms in the transtry. Tasman shipping area. They said that Government had done nothing, although it had made a number of promises, none of which have been fulfilled. We get to that from this Government in Austhe tralia. It makes lots of promises and none. Cabotage must go if we are to have real reform in the Australian shipping industhe try. Cabotage must go on the trans-Tashonourable man route if CER is to work properly. Indeed, if we can get it working-which is what the coalition has committed itself to do-then we will find that the Austraon lian economy will pick up that $860m worth of gains as part of the proper form pfogram for the waterfront and due. . coastal shipping industries. There are many examples of the sorts of inefficiencies that exist as a consequence of cabotage. Ivan Deveson, who now the joint chairman of the Australian Shipping Users Group, highlights in number of his speeches the sorts of costs that are imposed on Australian manufacin turers as a result of cabotage. For examglected ple, he says that to ship a car from decades. Australia to New Zealand is $200 more expensive than to ship the same type car from Japan to New Zealand. We lost wheat trade between Australia and New Zealand a year or so ago simply because of the high costs of shipping between tralia and New Zealand. We lost that sale shipof wheat to New Zealand to Turkey bea cause it was cheaper in the long run to wheat from Turkey to New Zealand than from Australia across the Tasman is some 1,400 miles because of that unofficial ban by the unions on foreign flagged vessels. So the ban must go if we are to see proper reform. I conclude this section of the debate on that note and say that this Bill does give the opportunity to speak, briefly though it may be, on the Government's shipping reforms. Any fair judge of those shipping nothreforms would have to say that, whilst there has been considerable success to there is still a long way to go before will capjtalise on the efficiency and economic gains that can be achieved the Australian coastal shipping indusThey can only be achieved by a govthe ernment that has the determination and the courage to tackle the issues of cabotage and the unofficial ban on the transused Tasman route and to deal with some of other issues that relate to manning on fulfils board Australian flag vessels.",118
195,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to see tonight conciliatory style in which the member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) is approaching the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. I do not know what has been going in the Opposition Party room that has led to this revised approach. The honourreable member gave credit where credit is It might be contrary to the populist things that get said around the electorate is when talking about these matters, but at least in here on the public record there is a some recognition of the gains that this Government has been able to bring about areas that have been either sadly neor unable to be tackled for some I do not want to go through the range of Of the legislation again. This was very adequately covered in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). But I Auswould like to add some comments of my own about a few of the matters that are incorporated in this legislation. Although it might seem a bit out of context in a debate on shipping and aviation, I want to refer to the am-ndments that provide for a delegation of power under the Broadcasting Act to enable the Department of Community Services and Health to look at the text of medicine advertisements. For some time it has been .evident to many of us on the Government side of the House that part of the reason for the almost Pavlovian instinct of Australians to race down to the doctor and get themselves a prescription for a dose of medicine for any problem is, among other things, the enormous emphasis that manufacturers place on the medicine solution to any health problem. I have observed that there has been a lot of discussion about some self-regulation and self-discipline in this area. This coincides with approaches taken by the Government to cause some rethinking of this. I notice that an inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs· is tackling the question of how one changes community attitudes to the taking of medicine. While that may seem a bit far ranging from the legislation before the House, amendments have been incorporated in. the Bill to allow the Department of Community Services and Health and the various people who are involved in looking at these standards to have a look at the advertising in this field. I that is a very worthy incorporation. It is a change that perhaps we all ought to talk more about. I would also like to refer to the Government's response to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft NoiseHORSCAN, as it is commonly known. I was a member of that Committee when I first joined this Parliament and I spent three years involved in what I consider was some of the most productive and worthwhile work that I have done. We certainly learnt a lot about the way aircraft, airports and their operations could be modified not only to be much more efficient by using many new techniques but also to be much more sensitive to the question of noise in the environments around them. To that extent, a lot of credit is due also to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), which was established during the second term of the Hawke Government-it may have flowed over into early in the third term. Operational control of airports was delegated to the FAC from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In the process, one of the things that was written into the legislation was the requirement for the F AC to be much more sensitive to the community needs of people living around airports. That led to the formation of the Australian Mayoral Aviation Committee (AMAC), the local government authorities body which represents the councils that are neighbours to airports. The Select Committee did a lot of work with those groups. It did a lot of work with the operators and the managers of the airports, and it made a number. of recommendations, which the Government has now agreed to, about the way that these flight operations should be managed with a sensitive eye to people who live around airports. I think these amendments to incorporate a recognition that there is a need for environmental protection are a major step forward. They are not by any means something that anyone should shy away from. I notice that the honourable memthink ber for Fadden (Mr Jull) is in the House tonight. Not long ago I undertook a study of a number of international airports in order to look at a few of these matters. He recommended that I should visit Manchester Airport. I took his advice and met with the management of Manchester Airport. He will be interested to know that the very day that I was there management was negotiating an agreement with the local environment committee about changes it would make in the operation of the airport in return for community agreement to additional night flights. It was actually a negotiated agreement between the airport and the community. There were a number of tradeoffs and everybody was happy with that arrangement. It has certainly opened eyes as to the ways in which we, helped by a more sensitive approach by airport management, could achieve a number these operational objectives without essarily bringing great community protest about environmental measures. I thank the honourable member for having sugnology, gested . that I visit Manchester, among other places. I also noticed that in his contribution the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) could not resist one little wander back to the shipping industry. fine. I acknowledge with gratitude his acknowledgment of the gains that have been made in the Government's shipping form agenda. At the same time, obposition viously, it is an article of faith out there among the faithful of the National of Australia. The honourable member cannot quite get up in here and say it so he had to make his contribution the trans-Tasman operation, cabotage other things. But what is never acknowledged, talked about or admitted by the Opposition is the fact that when these arrangements about staffing on the waterfront-we it staffing; it is no longer mantralia . power-were made by the owners and the shippers, that is, the cartels, for the duction of containerisation on the watervehicles front, the trade off was that no one would lose his job. A lifetime work agreement was actually given to the people working in the industry-not only on ships, but also on the waterfront. That arrangement goes back to 1958. The reason for this was that those involved knew that the productivity gains from containerisation were so high that they could easily absorb the long term cost of the depletion of staff by natural attrition. No-one ever wants to talk about the fact that the cartels actually entered into that agreement for peace on the waterfront and for a trade of containerisloads ation. In the process they accepted cabothat tage as part of the long term agreement. No one says that any industiial agreement is in place for life. Of .coUrse, it is not. But the fact of the matter is, as the expire. my Opposition acknowledged, that many of the initiatives that have taken place in terms of achieving waterfront reforms of have, in fact, come from the unions and necthe union leadership. They have been keen to encourage new entrants into the industry-younger people tuned to new technew ways of management and new ways of operating the waterfront-so that when we have a fleet of modern ships being loaded and unloaded by modern equipment, we also have people working in the wharves who are trained and modThat is ernised in their thinking. Everyone is trying to accelerate the winding down of that very agreement, but rediscussion is always couched by the Opin terms of 'Look at what the Party unions have done to us on the waterfront'. It is never admitted that the carall, tels-the owners and the shippers-were about the ones who in fact encouraged and and agreed to that lifelong agreement about staffing levels on the waterfront. I also want to touch briefly on the point raised by the honourable member for Gilmore about Mr Deveson's comment call on the cost of shipping cars from Austo New Zealand and elsewhere. I agree that what Mr Deveson said is quite introcorrect because it does cost more to ship from Australia than to ship them from Japan to Australia. The honourable member forgot to mention in his little outline that we are talking about bulk contracts and full loads in Japanese ships coming to Australia. Of course the contractors get a bulk deal to cart a Japanese car on a Japanese ship to Australia but when they are back loading, going across the Tasman or elsewhere, they do not give our manufacturers the same price or the same rate to use their ships. It may come to the point where the Australian motor vehicle industry feels that it has a case to buy its own ships or to contract its own but at the moment we are not in position; we are not an exporter of motor vehicles in any great way and we have not yet found-Mr MCGauranYour time is about to",120

198,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, can they negotiate this with you? I am happy to end on that point if they promise me that, the next time they say Mr Deveson complains that it costs $200 more to ship a car from Australia to New Zealand than it does from Japan to Australia, they will tell the whole story. If they promise to do that, I will end at this point and will support the legislation.",123
199,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"1 thank the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) not only for his contribution night but also for his generosity and his goodwill in allowing me to have three minutes on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I also thank him for his kind comments regarding his visit to Manchester. I think the Federal Airports Corporation should take a great deal of notice of the operation of Manchester International Airport. There is real evidence of what happens ·with a privatised airport in operation in a community such as that and the contribution that it can make. The particular aspects of the amendment Bills to which I would like to address my comments tonight obviously revolve around the aviation portfolio. While there are some seven aviation Bills being amended tonight, there is really only that regard. one aspect I would like to pick up in the brief time. I have been allocated. There are, in fact, only minor amendments in most of the other Bills, but the particular Act on which I focus my attention is the Civil Aviation Act 1988. There are a number of clauses in this Bill. I do not think that the Opposition has too many problems with them. However, th- l-Iauses that have caused some concern in the aviation industry are clause 12 and clause 18. . Clause 12 of the Bill, on the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), amends the definition of 'aircraft' for the purpose of dealing with charges or statutory liens. I can understand why that has to be done. However, there is a general feeling within the industry that it is not really getting the deal it wants. Some years ago the industry agreed t9 the then Department of Aviation and subsequently the present Department of Transport and Communications having such power on the understanding that was then given, by the then Secretary to the Department, that such a power to impose aircraft liens would not be used routinely and exercised only as a last resort when all other measures had failed. The industry tells me that it was concerned that this particular assurance. was fairly short lived and the statutory lien was quickly introduced as a standard debt to- recovery measure. The industry would argue that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is a government business enterprise (GBE) and is expected to act as a commercial venture for the Government. I suppose it would have some argument because it would say that it seems rather funny that a GBE has specific powers to impose liens and that particular aspect is not granted to people in the normal commercial world. Indeed, the industry tells me that it would prefer the CAA's debt recovery procedures to be restricted to those normally available to commercial enterprises. The Opposition will not oppose that particular amendment, but I thought it was necessary to bring to the attention of the House the general feeling that exists within the aviation industry in The second clause to which I would like to make a few comments tonight is clause 18. That is the amendment that will enable the Civil Aviation Authority to impose on-the-spot fines for breaches of the Civil Aviation Act as an alternative to prosecution. At the moment it is true that the only way of penalising a breach of regulations is to prosecute, even for relatively minor offences. Under these proposed provisions the maximum penalty would be set at one-fifth of the maximum penalty on prosecution of the offence. It should. be said too that anyone who is prosecuted has the right to go to court. There is a choice: those who are prosecuted can either pay the fine and forget about it and not go through the particular expense of going through a court action or if they feel that they have been hard done by they have the right to resort to the court. However, the industry is, in a sense, in a bit of turmoil about this particular aspect of the Bill, principally because of some of the activities of the inspectors of the Civil Aviation Authority. Once again, we would not oppose this particular measure, but would like to bring to the attention of the. Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and the Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is in the House, the concern that is expressed in some areas of the general aviation industry about what has been going on. Quite frankly, although the Civil Aviation Authority gi ves guarantees that this will be a last resort-I have spoken to a number of its officers who have said ,that is the case-there is a very real cern that, as one of the peak bodies of general aviation has said to me, we risk creating a lot of little Hitlers running around issuing tickets for trivial offences to the annoyance and aggravation of the industry. At a particular airport close to my electorate that starts with 'A' that pect-Mr MCGauran - Don't be coy.",123
200,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"It is Archerfield. It has been brought to my attention time and again that the general line of some of these aviation inspectors is that they will go up to operators of aircraft and say, 'If you do this after the golden days come in, we've got you for an $80 fine'. We know that the civil aviation inspectors have done a sweep through western Queensland. I have had a number of complaints from aircraft operators about some of the tactics that they have used and there will be court proceedings following. Nobody would deny that there are some cowboys in the aviation industry, but they are a very small percentage of the operators. I believe that most general aviation operators are responsible people. I would hope that the Minister would give assurances that the on-the-spot .fine system would be used only in the most extreme cases after counselling had been given and would not be used as a revenue raising measure and that CAA officers and inspectors would not act as cops around the airport trying to lay fines on people who may have breached some minor regulations. As I said, the history in Western Au.stralia and, indeed, Victoria and now in Queensland, of the CAA when it takes on some of these cases has been pathetic. It would be very interesting to find out what the cost has been to the taxpayers of Australia with the number of cases that the CAA has lost. I would hope that the Minister would give the House, and indeed the industry, a general assurance that these on-the-spot fines will not be seen as a method of creating annoyance to an industry which on most occasions is a very responsible one. Apart from those few concerns, the Opposition has no real doubts about the vacon- lidity of the amendments that are being offered in the seven aviation Bills.",124
201,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (9.35)-11 is my happy duty to wind up as- this debate. I would like to thank the Opposition members who spoke for their. contributions. I would also like to thank the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) for his contribution. Without wishing to take odds in an extreme fashcivil ion with the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), I must say that he was a trifle naughty in the introductory remarks to his speech. In particular, I refer to his statements about the third just runway and the issue of micro-economic reform. I say that because I know from his subsequent remarks that he has a contradictory position. In the first instance, he said very clearly that he thought the Government's performance in the area of micro-economic reform left a great deal to be desired. In fact, he said that the Government had been very lax in this area. Later in the course of his contribution, he made it very clear-and I commend him for it-that he praised the Government's performance in the area of shipping reform. The performance in the area of shipping reform is not only a tribute to the dedication of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, but is also, as the honourable member for Gilmore rightly pointed out, a tribute to the work which has been done by the industry itself, in particular the role which has been played by the Seamen's Union of Australia and specifically the role played by Pat Geraghty. It is refreshing to see such a progressive attitude being portrayed by the honourable member for Gilmore in accepting that it is possible to work in a cooperative fashion with the trade union movement and that it has a valid role in working with industry to bring about the reforms which we all see as most necessary for the future of Australia's waterfront and, in this instance, the shipping industry. In relation to the third runway-and I will take only a minute of the House's time on this-I was somewhat concerned and amazed at the statement made by the honourable member for Gilmore, because he knows, as I am sure the House knows, that the Government is committed to the immediate construction of a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, subject to the satisfactory environment impact statement (EIS). He is also aware that it is extremely important in the context of the third runway for the Government to ensure that the public processes are appropriate and adequate and that all people who have an interest in the third runway have an opportunity to examine the EIS and to make appropriate comments about it. He would also be aware that, in that context, the position which has been taken by this Government has been one which ought to be praised by the Opposition. In that process of public information and public access, instead of just allowing one month for comment by the public on the EIS, the Government has taken the view that it is important in this particular instance, because of the nature of the third runway and because of the controversy which has surrounded that project, that we get it right. It is extremely important that those people who have well-founded concerns, in many instances, about the environmental impacts of the third runway are given appropriate opportunities to make comment on the EIS. The honourable member for Gilmore also knows that this Government has a commitment to the development of that third runway, subject to the EIS being satisfactorily accepted. In conclusion, whilst the honourable member for Gilmore made these comments about micro-economic reform and given the fact that, broadly speaking, these amendments relate to the transport industry, he also ought to have been gracious enough to acknowledge the reforms which have been made on the waterfront. He ought also to have been gracious enough to recognise that the best way we can achieve the economies that he is after in relation to trans-Tasman shipping is to vigorously encourage the maritime reform processes which have been put in force by this Government to continue and to come to some conclusion. That will be done with the cooperation of all people in the industry. I seek the support of the honourable member for Gilmore in ensuring that he treats the waterfront and the other areas of his portfolio responsibility in the same objective manner with which he has tonight demonstrated he can treat the shipping industry; and he can see the very positive contrioution which is being made by the trade union movement not only to waterfront reform generally but also to shipping reform.

206,Mr COSTELLO,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"ln years to come people will litigate questions of company law and they will look for holes in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. When the courts come to consider such issues they will look at the speeches that have been made and they will look at the explanatory memorandum to find out what was meant. It is important that when they do so, they def- know the deplorable way in which this legislation was handled. This legislation, which would be one of the most complex pieces of legislation to come before this House, has been allowed a total time for debate of 60 minutes. When those who come to construe what the legislation actually means look for guidance, they will find no guidance in the cursory second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum. I thought I might read the memorandum to try to find out what the Bill meant, and realised I had to read the Bill to find out what the explanatory memorandum meant. There are 300 pages in this Bill, and 60 minutes has been allowed to debate it-about 12 seconds per page. The Opposition, having half that time, has about six seconds per page. This is consistent with the disgraceful conduct of this Parliament, where 39 Bills have been guillotined-a fine tradition continued by the Hawke Government of guillotining legislation in this place. But the history of this legislation has not been as short as the time which has been allowed to debate it. In September 1987 then Attorney-General Bowen announced that there would be a scheme of national companies legislation. It took a year before the package was introduced into the Parliament in May 1988. It took a year for that legislation to be passed in July 1989, and the new system was supposed to be up and running on 1 January 1990. Of course, in February of this year significant parts of the legislation were thrown into doubt as a result of a High Court challenge which declared at least that part of the legislation that related incorporation to be unconstitutional. The Government at first announced it would proceed nonetheless with national legislation, and it took until June 1990 before the Commonwealth finally recognised that it had to negotiate with the States in relation to constitutional legislation. Heads of agreement were signed on 29 June 1990 in Alice Springs. Of course, the next startceedings up date, that of 1 July 1990, had to be postponed, and we now have a third startup date of 1 January 1991. To work properly, not only has this Bill to pass this Parliament but also legislation in very similar form has to pass six State parliaments and the Northern Territory Parliament, and all of that has to be done before 1 January 1991. This Parliament is being asked to pass this legislation only about, a third of the picture. The third of the picture that this Parliament has is the legislation which is before it. Another third of the picture is the legislation to go before State and the Northern Territory parliaments-legislation that was still being finalised on Monday of this week and legislation which we have certainly not seen as part of the progress of this legislation in this place. But the other third of the picture, of course, is the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States which provides the background for the implementat ion of this scheme. That agreement, as I understand it, has not been signed as yet. So what we are doing is putting through legislation in this place, without seeing the State legislation, to implement an agreement which has not been signed. There will be technical problems in relation to this legislation that the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) has not even considered as yet. If there had been significant and proper debate, those matters could have been discussed and necessary amendments could have been moved. For example, one of the provisions of the legislation will be that offences and civil proceedings under the legislation can be taken in any of the several State supreme courts. Of course, in those different State supreme courts there will be different rules and certainly different evidence. to What this will mean is that those who are taking proceedings under corporations law will be able to choose a forum that suits them where the evidence will be conveniently in their favour in relation to the particular problem at hand. To cope with that situation, there is a provision in the Bill which allows proto be transferred from one State supreme court to another and for lawyers involved to follow the action as it is transferred, and they are given rights of appearance in State supreme courts in States where they may not be admitted to practise, as if they were conducting Federal litigation in the Federal Court. But of course the regulation of the legal profession comes under State legislation and it will be very difficult to enforce discipliwith nary procedures against lawyers in those particular cases. As part of the federalising of this particular scheme, Commonwealth bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, will be given rights to enforce the particular law. I do not know whether the Attorney has considered whether further provision will be made for the Australian Federal Police to exercise all of the responsibilities it will have, whether provision has been made for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to exercise all of his responsibilities, or whether provision has been made as yet for the AAT to cope with all of its responsibilities under this particular legislation. I raise these matters in the hope that the Attorney might address them in the course of this debate, but I make the point that there has been no real opportunity to debate these issues and to find out. At this stage we are asked to take this whole scheme on trust. It is a kind of lucky dip legislation which mayor may not work. We hope that it does, but we cannot say for sure before we are forced to vote on it in this place. The Government itself knows that there are going to be all sorts of problems with this legislation and that is why it has inserted clause 10 in the Bill which provides that regulations may be made to: . . . provide that the Law, or specified sions of the Law, has or have effect with such modifications as the regulations prescribe. In other words, what the Government proposes is that it can make regulations to modify the effect of this legislation, regulations that will not be an enactment of this Parliament, that will not be referred to the legislative body of the Commonwealth, but which will be made by the Government. This will not be the law; this will be the law as modified by regulations. This sets the Government up as some kind of latter day Stuart monarchy which can introduce laws by regulations without an enactment by this Parliament. The same can be said of proposed new section 79, which gives the power to modify laws under the cooperative scheme, which continues in a transitional phase, by regulation. Both of those sections are offensive and I propose moving amendments to delete each of them. One of the other aspects of the implementation of this scheme is that when the Bill receives royal assent, section 219 of the Corporations Act becomes a law which will eventually govern all companies in Australia. Section 219 provides that companies have to set out an Australian company number, a nine digit registration number, on the company seal, on public documents and on eligible negotiable instruments. Those terms are defined in section 9 of the Act so that that number will have to be on business letters, statements of account, invoices, receipts, orders for goods, orders for services, official notices or publications. They will have to be on bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques or other negotiable instruments. In other words, by 1 January 1991, every company in Australia, if the legislation goes through, will have to use that nine digit number on all of those documents. Indeed, section 219(8) of the corporations law provides that the company shall also paint or affix and keep painted or affixed in a conspicuous position and in letters easily legible on the outside of its registered office and place at which its business is carried out, its name and the fact that it is a registered office. These are provigoing to be enormous imposts on businesses throughout the country. It is not widely appreciated that this will be the effect of the giving of royal assent and the passing of this Bill. Those companies that have not affixed their nine digit Australian company number to all of those documents will be liable for an offence under section 1311-where it is an individual, $1,000 or imprisonment for three months; or under section 1312-where it is a body corporate, a penalty of five times the maximum pecuniary penalty. That means that as at 1 January 1991, every company in Australia has the risk of becoming a criminal company if it has not by that stage put its nine digit number on all of those documents. Companies throughout Australia arl:! not aware of the enormous impost that this will create. It is going to be a goldmine for printers; it is going to be a disaster for the environment in terms of wasted paper, as companies begin to pulp all of their documents and print new ones. It would be easy for the Attorney-General to say, 'Look, I won't proclaim that particular section. I will give a moratorium on it', but he cannot do that because his Bill provides that it comes into effect on the giving of royal assent and it either all comes into effect or it does not. Perhaps he proposes making one of his regulations to modify the application of the law, but again, that is an offensive provision-passing the law through this Parliament and then modifying it by regulations. The Attorney should have structured the Bill in such a way that a moratorium could have been given. I call on the Attorney to announce tonight that there should be a moratorium in relation to on 1 January 1991. that particular provision. It is not as if the Australian Securities Commission could not have anticipated and prepared for this in advance. The Australian Secuis rities Commission has been in existence for 18 months. It has been working tothree wards this great day and it could have had much better information out to comdebate. panies and much better machinery in place by now; it has not. As a result, all of those companies run the risk of being convicted of offences. In addition, at the present time, most companies throughout Australia are ceiving forms from the Australian Securities Commission listing names of ernment. directors, even places of birth and the like, which they are all supposed to return before 1 January 1991 so that the inforthe mation can be keyed into the national computer system. I h.ave had numerous complamts abo-t the macc';1racy of those records. It IS h-rdly behevable that all of those ret-n-s will be lo-ged by 1 January. 1991; It - ardly belIevable that. t-ey will be k.eyed mto a computer; and 1- IS hardly b-lIevalooks ble that that syste- - Ill be opera-mg on that date. In.deed, It IS hardly belIevable th.at there will be adequat- staff to cope explanation. wIth all of the work that IS necessary. If one were to travel around the capital cities of Australia, one would see a lot empty office space rented by the Austraother lian Securities Commission, but not inempt habited by staff artd not partitioned and without desks and phones. There is a lot of empty office space, with nobody there actually to regulate what is supposed to be happening by 1 January 1991. We cannot say, 'Look, let us leave this whole system and continue under the old system whilst we get this system in place' because the old system has being severely run down. Most of the State Corporate Affairs Commissions have been run dry in terms of their staff. They are not now in .a position to continue administering the law. So we have an upsatisfactory old system, a new system that will not be a.lone, ready and a horrible interregnum in relato tion to company administration looming There will be unbelievable administrative problems. But make no mistake who is responsible. It is the Government which responsible; it is the Government's scheme. It has taken the Government years to bring this scheme into this House. It has been allowed one hour of 'In the six weeks between now and Christmas it has to get not only through this Parliament but also through six State parliaments, the Northern Territory parliament and all of those administrative details have. to be attended to. This will rebe real problem stuff. Make no mistake ' about who is responsible-it is the GovThere are also some interesting provisions in the legislation. I raise them in hope that the Attorney-General will enlighten the House as to what they mean. For example, a new section 66A is to be . inserted into the corporations law. The new section 66A prescribes various exempt bodies. It will be found, as a general rule, that in each State credit unions and IS cooperatives are determined to be exempt bodies for the purposes of the law. If one at the explanatory memorandum to find out the significance of being declared an exempt body, one will not find any . The only State, of co.urs-, that IS t,lot to of have any exempt bodIes IS Vlctona. In wor-s, - ll the other States - ave e-­ bodIes IJ? t.he fon;ns. of theIr .cred.lt - ll1ons - nd bUlldmg socIetIes b';lt Vlctona IS conspIcuously a.bsent. If one IS declared - n - xe-pt body, It mean- that the organIsatIOn IS not a corporatIOn f-r the p';1rposes ofth- law. Part 7.12, which appl,tes to corporatIOns and regulates the offenng of securities by corporations, would not apply to exempt bodies. In other words, that part will not apply to credit unions and building societies in New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland, but it will apply to Victoria. Have things now got so low in Victoria that it of all the States, cannot bring itself administer properly those bodies under State legislation and has to bring them in under Commonwealth legislation? Is that the case? Is it the case that the Victorian Government has lost confidence in its own regulation? That seems to be the conclusion from the strange insertion of proposed new section 66A. Another question for the Attorney-General is the deletion of 'close corporation' from this Act. The deletion of the definition and the consequential provisions in relation to close corporations would seem to indicate that the Government' has now determined not to proceed with its separate Bill in relation to close corporations. But we certainly had no announcement of that. There was no explanation of that in the explanatory memorandum. Again, perfunctorily, it just tells us that close corporations are going out. I ask the Attorney-General to explain to the House the significance of the deletion of close corporations from the purview of this Act. In relation to corporate law generally, this Bill proposes no changes to the substantive law. There are no changes in the substantive law in relation to loans to directors and no changes in the substantive law in relation to duties of auditors or duties of valuers. There are no changes to the corporate law in respect of all those areas that the public is now concerned about; all those areas that came to light during the excesses of 1985 and 1986 and the bull run on the stock market. There are no changes to any of those substantive laws. Although it has been three years in the making, this law that will be applied as a result of this Bill does not attack of the major practices that have concerned shareholders, creditors and those who have been hurt by severe breaches of corporate regulation over the past couple of years. It has taken three years to produce this complicated set which basically reinforces substantive law as it has always stood. Let me make it clear: the coalition supports the principle of uniform company law administered by a uniform agency, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). We support that principle. We believe that corporate regulation under the seven years of the Hawke Government has be-n deplorable. We believe that the law has been optional. We believe that there have been practices abounding in Australia to the 'detriment of shareholders which are disgraceful. We believe that the Government has been very slow to act-indeed, almost unwilling to act in many of those respects. We believe that the Government has shown little interest in or has been too close to those who have been offending against these laws to really show any determined effort to come to grips with the problem. If the introduction of this system leads to uniform law, if it leads to a uniform administrator, if it means that in the future the laws not only protect shareholders but also are enforced so that shareholders can believe that there is some legitimate protection for them, this will be a great step forward. We support the principle of this particular law. We have grave reservations about the way in which it has been introduced. We have grave reservations about the way in which debate has been allowed. We have grave reservations about whether it will be available for implementation in a meaningful way on 1 January. But we will not oppose this Bill because, underlying all of that, we believe that it is necessary to do something to clean up the system of corporate administration in Australia. We believe it is necessary to have a uniform law. We believe it is necessary to have one administrator, so that that administrator can be held responsible for failures and the Minister responsible for any that administrator can be held responsible for failures in the future. We support the principle, and that is why-in spite of all of those reservations-we will support this legislation. But we will not take any responsibility for all of those problems which will arise. We will not take responsibility for the technical defects when they come up. We will not take responsibility for the holes. All of those problems have been caused by the Government's neglect and delay in getting the legislation into this place, its neglect and delay in allowing adequate debate, its neglect and delay in allowing the opportunity to amend the legislation. Because the Government has acted in the way it has chosen, it can take responsibility for all of those problems that arise. the principle works, if the legislation be got through the States, if those administrative problems can be solved, this will in the long run be an advance in the system of corporate regulation in Australia. I hope for the sake of those who operate companies, those who advise them, those who invest in them, that this will do 'something positive to help proper and sound corporate regulation come to Australia in the near future.",126
207,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to support this legislation and I have heard the comments of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). Interestingly, the major debate on a lot of this was conducted in the previous Parliament-and I am sure the honourable member for Higgins would understand that the major package of legislation that incorporated this came down in the previous Parliament.. This is really reflecting upon that agreement by heads of Government which has been to try to redress some of the difficulties that were encountered arising out of the High Court challenge. I might say that one of the great difficulties we had in the past in the debate was that many of the colleagues of the honourable member for Higgins were very much wedded to the old cooperative scheme. There was great difficulty in getting them to come to understand that. I acknowledge the contribution of those colleagues in the Opposition who were on the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. They worked very hard and diligently. But still the base issue to be addressed. That is, that we did require a single system of company law in Australia. This commitment by others to systems that had outlived their usefulness or that clearly were not working was something that had to be broken in terms of attitudes. The interesting thing is that the excesses of the 1980s that have been referred to previously have now compelled legislators and the public to understand that we needed to do something a lot better. I think I can say on behalf of the previous Attorney-General, Mr Lionel If Bowen, and thisAttorney-General (Mr can Duffy), that there has been a commitment on this side to do something substantial. The great problem was that the old cooperative scheme meant that one did not have a direct line of ministerial accountability through this Parliament. Therefore, to try to redress the matters that were common-and that were certainly common in Western Australia-was a great difficulty. I think the honourable member for Higgins, when he reflects upon that, will understand that was the position we inherited. It was a considerable problem, but I would also acknowledge that the move to the cooperative scheme in the 1970s was, at that time, 'a very sensible move. So we need to see these things in a transition process. I think the problem is that the upgrading of corporate regulation has lagged behind what has happened in the marketplace. We have to look at the great obstruction of the States in this matter and we have to look at what has been, in the past, the very unhelpful attitude of the Opposition that was wedded to this system I have talked about. As someone who comes from Western Australia, the shortfall in corporate regulation has certainly concerned me. I think that much of the difficulty we now have, in terms of operating a viable business sector in Western Australia, can be attributed to the shortcomings in terms of corporate regulation. I am sure that if we were to talk to people in Perth they would agree with that. But at the same time. I would also acknowledge that people in Western had Australia are concerned about this move to a new national scheme. I will take up the point of the honourable member for Higgins with regard to the question, under section 219, of the nine-digit code to which he referred, The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) will introduce a moratorium from 1 january that will require that companies include the registration number on their business documents, cheques and other negotiable instruments. The moratorium will come into effect from 1 January and it will last for six months from the commencement of the scheme. During the moratorium the ASC will not enforce the requirements of section 219 (3) of the Corporations Act, which requires a company's registration number to be set out on all public documents and negotiable instruments. The issue that has been raised of the great concern about the nine-digit number is being addressed by the Government and the ASC. Mr Costello-But it is still an offence.",131
208,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member talks about an offence. Ultimately, if we are going to have a system we will have some offences. The great problem in Australia is that we had a system and we had offences, but no one has bothered to prosecute them. I come from Perth. I can give the House chapter and verse on the offences and I can give the House chapter and verse on the failure to prosecute. The Chairman of the ASC, Mr Tony Hartnell, has indicated that the ASC will be conducting a major information campaign during the moratorium. The ASC's campaign will enable companies to become familiar with the new requirements and the proper ways of meeting their obligations under the Act. That is to be applauded. One of the great difficulties this area is that people have often said, 'We did not know what was required'. The new system will give people information so that they can comply. However, the moratorium will not affect the obligation of companies to include their registration numbers on the company seal. Companies will also be required to include the number on forms and notices lodged with the ASC. The moratorium and the accompanying information campaign by the ASC will remove the source of confusion and uncertainty that has been developing amongst some sections of the business community. The moratorium will also give companies sufficient time to make the necessary changes to their stationery and other business docin uments with a minimum of cost and inconvenience. So the issues raised by the honourable member for Higgins are addressed in this note in which I address the role of the ASC and its recognition of this need for a moratorium. I have read some of the most extraordinary nonsense in the so-called popular press in Perth about this new, sinister nine-digit system. Coming from what has been, in many senses, the State that has produced some of the greatest corporate cowboys, I find that the fact that we now have people saying that they do not want to be part of a national system that enables the shareholder to be protected, let alone other people doing business with that company, is just extraordinary. We have had to put up with this deluge of misinformation in Western Australia concerning this 'sinister' system that will be operating out of Victoria. I pay tribute to the former member for MCMillan who did a lot of work in this area. But it is important to understand that this new ninedigit code is designed to put some effective protection into the system. That is what we are talking about now. I am encouraged by the transformation in the attitude of the States. Had the recent federalism conference involving the Premiers and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) taken place before we moved into this whole issue of corporate legislation, in we might have had a happier history. It has been a very checkered history . We had a High Court challenge by the States at the very time that corporate criminals were clear on the landscape and were everywhere to be seen. Yet there was no commitment from the States, including Western Australia, to improve the system of corporate regulation. I found that staggering. It also worried me that shareholders were not being protected. I suppose the best image I can convey to this House is that of shareholders who had lost money standing up at a meeting of Bond Corporation and applauding the executive. It showed, first, that we had lost sight of what corporations were about this country and, secondly, that corporate regulation had left a lot to be desired in what we should be doing in setting up a proper regulatory system. I am saying to the House that this legislation is an attempt to do something substantial as regards corporate regulation. I am pleased to hear that the Opposition supports the Bill. That is a very positive attitude. Of course, I acknowledge that there will be times when the Opposition will take issue with the question of administration. That, by definition, will follow because that is a circumstance where we have got a national scheme bedding itself down. But we have got to have a commitment in this Parliament to having proper debates of this nature-and there will be more in the future-about this whole question of corporate regulation, because we have a collective responsibility. Nine per cent of Australians are shareholders. We need to get that up to 18 per cent to 20 per cent. We cannot do that unless we can get confidence amongst shareholders that if they put their money into shares it will be protected. I was in Zurich the other day and was interested to find that the first issue raised with me by Zurich bankers was, 'What about corporate cowboys in Australia and is your money safe?'. Putting together a proper regulatory framework is a way of doing that. I assure the House that this legislation is very important in that context. I think that much is to be done down the track, but this legislation will go a long way. I am pleased to commend it to the House.",132
209,Mr RONALDSON,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"It is with mixed feelings that I rise tonight because of the disgraceful manner in which the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill, which is an extremely important piece of legislation, was introduced into the House and the unseemly haste with which it has been dealt. The Opposition has been given an absolute minimum time to consider the Bill, but to add insult to injury one hour has been allowed for debate. I might be a new chum and a bit naive-I have only been a member for seven months-but I would have thought that perhaps an imperative part of election to this place was so that we could see democracy take place. Those people who voted for me are quite right to expect me to come into this place, see democracy at. work and take it back to them. I think that what we have seen during this week and during August is .nothing short of a total disgrace. I cannot, in all conscience, go back to my electorate and tell them that the system that they are supporting by voting for people to come here is an absolute farce. It is a total disgrace that although we start sitting at 10 o'clock-of course, we are here a lot earlier than that-and we leave at a quarter to one in the morning, we are guillotining legislation of such national significance as that relating to wool, the sale of public assets and other matters right across the board. I really am extremely disappointed at the parliamentary and democratic process that we have seen this week. I am sorry that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has left the chamber, because I have no qualms about saying in this House that I respect the Attorney-General. But that respect is sorely tested by the manner in which this Bill has been presented. I inform the Attorney-General, who has just walked back into the chamber, that I just paid him a compliment. I said that although I respect him I am extremely disappointed in the manner in which this Bill has been introduced, the amount of time that has been given for the debate. There are nearly 300 pages of legislation. I have sufficient respect for the Attorney-General to believe that he could not in all conscience possibly support the process that led to the introduction of this Bill and the amount of time that has been allowed for debate. I am disappointed that the Attorney-General did not put his foot down and allow sufficient time to discuss this extremely important matter. I know that a large number of people wanted to speak on this matter, and I am sure that they will have to resort to another late night tactic of speaking on the adjournment debate or grievance debate in order to do so. Since 1983, the Hawke Government has guillotined more legislation than was guillotined in the whole period between Federation and that time. Honestly and truly, what an abysmal record. We have offered to come back to this place. What do we get? The Government ment says, 'No, we cannot fit it in. We will throw the democratic process out, and we will come back for four days in early December and then a couple of before Christmas'. I do not think it good enough. The Opposition does support the prinknown as. ciple behind the Bill, as my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Cosof tello) has already stated, but we want Government to allow proper study and exposure of, and debate on, the Bill. I have not even had a chance to go back my electorate and discuss it with the people who are going to be using this I have had not one opportunity to go back and discuss it with them. I will go back on Friday and say, 'Look, 300 pages. There you are. You read it, and you will have more time than I did-far more see time'. Again, that is an absolute disgrace. I am running out of time and my friend across the way gave me every opportunity to speak the other day and I will, indeed, honour that commitment. While we are talking about corporate collapses, let us talk about the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He was feting these corporate high-fliers around Australia. He even took time to move away credit, from some of his sporting functions so Again rdoes that he could fete some of these corporate of his convictions-which high-fliers.",133
210,Mr LAVARCH,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,John Elliott?,134
211,Mr RONALDSON,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"How about Mr that Bond? How about a few others? When to the electoral glean went off, it was ,a ferent story and the Prime Minister not want to know them. The lesson to be learned from the Prime Minister by the next round of high-fliers is: be extremely careful how close you get to him because this Government has set the scenario that got these people in and then it kicked the bucket out from under them. I apologise that I cannot go through number of divisions in this Act and, quite frankly, we would be doing the Parlianing ment a disservice to try to pick out only some of them. Let us talk about proposed new section 10, the provision for legislaready tion by regulation again. This Governso will go down in history as the regulation legislator. It does it time and time again. Here it is with another important piece of legislation giving itself andays other crack at regulation. The great is regulators of the 1980s-that is what members of this Government will be While we are talking about the effects regulation, let us have a look at the the situation in Victoria. The Cain Government has totally destroyed business in Victoria. It is an absolute disaster. I have to asked the Treasurer to come down to Ballarat but, of course, he is too busy law. working out where he lives and he has not got time to come down to Ballarat. If he came down he might just see what is happening there. He might see the factories open for four days a week; he might the factories that, potentially, will close before Christmas or close after Christmas; he might drive up and down Sturt Street and see the number of retail shops that are closing. But, of course, that does not matter to him. He is not concerned about that. He is too busy walking in here, passing on personal abuse across the table, all and then walking out again. The Attorney-General, to his enormous will not behave in that manner. say that if he had the courage I am sure he has-he would not have allowed one hour 'to debate this Bill. I suspect, and hope, he fought extremely hard to get longer discuss this Bill. As I say, I respect his difjudgment, but that has been sorely tested did by what has happened today. I go back to proposed new section 10. We have not even got a signed agreement between the States. Let us say that this Bill goes through the House tonight-I have said that we agree, in principle, to the legislation-and then goes through the Senate. What is the potential in two the months or a month's time-it is no secret that the Government wants it up and runby 1 January-for massive changes to this legislation by regulation? Why did the Government not get this legislation before it came through this House that we would know where we were going as an Opposition, and so the Government would know where it was going? Obviously the draftsman was totally concerned about what was going on with this Bill. Indeed, that is why he has left this proposed new section 10 open fo- the regulation. It should concern every smgle member of this House that there is such a totally open-ended opportunity for the Government to move various significant amendments to this Act by way of regulation. I have already addressed the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister with his favouring of corporate high fliers. This false. economic scenario that we had was actIvely pursued and marketed by the Government, but then they were dropped like a hot spud when they were no longer popular. When the financial pages were talking about the corporate high fliers in derogatory terms, he suddenly dropped them. I give a word of caution to anyone who wants to get out and have a go in this country now. I am the first to admit that this Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill will, further down the track tighten up some fairly significant probl-ms, not the least of which is the total wasting of shareholders' funds. I am sure that does not give the Attorney-General any joy; I am sure it does not give the honourable member for Stirling (Dr Ronald Edwards) any joy. And it most certainly does not give the honourable member for Higgins and me any joy to see people who honestly invested in Australian companies have the value of their investment severely diminished. I am sure that this Bill in some part will protect those people. I hark back again to the question: why this open-ended regulation in section 10? I hope that we can trust the Government to ensure that what has happened in the last four or five years is not repeated.",134
212,Mr LAVARCH,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Fisher) (10.21 ). . . . .The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) very well illustrated his point that he had insufficient time to become familiar with the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. In the 10 minutes that he spoke I do not think he came to grips with it at all. For the first seven minutes or so he canvassed with a bit of cant and humbug how terrible it all was that he had limited time and what have you. It was only in the last couple of minutes that the honourable member actually got to the regulation. It is hardly desirable-and one could hardly say otherwise-that legislation as important as this is going through with such a short time for debate. I could not defend this length of time in relation to this legislation. But it must be noted that this whole corporations scheme went through the previous Parliament. There was substantial debate, and in fact the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) spelt out the time frames in his opening address. He mentioned the length of time the matter was in the Parliament, and the length of time the matter was in the Senate. It is hardly a scheme which has been sprung on members or one about which there has been no notice. Sure, an hour is hardly sufficient in terms of this legislation, and I would not a-gue otherwise but in terms of the total Issue there has 'been plenty of debate and a lot of discussion, and the Opposition has had opportunities. Honourable members. opposite served on the Edwards CommIttee on this subject. There has been ample opportunity for contribution to it. One of the first things I remember hearing of the honourable member for Higgins when he was elected to this place was that he took a very active interest in thi- area of the law and was going over to the upper houses of the various - tat-- and expressing views about the desIrabIhty or otherwise of this scheme. I am pleased that he seems to have had some 'road to Damascus' type of conversion and now supports the legislation, given the qualifications that he mentioned. At least the honourable member has now come round and believes the general scheme of the legislation in terms of its arrangements with the States should be deserving of some support. Perhaps the honourable member will now use his best endeavours to go to the upper houses of the various States to put in a good word for getting the legislation passed so that the scheme can be up and operating by 1 January. The other criticism the honourable member for Higgins made was that the legislation. made no change to the substantive law. If I were to be asked about the evidence coming before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when inquiring into corporate practices and the rights of shareholders, where blame could be apportioned for the very bad spate of corporate collapses, I would have. to say that I do not believe the substantive law holds its hand up for being the real reason. The great preponderance.of evidence is that it is not the substantive law itself which has been inadequate; it has been the enforcement of that law. The other major-I would say substantial-problem has been the very company law system we have been operating by. This is the cooperative system. In too many instances things fell between the cracks in the system, between the peak body-or supposedly, the peak body-the National Companies and Securities Commission and the State corporate affairs commissions. The cooperation between those bodies and the cooperation that should have occurred at the ministerial council level simply did not work. It might have been great in theory and there might have been all the best will in the world, but simply did not work. There was not that direct line of authority to a responsible Minister and a responsible authority so that blame could be sheeted home when things went wrong. I remember sitting in this House hearing the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) question the former Attorney General time and time again about what was happening in Western Australia in respect of Rothwells Ltd, and quizzing him as to why certain actions were not being taken. The Attorney simply had to reply that if it were up to him, if he had the power and actually the authority to do it, m,aybe the situation would be different. But the very system we had led to that sort of climate. We had a system which lent itself to the corporate cowboys taking advantage of it. We also had a system whereby the funding of our regulators, where the Commonwealth had to match the funding of the States-and the States gave different priorities in these areas-again made it difficult. What has this Government done? Firstly, in terms of this legislation, it is putting in place a truly national scheme with decent lines of authority. Mr Costello-How long did it take? Mr LAVARCHIt would have been a lot shorter had we not had members like the honourable member going to the various States and trying t6 talk them out of it. It would have been a lot easier had the Opposition taken the sort of stand it is taking now rather than playing cheap political games with this issue. It would have been a lot easier had the Opposition adopted a truly national outlook rather than this reliance at all stages on States rights and the importance of States powers. To give credit to the Opposition, it has moved along. This legislation has also moved along and it is worthy of our support. A couple of specific matters were raised by both honourable members who spoke in this debate. One was in relation to the numbering system. First we should point out what the numbering system is about. It is a system which will in effect replace it the company name so that each company has a clearly identifiable number. In the case of incorporation in various States, one will not have the situation where companies are running around with the same name, even though that should not occur. I know it occurred; I struck it a few times when I was in practice. We also have the situation in regard to regulations. The regulation power exists so that the transitional arrangements between the old scheme and the new scheme can be handled. I think the Attorney will deal with that more fully in his address. This is the first stage in terms of corporate law reform. There will be a second stage which will deal with those substantive matters about the duties of directors, about the duties and roles of auditors and about other issues that are currently before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is at that stage, with proper consultation with the States, that the law, inasmuch as it needs to be amended to strengthen it, will be amended. In short, I urge the House to support this legislation. It is useful lation that will put in place a decent company law system in this country, and we surely do need that.",135
213,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"in reply-I thank the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) for' their contributions tonight. There has been some good news and bad news. The bad news was being accused of being a latter day member of a Stuart monarchy and of introducing lucky dip legislation. Further, there was the strong implication in the contribution by the honourable member for Higgins that we were 'guilty of environmental vandalism. But there was also some good news and that was basically that the coalition, despite massive reservations, supports uniform corporations legislation and one regulatory body. A conversion rivalling that of St Paul on the road to Damascus has been indicated by the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Fisher-both honourable members who have taken a long and continuing interest in this area. I do not want to dwell too long on that at this stage because I will also complain that I will not have time to address the matters raised, particularly by the honourable member for Higgins. However, with regard to the delays in this matter, there are a lot of people around who should not be too loud in their criticisms of the delays, and the time will come one day when I will deal with that in some detail, but not tonight. One of the first matters raised by the honourable member for Higgins and also the honourable member for Ballarat and then replied to by the honourable member for Fisher was the question of regulation making powers. The honourable member for Higgins referred to section 10, which provides for those laws of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) that may be overridden by the corporations law but the continuation of which in force would not be inconsistent with the underlying legispurposes of that corporations law. There is nothing sinister in that at all, and I will give the House an example of it. If one had an ACT which introduced a motor trading licensing scheme which could license a company, the ACT law could well apply criteria for directors of that company. This could be inconsistent-could be-with the Corporations Act and, therefore, invalid, although it did not in any way really offend underlying principles of company law. Section 10 allows regulations to put the validity of the ACT legislation in that instance beyond doubt. Section 10 (2) makes it clear that the regulation making power is for the avoidance or resolution of such inconsistencies. The section recognises at the same time that the exercise of the regulation making power to amend the ACT law is to be confined within a limited time frame-in this case 12 months. This provision is similar in concept to a provision contained in the ACT Self-Government Act. The regulation making power in proposed sections 77 and 79 is for the purposes of clarifying, as the honourable member for Fisher pointed out, the transitional operation of the provisions of the former cooperative scheme laws after the commencement of the new corporations. In particular, it will make it clear what continued application the old law has in relation to past matters in a particular case where its future operation has been overridden by the Corporations Act. I emphasise there the need to clarify the transitional operation of the provisions of the former cooperative scheme. The other matter which I think is important-I do not know whether it was just a cheap shot or genuinely a sinister thought - - Mr Costello-All my shots were expensive.",137
214,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"That is true. The honourable member for Higgins waxed eloquent on section 66A, both in the House this evening and on the ABC PM program tonight. He spoke as if there were some sinister plot in respect of Victoria. As honourable member correctly said, section 66A contains a consolidated list in respect of each State, except Victoria, of current exemptions from the definition of 'corporation' in the companies codes of those States. This provision-section 66A-is quite specifically part of the agreement reached with Ministers to retain the status quo in respect of .those exemptions. That was agreed and that was something the States very much wanted. Victorian exemptions, however, are currently not included in the Companies Code because the exemptions in Victoria are provided for under other Victorian laws. Those exemptions will be carried forward under the corporations law by the Victorian application of laws legislation, which will be introduced tomorrow. So the concern· that the honourable member for Higgins has about that is not justified at all. For example, Victorian building societies, cooperatives and credit unions, as well as all other State bodies such as those, will continue to be subject to State laws; that was part of the agreement. The honourable member for Stirling alluded in some detail to the question of the company number provisions in section 19. However, he did raise another issue and that was section 219(8) regarding signs to be placed by companies outside their place of business. He then said that this would be another impost on business. I do not think that the honourable member has had a very good look at section 218(4) of the current Companies Act 1981 which already provides for that and has already done so for many years. There is no substantive change. Mr Costello-How long have we had the Bill?",137
215,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The fact is that it only requires the name and the registered office. It does not require the number at I was not going to mention the question of how long we have had the Bill until the honourable member for Higgins interjected and invited it. We have had too much of that tonight. He had an advance copy of the Bill on 24 October-he did the not get it yesterday-with an offer of an early briefing. The final version of the Bill went to the honourable member on 6 November, with another offer for a briefing which he had on Thursday. He was offered further briefing if he so wished. He obviously took that briefing and worked on it. But it is a bit much for the honourable member to indicate that he got the Bill yesterday; it is just not true. Close corporations was one of the matters not agreed upon by the Ministers in Alice Springs. It was not part of the package. The future of close corporations legislation is certainly a matter which will be dealt with within the new ministerial council arrangements. I am sure that that will be one that will crop up. The other issue I just want to touch on is the fact that the honourable member for Higgins seemed to indicate both here tonight and also on the ABC program earlier that this legislation did not deal with a lot of matters which were very important. If he looks again at the second reading speech he will see that I adverted to only two exarriples of the ongoing package that will have to be dealt with in the corporate reform area-insider trading and loans to directors. The advisory committee's exposure draft is currently out for public comment on the loans to directors. The other matters we have on the agenda-and I think the honourable member is well aware of this-are directors duties, which again is a matter that will certainly be part of that package of law reform, and the inquiry into corporate practices and rights of shareholders, which is extremely important. That is one where the honourable member for Fisher is very much involved because the committee he chairs is currently recei ving submissions from Interested groups and individuals on that matter. The other issue is the question of penall. alties, which is very much on the agenda at this stage and is also very important-and the honourable member for Higgins would understand this-because the international aspect of the problems with corporations these days is the question of mutual assistance between regulatory agencies here and overseas. Announcements have been made in that area already that, instead of just being able to provide information that is already on file, the regulatory bodies here and overseas will have the power to undertake investigations to carry that further. It really is a bit of a nonsense to say that this is the end of it. It never has pretended to be the end of it. Mr Costello-I am not saying that.",138
216,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The fact is that, as I said earlier, we would be a hell of a lot further down the path if there had been more cooperation, but that is not a matter that we have time to debate this evening. This is historic legislation. It is the ginning of a new era in corporate regulation, but it is an ongoing process. I can assure honourable members that during the next year the Government will be proceeding with almost all of those matters that I have referred to in the last couple of moments.",139
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,Order! The time allocated for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.,139
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.,139
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"It is understood that the Opposition wishes to incorporate in Hansard those of its amendments and new clauses which have been circulated but which were not moved at the expir-tion of time.

220,Mr MCLACHLAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Barker) (10.42)The 40-minute time limit imposed on this debate demonstrates the Government's real commitment to Australian exporters. It is ironic that a week after the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) deliberately strayed into areas outside his ministerial responsibility because he was allegedly so concerned about the future of exporters in this country, the Government does not even allow be the Parliament to debate this issue. I am afraid this attitude is rather typical of the Government's treatment of exporters. It . sometimes makes a lot of grandiose claims and even throws a million or two dollars here and there at the problem, but the indisputable reality is that it is this Government's economic policies which are crippling exporters, and for some the damage will be tragically permanent. All Australians are bearing this cost and will for years to come. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No.2) is equally part of the problem, or at least symptomatic of it. Here we have a piece of quite complex legislation enacting complex changes to a scheme which involves a plethora of eligibility criteria, rules and definitions. I do not dispute that where the public purse is involved there should be proper checks and proper balances, but the point I wish to make is that this Bill epitomises much of what is wrong with the Government's approach to industry, and certainly what is wrong with the new interventionist push from certain Ministers. Honourable members might recall that the initial handling of this matter was less than perfect. They will recall that Senator Button's announcement of the Government's response to the report of the Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance on 28 February this year, during the election campaign, was somewhat of a shambles. In a sort of last minute rush to buy a few extra votes, the sums had not been worked out properly, and we saw a press conference with a very unimpressed Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and an extremely busy senator adding and re-adding the figures with the help of some journalists and a calculator. Then in May the Government introduced a Bill to extend the market development grants scheme for five years unchanged. The coalition queried this and the Government apparently changed its mind and extended the scheme for six months, until the end of 1990, to give it time, it said, to discuss. with exporters the changes foreshadowed III February. Eventually, on 8 November-six days ago-legislation was rushed into the House proposing changes identical, as far as we can ascertain, to those announced . in February. More suspicious people than I might say that this extraordinary chain of events was a ploy to keep the Opposition and exporters in the dark but, in my view, it is just gross incompetence. It is inefficiency. At any rate, it should give business good reason to be wary of politicians, especially Labor politicians, wanting to help them. If this Government were a corporation, it would have gone broke long ago. If it were an exporter of legal and administrative services, it would not be able to sell them. The coalition's fundamental view is that the export market development grants scheme, whether it spends $200m or $1 billion, or whether it targets large or small exporters or successful or unsuccessful exporters, or any other scheme that. selectively supports exports, is not going to bring about the 4 per cent shift in gross domestic product (GDP) to net exports that this country needs merely to stabilise its massive foreign debt. Certainly, it is difficult to show that current scheme has brought about a sustained lift in exports, let alone an improvement in the current account. Last year the current account deficit exceeded $20 billion and, while imports have been declining this year as demand slumps, so too have exports. This is our starting point. However as the coalition announced in August of' this year, it has decided to support a five-year extension of the export market development grants scheme, for two main reasons. First of all, it would be unfair and disruptive to remove the scheme when exporters face such a hostile economic climate. To paraphrase both the Hughes Committee and Professor Ross Garnaut such action would send the wrong signals. Secondly, we believe that it would be unfair to remove export assistance which, in part, compensates exporters for the effect of import protection before removing import protection itself. Consequently, the coalition will not be opposing this Bill, alth-':lgh I w.ill outline in a minute a proposItIOn WhIch, I am advised I do not have the time or the technic-l ability to move in this place, but which I would like to suggest to the Minister that he consider. However, I put on record the coalition's firm intention to remove after time, the export market devel6pm-nt grants scheme after 1995 in conjunction w-th a package of .stru.ct-ral reform includIllg phased reductIOn III Import p;otection to, at most, negligible levels by the year 2000. By that time, we will have been in power for two years and the benefit of those structural reforms will be apparent. We have no doubt at all that our approach will deliver the competitive environment required to give Australian exporters a real chance. At the moment, they are penalised by an excessively high cost structure, and the major impediments are as follows: an industrial relations system which stifles productivity and costs tens of billions of dollars per annum; transport and communications systems-in particular, for exporters, the waterfront-which also cost millions of the dollars per annum; the cost of capital; a very high, uncompetitive and volatile currency; government taxes, charges and regulations which are beyond the pale; and, of course, we still have tariffs on inputs. The coalition has no copyright on this list. It is Australia's list. Commonsense tells us that, if exporters are to succeed and if more producers are to commence exporting, these impediments must be removed. I note the rather weak admission lagging of the Minister for Science and Technolness ogy (Mr Crean) in the last paragraph of the second reading speech: The Government can do more and it will looking for new ways to pursue this important objective. I suggest that it could do no better than to study the report of the Bureau of dustry Economics, extract the digit and get the country moving. The Industry Commission estimates that the benefit fundamental changes in many of these areas to be about $22 billion extra GDP, a net addition of 53,000 jobs, an increase in household income of $2,350, a 7 per cent reduction in the cost of living, an increase in exports of almost 18 per cent, an improvement in the trade balance, and national an increase in real wages of 9 per international cent-something that I anticipate that the claimable. Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, would approve of. Surely, it is something that the Australian Council of Trade Unions would want to happen. We hear time and again that we are moving to a position to do this to a position to do that. That is what these Ministers say in those hackneyed phrases of the club-'We are moving to position'. If the Australian fieldsmen this summer moved to their positions at the speed of this Government, the Poms will win every test match by an innings at least. The Government's failure to dress these areas to any significant means that, in order to be seen to be helping exporters, it must resort to compensation schemes such as this. The changes incorporated in the Bill represent the latest and a late attempt the Government to improve the and follows the inquiry last year chaired by Professor Helen Hughes. The CommitGovernment's tee's report makes interesting reading. bulk of the report argues heavily against specific export assistance programs, for the simple reason that in the end they not work, but somewhat resignedly the Committee recommends extension of their the scheme for five years until 1995 because-and I quote from page 71: Closing down the EMDGS at this point of export performance would give the busicommunity an erroneous signal. As we know, business is getting more than enough erroneous signals right now. The be Committee also recommended a series of changes to the scheme to target it more effectively and many of these proposals are contained in this Bill. They include: a Inreduction in the reimbursement rate from 70 per cent of eligible expenditure to 50 per cent; an increase in: the maximum of annual grant from $200,000 to $250,000 and an increase in the export ceiling to $25m; a restriction of the maximum number of annual grants to eight;. firms will be allowed to claim $200 per day for up to 21 days as eligible overseas travel expenditure; and the cost of attending intereducational courses in business development will be We accept these changes which both tighten the eligibility criteria and help to ensure that the scheme is directed at assisting new exporters or expanding the range of eligible activities and claimants; for example, the proposed inclusion of or moving inbound tourist operators. The Bill also proposes to increase the a expenditure threshold from $10,000 per year to $30,000 compared with the Hughes Committee recommendation of a $50,000 threshold. The coalition considers this threshold is still too high, especially for adnew entrants to the scheme. The Hughes degree Committee, when recommending an increase in the threshold of $50,000, recpartial ommended that new entrants to the scheme should be allowed to claim their first two years expenses towards the by threshold. We would like to see a similar scheme provision in the new scheme. The situation is complicated by the requirement that the first The $15,000 of expenditure in anyone year is not reimbursable; in other words, the coalition is requesting that exporters be do given the option to combine two years expenditure to reach the $30,000 limit for first grant but that, in effect, only . expenditure above $15,000 in each year will be eligible for reimbursement. I understand that it is not within my power to introduce an amendment along these lines but it seems eminently sensible and I ask the Minister whether he would consider it. This change would reduce hurdle that small exporters have to involving extra expenditure. Although the Opposition does not have detailed inforI mation, we believe it would involve relatively small amount of extra cost the scheme. I ask the Minister to seriously consider this proposal, particularly in the light the Government's apparent intention to assist smaller exporters. If he would sider this suggestion between now and the time that this Bill is introduced into Senate, perhaps we could communicate on the subject. This change would reduce the hurdle that small exporters have face, involve some extra expenditure as I said, probably would be not too great-to the order of less than $lOm. The message, however, that I convey to exporters today is that the coalition its part is guaranteeing to get rid of impediments that those exporters say the major stumbling blocks. By 1995 there will be little need, as I said earlier, export market development grants scheme or others like it. In the final governments cannot make the economy competitive. They can only create the conditions for business to make the omy competitive and I urge this Governfacturing ment to get on with that task. We have had 35 bills under guillotine this week. If we are asked to consider whether the extraordinary chronological order of events around this Bill is either a deliberate conspiracy or just ineffithat ciency, my vote would be for the latter.",139
221,Mr KERR,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Australia the lucky country is very much at a turning point. A great vista of opportunity opened up before us, as pointed out Ross Garnaut where he said that this time of great opportunity for Australia. is a time when Australians have a chance to grasp the prosperity, self-confidence independence in an independent world future. that earlier Australians in expansive times had hoped for their country. My concern is that we will miss the boat and end up residing in relative poverty at the bottom of a dynamic and prosperous Asia. To achieve Qur share in the the new world that is emerging both in Europe face and our neighbouring region, tough and challenging decisions will have to be made. believe that there will have to be a a change in the very philosophy that is at to present the basis of our business enterprises. I do not accept the proposition that is of obviously at the heart of the Opposition that it is enough for governments to stand conback and say market forces will rule and free enterprise will win the day. This is a the false hope and one that is held with religious zeal by some who cling to a notion of an ,open world economy. The discusto sions that are occurring on the General and, Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at present suggest it is simply not going to happen. Non-interference in the market is all for well and good for economic theorists but the the facts are that we do not have a level are playing field. Other governments use incentives and tax breaks to distort their for an economic systems in positive ways. Market forces do not always militate towards analysis, strategic planning. It is a very interesting phenomena that in a debate that is now occurring about econindustry policy and the future of manuthe Opposition appears to be the party which is rigid in an ideological construct. It is set in a position of being unable to do other than say that it will permit market forces to have their day and remove even the positive incentives this Government is building into its planning for a more prosperous and constructive manufacturing sector. What governments can do is make strahas tegic judgments about the national interby est which individual firms cannot be is a expected to make. We need to be asking It now what Australia will be able to market to the world and what our potential and strengths will be in two decades in the From that assessment we can plan. It is obvious that there are grave areas where we need to make those plans, areas for commercialising the intellectual advances that occur through research and development. We need to respond to the lack in our capital markets of venture capital and, pertinent to the debate tonight, we need to look very carefully at how we can assist export related companies to take advantage of opportunities that they see in front of them. It is interesting in this framework that the position of the Opposition is that it will tolerate the existence of the existing scheme because to do otherwise would be, as Opposition members say, to give the wrong signals. Essentially, the Opposition would prefer to have no such export related schemes. It has undertaken to remove all such schemes after 1995. That will send absolute shivers of despair through an already battered manufacturing sector. Those in manufacturing have given me the message that they are absolutely horrified at the prospect of the ideologues in the Opposition coming into government with their flat earth schemes of removing all thought of any strategy towards assisting Australia's manufacturing industry. To assist debate in this area I mention that two very important initiatives go far to providing some more empirical basis for discussion of issues which have in the past been the subject of ideological posturing: the Garnaut report and The Global Challenge-the Telesis Study, a report commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council and produced by the consultancy Pappas Carter Evans and Koop Pty Ltd. Together the two studies give us a very good basis for some intelligent approach towards industry strategy. It would be plain that neither strategy would look favourably towards a strategy based on maintenance of a high tariff system. All significant commentators, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), have concluded that it is no longer appropriate and has been counterproductive to have a high tariff barrier sheltering inefficient industries. In that regard I draw the Opposition's attention to a very important document produced by the ACTU, which reflects the positive and constructive attitude towards options which are available, entitled Australian Manufacturing and Industry Development: Policies and Prospects for the 1990s and into the 21st Century. The interesting point in relation to the Bill before the House is that both the Pappas Carter document and the ACTU document call for a risk sharing support scheme which is to be complementary to the export market development grants program. The honourable member for  whatsoever of the complementary scheme that the Minister is introducing, not by legislation but by administrative measure. It is a discretionary scheme under the Austrade arrangements called the international trade enhancement scheme. The international trade enhancement scheme, although it is relatively modestly funded, picks up very significant components of the recommendations of The Global Challenge, one point in which states: The cost of effective strategic entry into export markets is a major discouragement to Australian firms, particularly given their high cost of funds and the short-term pressures to perform from financial markets. A company opening its own office in Japan can expect a cost of at least $1 million per annum and might not secure significant sales for a number of years. Product adaptation expenses, trial shipments and promotion and marketing expenses for specific projects would be additional, and generally very large. There is also a need to learn and to pay careful attention to the particular requirements and ways of doing business in Japan. From that it concludes that individual firms are unlikely to have a sufficient capital base to take the large capital risks from the very small base of Australian manufacturing. Many of the theorists on the other side simply ignore the realities that underlie the scale of Australian manufacturing and the precarious nature of its funding. The report goes on to say: To encourage Australian companies to take the risks and make investments necessary to develop sustainable positions in complex factor export markets, we recommend that Australia should provide risk sharing assistance to established firms that invest in strategic export development. Risk sharing assistance can be provided in a number of ways. What is important is that they should adhere to certain key principles. The report goes through them. Firstly, says assistance should go to firms with proven manufacturing track records. significant Funding should be for discrete expense investment programs with a long term strategic investment on exports. Assistneeds ance should be on a matching basis in a constructive way. form repayable with interest components on profit share if the project succeeds and the goal should be to encourage compaa nies to take export risks they might not otherwise take. Finally, decision making on selection of 'projects should be taken using the skills and tools of private sector investors and by people with relevant business experience. The ACTU has also picked up that promust posal and compliments the Government tion for introducing the international hancement scheme. It points out that the scheme will be run by the Australian Trade Commission, Austrade, with a budget of $55m over three years and points out that the objects of the scheme include: - To encourage participants to conduct stantial international business development activities with preference for activities involve new markets, new products or services. - To provide support for the substantial pansion of international business activities. - To facilitate new investment . . . between Australian and Foreign firms . . . They also include grouping together conalone. sortia where the scale of Australian manufacturing and export related companies is too small to otherwise enter markets their own. Both the ACTU and the Australian Manufacturing Council are as one in prosimplistic posing a significantly more interventionist strategy than the Opposition would. In fact, the Opposition would say that it would not respond in any way to focus assistance in the area which industry itself is calling out for. The Opposition has an enormous inability to come to terms with the practicalities of issues. We have tinual reference to ideological preferences and we have rejections of propositions which would respond to the needs of specific industry situation in this country; and throughout Australia those industries it and groups which are export oriented are distressed by the prospect that the very manufacturing capacity of this country could be savaged by the unwillingness of the Opposition to perceive its and to respond to those needs in a This is not a call, of course, for the old interventionist tariff protections but it is call to use intelligence to look at the objective situation in which our industry finds itself, to go through the rigorous application of analysis that both Garnaut and the Australian Manufacturing Council's consultants undertook, and to blend the best of those approaches together. We draw back from the levels of protecwhich still shelter some relatively intrade enefficient industries. But let us assume that we take every possible step to do that. We still need to give long term strategic thought to the way in which we wish this economy to develop and we need to look at what we would wish to have in this country by subway of a future in the manufacturing sector. If, indeed, the thought is that we are which indifferent to the future of manufacturing new in this country, I believe it to be a fundamentally wrong. approach. I suspect that exunderlying the rhetoric of the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) is a simplistic preference for a future of Australia based on trade in the primary sector If that is the case-and certainly the measure of that can only be judged at the on present time by a failure to come to terms with any of the more difficult and complex issues in the debate and a resort to rhetoric-if there is a real indifference to the future of manufacturing, if there is no attempt to come to terms with some of the more difficult issues that affect Australia in terms of trying to find ways of getting a store of venture capital so that industry can invest, if there is no significant interest in looking at the unconderlying causes of lack of strong export firms in Australia, and if there is no interest in looking at the points about our grouping and the way in which export related firms can cluster together to form international cartels of sufficient scale to penetrate export markets, then it is a message that the Australian manufacturing sector and the Australian public that are employed in that sector will reject decisively.",142
222,Mr DOWNER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Mayo) (11.11)Listening to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is interesting because his criticism of the coalition and his advocacy for what nowadays is known as strategic trade theory makes one contemplate who is going to be at the rudder of the ship of strategic trade theory. The implication of what the honourable member for Denison is saying is that it will be him and others like him who will be directing the investment activities of Australian businesses and determining what markets Australia should be investing in. I think that in itself underlines why we do not waftt strategic trade theory in this country. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has pointed out that the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No.2) introduces changes to the export market develop-' ment grants scheme based on the recommendations of the Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Develop- . ment Assistance but, because of the shortage of time, I will not cover again many of the comments he made about what this Bill actually does. However, I make this point in quoting from a letter I received today from Michael Pointer, the Chairman of the Australian Export Action Committee: Australia's exporters are concerned that the twar Government proposes to guillotine tonight's bate on the Export Market Development Grants Bill No.2 1990. If the Government is really serious about the issue of exports and about trying resolve Australia's fundamental balance payments problems and the problems of Australia's foreign debt, one would think that it would allow some time for the Parliament to debate issues which, at least from the Government's point of view, regards as important initiatives to try resolve those problems. But apparently not. Only 40 minutes has been allocated and in that respect I think the Australian Export Action Committee is absolutely right. One would think that the Parliament would be given time to debate things that were important to the country's future. Apparently not. I would like to make three brief points about this legislation. First of all, we support the legislation and we support it with the amendments that the honourable member for Barker has outlined because today Australian companies operate in a very hostile exporting climate-not a hostile international climate, as it happens, but a hostile domestic climate. This legislation does something to try to compensate for that hostile exporting climate in our country. It helps to create something of an export culture. It is legislation which is consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and it is legislation which, in a sense, is a concession to the fact that the Government has failed in all the really fundamental areas of making the economy more competitive. If a country is to succeed in the international marketplace, it has to focus on its comparative position in that marketplace. That seems to me to be a perfectly obvious proposition. Yet the structure of our economy is such that it operates almost as though it is hermetically sealed from the rest of the world-that somehow we can get by regardless of what is happening in other parts of the world; Y-t over the last seven years or so the world has gone through one of the most dramatic changes ever, certainly in the posera, in terms of relative decompetitiveness. We have done very little to keep up with that dramatic change. The changes we really need to address are not a few million dollars worth on to export market development grants of schemes, but fundamental changes to our taxation regime so that those goods and services which are exported are not subject to the wholesale sales tax, which would reduce the cost of our exports by it about 2 per cent or $1 billion. We need to to change, as the honourable member for Barker pointed out, our industrial relations system so that system does not operate within the luxury of internal domestic debate, but so that it bears some relationship to the need for that system to be a competitive international system. There is no point in having an industrial relations system that does not take that into account, yet ours does not. We need, as is constantly said on this side of the House, very substantial changes to our waterfront. Where New Zealand and Britain have achieved 100 per cent increases in productivity during the calendar year 1989, we hope to achieve 30 per cent increases in productivity over the next three years. We need dramatic reform of our shipping. The Government is frightened of the maritime unions and therefore will not make those changes. It is cheaper to export wheat from the west coast of the United States to New Zealand than it is to export wheat from the east coast of Australia to New Zealand. That is terribly sad. One would think that the Government would really worry about that and want to do something about it. We need to change, as the honourable member for Barker said, our transport system, our communications and the costs that we impose-and the honourable member for Denison would be sensitive to this:-on the production of electricity in this country. All those things are lutely fundamental to the competitiveness of the economy and they cast a gigantic shadow over minuscule measures like an export market development grant, which is scant compensation, really, for our failcost, ure as a country to make those fundamental changes. I want to make a couple of other points. Recently, a number of Ministers, not least the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), have been making speeches, possibly a little out of turn, 'about the need for Australia to develop a whole range of new export incentives on top of this particular incentive, which isa GATT consistent incentive, that we have before this House. These are the people who are the old proponents of the strategic trade theory, the people who have turned their back on fixing taxes, industrial relations, the waterfront, shipping, transport and communications, and instead have said, 'Let us pull out of the air the old quick fix', the quick fix we have heard about throughout the history of economics, and this particular one is as old as the whole of that history. They say, 'We can provide some export incentives because the rest of the world is so generous with its export incentives'. That is not right. Helen Hughes, in her report, which this Bill is based on, made that perfectly clear. If one has a look at expenditures on export promotion in selected industrial countries-the chart that she produced-using the year 1987, one sees that Australia spends $US6 per $US1,000 of exports; Canada $US5; France $US2; and the United Kingdom $USl. Great exporters like Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany, as it then was, spend a negligible amount. We are already big spenderSon export incentives, but many Ministers say, 'We've got to spend a good deal more'. There are three reasons why that will not work. First of all, if we spend a lot of money on export incentives, what do we think the rest of the world is going to say? 'That's good. Thank goodness we can buy more and more Australian imports'. Of course they are not. They are going to impose countervailing duties. It is quite consistabso- ent with GATT for them to do that. So we will be spending this taxpayers' money on extra import incentives, diverting economic activity into those incentives, and we will get no benefit out of it at all, only because other countries will say, 'We will jack up countervailing duties'. Secondly, it completely contradicts the position we are quite rightly taking in the Uruguay Round that the European community principally, and also the United States, should cut out export subsidies for agriculture. One cannot go around the world telling the Americans and the Europeans to stop providing export subsidies in the area of agriculture, which is so important to us, hoping they are deaf, blind and stupid-and they are none of those-and saying that we are, by the way, going to introduce a whole range of export subsidies ourselves. It is just nonsense. Thirdly, if one pursues a trade policy like that, one will start a subsidies war all around the world. We are a very small country, at the bottom of the world-at least in the way in which the Americans and Europeans see the globe-and if there is an export subsidy war in this world, our country is going to be the first victim of that war. The Europeans and the Americans can afford to flatten this country economically with subsidies because of the gigantic size of their budgets. So when Ministers and backbenchers, as we have heard them this evening, say that export subsidies will be the solutions to this country's problems, forget it:--thesolutions lie in fundamental economic reform. It is a disgrace that debate on this Bill is being truncated in this undemocratic way. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. AUSSAT AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 November, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the Bill be now read a second time.",145
223,Mr NA BROWN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Menzies) (11.21)The Aussat Amendment Bill does basically two things. First, it removes some impediments of a legal nature to the privatisation of Aussat Pty Ltd. Aussat was originally established as a government owned company and, in fact, for some time. I held virtually all of the shares in it. Fortunately I did not hold these shares for my own benefit, for I would certainly be bankrupt by now if I did. I held the shares on behalf of the Government and the people because Aussat was a government-owned company. It has been the policy of the Liberal and National parties for some time that Aussat should be privatised. It is good to see that the Australian Labor Party has at long last adopted coalition policy on this matter. It is important that the record be clear on this and related matters. Aussat should always have been privately owned, as some argued at the time it should be. But that, of course, was not the tenor of the times and Aussat was established as a government-owned body. In recent years the coalition parties have been advocating the sale of Aussat becallse its activities are not activities that the Government should be involved in at all. They are more appropriate for the private sector. The Australian Labor Party, after a lot of blood-letting and anguish, has now come to the same conclusion and we congratulate it on its deathbed conversion. This first group of amendments to the Aussat Act will enable that sale to take place. They repeal the parts of the Act which prevent Aussat from becoming a public company and that limit the number of its shareholders. As our policy is for the privatisation of Aussat, we naturally have no objection to these parts of the Bill. They constitute between them the first reason why we will be supporting this Bill. The second group of amendments will enable Aussat to undertake a wider range of activities than it is presently entitled to undertake. In general, we support these changes, but we say that they do not go far enough. I will be moving some amendments to enable Aussat to undertake all telecommunications activities without the restrictions that the present Bill imposes on it. We will be doing this in the words· that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself used in his statement to the House just the other day. We will expect Government members to vote in favour of adopting the Prime Minister's owa words unless they want to disown what he said. The proposals in the Bill to expand Aussat's activities come from the Government's decision to allow a competitor to Telecom Australia. Aussat will be the nucleus of that competitor. The new competitor, according to the Government, will be the sole competitor until 30 June 1997, after which the Government's intention is that there will be 'no limit on network competition'. In fact, there will be more than one competitor to Telecom by 30 June 1997 because the Labor Party, mercifully, will not be in Government on that date. Nevertheless, the present Government's policy is to allow one competitor to Telecom, based on Aussat. It wants to get Aussat up and running as soon as possible to provide some early competition and to fatten it up before it is sold. So the amendments to the Aussat Act contained in this Bill will allow Aussat to· take part in more activities in telecommunicationsth'an are presently permittea. There will be a new section 9 which will declare that the primary object of Aussat is to conduct the business of supplying telecommunications and related services within Australia, outside Australia and between Australia and other countries. At the present, Aussat is permitted only to carryon satellite communications, so the amendment is a great advance-and we support it. There will also be a new section lOA which will enable Austel, the independent regulator, to give directions to Telecom and OTe Ltd to allow Aussat to use their networks and facilities. We also support that proposal. We then come to the most important part of the Bill, that is, the insertion new section lOB. This is good as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. It gives Aussat the right to provide three things: firstly, a domestic or international public telecommunications infrastructure or network; secondly, access to international public telecommunications networks; and, thirdly, telecommunications services of the kind referred to in section 36 of the Telecommunications Act, which in fact are public switched telephone, data text and video services, public switched integrated services digital networks, leased circuit services, and mobile telephones. The Opposition does not believe that Aussat, of course, should be the nucleus of the competitor to Telecom as this will hamstring the competitor. If we are going to have competition, we must have real competition not restricted by the burden of Aussat and its debts. Nevertheless, despite that, the Government has in fact decided that Aussat will be the nucleus of the competitor, and as this is a first, albeit inadequate, step towards competition, we will support it. However, it must be clearly understood that the Bill and, in particular, the new section lOB will not enable Aussat to engage in all telecommunications activities. This is so for the following reason. The new section lOB says, in its own terms, that the new powers to be given to Aussat are 'subject to subsection (3)'. Subsection (3) is a very important limitation. That limitation is: Nothing in this section is intended to affect the operation of sections 35, 47 and 48 of the Telecommunications Act 1989. Sections 35, 47 and 48 of the Telecommunications Act are vital because they give Telecom its monopoly over the first phone of a basic telephone service and they give it its monopoly over public pay phones. So, despite the grand protestations of enabling Aussat to engage in all telecommunications activities, this clearly is not in fact being done by this Bill. The Bill expressly says that the new powers of Aussat are subject to Telecom keeping its monopoly on the first phone and on public pay phones. These are vital parts of the Telecom monopoly, an.d it must be of a understood that they are being preserved by this Bill. Not only are those areas of the Telecom monopoly preserved by the Bill but, in doing so, the Bill is in fact clearly contrary to the statement of the Prime Minister made as recently as 8 November. In that statement, the Prime Minister said that Aussat-and I quote here his exact words: . . . will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. These are not unrestricted rights that are being given to Aussat. They are, in fact, severely restricted. They are not rights to provide all telecommunications services, because the Bill preserves Telecom's monopoly in two of the most potent activities that make up that monopoly. It is bad enough to limit and restrict the competitor by requiring it to saddle itself with Aussat, but it is doubly bad that the competitor is to be shut out of the two major areas of telecommunications.  lieve that?",147
224,Mr NA BROWN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I say to the honourable member who has been interjecting: go and read the Prime Minister's speech. I know that it is probably a distasteful experience but, if he does so, he will find that there are clear inconsistencies between what the Prime Minister said and what this Bill says. It is there in language. Making Aussat the nucleus of the sole competitor is to make it fight with one arm tied behind its back, and restricting it, as this Bill does, is to tie both of its arms. We have, for that reason, a second reading amendment and some committee stage amendments to incorporate the precise words from the Prime Minister's statement-because the precise words of the Prime Minister's statement should be incorporated in this Bill so that Aussat can have the full powers and the full responsibilities which the Prime Minister said that it would have and which are not being given to it by this Bill. In addition to the second reading amendment, we also have other amendments to give Aussat what the Prime Minister described-and I use his words again-as 'unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services'. This Bill does not live up to the Prime Minister's promises, and our amendments will rectify that shortcoming. Of course the reality is that, because of the outrageous way the Government is acting in imposing the guillotine on this Bill and many others, we will probably not be able to move our amendments or have them voted upon. But they are in fact on the table and, if the Government will not accept them, then it can take the consequences of that in the future. It should also be understood that there are internal inconsistencies between the Bill and the Minister's second reading speech. The Minister says first that: The Bill does not, however, seek to establish the duopoly on network provision ... But the Bill in fact expressly empowers Aussat to: . . . provide any domestic . . . network . . . I revert to the second reading speech. It also says that the Bill will allow Aussat: . . . to compete with OTe and Telecom across the full range of services in the international and domestic markets. I simply ask the question: How can that be when it is prevented from supplying the first phone and public pay phones? It plain cannot be so. Do they not come within, and I go back to those words again, 'the full range of services in '"" domestic markets'? Of course they do. Thirdly, the second reading speech says that the amendments: Will not affect the basic telephone service, or the first telephone service currently provided by Telecom. . What on earth does that mean? Does not 'the basic telephone system'-and they are the words used-come within ' . . . any domestic public telecommunications infrastructure or network', which is the very activity now being given to Aussat by this Bill? Of course it does. So this great competitor is not permitted to touch the basic telephone service. If one puts all of that together, it is apparent that the Bill does not come up to the Prime Minister's promise of providing early competition in any real sense of that word, and it should be amended to bring it up to that promise which the Prime Minister made and with which we agreed. It confirms what we have always believed: the Government is lukewarm about competition and will always chase second best when it is not chasing third best-which is most of the time. To put all of this together, we will support the Bill because it proposes some modest steps towards competition. But it should be amended to make it a better Bill and to encourage more competition, which this country so badly needs in the area of telecommunications. It must now be obvious to everyone that in this whole area only an alternative government will provide full and genuine competition. As I have already alluded to in passing, I will move, at the appropriate time at the end of my speech, a second reading amendment to the effect that: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the should have been drafted so that Aussat will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. I reiterate the point that those words are not mine-'they are the Prirne Minister's own words. He came into this House and said that the Government will set up a situation in which Aussat, the nucleus of the competitor: will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. If this Bill and the debate were to full length, we would give Government members an opportunity of voting in .suptions port of the words used by their leader. That is the effect of the second reading amendment; that it should have been competitive - drafted to incorporate fully and properly the Prime Minister's grand protestation about competition, which, I repeat, is reflected in this Bill. In addition to that, I will be seeking leave at the appropriate time to incorpomove rate some proposed committee stage amendments which will again incorporate in the Bill itself those words which used-that is, to give to Aussat this adWarringah. ditional power to provide for all telecommunications services without restriction. There will be amendments to remove the limitations proposed in the Bill, and there will in fact be an amendment which will repeal sections 35, 47 and 48 of the Testantly. lecommunications Act which contain these very potent parts of the Telecom monopsecond oly. Those are the amendments will be asking at the appropriate time to have incorporated. As I say, we will be supporting the Bill but on the basis that it only takes step towards competition; it does not come anywhere near the full extent competition that should be provided. will now formally move the second ing amendment.  Mr N.A.· BROWN-Yes, hysterical laughter is about the most that the Labor Party is ever capable of producing on serious matters like this. I move: That all words after""That"" be omitted with a Bill view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should have been drafted so that Aussat will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services"". Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Is the motion seconded? I call the honourable member for Warringah.",149
225,Mr MACKELLAR,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Isecond the amendment. As my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has indicated, go the the Opposition supports the Aussat Amendment Bill.

The shadow Minnot ister actually sat down prior to moving his amendment. I stood in my place.

I saw the honourable member sit down and stand up, I thought almost inAs far as I was concerned, he still had the call and he had foreshadowed a reading amendment. I do not think which we that was unreasonable.  is poor reward for showing and extending a courtesy to a colleague who is flounderthe first ing on the other side. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER - I think of the honourable member does not have a I point of order. The honourable member readfor Warringah may continue. Mr MACKELLARThank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I repeat that we do not believe that the Government is moving with sufficient speed to introduce the changes that are needed ,to create a truly competitive and viable Australian telecommunications industry. Our position, as outlined by the honourable member for Menzies, is very clear. This is a step towards competition which is not insignificant but, nevertheless, one that in our opinion does not go far enough, nor at a sufficient pace, to maximise the possible benefits to Australian telecommunications users, manufacturers or exporters. What is being proposed is what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) called in his second reading speech 'an interim measure', which will allow the Government to sell . Aussat and to put in place temporary measures to allow Aussat to compete in the short term with OTC Ltd and Telecom Australia. The Minister went on to say that further legislation to implement the Government's complete telecommunications reform will be introduced in the new year and that this will establish a duopoly unW 1997 when a sunset provision will apply. I think the Minister has demonstrated an extraordinary degree of courage by using the word 'duopoly', given the considerable media and informed questioning of the Government demolishing one duopoly at the very time that it is creating another. Unfortunately, there is not sufficient time in these guillotined debates---,.and I am sure that the Minister for Transport and Communications, who is at the table, will, in his heart of hearts, realise that his conduct in the House at the behest of his parliamentary leader is not really in the best interests of the reputation of this House of Representatives-to explore this in any depth. It stretches the Government's credibility to its limit that ,all the disadvantages of one duopoly can so miraculously become the advantages of the other newly created· duopoly. What is particularly relevant to this debate is to refer back to the telecommunications reform statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of 1 November. The honourable member for Menzies has already mentioned the Prime Minister's statement. My clear understanding of what the Prime Minister said in that statement is that there is an intention to create a new competitor based on Aussat, and for that new competitor to. have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications service from the end of 1990. On this side of the House-and, I must say, amongst the Australian people generally-we have come to accept the yawning gaps that so often occur between the Government's intentions and its subsequent actions. This Bill does not provide:-I repeat, does not provide-for unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. Instead, it will, retain an absolute. monopoly for Telecom in the provision of first phones and public pay phones. How could anyone say that it provides all the opportunities, when it restricts these opport\lnities? Furthermore, the Minister has indicated in his speech that. until Aussat is sold,he expects the Aussat board to .consuIt closely with him on any new business ventures it proposes to undertake,. What does that mean in a relevant commercial sense? Does it mean that the new board has to come cap in hand to the Minister and say, 'Look, we would really,like to do something about this' and he will say, 'I am not too fussed about that. I really don't agree with that liort of thing'. It does strain the credibility of the .Government and the Minister when he suggests something like that. . How the Minister believes that Aussafs ability to provide new services will improve its commercial viabilityhow he believes that can possibly succeed, in the face of his expectation of close governmental supervision over Aussat's new business venture---.,.is a matter to' be wondered about. I would be very interested to hear the Minister explain this diffic\llt proposition. Thankfully, as the honourable member for Menzies has said, we will be in government before the 1997 sunset clause takes effect and, of course, we will have an opportunity before that to deregulate the industry properly, remove the duopolistic situation and allow Australians to enjoy the benefits of genuine competition. When one considers the implications of this sunset provision, the limitations which are being placed in the way of Aussat becoming a complete competitor to Telecom and the past lack of interest shown by the Government towards Aussat, one must have doubts about this Government's sincerity in wanting even two equally competitive telecommunications organisations. Let us have a look at that history of lack of interest in Aussat. First of all, the Government refused to inject desperately needed capital into the organisation. It refused to allow Aussat to work itself out of its financial difficulties by preventing it from competing with Telecom in its service areas. Yet Telecom, on the other hand, had a significant interest in Aussat. It was permitted to actively encroach into Aussat's markets, and it was doing so with the undoubted assistance of two :Telecom members on the Aussat board. How could Aussat possibly function with a significant proportion of its capital subscribed by Telecom and with two members of Telecom on its board? Obviously, it was in a very difficult competitive situation.",150
226,Mr NA BROWN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,We were ridiculed when we drew attention to it.,152
227,Mr MACKELLAR,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Yes. It was said this could' not possibly affect it. Of course it affected it. I point to the difficulties caused to Aussat by the delay with its long march rocket launch, and the Government's failure to financially support an alternative launch vehicle. I also point-and this is particularly significant, I believeto the restrictions placed in the way of Aussat's entry into the pay TV developments and its proposal for a Pacific rim footprint. This last proposal-the Pacific rim footprint-had the potential to place Australia in a pivotal role as a communications centre for the western Pacific region. But the opportunity was lost because of the Government's lack of interest. ",152
228,Mr MACKELLAR,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"The honourable member, who proposes to speak in this debate, says 'rubbish'. If he had a look at the opportunities which would have become available if that Pacific rim footprint had been pursued, he would have seen that we could have become a hub for communications. It did not progress;· it did not continue. Why? Because there was no support from the Government for this. One of the great contradictions of the Aussat Amendment Bill 1990, and one that clearly identifies the Government's lack of commercial nous is, on the one hand, the statement of the Minister for Transport and Communications that Aussat's sale will generate 'substantial Commonwealth revenue' while, on the other hand, it has acted in a way to keep Aussat in a state of permanent and debilitating financial weakness. Yet' it is now this debt-ridden organisation which is to attract a multi-billionaire buyer and a price which will satisfy the Government's desperate fiscal need for debt offsetting asset sales. If the Minister knows somebody anxious to buy Aussat perhaps he would let us know. I have not heard too much talk around the place about any Australian organisation with the capacity to take over Aussat. I can see the Minister at the table utilising the fingers of his left hand to detail these things, but I hope in his reply-if, because of his guillotine motion, the Minister is allowed to reply to this debate-he will inform us of the Australian organisations which have the capacity to invest in Aussat. It is difficult not to get the feeling that the greatest failing of this present Labor Government is its naive desire to be all things to all people at all times. It has a relationship with the Australian Telecommunication Employees Association (ATEA) that is probably a critical factor in this matter. We all know the ATEA is . a very significant contributor to Labor Party funds, and it has had a significant history of opposition to Aussat and it would like to see Aussat fail. It has been prepared to hold back Aussat and support Telecom. It wants reforms but carries them through in a way which does not start with that overworked phrase, a level playing field, and its sunset clause and limitations on the newborn child give the older sister more than a head start. Despite all of that, the Government wants the younger sister to attract a wealthy suitor with sufficient funds to help pay off a sizeable part of the parents' debts. I make three interesting-I hope they are interesting-and telling observations. Just once in his second reading. speech did the Minister refer to the national interest, and then only half-heartedly. Only once, and then only in his last 20 words, did the Minister talk about his reforms bringing greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. Not once was there adirect reference to the benefits which consumers will enjoy from these changes-not once. If we look back over the Government's broadcasting reforms of 1985 to 1987, and the state of that industry today, I believe the Opposition-as stated by the honourable member for Menzies-has every right to feel great concern about the Hawke Government's conviction in wanting a viable and competitive telecommunications industry. It should have one. The opportunity was there. The Government has shown, by gross dereliction of duty in the past, it is even now incapable of achieving the sorts of results that a proper approach to this problem would see benefiting not only the industry, but also all the consumers who have to utilise the services which should properly be provided in a fully competitive situation.  pleased to see the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has now entered the chamber and I am sure he would have been exceptionally disappointed at the performance of his colleague the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). What was the thrust of the honourable member for Menzies? He was bemoaning the guillotine, that we were not allowing full discussion and that we were reluctantly introducing competition, yet it was only last· week that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made the announcement in this House about what we were going to do and what the future was, and here we are today, Wednesday, discussing the first of a number of Bills. We are hopeful that with the passage of this Bill competition will not be the dream that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Menzies, had long yearned to introduce, some pipe dream, some abstraction; it will be a reality and brought in in double quick time by a Labor government and by a very effective Minister. We are get7 ting early competition; it is going to be here. What else did he say? The 'honourable member for Bass also said, 'Oh, this is not genuine competition because people will hot be able to move into the first phone area and will not be able to move into pay phones.' I challenge the honourable member for Bass and the honourable member for Menzies: Tell me of the people who are sali vating, waiting to set up and to get into the pay phone area, or indeed even into the first phone area. List them for me. Tell us. Share it with the House. There will be interest in the first phone area when we have personal communications networks and when we are into the radio systems, but there is not much interest in first phones nowThe point is that members of the Opposition have not told the House that the first phone monopoly is sunsetted to 1 July next year. Apparently, what the Opposition wants to quibble about is some six months, or any period of time that we might provide notice to industry. That is what the Opposition is quibbling about. It says that this is not genuine competition because we have nominated two areas which competitors do not want to get into, and they are not permitted to at this stage in the first Bill. What a pathetic offering from the champions of privatisa- . tion and competition. That is all they can· offer the Hou-e at this stage about this Bill. The Aussat Amendment Bill 1990 is fundamental and far-reaching because it signals fundamental reform in the communications-telecommunications area. Mr Elliott---':'It is historic.  the honourable member for Parramatta said, it is historic. It picks up on the 1988 reforms which started the whole process. This is the continuation of that. Of course, we are not talking ,about some academic theory of competition where we try to spray as many competitors as we can, so that we have ineffective competition. We are talking about getting up a second viable network performer. That is at the guts of this Bill. Of course, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) asked, 'Well, what about the consumers?' The big difference in the approach of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Government is that ordinary consumers of Australia-and rural Australia-are at the forefront of our concerns. Indeed, as successive pieces of legislation will show, the price-capping consumer safeguards which already exist will be strengthened further. What does the Opposition propose to do? In the name of protecting consumers it wants to put community service obligations into the Budget. That is the first thing that will be hacked at any Treasurer of any political party. Mr Elliott-It will be chopped straight away.  ber for Parramatta says, it will be chopped straight away. It is phoney consumer protection. The Minister mentioned that in his second reading speech, and the honourable member for Warringah raised a very unfair point in this regard. The Government is specifically concerned about ordinary consumers, rural consumers and remote communities. All these things are at the forefront of the Government's consideration. The Government is not concerned with trying to float off all publicly-owned companies-the government business enterprises-that we possess. These things are driving us. Why should we not continue to preserve what will be the merged Telecom-OTC organisation in public ownership? A great national interest is at stake here. I believe that it is only through this strengthened public ownership that we will deliver the full potential that these changes will make. It has the potential to create a heightened manufacturing industry, not only in the customer equipment area but also in switching and other areas. That will create jobs in Australia but, more importantly, it will create technology. I believe the Opposition through its policies would jeopardise all that. We want a dynamic and efficient industry, as the Minister said, that will make Australia a springboard to the opportunities in Asia. The Minister said that time and time again. We do not have a vision only about domestic Australia; we also want this industry, as a growth industry, to contribute to our exports, to our presence and to our national economy. I know that other members wish to speak to this Bill. I thought it was really sad to listen to Opposition members talking about the Aussat Amendment Bill 1990. They could quibble and pick at only two areas. I can say frankly I have never heard anyone say, 'Look, I am salivating. I want to get in here; this is where we are going to make our profits; this is by where we will really tear the place apart'. Of course, they are not. They are interested in the real aspects of competition, which is overseas calls, the trunk network, local calls, satellite service and value-added services. That is where the money will be made. If they ever get into the first phone, it will be a very minor area. Mr MACKellar-Pay phones.  for Warringah continues on about pay phones. Of course, pay phones have had a spectacular history of financial haemorrhaging. It is only recently that the returns from those phones have moved into the black but, even though the returns may be in the black, I can assure the honourable member that there will be no competitor searching his electorate wishing to set up pay phones-and much less in my electorate. As far as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) is concerned, he is not even in the hunt. I have much pleasure in congratulating the Minister on the speed with which the Government has tackled the whole reform process and the fact that we are here talking not about what we mayor may not do, but about what we are doing and what this Bill will permit.",152
229,Mr SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"There are only a few moments left and I thought I might take the opportunity to add a few remarks about the Aussat Amendment Bill. As indicated by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), we support the legislation but we do so with some reservations. The first reservation is that this duopoly will continue until 1997. We want to see Aussat privatised, but we want to see it privatised in a way that will benefit all Australians. I do not want to go into the technicalities of the Bill because time does not permit, but let me answer one of the issues raised by the previous speaker, the honourable  the need to continue with public ownership. It is interesting that today has been red letter day for the issues of privatisaber tion. All morning I spent in this chamber talking about privatisation of the Comunion. monwealth Bank and privatisation of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, which was an assets sale. The Governof ment has created monstercom in the bank. The biggest bank in this country will be the Commonwealth Bank and the biggest telecommunications service in this country will be Telecom. This Bill is about the competitor to Telecom. The question is: is this going to be effective competition? Are the consumers of this nation-and that ought to be our priority, regardless of where we sit in this chamber-going to get a benefit? What we on this side say is that the Governproper ment is effectively delaying the benefit consumers in the way that it is proceedthe ing. Admittedly, we were a little surprised that the Government went nearly as as it did but there are, as the honourable member for Menzies pointed out, some reservations. The honourable member for Chifley spoke about the first phone moted nopoly and so on, which is the nature of the amendments, but, because of the guilproposed lotine, we are not going to be able to deal the question. with them tonight. However, t!le,e are those reservations.",155
230,Mr BEAZLEY,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,It will be next year.,155
231,Mr SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"It is all right to say that it will be n-xt year, but we want it now. The consumers deserve it now and all that the Government is doing is putting ideology in front of the needs of the consumers of this nation. The Government says that benefits are going to accrue to Australia by this monstercom because of the critical mass in the manufacturing area, which will also give the Government an opportunity to get into the international market. Henry Ergas, the Centre for International Research on Communication and Information Technologies and others do not accept those arguments. The Government knows that they do not accept those arguments. We come back to the fundamental issue that drove that special conference: this is a deal and a compromise. In favour of a whom? Whom does the honourable memfor Chifley represent? He represents the people from the telecommunications They are the people he has given into. He has put their issues and their concerns first, rather than the consumers Australia. They are the ones who are terms of going to get the benefits. We are a country that has a great future. As the Minister for Transport and all Communications (Mr Beazley) has identified on previous occasions, telecommunications is a fast growing industry. We need a competitive structure, and that is the key to our policy: the development of a truly competitive structure. That is why we say that 1997 is too far away. We need to pull it forward. We need to have the basis of interconnection, and the to Government knows that I understand all technical arguments. Unfortunately, we are not going to have the opportunity far to debate those issues today, but-Thursday, 15 October 1990",155
