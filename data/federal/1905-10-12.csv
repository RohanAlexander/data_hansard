Mr GROOM. - The honourable member having courteously given, me notice of his intention to ask this question, I am prepared with the following information:A subdivisions increase has been paid to officers who, under the original classification scheme, were classified at a salary higher than that which they were receiving, on condition that the amount was included in the Estimates; hut officers who have been classified' at a salary involving more than one sub-divisional increase, must await the' approval of the classification and. the appropriation of funds by Parliament before the arrears can be paid. Those officers who have been classified under appeal at a higher salary than was' allotted in the original classification scheme must also await the approval of the scheme and the provision of funds, which are included in the Estimates 1905-6.  the. late Treasurer promised, at the time that we agreed to pay the increments on salaries under £ i 6 o per annum, that, when Parliamenthad sanctioned the classification, increments on salaries exceeding that amount would also be paid without reference to the passing of the Estimates?

HOME RULE FOR IRELAND. Debate resumed from 28th September, (vide page 2973), on motion by Mr HIG GINSThat an humble Address be presented to His Majesty as follows :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY : We, Your Majesty's dutiful aud loyal subjects, the Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, desire most earnestly in our name and on behalf of the people whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty's person and Government. We have observed with feelings of profound satisfaction the evidence afforded by recent legislation and recent debates in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, of a sincere desire now to deal justly with Ireland; and in particular we congratulate the people of the United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land question, and on the concession to the people of Ireland of a measure of Local Government for municipal purposes. But the. sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland. Enjoying and appreciating as we do the blessings 6f Home Rule here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland. They ask for it through their representatives-neve r has request more clear, consistent, and continuous been made by any nation. As subjects of Your Majesty we are interested in the peace and contentment of all parts of the Empire, and we desire to see this long-standing grievance at the very heart of the Empire removed. It is our desire for the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, as a Power making for peace and civilization, that must be our excuse for submitting to Your Majesty this respectful petition. Upon which Mr Reid had moved, by way all the words after the first word "" That,"" left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" whilst in full sympathy with every movement calculated to advance the best interests of Ireland, this House declines to petition His Majesty either in favour of or against a change in the parliamentary system which at present prevails in the United Kingdom(1) because this House does not consider such matters within its legitimate province; (2) because they will shortly become issues in an appeal to the electors of Great Britain and Ireland in which this House has no right to interfere ; and (3) because this House confidently relies upon the fairness and wisdom of the British people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people and the stability of the Empire.""",14
23,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," B y way of perjoin sonal explanation, I wish to say that I was aware absent through illness when this motion of was last under discussion, or I should have taken earlier action to reply to the ments then made by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, who, at clusion of his speech, used the following words, which impugn my veracity. I hadThethehonorable take this opportunity of placing the mattinguished ter clearly before the House and the counquis try. I am not so much concerned about honourable members as about those who take the the trouble to read the reports of the bate upon this very important question. think At page 2959 of Hansard the honourable Orange member for Southern Melbourne is reported and to have saidThe honourable member for , Dalley recently made an assertion which I think calls for an thoroughly accurate. immediate and emphatic contradiction. stated that the Marquis of Linlithgow, formerly Governor General of the Commonwealth, was Orangeman, the evident intention being to support the organization by lending to it the weight to do so. and dignity of a highly-esteemed gentleman, and to a corresponding degree to prejudice cause of Home Rule for Ireland. I challenged liberation and perfect knowledge. the honourable member for proof in support of his statement, but he was unable to furnish I think it is unfortunate that the name first Governor General of the Commonwealth should have been dragged into a debate of kind, in association with an organization whose aim is to set one section of the community throats of the other section, and which lives the prejudices of the past. I believe that Marquis of Linlithgow has had an inquiry dressed to him as to whether he was ever associated with the Orange institution, and, although no reply has yet been received, a letter has addressed to me by a gentleman who is fident that the statement made by the honourable member for Dalley is without foundation that he is prepared to make a liberal donation to charitable institution named by the honourable member for Dalley if it can be proved that statement is correct. The honourable member then proceeded to read a letter which contained the following statementAnother statement made was that Lord lithgow was an Orangeman. I feel confident that statement was untrue, and if it proved that he has ever taken the Orangeman's oath, I am willing to give a liberal donation a charitable institution, feeling confident that honourable gentleman has too high a sense of honour' to take so vile an oath. Towards the conclusion of his speech, honourable member saidReferring once more to the statement honourable member for Dalley, of Linlithgow was. connected with the Orange institution at one time, I wish to say that, even if our former Governor General was induced to the organization, he could not have been of the hideous oath by which he would be required to bind himself to carry out the objects the order. I feel perfectly sure that he will give an emphatic denial to the statement. stateWhen I addressed the House on 31st August, in connection with the motion now the conunder discussion, I statedmember for Southern Melbourne privilege of being acquainted with a disOrangeman in this country-the Marof Linlithgow; but surely he did not find him anxious in any way to destroy the peace of community ? Although he was Governor General of Australia, the present Marquis of deLinlithgow-the n Earl of Hopetoun-di d not that it was dishonourable to belong to the Lodge, and that body today has among its members some of the leading men in England Ireland. I now reiterate that statement, which was The honourable memHe ber for Southern Melbourne stated that he had challenged me to furnish proof of an my statement, and that I had been unable That is absolutely incorrect. I was never asked to furnish any proof. I the spoke after full consideration and with deI am it. prepared to accept the challenge offered by of the the honourable member on behalf of his friend, who is so confident that my statethis ment is untrue, and I welcome this as at the the first instance on record in which it upon has been open to a member of Parliament to the make a wager, and at the same time to be adin order. If the honourable member or his friend will put up any amount from ^ 2 0 been to £ 1 0 0 I am prepared to furnish proof so conthat the Marquis of Linlithgow was a member of the Orange Institution, and if any honourable members are anxious to seize a golden opportunity, I would recommend his them to accept a similar wager. The only condition I lay down is that I shall name the charity to which the donation is to be made. Further, I should like you, Mr. Speaker, to hold the stakes. I do not make that suggestion with any idea of Linridiculing the honourable member for can be Southern Melbourne. As I have stated, I accept his challenge, and in the words to of the Premier of Victoria, I would saythat to him, "" Stuff up or shut up."" The honourable member, in his concluding remarks on the occasion referred to, contradicted the one of his opening statements. He stated that what I had alleged with regard to the of the Marquis of Linlithgow was untrue, but he that the Marquis subsequently said I wish to say that even if our former Governor General was induced to join the organization, he could not h.ive been aware of the hideous oath by which he would be required to bind himself to carry out the object of the order. I feel perfectly sure that he will give an emphatic denial to the statement. Those remarks indicate a doubt upon the subject. I wish to place it upon record that I never make a statement of a serious character in this House unless I am prepared to substantiate it. I introduced the name of the Marquis of Linlithgow deliberately and with foreknowledge. The Marquis of Linlithgow was not only a member of the Orange Institution, but at one time was Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Therefore. I was speaking of a matter of which I had full knowledge. I am very sorry that the action of the honourable member should have rendered it necessary for me to make this explanation. I regret that I was absent from the House at the time that my veracity was impugned, otherwise I should have forthwith explained the situation.",15
24,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Southern Melbourne) I need scarcely comment upon, the bad taste of the honourable member for Dalley in dragging you, Mr Speaker, into this matter in such an irreverent and irregular way.",16
25,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member is a fine judge of good taste when he accuses another honourable member of telling lies.,16
26,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I did not accuse the honourable member of telling lies. honourable member ought to know the difference between a deliberate lie and a misstatement. At the time. I .spoke I certainly thought that the honourable member had made a misstatement, and, further, I considered that he had shown exceedingly bad taste in dragging the name of Lord Hopetoun into a discussion of this kind.",16
27,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The Marquis of Linlithgow is the same as any other man. We do not bow clown to him and worship him.,16
28,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I trust that until a communication has been received from the Marquis of Linlithgow' honourable members will refrain from giving credence to the bald statement made by the honourable member for Dalley.,16
29,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Will the honourable member put his money up?,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Order ! During the whole of the time that the honourable member for Dalley was making his explanation the honourable member for Southern Melbourne made no remark whatever. would therefore ask the honourable member for Dalley to refrain from making interjections.,16
31,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I feel sure that neither this House nor the country will give any credence to the bald, unsupported statement of the honourable member that the Marquis of Linlithgow was an Orangutan. It is true that he may have been induced to become associated with the institution not knowing anything about its real character. If he did so, however, he very speedily severed his connection with it, because soon after his arrival in Victoria, he took the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of a convent-a n act which would have led to his expulsion from any Orange lodge in the world. If he had not thus cut Himself adrift from the Orange Institution, the officials of that organization would have cut him adrift from themunless they restrained their hands merely because he was Lord Hopetoun. I am exceedingly sorry that the name of the first Governor General of the CorrtmonwealtSi has been associated with so odious an organization.",16
32,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I find it rather difficult to address myself to the motion before the House, after the altercation we have just heard. I am satisfied that the honourable member for Southern Melbourne is a person to whom honourable members must pay a certain amount of atThe tention, insomuch that his intimate knowledge of the Orange Institution makes it clear that at one time he must have been a member of the organization which he is now so bitterly denouncing.",16
33,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member is making a statement absolutely without foundation.,16
34,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I would be the last to misrepresent any fact, and if the statement. I have made be incorrect, I shall take the first opportunity to tender a public apology to-the Orange Institution. I am very grateful for the opportunity to again address the House on this question; but in view of indications that honourable members are anxious to proceed to a vote, I shall curtail my remarks as far as possible. On a former occasion, I endeavoured to show that we had no mandate from the people of Australia to interfere in a question concerning another self governing section of our Empire, and further, that we had no right to inI terfere. I shall now seek to demono strate that it is not expedient for the Commonwealth to obtrude itself into the matter. The question of Australian expediency must necessarily include the wider question of Imperial expediency. It is a truism with which honourable members are well acquainted, that the Empire depends for its integrity upon the good-will and mutual esteem existent between its component parts, and the liberty which has been always hitherto conceded by each to each to manage its own affairs. I have already shown that Ireland is a natural component part of the United Kingdom, being in juxtaposition to, and within easy range of, the Imperial Parliament : that at the present time she possesses from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, more representation in that Parliament than she is entitled to from the stand-point of her population ; and consequently that we must consider her as an integral part of one of the great self-governing parts of the Empire. It behoves us to be very careful before we consent to intrude on the management of any such part of it. That the United Kingdom does not ask for our interference is clear. Up to the present time the I m perial Parliament, which constantly hears the Home Rule arguments of the nationalist members of Ireland, has not shown any disposition to grant Home Rule to that country. As a matter of fact, we know that in late years there has been a revulsion of feeling, even in England itself, upon this Question. At the present moment the prevailing sentiment throughout England, Scotland, and the North of Ireland, is absolutely in opposition to the proposal to grant a separate Parliament to the Irish people. How should we in Australia brook Imperial interference with our own laws ? The honourable and learned member who has submitted this motion would be the first to resent any such interference. If , for instance, one State wished to secede from the Commonwealth, what would the people of the other States say if the Imperial Parliament attempted to exert an influence which was detrimental to the integrity of the Union? So far as we are concerned, there are other causes of possible friction between the mother country and ourselves if we start this ball of mutual interference a-rolling. For example, there is our Immigration Restriction Act.",16
35,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That measure affords instance in which the Home Government did effectively interfere in our affairs.,17
36,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Was the honourable member satisfied with that interference?,17
37,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,No .,17
38,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Y e t trie honourable member is now proposing that we should f o l low the very course which he himself resented.,17
39,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I said that I did not think the course adopted was justified. There is a wide distinction between' following the course which was suggested and objecting intrinsically to the suggestion.,17
40,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"In that case, Australia, as a section of the Empire, was interfering with the right of British subjects to enter British Dominions. The Imperial Parliament had every right to represent the case of other subjects of the King in that connection. But is any Australian debarred from landing in Ireland ? What right, then, have we to interfere in the Constitution and government of Ireland ? The leader of the Labour Party himself admits that he keenly resented the Imperial representations",17
41,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I did not say anything of the sort. Apparently, the honourable member is a champion of misrepresentation.",17
42,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I do not wish to do the honourable member any injustice, but a few minutes ago he told us",17
43,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That I disagreed with the course suggested, not that I disagreed with the suggestion.",17
44,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I misunderstood the honourable member. He does not resent any representations being made to the people of Australia by the Imperial Government in regard to Commonwealth legislation, even if those representations concern ourselves only, and do not affect other subjects of the King.",17
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Is that what he says ?,17
46,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is what he has given us to understand.,17
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,It is rather a strange doctrine to lay down.,17
48,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,We have already been told during this debate that the people of Canada have made similar representations to the Imperial authorities.,17
49,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Upon several occasions.,17
50,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I intend to quote the reply to the representations which were made in 1882. I do not know whether it is nean cessary for me to read the motion which was carried upon the occasion to which I refer,17
51,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,No . it is ancient history.,18
52,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If it be ancient history to the honourable member, who has so intimate a knowledge of Orange lodges, I will not trespass upon the time of the House by reading it ; but will content myself with saying that it was similar in spirit to that which is now under, consideration. reply to those representations the following communication was received by the Canadian Government",18
53,Mr CARPENTER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,What is the date of the reply?,18
54,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"It is dated 12th June, 1882.",18
55,Mr CARPENTER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,There has been a very different reply since then.,18
56,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If so, I have not had the privilege of seeing it. Upon the 12th June, 1882, the following reply was addressed by the right honourable the Earl of Kimberley to the Marquis of Lome, who was then Governor General of Canada:My LordI have received and laid before the Queen the Address to Her Majesty from the Senate and House of Commons of Canada in Parliament assembled, which was transmitted in your Lordship's despatch of the 16th of May. I am commanded by Her Majesty to request that you will convey to the Senate and House of Commons her appreciation of the renewed expression of their unsiwerving loyalty and devotion to Her Majesty's person and Government. Her Majesty will always gladly receive the advice of the liament of Canada on all matters relating, to the Dominion, and the administration of its affairs; but, with respect to the questions referred to in the Address, Her Majesty will, in accordance with the Constitution of this country, have regard to the advice of the Imperial Parliament and Ministers, to whom all matters relating to the affairs of the United Kingdom exclusively appertain.",18
57,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The Imperial authorities did not sav that upon the second occasion.,18
58,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,What did they say ?,18
59,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,They did not administer a snub.,18
60,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Will the honourable member tell us what the Imperial authorities did say upon the occasion to which he refers?,18
61,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I have not got a copy of the communication here.,18
62,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable member is very anxious to make it appear that another message was subsequently despatched, which put the matter in quite a different light; but if he has a copy of it, I challenge him to produce it and I shall now read it. In view of the snub which was administered to Canada, is it expedient for the Commonwealth to court a similar catastrophe ?",18
63,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,A snub is not a catastrophe.,18
64,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"It is not to the honourable member! Even if by our interference we did not invite similar interference in our In own affairs by other sections of the Empire, we should be laying ourselves open to a snub, which, in my opinion, would be most richly deserved. Under these circumstances it is most inexpedient that we should pass this motion. During the course of this debate we have been assured that all that is sought is "" a just measure '' of Home Rule for Ireland. We have also been told by the terms of the motion that that '' just measure '' of Home Rule is required to pacify the people of that country. Obviously, then, a "" j u s t "" measure of Home Rule means a measure which will be satisfactory to the Irish people. Consequently it is to the nationalist opinion in Ireland that we must go to ascertain what is really meant by ""Home Rule"" for that country. In the first place, I desire to point out that Ireland is divided against itself upon this question. A very considerable section of its people are bitterly opposed to the establishment of a separate Parliament for tEat country. It is true that a majority desire Home Rule, but there is a very large minority who seem to fear that Par- the granting of autonomy to Ireland may eventually affect its own very right to live. As a proof that this feeling is not entirely without justification, I wish to refer honourable members to a policy which is now regarded with universal favour by Irish Nationalists-the Sinn Fein policy, which aims a good deal in the direction indicated. In this connection I wish to quote a few extracts from other papers reprinted in the Untied Irishman of 15th July of the present year, and apparently endorsed by that paper. The first reads as follows:-Briefly, the Hungarian policy as applied to Ireland, or the Sinn Fein policy, as it is familiarly called, means for a beginning that all Irish elective bodies, county councils, & c , should be exclusively manned by earnest Nationalists. No position in the public service at all controlled by the local elective bodies will be given to pensioners or servants of the British Government. According, then, to this authority, if Home Rule were granted to Ireland, nobody who is not a Nationalist would secure any offict. of trust in that country. The Sinn Fein policy involves no oath of allegiance to England, no compromise of principle. It practically means resistance to English law,i .where the parliamentarian policy meant compliance. It involves no acknowledgement of 'England's claim to govern the country. It leaves England exposed to foreign nations. away with our real and most injurious connection with England, which is through the English Parliament - and Australia is certainly loyal-shoul d That, I think, advocates the establishment of a Parliament possessed of at least coordinate powers with that of the United Kingdom, although it has been constantly denied in this debate that such powers are sought. The next extract readsPriests and people will be united in this policy of constitutional resistance, for at a recent session of the Columbian Society, formed by the students of Maynooth, it was decided that the Sinn Fein policy is the policy for Ireland. These are all extracts showing what action should be taken, in the opinion of the Nationalists, to bring about Home Rule for Ireland. It can hardly be said that opinions endorsed by a Nationalist newspaper are not fairly conclusive evidence of the state of national feeling in Ireland today. now refer very briefly to observations with reference to boycotting, which were made by learned occupants of the Irish Bench. ' Lord Chief Justice O'Brien, when addressing the Grand J ury at the North Tipperary assizes on 3rd July last, complained that boycotting existed in certain districts, and that some few persons were actually refused the necessaries of life. Mr Justice Kenny, addressing the Grand Jury at the Limerick assizes in July last, said that agrarian troubles in certain districts were on the increase, and that this "" cast a dark blot on the good name of the - county."" Then, again, Mr Justice Wright at the King's County assizes, in the same month, said that "" it appeared as if there was a reign of terror over the district."" Lord Chief Justice O'Brien at the Clonmel assizes on ioth July last, in passing judgment on an arson charge - the plaintiff being what is locally known as "" a grabber""-referre d to a speech bearing on the case delivered just previously by a member of the Imperial ""Parliament, Mr K. E. O'Brien, and saidHe did not think Mr O'Brien contemplated outrage. He acquitted him of any such idea, but they had to consider the stimulating effect of such language on an excitable people. - Apparently, then, bovcott and terrorization are now rife in Ireland. . If the fact that a very large minority of the people of Ireland are directly opposed to Home Rule-fearin g that it may legalize this sort of thing-is not in itself sufficient to make us hesitate to obtrude our interference,, surely the demands of the leaders It does of the Irish Home Rule movement are couched in such terms that no loyal Colony support that which we are today asked to do. The honourable member for Dalley has already quoted extracts from speeches by Mr Redmond, M.P., and Mr Devlin, M.P., as well as from a celebrated speech delivered many years ago by the late  quotations some others culled from recent speeches of other Nationalist leaders in Ireland at the present time. The first of these is a quotation from a letter written by Mr T. O'Donnell, M.P., and published in the Freeman's Journal, of 9th June last. The letter referred to a distinctly disloyal incident that had occurred at a conference of teachers held at Sligo. At this conference the chairman proposed to toast the King, but the teachers assembled I shall trooped out of the room rather than give that toast which we, in Australia, at all events, are always glad to honor. Mr. O'Donnell's letter is as follows: Loyalty to such a toast would mean loyalty to the slavery or banishment of our sons, to the impoverishment of our country, to the annihilation of our race, and such hypocrisy and meanness"" Hypocrisy and meanness,"" in toasting the King! And yet Irishmen in this House are asseverating by this motion their loyalty to the same great Sovereignno true Iiishman could be guilty of. Notwithstanding this we find the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the honourable member for Coolgardie, and also the honourable member for Southern Melbourne - if he is really an Irishman - asseverating in the opening terms of this motion their loyalty to the KingLoyalty to Ireland, as well as persistent and uncompromising opposition to the unconstitutional and ruinous rule of the foreigner, form the plain duty of Irishmen. We want those duties taught to our children. . . It is time for the Irish party to take up, at home here in Ireland, the question of the education of our children. The boy of today will be the man of tomorrow. We must see that he is not being trained a slave or a shoneen, but that his national instincts are fostered and encouraged. Thus, and thus only, can future national organizations become strong, being made up of the masses whose patriotism is fanned by knowledge. I am perfectly satisfied that the great majority of teachers are thorough Irishmen, and that they certainly will not subscribe to the doctrine that the incident which occurred at Sligo is either "" regrettable "" or "" unpardonable."" This was an open declaration by a Nafollows:tionalist member that the paid servants of the State should misuse their trust to foster disloyalty in the growing generation. And yet we are told that these Nationalist Stephen's members ask, not for separation, but only him for some sort of subservient Parliament, to assure the peace and goodwill of the people of Ireland. Lord Oranmore and Browne leader. referred to this Sligo incident in the of Lords, and the Marquis of Londonber derry, in reply, saidThe Commissioners of National Education Ireland were considering the advisability ing a further circular to the teachers, reminding them of the terms of Rule 89 of their code 1905, and of Rule 94 (3), which provided the children were to be taught a spirit of ence to the law and loyalty to the Sovereign, to do nothing in or out of the school which might have the tendency to confine it to any denominathey tion of children. He would impress it upon the Rule should be granted to Ireland. Commissioners of National Education in Ireland to insist upon that paragraph being carried It will thus be seen that this incident ated considerable stir at the time, not in Ireland, but in the Imperial Parliament.  of the Gaelic League, at a meeting of the Dublin Central Teachers' Association, rebeliefs ferred to the matter, and saidWe know the great power the teachers have in their hands. We know that they have the moulding of the minds of the young people in the country, and we know it is the business of the national teacher and his duty to the country to saturate the minds of the young people with true ideas of Irish nationality. That is his business as much as it is to teach them that two and two make four. The most important side of education was the National side. Despite such statements as these, we are told by the supporters of the motion that such a thing as Irish nationhood is not demanded. We should hesitate before we handover the government of Ireland to people who hold these opinions-to persons who think that it is hypocritical and mean to show respect to the Sovereign of an Empire to whom we are proud to own allegiance-to the embodiment, if I may so put it, of the Anglo-Celtic nationhood. I wish now to refer to an action recently taken by Mr John Dillon, M.P., who. most people will admit, is a fairly prominent Nationalist. According to the Freeman's Journal, he travelled specially from London in order to preside at a meeting in Dublin, on 3rd June of this year, at which a presentation was to be made to Mr Michael Lambert. The Freeman's Journal, Mr Kelly. which is certainly a Nationalist organ, reports the proceedings at this meeting as On Saturday night last a number of friendsand admirers of Michael Lambert, the man who made the key that opened the door of Jamescell in Richmond Prison, and restored to freedom, presented him with a handsome testimonial in memory of that great deed. Forty years have rolled by since the day on which the world was startled by the escape of the Fenian House We learn from this that a prominent memof the House of Commons- a nationalist representative of Ireland-hastene d to in Dublin to render homage to a Fenian. of issuThis gentleman has taken the oath of alof legiance just as have the framers of this that motion, who are at the present time seekobediing to again asseverate their undying loyand alty to the Empire, for whose good only, tell us, they are urging that Home Sir Thomas Esmonde, another Nationalist M.P., out. attended a mass meeting of nearly 20,000 crepeople, at Enniscorthy, county Wexford, only and, according to the Freeman's Journal of 29th May, spoke as follows :We are the descendants of the rebels of '98. . . . Their principles are our principles; their are our beliefs; their ideals are our ideals; and led by the inspiration which animated them, we declare that we wil l never submit to foreign rule in Ireland, and that we will never cease from struggling, by whatever means seems best to usWhether it be by sugar-coated motions in loyal Australia, or agrarian outrages in Irelanduntil Ireland is free from the centre to the sea. This solemn pledge we renew today, and we pledge our faith once more by the memory of '98- . Mr Michael Davitt, another prominent member of the party, also spoke on that occasion, as follows: It was just 107 years ago today that the rebel peasants, pike in hand, stormed the enemy's position in Enniscorthy"". It is always ""the enemy's"" positionWe are proud of the valour they displayed; we reverence them for tEe lives they freely gave for Ireland; we bless their names and memories, and we proclaim here today, on soil made holy by the sacrifices so nobly offered up for Irish freedom, our loyalty to the principles for which they battled, and to the cause in which they f e l l. The cause of rebellion ! The Lord Mayor of Dublin also spoke on that occasionand may I again remind honourable members that these quotations are all taken from the Freeman's Journal, a Nationalist paper, and consequently cannot Le said be distorted. The Lord Mayor saidIt was a grand thing that such an crowd of people could come there from all counties ' in Leinster, and many other counties, to celebrate the memory of '9S, and he would be safe in saying that there was not a man there but would risk all that the men of '98 risked if the occasion required it. This is the view of another fairly prominent Irishman, who, under Home Rule, would no doubt take a leading part in the  chairman of the meeting, spoke as follows: All Ireland was proud of the heroic stand made for Ireland in that memorable year, and one of the objects of today's meeting was to show that, although they rejoiced in reverencing the memory of the mighty dead, they never forgot the cause for which they died, and in which they today renewed their fealty. That cause was as much alive today as it wasand here we get the comic elementwhen Father Murphy raised the flag, at Boolavogue. I say "" comic element,"" because those words have a swing about them which reminds one of the refrain of a comic song. Mr T. J. Condon, M.P.. speaking at a meeting of the United Irish League at Dualla, .County Tipperary, is reported in a Nationalist newspaper-the Cork Examiner-of the 14th June last, to have saidBut so long as the British flag floated over Dublin Castle, they would never rest satisfied until they pulled it down, and in its place raised aloft the flag of Ireland. He is another loyal supporter of the Imperial connection who will help to govern Ireland, if the Imperial Parliament, yielding to the representations of this and other Parliaments of the Empire, grants to that country what the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is pleased to call ""a just measure of Home Rule."" Mr Thomas O'Connor, in moving a vote of sympathy on the death' of Mr J. F. X. O'Brien, M.P., is reported to have spoken as follows: It was not necessary for him to tell what part James F. X. 'O'Brien took in the '67 movement. He, as they knew, stood in the dock for one of the noblest acts that an Irishman could be guilty of-h e appeared in open arms against Her Majesty the Queen. That is another sample of the loyalty of the friends of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable member for Coolgardie. Major MACBride, another of these loyalists, to whom so manv generous references have been [T,8] ' to made, speaking at the graveside of Wolfe Tone, is reported in the Freeman's Journal immense of the ioth July last to have saidHere by the grave of Tone he asked them to solemnly renew their vow of allegiance, and to promise that as long as God gave them health and strength they would never cease working until they had ousted foreign rule from Ireland. They had often been accused of foolishly urging on the country the necessity of appeals to arms. Thatwas not true. They had lamented, and still lamented, the waste of Irish money upon the parliamentary movement, the cost of elec-. tions, useless law expenses, and so on. Their contention was this, that if this countless wealth, i which was thrown away from O'Connor's time to our own time, were employed in maintaining what was left of our industries, and placing arms in the hands of the young Irishmen when an occ-ision like the Boer war arose, they in Ireland would be in a position to add a new Republic 10 the Republics of the West. Yet, we are told that these gentlemen are anxious to honour and maintain the Imperial connection ! Mr William O'Brien, M.P., writing to a Manchester correspondent on his policy of conciliator), said It is really too absurd to reply seriously to the grotesque accusation that my policy is to hand over the government of Ireland to th-j landlords. It only shows to what silly lengths my calumniators go. Of course, what my policy really means is to abolish the landlords as landlords altogether, and to welcome only those ex-landlords who are willing to join us in handing over the government of Ireland to an Irish Parliament. All this will be clear enough by-and-by. They are going to have only such landlords as will do the will of the Nationalist Party in Ireland; and "" all this,"" he tells us, "" will be clear enough by-and-by."" These statements only too strongly emphasize the need for the caution of the people of the northern part of Ireland which they evidence when they so strongly oppose the granting of that "" just measure of Home Rule "" which some honourable members are so desirous to see given. If the Imperial Parliarfient is foolish enough to grant Home Rule to Ireland before the leaders of nationalist opinion in that country have shown a different spiritin regard to the Imperial connection, "" all this will be clear enough byand-by."" I have put before the House the views of the Nationalist leaders of Ireland, and the quotations which I have read make it plain that the only measure of Home Rule which will satisfy them is complete separation from Englandcomplete local autonomy in all regards, even to the extent of making Ireland a separate nation.

67,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If the Prime Minister throws in his lot with the Labour Party and the Home Rulers, his constituents and the people of the Commonwealth will know what to think of him, and of those with whom he is associated.",23
68,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," Unfortunately a great deal of religious and racial feeling has in times past been imported into the discussion of the question of Home Rule for Ireland, which has not received that fair consideration to which it is entitled at the hands of thoughtful men. In this respect, however, a marked improvement has taken place within recent years, and, although some traces of the old bitterness remain, there has been a gradual evolution in the direction of according fairer treatment to the people of Ireland. As honourable members know, some years ago the mere fact that a person belonged to the Roman Catholic Church constituted a bar to the exercise of civil rights. This unjust provision gave rise to a great deal of bitterness on the part of those who were the subjects of the embargo. After considerable agitation, the full rights of citizenship were conceded to Roman Catholics, and, although the opponents of the reform predicted that its achievement would be followed by most disastrous results, its main effect has been to cement the union of the English and Irish races, and to make it stronger than before. A similar result has ensued from the disestablishment of the Irish Church. The Irish people were called upon to contribute to the support of a Church to which they were antagonistic, but after they had endured this injustice for a considerable time, the good sense of the British Parliament prevailed, and, despite all the evil predictions by treme opponents of the movement, the relief afforded to the people of Ireland had the effect of strengthening the bonds of Empire. With regard to the question whether the people of Ireland should have a more direct voice in the legislation specially relating to that country, I wish to clearly indicate my position. I have been a student of British politics for about thirty years, during which time. I have watched closely the trend of events. I have for some time held the view that the [n.8]- 2 great Imperial Parliament, which we all admire, and which contains some of the best and most capable men of our race, has to devote so much of its time to matters affecting the relations of Great Britain to other nations, and to other Imperial subjects, that purely domestic legislation has not received the attention to which it has been entitled. It has been impressed very strongly upon me that the difficulty which is now pressing on the people of Scotland and Ireland, and even of England and Wales, owing to the backwardness of domestic legislation, might be overcome by establishing in each of those countries Parliaments charged with the duty of looking after domestic matters, and by leaving the Imperial Parliament to deal with purely Imperial questions, which, in themselves, would be sufficient to occupy its attention. I do not, in this connection consider only the needs of Ireland. I have in view the necessities of other parts of the United Kingdom. I believe that by creating legislative machinery for the purpose of dealing with purely domestic matters a great improvement might be effected, and that what would be good for Ireland would also confer benefit upon Scotland.",23
69,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Scotlan d does not want Home Rule.,23
70,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If the honourable member were to investigate the matter, he would find that a large number of people in Scotland desire that the principle of Home Rule should be extended to that country. The British Parliament has so far recognised its inability to effectively meet the pressing demands of the people in regard to domestic legislation that it has conferred upon County Councils and other municipal bodies much greater powers than we in this democratic land would dream of intrusting to such institutions. This reform has, to a large extent, met the needs of Scotland and Ireland, as well as of England. In the large centres of popuexlation in the three countries the municipal bodies have been exercising functions such as are intrusted by us to our States Parliaments. This is particularly so in the case of London and Glasgow. In fact, if our States Governments attempted to proceed to the lengths to which some of the municipal bodies have gone the anti-Socialists amongst us would receive a shock from which they would not speedily recover. The experience gained in connection with these municipal bodies has led, not to the restriction, but rather to ths enlargement of their powers, because their intervention has been of a purely benevolent character. It has not been i:i the direction of protecting the interests of the few to the detriment of the masses, but the aim has been to improve the condition of the people, who have been unable to help themselves owing to the adverse influences exerted by their environment. The work of the local governing bodies has, in fact, been of a most beneficent character. The Imperial Parliament has, in the manner indicated, been relieved of a considerable amount of the work which it would otherwise have been called upon to discharge, but with which it wouJd_havc found it difficult to deal owing to the extent to which matters of Imperial importance monopolize attention. The question we now have to consider is the extent to which this wonderful development of local government will prove adequate to meet the necessities of the case. Whilst the local governing bodies are able to exercise a great influence within their own immediate spheres of operation, many questions relating to the interests of the people as a whole, and quite beyond the scope of any local organisation, demand attention from time to time. In such matters it is necessary at present to appeal tc the Imperial Parliament, which/as I have said, finds it difficult to devote sufficient time the discussion of domestic legislation. The principle of local government has been extended to Ireland with marked Benefit, and the experience gained there has furnished a satisfactory reply to the objections that have from time to time been raised that the people of Ireland are not to be trusted with self-governing powers. So far, the people of Ireland have shown not only that they possess the ability to govern' themselves, but that they can be relied upon to wisely exercise any such powers which may be conferred upon them. That is a fair indication that wider powers would be handled in the same way by the Irish people. I have no sympathy with the suggestion that Irishmen are not to be trusted to do justice to themselves, and that therefore it would be unwise to arm them with large self-governing powers. Empire itself owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Irish people for the administrative ability which has been drawn from their ranks. Amongst those who have contributed to Britain's greatness must be numbered many leading Irishmen who have rendered yeoman service in various parts Mr Brown. of the Empire, and at the principal centre of government itself. In view of that fact it is unreasonable to urge that Irishmen are not to be trusted with powers of self-government, and that their loyalty cannot be relied upon. The honourable member for Wentworth laid considerable stress upon that aspect of the case. He quoted a number of extracts from newspapers in support of his contention that the professions of loyalty on the part of leading Irish representative men concealed a deep-seated disloyalty, that would find expression upon the first convenient opportunity. I claim that, whilst upon either side a few individuals may go to extremes, the true position is not to be judged by the views which they enunciate. Ireland has given undoubted evidence of her loyalty to the British Empire through her politicians, who have taken a leading part in the administration of the various self-governing colonies, and in that of the centre of the Empire itself, and also through many men who have distinguished themselves in the British army and navy. Irishmen have ever responded to the call of the Empire, and have manfully borne their share of defending and extending its bounds. Because a few individuals-probabl y labouring under a deep sense of injustice-hav e chosen to to adopt an extreme attitude, is the whole nation to be judged by their utterances? I will not allow my opinions to be warped by the extreme statements, either of those who are super-loyal, or of those who are disloyal. I am content to judge by results, and those results compel me to the belief that the Irish people, as a whole, are prepared to loyally work for the upbuilding of the Empire. What they ask for, in respect of larger powers of self government, is a bare act of justice. It is because I recognise the advantage of giving them those powers that I favour this proposition. I support it, not merely because I desire to see a complete measure of autonomy granted to Ireland, but because I wish to confer upon other parts of the United Kingdom, whose needs are quite as imperative as are those of Ireland itself, a The similar boon. If we were asked to grant a separate Parliament to Ireland for the purpose of completely separating that country from the Empire, I should say distinctly that I did not favour_ such a proposal' I believe that the best interests of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and those of England itself, find expression in the union which has ^been feffected. That union) should be maintained for the general advantage of their people. Whilst it is true that it has not been without blemish, I claim that the advantages conferred by it - more than counterbalance any injustices which may have been perpetrated under it. I repeat that no movement on the part of Ireland or Scotland, in the direction of separation from the mother country, would receive any support from me. But the motion which is under consideration does notaim at that result. It simply requests that a greater measure of self-government should be extended to Ireland.",23
71,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Some of the speeches which have been made in support of it go much further.,25
72,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I have not heard those speeches, although I have been present during nearly the whole of the debate. I am not prepared to do an injustice because some individuals who, upon this question, entertain views similar to my own adopt an extreme course. If they push their ex-' treme views to an issue they will find that I am in opposition to them. There was ' one point in the address of the leader of the Opposition which appealed very strongly to me. I do not share the view that we are not even remotely interested in the affairs of the Empire, and that we should leave all matters which immediately relate to the Home Government severely alone. I say that we have a right to express our opinions in a respectful way. At the same time, I think we ought to be careful how we exercise that right. We ought not to exercise it needlessly, but only upon occasions when there is some justification for so doing. I claim that we had a right to approach the Home Government in regard to the introduction of Chinese labour into South Africa. Indeed, in my opinion, it was our duty to act as we did, because, bysending troops to assist the Imperial authoritice ties during the Boer war, the condition of affairs which had previously obtained in South Africa under the rule of Mr Kruger and the President of the Orange Rivei Free State had been completely altered. Thus, whilst I agree with the leader of the Opposition that we should not unduly interfere in British politics-especiall y at a time when they are likely to assume an acute form- I say that upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland'we do not intervene on those lines. By the terms of the motion under discussion we are merely invited to express our appreciation of the benefits that would attend an extension of the powers of local government, with which the British Parlia? ment has seen fit to endow a number of its possessions. We are simply asked to affirm, as the result of our own experience, that if a wider measure of local government were extended fo Ireland the British people would benefit thereby, and the stability of the Empire would be strengthened. In making that affirmation we should not be exceeding our legitimate functions. If we were invited to take an active part in influencing opinions in the old countrywhich is primarily concerned in this matter- I should not be prepared to support the proposal, and I should be at one with the leader of the Opposition in deprecating any such interference. In the course of his remarks the honourable member for Wentworth declared that the Labour Party would vote solidly upon this question. I am a member of that party, and if it is going to record a solid' vote upon this motion the honourable member knolws more than I do. . As a matter of fact, the question has never been discussed by members of the Labour Party. I have not been approached by a single individual as to the attitude which I would adopt towards this motion. It cannot be said that Home Rule for Ireland is part and parcel of tfie politics of the Labour Party, for the party, as such, has no more considered the question than has any other section of the House. There is one sentence of the motion which ought certainly to be deleted. I refer to the wordsBut the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland. I admit that since the Act of Union Ireland has, perhaps, suffered greater injusthan has any other part of the British Empire. The desires and aspirations of its people have undoubtedly been misunderstood, and religious bias and racial feeling have certainly led to the perpetration of injustice. But, whilst this is so, I realise that the great body of British electors outside Ireland-and even many British politicians, in whose hands the destinies pf the Empire largely rest today-recognise the grievances of the Irish people, and are prepared ""to attempt to redress them. I do not admit that'future British Parliaments are likely to be less ready to do justice to the Irish people than is the Parliament of today. Unfortunately, it has not been, and is not now, a thoroughly democratic Parliament in the sense that we understand the term. The English Constitution provides for a Parliament one of the Houses of which consists of men who, by reason only of their birth, are called upon to legislate. These men belong to the great - landed classes, and, naturally, their numbers are being augmented from time to time by the wealthy sections of the community. They are class representatives pure and simple, and voice the opinions of only a very small section of the people. Notwithstanding this fact, their right of veto is such that they can practically block all legislation, and it is only when the breaking-point is reached that they recognise that discretion is the better part of valour, and give way to the House of Commons. The House of Commons is not nearly so democratic as are a number of the Legislatures of Australia. In the first place, there is an inequality of electorates. Some of the electorates comprise very large populations, while others embrace but a small number of electors. In these circumstances, there can be no equality of voting power. Another point is that a large section of the British people are not qualified under the electoral law to exercise the franchise. The whole of the female portion of the community is excluded from that privilege. Nevertheless the House of Commons is becoming more and more' democratic. Fuller expression is being given to the opinions of ""the people, and-as tKe evolutionary tendencies of democracy extend the British Parliament must become more and more a reflex of the views of the whole people. Having regard tb all these facts, it seems to me to be probable that before very long the Parliament will more truly represent the desires of the people of the United Kingdom than it does at the present time. I trust that the mover of the motion will agree to the deletion of the words I have mentioned, and, in order to lest the matter, I beg to move That the words "" But the sad history of since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively with the economic and social conditions land,"" be left out.",25
73,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I would remind the honourable member that there is alreadv amendment before the Chair to omit all the Commonwealth. - words after the word "" That,"" line i . Until that amendment has been dealt with I cannot receive that which the honourable member has just submitted.",26
74,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I desire, sir, to intimate that at the proper time. I shall move that the words I have read be left out.",26
75,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I shall take care, when putting the motion, that the honourable member for Canobolas is not prevented from moving his amendment.",26
76,Mr LEE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," In the course of his speech, the honourable member for Canobolas said that the subject of the motion was one that could not well be dissociated from religious considerations. Every British subject is entitled to hold whatever religious views he pleases, and in my opinion every man should have the right to give free expression to his religious beliefs. A man's religion should be sacred to him. It cannot be said that the views expressed in the motion are those held by the people of the Commonwealth. They may represent the opinion of some honourable members, but it cannot be denied that the question of Home Rule has never been submitted to the people. The subject is one that has been discussed again and again in the British Parliament, and has led to the defeat of more than one Ministry. It is likely to come prominently before the people at the approaching general elections in Great Britain, for we may be sure that the Nationalist Party will take care that it is not allowed to remain in the background. It would be just as reasonable for the British Parliament, at a time when the Tariff Commission is taking evidence with regard to the fiscal issue, to send a message to this Legislaturerequesting us to give a greater measure of free-trade to the people, as.it would be for us to request the British Parliament to grant a measure of Home Rule to Ireland. We know that there is much dissatisfaction in New South Wales with reference to the delay in determining the site of the Federal Capital, and I should like to know what honourable members would say if .the British Parliament sent a message requesting us to establish Ireland the Federal Capital where the people of deal that State desire it. If such a message of Irewere received, I am sure that the House would ignore it, just as the British Parliament has from time to time ignored mesan sages sent to it by the Parliaments of the",26
77,Mr CROUCH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,They did not ignore the message sent intimating our willingness to despatch' troops to South Africa.,27
78,Mr LEE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We took that action of our own free will. It is true that many people were opposed to it, and I should like to 4 know whether the honourable and learned member was i i i favour of the sending of troops to South Africa. That is an awkward question for him to answer. It is a well-known fact that the difference of opinion with regard to the question of Home Rule has led to the disruption, of great liberal party in England. That party has never recovered from the blow dealt it by Mr Gladstone's proposal to grant Home Rule to Ireland. Mr Chamberlain regarded the proposal as one that was likely to lead to the destruction of the Empire, and rather than support it he severed his connection with the liberal party. The late Lord bury, in the course of a speech a few years ago, .also said that 2,000,000 of - Her Majesty's subjects in Ireland were opposed to Home Rule. Considering that these are the views of men who have guided the affairs of the nation, it would ill become us to transmit such a message as this to the British Parliament in the absence of any mandate from the people of Australia. The late Lord Randolph Churchill took a great interest in the question of Home Rule, and, as the result of a tour which he made through Ireland, declared that if it were conceded there would be bloodshed there. He found, in the course of his tour through the country, that the desire was not so much for local government as for an independent Parliament that would lead ultimately to separation. The honourable member for Canobolas referred to the position of Scotland, but no one can say that any demand has been made either by the people of Scotland or of Wales for Home Rule. each were granted a measure of Home Rule, the United Kingdom would be disrupted, and would soon be a thing of the past. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who; in submitting the motion, put his case very fairly, declared that "" England does not understand Ireland."" It seems to me, however, that Ireland does not understand England. She has never done so; she has never recognised that the whole history of England for the last 1,000 years is one long record of a sturdy fight for freedom. The English people fought for freedom throughout the days of the Tudors and the Stuarts, and those tyrants were consumed in the flames of liberty. England has been the beacon light of freedom to other nations, and has always been in the van of liberty. Ireland will never truly understand her until she recognises that the people of that land sympathize with her, and are anxious to do all they can to make her a happy and prosperous community. The great cause of the Irish trouble is that Ireland was conquered and subdued by the England, the Saxon placing his foot upon the neck of the Celt. Nothing will ever satisfy the Irish until they get separation. It is more than local self-government for which they ask; they wish to be separated from the Empire, and to become a distinct nation. But the Nationalist party in Ireland has lost one of its chief supporters. SalisThe Methodist, a great and influential organ of the Non-Conformist party in England, used to advocate the claims of Home Rule, and, when the education question was before the Imperial Parliament, asked the Nationalists to protect the Non-Conformists from being compelled to pay for the support of denominational schools, in which they did not believe. The Nationalists, however, refused the in. assistance, and therefore this great organ, and the section which it represents, wiped their hands of Home Rule, and would have nothing to do with people who were so selfish as to refuse to stand by their friends. Ireland does not understand England. For the last twenty or thirty years England has been trying in every way to pacify Ireland. To-day the Irish land laws are more liberal and more generous to the tenants than any others on the face of the earth. No landlord in Ireland can raise his rent of his own motion; he must have it appraised by arbitration. The Imperial ParliaIf ment has lately voted ,£112,000,000 to enable the Irish peasants to become their own landlords; but Mr Redmond, when out here, while admitting that Ireland has the best land laws in the world, said that the people of Ireland would not be satisfied with what had been done for them, because they wish to govern themselves. I object to the slur thai has been cast on the name of Irishmen by some who have spoken, and seem to think that Irishmen cannot be trusted. They have proved themselves worthy of trust, and I am proud to be the son of an Irishman. But Ireland's hatred and bitterness against England is being fomented by agitators. The honourable member for Southern Melbourne sneered at a large section of the people of Ireland. He spoke about the Orangemen, and about a vile oath which he said they had to take. He can never have read the Orange oath. If he had he would not have spoken in that way. I am an Orangeman, and am not ashamed of the fact.. My obligations as an Orangeman bind me to act as a loyal subject of the King for the preservation of Protestant line on the English throne. It is an Orangeman's duty to see that the constitutional monarchy of England is supported as by law established. Orangeman should feel no bitterness towards his Roman Catholic brethren.",27
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,They do.,28
80,Mr LEE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Tru e Orangemen do not. They would see that Roman Catholics, as well as other people, had their rights. There may be unworthy Orangemen, as there are unworthy Presbyterians; but there should be no bitterness in the hearts of Orangemen against those who differ from them on questions of religion. One great reason why I am opposed to the granting of Home Rule to Ireland is that a great number of my co-religionists there are opposed to it. Why should I try to fasten on them a system of government of which they disapprove? I should be unworthy of the name of Protestant if I did so. The sooner we have a vote on this motion the better; but I shall find no fault with honourable members for speaking or voting in regard to it as they think fit.",28
81,Mr KING OMALLEY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I was in New York many years ago, when Mr. O'Brien and Mr Dillon escaped from K i l mainham Gaol, and I remember Governor Hill receiving them, and the terrible speeches which were made against England. The people of New York were worked up into a perfect flame of excitement over the matter, until, not only Irishmen, but Germans, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, and even Englishmen felt bitterly towards that country.",28
82,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That sort of excitement is worked up in America before every presidential election. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Honourable members opposite are continually speaking of the desirability of an alliance with the United States, so that this country may have the assistance of the foremost civilized nation on God's green earth in the days of its troubles and misfortunes; but it would be easier to gain the friendship of savages than to win that country over, so long as we refuse to do justice to the land which gave birth to about 20,000,000 of its foremost citizens. I am for Home Rule for Ireland, not because I have suffered injustice from England, but because I think there will never be any hope for Great Britain until every element within the Empire is satisfied. We can never be a firm nation until that happens. Many years ago, the Bismarck, speaking to an American about the probability of England controlling the Continent, as she controlled it after the defeat of Napoleon, said, "" England is a But an nation of the past. She never can again have a voice in the management of Continental Europe while she has a dissatisfied and rebellious Ireland at her door.""",28
83,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Englan d has the biggest voice today in European affairs. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There - are only 4,000,000 people in Ireland, so that if they were given Home Rule, and proved unfit to govern themselves, rebelling against England, the 4,000,000 Scotch, and the 40,000,000 Englishmen and Welshmen would be able to surround the country with their ships and blow it into the sea.",28
84,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,We do not wish to do that.,28
85,Mr KING OMALLEY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If Ireland is not fit to govern herself, her people wil) start to fight until, like the Kilkenny cats, there is nothing left but their tails. Then we can repopulate the place.",28
86,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Is that the object of the motion ?,28
87,Mr KING OMALLEY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Do honourable members mean to contend that although Irishmen are capable of governing England. Scotland, Wales, Australia, Canada, and the United States, they are not capable of governing Ireland? When the English soldiers were sent to South Africa they proved to be rank failures, until an Irishman was set at the head of them. The Empire exists for the sake of the Irish. God sent them into the world to rule it, and they are going to rule it. Ireland is poor and England is rich; Ireland has produce to sell, and England has money with which to buy it. England wants the produce and Ireland wants the money; Ireland is willing to supply England, and England is willing to take her supplies from Ireland. These things being so, it is preposterous, in this age of intelligence, to talk of Ireland wishing to separate from the British Empire. She does not wish to do that. A few years ago, Canada rebelled against England. Why? Because England was not dolivion. ing her justice. But since Canada has had the right of self-government, there has been no rebellion, and that counher try is today one of the happiest and most prosperous in the Empire. Canada would have seceded from the Empire, as the forces United States did, if she had been treated as some honourable members wish to treat the Irish people. I am for Home Rule because I wish to make the Empire strong. The representatives of New South Wales, who seem to be poisoned with parochialboys, ism, would rise up from the shades and shadows of the shark-ridden harbour that country if Victoria attempted to vern it, and would come across the fronthe tier with an army 20,000 strong. I wish to see an Empire created which will live for ever; but, to secure that, no portion of it must be allowed to remain dissatissome fied. Make every part happy, and each people rule themselves. We heard a great deal to the effect that there is in Ireland a section_who do not desire Home Rule. I honestly believe that, Home Rule is granted, that section govern Ireland. There has been only one Roman Catholic leader there - Daniel you. O'Connell. All the other great men of Ireland have been Protestants. that a great meeting of Orangemen and Roman Catholics could be convened, cause I believe that, if Protestants Catholics could be brought together to matters over, they would 'in the end shake hands and have a good time, as the Russian and Japanese plenipotentiaries have had America. When they were first introduced by President Roosevelt at Oyster Bay, they would hardly speak; but, after the terms of peace had been agreed upon, shook hands, and kissed each other, and had a grand time, each discovering that other was not a bad fellow after all. I lxilieve that if the Right Worshipful Grandmaster of the Loval Oiiange Instispeaks tution and Archbishop Carr and Cardinal Moran were brought together, they would have a good time. They would find that there was very little, difference between rhem- a difference so slight that it could, easily be ignored. I shall vote for the motion, because I believe that if Home Rule be granted to Ireland, it will tend perpetuate the British Empire. We all know, from our reading of history, that Rome rose to a glorious pre-eminence only to totter and fall into the ocean of obHer downfall was brought about by the same human frailty that is now threatening to wreck the British Empirefailure to do justice to some of the people under her sway. When her subjects flocked to other nations, they husbanded their until they were able to turn and rend their former conquerors. When the American war was over Home Rule was refused to some of the southern States, which were governed from Washington, but the people organized their Kuklux clans, their Nighttheir Moonshiners, their Sevenhill Butchers, their Kentucky Fliers, and of their Vigilance Committees, and nearly goevery night some of the leading men from north were shot in the south. When President Hayes was elected, in 1876, he gave Home Rule to the southern States, of which are now the most loyal in let the American Union. If you satisfy the have people that you trust them, and have faith in them, they will respond, but if you always watch them, and charge them if with disloyalty, you will arouse every will sentiment of manhood in them, and as soon as they can they will turn and rend I shall vote for Home Rule.",28
88,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I have no deI wish sire to speak at any length, nor would I have spoken at all but for some remarks bewhich have fallen from other honourable and members. I do not propose to deal with talk the merits of the question of Home Rule in the abstract. That is a large subject, and its discussion would occupy too much in time. .Moreover, it is not necessary to deal with it in order to discuss the motion from my point of view. It seems to me that the terms in which it is couched are objectionthey able. It must be remembered that it is proposed to send forth from this House an the expression of opinion, not from a single individual, but from a deliberative and responsible assembly-the assembly which with the authoritative voice of the Australian Commonwealth. Therefore, we should first pay regard to the question whether a motion of this kind can, with propriety, be tabled; and, secondly, the wording of the resolution should be very carefully considered. It wil] be found that the resolution contains a charge of injustice to against the Imperial Legislature. That is a most serious matter, and, in itself, would afford sufficient reason to induce me to vote against it. The second paragraph of the motion reads as follows:We have observed with feelings of profound dom are concerned. satisfaction the evidence afforded by recent lation and recent debates in the Houses of liament of the United Kingdom of a sincere desire now to dea! justly with Ireland. An. ordinary reader would at once interthe pret those words as meaning that only recent legislation and recent evidenced any desire on the part of the British Parliament to deal justly with to the people? Irelandi That interpretation is emphasized by the inclusion of the word "" now in the phrase, "" a sincere desire now to justly with Ireland."" That implies that hitherto there has been no such desire. It proceedsappears to me that the statement conveys deliberate and direct insult to the British Parliament, and I am surprised that any purposeshonorable member should have had the audacity to submit a motion couched such objectionable terms, and implytions. ing such charges. Parliament passed a resolution, of this but character, dealing with some legislation derstand within the special domain of the Commonsocial wealth, and such a resolution were officially conveyed to us, we should not only resent it, but we should be fully justified in doing so.",29
89,Mr THOMAS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Shoul d we not deal courteously with any message we might ceive from the British Parliament?,30
90,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Yes ; if it dealt legior timately with a matter within the purview of the Imperial Parliament. Such a mesgross sage as that embodied in the resolution now before us would not, however, deserve courteous reception, because it conveys insult. It states, by inference, that Imperial Parliament has dealt unjustly, and has always desired to deal unjustly, with Ireland. I submit that there is justification for any such statement. A though many regrettable mistakes have been made in the past in connection with legislation dealing with Irish affairs, they have not been due to deliberate attempts ment. on the part of the British Parliament to deal unjustly with Ireland, but have arisen from misconception, or from misunderlocal standings of one. kind or another. I think it would be unwise, as well as discourteous, to pass such a resolution as that before The motion proceedsand in particular we congratulate the people the United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land tionI do not see any cause for congratulation* so far as the people of the United KingThat measure may legishave been designed with the very best inPartentions, but I feel sure that it will not bring about the desired results. We might very well congratulate the landlords upon passing of such an Act, but the people of the United Kingdom have no cause to debates had feel particularly elated.",30
91,Mr MALONEY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Will it not do any good,30
92,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I do not think it will "" do any good to the people of the United deal Kingdom, although it will, no doubt, benefit the landlords of Ireland. The motion a and on the concession to the people of Ireland of a measure of local government for municipal Certainly that is a matter regarding which in we may cordially express our congratulaThe next sentence, however, reads If the British as follows:the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can unor effectively deal with the economic or conditions of Ireland. That is a sweeping charge against the British Parliament, for which there is no justification. Although mistakes have been made in the past, I believe that the British Parliament is perfectly capable of underrestanding and effectively dealing with the economic and social conditions of Ireland, of any other part of the Empire over which it has jurisdiction. It would be a impertinence on the part of this Parliament to attempt to interfere in legislaa tion which is solely within the sphere of an ithe Imperial Parliament. Every honour the able member of this House would resent any attempt on the part of the British Parliament to interfere .with, matters of Comno monwealth concern, over which we have l - direct control, and I decline to become a party to the passing of anyresolutionwhich might result in our receiving a well-deserved snub at the hands of the Imperial ParliaThe sentence which I have last quoted, clearly points to the fact that it is not Home Rule for Ireland in the sense of self-government, but separation, that is desired by those responsible for the motion. I am supported in that belief us. by the remarks of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne. The honourable member for Canobolas, in response to an of interjection on my part to the effect that separation was desired, said that he had quesnot noticed anything that would suggest that idea, and he said further that he was absolutely opposed to separation. I would direct his attention to the remarks made by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, reported at page 1793 of Hansard, as follows:The most effective way of bringing about Imperial separation is by insisting, in certain circumstances, upon legislative union. On the other hand, the best way to make a lasting and true Imperial union is to grant legislative separation. The experience of the world proves that.",30
93,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"It has been denied that legislative separation only is sought for. Later on the honourable member for Southern Melbourne said:The best way in which to bring about Imperial union is to grant legislative separation. Any man who chooses to seriously consider this great problem will find that the history, of the world demonstrates the truth of my statement. Those who cavil at it are flying in the face of all history. I repeat that the surest way to Imperial union is through legislative separation. These remarks clearly convey the impression that what is really desired by those who favour Home Rule for Ireland is separation from the mother country.",31
94,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member for Southern Melbourne is not a separationist.,31
95,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I have quoted from his speech. On page 1795 of Hansard, the honourable member makes a further reference to this matter. He says :We desire an Anglo-Celtic Federation- a union with America-wEic h is bound to come.",31
96,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member wishes to see the two peoples separate in order that they mav unite.,31
97,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Certainly . - Mr JOHNSON - That is a most peculiar position to take up.,31
98,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I will show that it is a scientific attitude.,31
99,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member wishes Ireland and England to go to the National Divorce Court in order to be re-married.,31
100,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is really the situation. A little later the honourable member said :The proposal now before the House is really one to tear up the paper of union in order to accomplish a union of interests and of hearts which will last for all time.,31
101,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Is that not possible under existing conditions?,31
102,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,No .,31
103,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Then it will never exist.,31
104,Mr RONALD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I have said that there must be a breaking up process before a real union can be reached. These quotations serve to show that the controlling idea in the minds of some honourable members who desire to see Home Rule granted to Ireland is to bring about separation from the Imperial union. The ostensible reason advanced by them is that it is necessary to break up a union that already exists, for the purpose of establishing another union. I maintain that such a contention is puerile.",31
105,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is not the contention of the leaders of the Home Rule movement.,31
106,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I am speaking only . of the views which have been expressed by some honourable members in this House.,31
107,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I do not think that the honourable member has correctly interpreted the speech of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne.,31
108,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I endeavoured to ascertain his actual meaning when he was addressing the House, and in answer to mv interjection he 'stated that there should be a divorce between Ireland and England for the purpose of enabling them to be remarried. That is a singular attitude to adopt. If two parties are satisfied with each other there is no need for a divorce. Whenever a divorce becomes necessary, there must be dissatisfaction between the parties who are directly interested. Under these circumstances I must assume that the basic . object of this motion is to assist in bringing about a separation between Ireland and the mother country. I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of Home Rule at the present moment. I submit that to carry this motion would be an impertinence on the part of the House. If similar action were taken By the British Parliament in respect to any matter under the control of the Commonwealth, I am confident that it would be justly resented by us. I support the amendment of the leader of the Opposition. His proposal puts <m diplomatic language the sentiments which I hold, and to which I have endeavoured to give expression in the brief time at my disposal. Should that amendment be defeated, I am certainly of opinion that there will still remain plenty of room for further amendment of the motion, and I shall move in the direction of having the word "" now,"" line 15, deleted. The inclusion of that word conveys an imputation of injustice which is not warranted, and to which even if it were warranted-it would not be good taste upon our part to give expression. Further, it does not come within our province_ as a Legislature to express such an opinion, nor to interfere uninvited with legislative matters solelv within the province of the British Parliament, and not affecting the Australian Commonwealth or its interests.",31
109,Mr CULPIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I did not intend to address myself to this question, and should not have done so had a division upon it been taken earlier. I dissent from the view expressed by the last speaker, that Home Rule is synonymous with separation from the Imperial Union.. As a Home Ruler and a follower of the late Mr Gladstone, I should have been very glad to see Ireland granted a complete measure of autonomy in his day. doubtedly Home Rule would have been carried then had it not been for the action of the renegade Mr Joseph Chamberlain.",32
110,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member's party supports Mr Chamberlain on the question of preferential trade.,32
111,Mr CULPIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am discussing Home Rule just now. The leader of the Oppopresent sition, in the amendment which he has mitted, has advanced reasons why a petito tion should not be presented to the in favour of granting .Home Rule to land. I disagree with the last of those reasons, which readsBecause this House confidently relies upon fairness and wisdom of the British people the removal of every just Irish grievance manner most likely to promote the welfare Irish people, and the stability of the Empire. We all remember what occurred a year ago, when this House was called upon to exto press its opinion in regard to the action of the Imperial authorities dn introducing Chinese labour into the Transvaal. Suboneself sequent events have proved that we were thoroughly justified in the action which"" we one's motives. took upon that occasion. In taking that action we recognised that the last reason advanced by the leader of the Opposition than light. is an incorrect statement. We cannot condeavour fidently rely upon the fairness of the House of Lords; neither can we rely upon the fairness and wisdom of the House of Commissiles mons in all things. That body does not represent the British people in the same that this Parliament represents the elecfectly tors of the Commonwealth. We enjoy a liberal Constitution, and we wish to see every other constituent of the British pire placed in a similar position* When which I shall cast my vote. a measure of Home Rule is granted to Iresired land-as it will be some day- I trust that its Constitution will be similar to our own. I do not altogether agree with the followtion that I now hold. ing statement in the motion of the honordebate able and learned member for Northern Melbourne:But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows lhat no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland. I cannot regard that statement as a strictly accurate one, because in 1866 the British Parliament passed the law which disestablished the Church of England in Ireland, and we must all admit that that extended a great measure'of justice to that country. Un- In all other respects, however, I agree with the terms of the motion.",32
112,Mr DEAKI N,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I regret that, owing to. the pressure of my duties, it was not until last evening that I realized the possibility that this discussion would be brought to' a conclusion today. Otherwise I should have endeavoured to prepare myself to the arguments that commend themsubselves to me better than I have been abledo in the interim. In my opinion, this King question is - one of the utmost imIreportance to us from more points of view than those which have yet been submitted'.. First, as to procedure and its implications^, the' and next as to the merits of the motion. for We all realise the risks of a discussion of in the this kind-risk s to which my personal atof the tention was called by the honourable member for Wentworth. It is not easy in a brief expression oh a question of this magnitude make oneself clearly understood by those whose desire it is to fairly follow an argument; it is still less possible to protect against those who are determined to misunderstand .both one/s 'argument and The motion introduces a new issue that has aroused, and is likely to continue to arouse, too often, more heat Consequently those ""who ento take an independent, impartial, and, I believe, a patriotic view of this great subject, expose themselves to the of both parties, with whom it has ceased to be a question of argument, and"" way has become a matter pf emotion. Perwell aware of that, I nevertheless feel it impossible to allow the debate to close, as I otherwise would gladly do, withEmout offering to the House the grounds upon I had deto remain silent until the close of the debate, because, in this matter, I speak; of course, quite apart from the official posiI enter into the as any private member might do,. and express no opinion other than my own. I am not aware how most of my colleagues will vote. I have not sought to discover from them or from others the tendency of their views. So far as I know, few honourable members are acquainted with my own opinions on this question. I have made no secret of them, but, as it happens, have not been canvassed-o r at all events, am not conscious that I have-by representatives of either party. The motion was submitted by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in a speech worthy of the House, and one that would .have been worthy of that great House of Commons, where the matter will one day be decided. It presented a case that, on its merits, must have appealed to every fair-minded man, and was f o llowed by a succession of speechesnotably that delivered by the honourable and learned member for Angas-that were closely reasoned and eloquent. tion resolves itself into three paragraphs, each of which has a distinct character. In the first the honourable and learned member invites us to present an address to His Majesty; in the second, we are invited to record our opinions in regard to certain historical questions, while in the third we approach directly a proposal that we should urge the wisdom of granting to Ireland a just measure of Home Rule. Those three propositions, important in themselves, have been countered by another series of three contained in an amendment submitted by the right honourable member for East Sydney. The first of these sets forth that it is not within the legitimate province of this House to deal"" with the question. We are next invited to say tnat for another reason - the approach ot a general election in the mother country-w e are incompetent to deal with it , and, thirdly, the right honourable member calls upon us to say that we rely upon the British people to deal with the question in an equitable manner. At the very outset, the amendment moved by the right honourable member for East Sydney throws out a challenge as to the constitutionality as well as the wisdom-the propriety as well as the correctness-*-of the procedure proposed. That appears to me a consideration of the utmost importance to the House. It involves the creation of another precedent that will always be quoted, and by which we shall, so far as lies in our power, mark out the limits of the extraneous scope of this Parliament. Is it within the constitutional competence of a Legislature such as ours, created expressly by Statute, with specially defined authority, to deliberate, and, having deliberated, to decide, and, having decided, to forward a petition to His Majesty the King asking that official notice may be taken of and effect given to our prayer. We have few illustrations to guide us_ with which I am acquainted, and certainly very few from the experience of the Commonwealth The right of every subject to petition the Throne is unquestioned. There can be, and should be, neither a limitation nor an attempt to limit that appeal. No one will suggest that it is not competent for the people of the Commonwealth to approach the Throne with any petition which they may choose to present on any subject whatever.",32
113,Mr HIGGINS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That has been contested The mo- by the leader of the Opposition.,33
114,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I disagree, and state my position. By becoming citizens of the Commonwealth, we have not ceased to be in some sense, at all events, citizens of the British Empire.",33
115,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We are proposing to forward this petition, not as citizens, but as members of this Parliament.",33
116,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am coming to lhat, first taking the preliminary point that we have not sacrificed our individual and independent right to petition the Throne in respect to this or any other subject. The contention of the right honourable member for East Sydney is that, as a Legislature of definite endowment, we do not possess the right to intervene in a question which must be decided by another Legislature, and that the supreme Legislature of the Empire. We have, as I have already said, some slight experience to guide us that is worthy of recall, and upon which, so far as I am aware, there has not been laid, during the course of this debate, the stress that it seems to me to deserve. No later than the beginning of last year, the Premier of New Zealand appealed to the Commonwealth Government, during the recess, to join with him, to use his own words, in makingprotest against introduction Chinese work Rand mines, urge strongly Imperial Government use prerogative prevent that. . . . I am quoting only the material words of a cablegram which Mr Seddon addressed to the Commonwealth Government. To this message we replied-for I happened at that time to hold the same office that I now self-governing colonies to explain their opinion occupyWe have hitherto refrained from making representations to Imperial Government to this effect, because of danger of establishing precedent of appeal to Imperial Government for defeat of proposed law of another colony. Of course, the exercise of prerogative of the Crown in respect to legislation of self-governing and Crown colony differs essentially. Precedent in this case would be of very limited application, but as this action initiates new and grave departure, consider best to proceed with special caution. Under existing circumstances, beg to urge joint protest against Chinese immigration into Transvaal in form to be agreed to be communicated to its Government, and send copies to the self-governing colonies. I may say, for the information of honorcognised able members, that I am quoting from liamentary Papers 1904, Vol. 2, pages opinion. 1641-2-3. On the 15th January, the Premier of New Zealand agreed with us that the form of procedure was difficult, and opinions. went on to say that If Transvaal was self-governing colony would exist of laying down inconvenient precedent, but being Crown colony there is little of representations being made by Crown as to legislative or administrative action governing colonies there is precedent for governing colonies expressing opinion on matters connected with a Crown colony. He then proceeded to make reference resolution in regard to the Pacific Islands. On the 16th January, we replied suggesting the message that should be sent to Cape Colony, the Transvaal, and the other Gochosen vernments concerned. In the course of this, we saidThough most reluctant travel beyond their own boundaries in order to introduce themselves matters having local import, the responsible isters of Commonwealth in discharge their to nation feel compelled express deep apprehenopinions sion results which will follow introduction Chinese to Transvaal. I make these brief quotations in order indicate the line of argument then pursued, the Empire. and the course adopted. The message, suggested by us was accepted by N'.w Zeaknd, and communicated to the Govevnments coning cerned, who replied through the Colonial ferent view ? Secretary of Pretoria that they, had considered our message in Executive Council, and proceeded to give us a polite and argumatters mentative answer. The Premier of Zealand, still adhering to his original idea from. of seeking the intervention of the Imperial Government, communicated with the Secreand tary of State for the Colonies, and received a reply from him dated 27th January- I have received your telegram conveying view which your Government has formed with repnrd to the introduction Chinese labour into Transvaal; I fully recognise the title of all Mr Deakin. < on so important a question, and especially of those who, like New Zealand, rendered memorable services in the South African war. Finally, in a document. bearing date 20th May, 1904, the Secretary of State for the Colonies communicated with the Commonwealth saying thatWhile His Majesty's Government full y recognise the right of the Legislature of the Australian Commonwealth to express their opinion on so important a' matter as the introduction of Chinese labour into the Transvaalthey regretted that for reasons set forth, they could not agree to our request.

124,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Presently. What distinguishes our intervention in the case of the Transvaal from the action now proposed to be taken is tfiaf iii that we were dealing, as I pointed out in telegram, with the affairs of a Crown Colony, whereas now we are asked to. appeal to the Government of the supreme Legislaliament ture of the Empire. I do not undermanner value that difference. While a right express our opinion in regard to important questions affecting another portion of Empire which is not a self-governing munity is recognised, that does not seem to me a sufficient precedent in itself justify us, without qualification, in posing in the manner suggested by the orable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. We are being moved to take what seems to me an unnecessary step, which the only precedent is what has been done by Canada.",35
125,Mr HIGGINS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"On two occasions, an intervening period of twenty-two years.",35
126,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"There is a precedent the action of Canada, which in the instance was met with a protest, the second occasion no protest was made. But in this instance we should endeavour stand on the safest ground we can find, it appears to me that one reason for approaching His Majesty the King in manner proposed is that the motion affects questions of policy which brought the sent Imperial Government-wh o will have deal with this matter-int o existence, probably keep them there. Urider these circumstances, the reply which we shall be Act. almost certain to receive will be hi accordance with the main principles of that policy. While-1 do not know that exception could governing dependencies of the Empire has be taken to. a request so moderately worded, and based upon such eminently reasonable and fair considerations as this is, it is too much to expect the Imperial Government to return an answer implying that it will affect any action they may take, while we might be told that it is scarcely our part to ask them to alter their course to meet our views.",35
127,Mr HIGGINS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We wish to speak to the people of England, not to the Ministry. . Mr DEAKIN - I am about to come and to that point. My honourable and learned friend would not have weakened his case, and would have lost no publicity if, instead of proposing to follow the Canadian prehe had asked the House to adopt the course which has been pursued in another Chamber-to which I suppose I may indirectly allude-wher e it has been sought to place on record a simple expression of case the opinions of members. I am sure that my my honourable and learned friend must feel that we are justified in taking into account the fact that the other branch of the Parhas approached this question in a different from that in which to we have been asked to deal with .it. I do not pretend to decide between the the merits of the two methods; but it will be comagreed that it would be much better if both Houses were to take the same course: to and I shall venture to offer some reasons interwhy the course followed elsewhere seems honpreferable to that proposed by the honourable and learned member. If the course proposed in another place were followed, for and met with the approval of a majoritv here, there would be a presentation of the views of this Parliament which would be in every way as effective as an address to His with Majesty the King. We must also consider the application to our own affairs of the in principle underlying this proposed action. first The Imperial Parliament would never while on present an address to the King in relation to the affairs of any other part to of the Empire, because it could give effect and to its will by legislative act, to which the not King; would be asked to assent, and thus the the object desired would be attained. Consequently, a parallel cannot be drawn be-: pretween our procedure and that of the Imto perial Parliament. We must approach the. and King with a petition, while the Imperial, Parliament would ask his assent to ail It is impossible to deny that, the legislative authority vested in the Imperial Parliament in regard to the self; been exercised with the greatest wisdomand consideration; and even in the occasional discussion of colonial affairs, members of that body have always exercised the most marked restraint. No doubt our actions and legislation have been subjected to some criticism' from individual members, but even, that not with notable frequency. When the supreme power and authority of the Imperial Parliament in regard to the various dependencies of the Crown and the King's dominions beyond the seas are remembered, in respect to the self-governing portions of the Empire, it must be recognised that they have been exercised with the greatest circumspection, and the most splendid self-control.",35
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Why not portions of the Empire?,36
129,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Because at times the affairs of Crown Colonies have been closely considered. Committees have been appointed to investigate them, and their ordinances have been freely interfered with. - Mr HIGGINS - Slaver y was abolished in the West Indies against the wishes of the people there.",36
130,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That is one of the cumstances in my mind. gard to the affairs of the self-governing portions of the Empire there has always been exercised a spirit of wise tolerance and consideration. It is therefore proper that we should proceed in a similar spirit. It may be contended that this is arguing against the position which I have already adopted; but it must be remembered that the Imperial Parliament exercises an authority which extends over the whole Empire, whereas we, although possessing, almost unlimited control over our own affairs, have no representation in the Government of the Empire of which we form part. Consequently there is cast upon us the necessity of considering the form in which we should approach extraneous questions with which we have no power to deal, and can claim none, but in regard to which, on principle and following precedent, we are entitled, when suitable and fitting occasion arises, to make ourselves heard.",36
131,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,We may be entitled 'to be heard without being entitled to speak.,36
132,Mr DEAKTN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The one would not be worth much without the other.,36
133,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That may be. there is a very great difference between the two things. One right comes from the people, and the other comes from the person to whom we are going to address burselves.",36
134,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We have to recollect that in approaching the Throne by way of petition, we not only seek a reply, but appeal to the sovereign powers, King, Lords, and Commons,, to give effect to our prayer. There, is nothing improper in that action, which is, indeed, strictly proper in relation to our own affairs. But when our representations relate, not directly to ourselves as a special community, but to an outside matter, the decision of which rests with the electors of the mother country and their representatives, it appears' to me say all that we can better exercise our undoubted right to the 'free expression of our opinions by setting them forth with such clearness"" and force as we can command, without directly invoking the sovereign power in the manner to which I have alluded, and without 'directly challenging a reply. We should rely on the strength of the reasons urged, in the hope that they will commend themselves to the minds of those who have it in their power to give cir- effect to any opinions as soon as they can But in re- share them. Therefore, if this Parliament, in placing on record its.opinions in this connection, follows the line of precedent suggested: by the Secretary of State in his despatch of a little more than six months ago, it will adopt the better course. To that suggestion exception was taken by the right honourable member for East Sydney, who contended that even an expression of opinion from this Parliament would be out of place upon any issue outside Australia; that it should be left to private bodies, leagues, or persons to take action; that ' we were neither called upon nor authorized to . speak for; our constituents, or the people of Australia in this matter; that our appeal could have no' legislative effect; that we were remote from the scene of action, and Would be subject to other influences, and that we should require before making ourselves heard in this connection to consult our constituents. If those arguments were sound, it would follow that the assertion, contained in the right honourable member's amendment, that the motion proposes to take us beyond the legitimate province of this Parliament, would be correct. They would narrowly and very seriously hamper but and limit us for all time; and, in my opinion, are unsound and injurious. They are based upon a doctrine which the right honourable gentleman boldly avowed, which is the key to much of the policy he has supported - in this House, and is relied upon particularly in regard to all Imperial, as distinguished from purely local questions. In this respect he takes the view of that able writer, Richard Jebb, who, in his recent Studies in Colonial Nationalism, contends that the Empire of the future is to consist of what might almost be called semi-independent powers, united by alliances arid agreements. The right honourable gentleman went on to argue that the greatness and strength of the Empire consisted in the independence of its several parts, and upon the absence of mutual criticism or examination, or of union, except by common agreements. This is Mr Jebb's view, and very largely the view of the right honourable member for East Sydney. This idea explains the attitude adopted by the right honourable gentleman towards the question now under consideration, and upon many others, such as preferential trade. Instead of dealing with his contentions piecemeal and seriatim,-' I desire, for the sake of brevity to say at once that my attitude towards the Imperial problem differs absolutely from his. I cannot share his sentiments. The right honourable gentleman thought it necessary to make some allusion to powers of separation with which he said the self-governing portions of the Empire are necessarily endowed. I do not propose to follow him in that regard. I do not agree with his statement, or with his application of it. I much prefer to avoid any discussion of such a subject. I regard it as unnecessary in this connection, and unseemly everywhere. Only in the last resort can the possibility of such action ever confront us. I see nothing on the horizon of the Empire to suggest the idea of disruption, or dislocation, and, therefore, refuse to dwell upon any contingency of that sort. We can most effectively unite the Empire as a whole by promoting its political organisation by local self-government. I approach this motion as one who believes that the Constitution of Great Britain, superb and magnificent as it is, and the greatest product the race to which we belong, is being outgrown by the circumstances of this great Empire, and is having imposed upon it a strain which lt' cannot long continue to bear. It has developed, and must continue its development. The growth of the great self governing communities and their increasing strength and importance call for the recognition of their right to a. voice in the decision of those questions in which their fate, as well as that of the mother country, is involved. At present, how can we, except by petition to the Throne, or by resolution, give expression to our opinions upon matters that affect our destiny as much as that of the mother country ? We are shut out-and perhaps some people desire that we should be-fro m the British. Parliament, and we are without representation upon any federal body charged with the issues of peace and war, of defence or internal unity. We cannot exercise any rights of citizenship beyond those conferred upon us by Statute, or assert our inherent equality with those who elect representatives to the House of Commons, which governs the Empire, except by the expression, of our opinion on Imperial questions. That can be done most effectively in Parliament, though «it can be done by any group of citizens anywhere. . I hold that it is impossible for us to shut the door on the great issues which are knocking at it today, including the great question, whether we are to cling, for all time, to that Constitution shaped on the anvil of liberty by centuries of struggle in the mother country, but shaped for three kingdoms within a small area, and close to Europe, without any provision for the great dominions of the Empire oversea. Starting with that conception, we cannot be content with the doctrine of each dependency for itself^ or with the idea that separate and independent States, acting together on occasion, will ever constitute a real whole. We can only rely upon an Empire, the parts of which are blended together in a living unity, not only so far as their fortunes are concerned, but also in regard to the real representation of every part of it. We cannot afford to leave great Imperial issues severely alone, and we certainly cannot treat in trTat way the one now under discussion, which clearly affects us. We are members one of another, with common interests and perils calling for common action. The right honourable member for of East Sydney made a strong point when he asked this House to decline to petition H is Majesty either in favour of or against a change in the parliamentary system at present prevailing in the United Kingdom. Let me put the converse very simply to the House and the country. Let me ask: If there is to be no change in 'the 1 parliamentary system of representation of the mother country as it now stands, what prospect is there of any federal unity of the Empire ? I maintain that no progress in the development of the unity of the Empire, or, to use the appropriate words of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, towards the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, will be possible until the Parliament of the mother country is prepared to reconsider its parliamentary system and the basis of representation.",36
135,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"But that change must be made mutually and voluntarily, and not be forced upon the mother country by outside pressure.",38
136,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I entirely agree with honourable member. It would not be possible for us to apply force even if we desired. It is interjected that this change should not be brought about in a fragmentary way. I should prefer that it should be effected on a grand scale and at once, but from my knowledge of history, particularly of that of the British people and of our own countrymen and their methods here, it is plain that the reform will be brought about only in a fragmentary way, piece by piece, step by step, and stage by stage, as may appear possible. But the first and fundamental consideration that underlies every change with the object of achieving greater unity and greater Imperial power, demands that at its very inception we should be permitted to exercise a ful l power of criticism. We have an indirect, but real, interest in the question of the devolution of the powers of the Imperial Parliament. All thoughtful Imperialists are realizing that to offer the distant .dominions of the Empire numerical representation in the Parliament of the mother country, overloaded as it is wjth a mass of intricate local legislative duties, would be futile. It would not further the interests of the Parliament or of the dependencies oversea. It would not present the opportunities we desire for the creation of a real effective political control of the whole of the Empire in which the whole of its own peoples would be represented. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I have a motion prepared dealing with that matter.",38
137,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Unti l we have regular representation in some Federal body, we must use the irregular representation which belongs to us by means of such motions as this when the occasion is of sufficient magnitude to justify them. On these grounds I venture, as an avowed Imperial federalist, to submit that the reconsideration of the parliamentary system of the mother country is a matter of direct moment to us, quite apart from the special considerations which govern the minds of those who form the Home Rule party.",38
138,Mr GB EDWARDS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"In other words, the Prime Minister would break off Ireland in order to open the door for Imperial federation.",38
139,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I would break off nothing, but bind all together. The special consideration that is being bestowed at present upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland arises naturally from one most significant, most insuperable cirthe cumstance, to which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne 4 has called attention. He says- . The people of Ireland have asked for a just measure of Home Rule through their representatives. Never has request more clear, consistent, and continuous been made by any nation. It cannot be disputed that the practical unanimity of the representatives of Ireland deserves the prominence which the honourable and learned member has given it in this motion. The reason why the question of Ireland is pressing is because the representatives of that country have endorsed it in an unmistakable manner. Surely that is the best of reasons. The same proposal would come with equal force from Scotland if her representatives had felt it necessary to bring it forward. The fact that Scotland has not done so^-the fact that the movement for Home Rule there after fluttering has almost died out-is a proof that its people are content to retain the representation they enjoy. Nobody desires to alter conditions with which they are satisfied. But it seems to me that we cannot look unmoved and uninterested, upon the problem of devolution in regard to Ireland since its solution must bring forward the consideration of the position of all the other self-governing communities of the Empire. The Federal principle must be applied. From that point of view, it seems to me that we find firm foot-hold and justification for recording an opinion upon this question. Unfortunately, I happen to differ from the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in regard to the final sentence of the second paragraph of his motion, which relates to the British Parliament. Indeed, I regard the whole of that paragraph as an unnecessary addition to his proposal. Whilst I do not possess a sufficiently intimate knowledge of the measures of legislation to which he alludes to warrant me in differing from the commendation which he bestows upon them, I am not sufficiently well informed to coincide with it, nor do I think it necessary that we should be asked to coincide. It seems to me that we should strengthen his case, if, putting aside these historical references and the appeal to His Majesty, we were content to concentrate our attention upon the vital part of his motion, which is to be found in the third paragraph. There he makes his position perfectly clear. Before passing from this branch of the subject, may I say that the criticisms which I have ventured to pass upon the mother of Parliaments are not my own. I would not venture to make them confidently if they were. When I say that the Parliament of the mother country, as a law-ma/king machine, is breaking down, and, as an Executive, is failing to satisfy its constituents, I am using the language of members of the House of Commons itself, and of some members of the other Chamber. In this matter I rest not merely upon my own opinion. I have summarized and quoted the testimony of many members of those bodies.",38
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Are we going to take a vote upon this matter today?,39
141,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I shall be most happy if we can do so - I have no desire to intervene, but for the reason which I have advanced was not prepared to speak earlier.",39
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Will the Prime Minister promise to give us time to take a division upon the motion after the adjournment for dinner?,39
143,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I regret that I can.not make any such promise. only one other authority whom I propose to quote before concluding my remarks- I refer to Sir Frederick Pollock, who has .been very prominent of late as the spokesman of a group of thinkers representing all parties in England, who foresee the necessary reconstruction of the British parliamentary system. That is still remote. Sir Frederick Pollock, speaking on the Federation of the Empire, saysAs for any kind of formal Constitution, it assumes the consent of several independent Legis'1 a hires, and involves a considerable modification of their existing authority. I am not aware of any reason for thinking that the Parliament of the United Kingdom would easily be persuaded to reduce itself by a solemn Act to a mere State Legislature, or that the Colonial Governments would be willing to surrender any substantial part of their autonomy to some new Federal Senate or Council - All the information at our disposal goes to show that nothing of the kind has any chance of being accepted, or even of seeming plausible enough, to induce any Ministry to take it in hand. He then proceeds to propose interim methods by which we can bridge over the period until the Legislatures affected are prepared to re-examine their position in this regard. But I am unable to agree with the leader of the Opposition that the consideration of this question takes us beyond our legitimate province, or with his statement that the fact that it will shortly become an. issue in an appeal to the electors of Great Britain and Ireland is material, especially if we confine ourselves to an expression of our opinion without addressing His Majesty the King and his advisers directly. We take no partisan ground, and make no undue interference with party politics, because all we ask is for a just measure of self-government for Ireland. What is just and wise we leave to them to determine among themselves without any proposal of ours. I agree with the third paragraph of the right honourable member's amendment, so far as it declaresThat this House confidently relies upon the fairness and wisdom p f the British people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people and the stability of the Empire. But admitting that-and it is obvious that in this matter we are without power, without authority, without votes, without direct connection with the voters-ther e is no reason why, uttering our opinions as best we may. we should not have those opinions laid before the voters of the mother There is country for their consideration. They constitute the jury to which we must appeal. They alone can decide the question. When this discussion, in a remote part of the Empire, 'is shown in its true relation, to our own ultimate interests, when the public of the mother country become seized with the reasons for expressing our opinions to them as well as with the opinions themselves, it appears to me that they are certain to receive fair consideration. All that 'we ask is that our views may make their way by the force of reason, and by the substance of the considerations we offer. Perfectly aware as I am of the responsibility which we all assume in acting in this connection, without a direct mandate from our constituents, I have never yet subscribed to the doctrine that a member of Parliament is amere delegate.i I have never withdrawn from the well-established doctrine of the mother country, that a member of Parliament, elected though he is at a particular period because of his views upon some questions often to the exclusion of all is not, on that account, relieved of the responsibility which he takes-and for which he will answer-of meeting whatever emergency may arise during the term of his representation. If his actions - command the support of his constituents, so much the better for him and for them, but when he faces for the first time'some question upon which he has not challenged their verdict, all that he can do is to give it his best judgment, and his best knowledge. He can only do that which he believes to be right. More than this no man can do, and this every man is called upon to do when he is confronted with a choice of alternatives. I trust that the motion submitted by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne will be dealt with in such a way as will enable any honourable members who share my opinions to vote upon each separate paragraph, instead of upon the motion as a whole. If it is decided to substitute for the motion the amendment of the leader of the Opposition, I trust that a similar course will be adopted. What we should endeavour to arrive at is the most precise and clear ex pression of the will of the majority of this House. That can best be accomplished by adopting the course I have suggested, seeing that in both instances the propositions, though connected, are relatively independent of each other. For my own part, I speak to-night-as I have saidunder circumstances of stress and haste, which have prevented me from dealing with the matter as briefly-and certainly as effectively-as I could have wished. I know that the question is surrounded -- by other considerations upon which I have not attempted to touch, and supported by arguments which I am content to have heard uttered by others. I know that in the Irish people it is inwoven with passion and poetry and recollections of their own. But I seek to approach it-withou t disregarding those circumstances-in the calm, clear light of the responsibilities of the Empire and its future welfare. I feel that upon a motion which asks simply for a just measure of Home Rule Air. WILKS - Who is to define what that means ? Mr Deakin.",39
144,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The supreme authority - the people and Commons of England.,40
145,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Then leave the matter to them.,40
146,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We are leaving if to others, them. It cannot be taken from them. There is a just measure due. We are not forbidden as citizens of the Empire to appeal to the reason, the judgment, and conscience of all other citizens of the Empire in this regard. Believing, as I do, that the future development of our Empire lies through its local governments- a multiplication of municipal functions by way of relieving the higher authoritiesand believing that subsequently the only possible method of combining, local self government in States or dependencies with effective Imperial unity of action, is by means of the Federal form of Government, which we are fortunate enough to enjoy, I should be false to every liberal tradition and principle if I refused to express myself in favour of a just measure of Home Rule to Ireland, which demands it today, or to any other portion of the Empire which may demand it tomorrow.",40
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,To Scotland and Wales ?,40

150,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"To the furthest extent consistent with, and making for, the efficiency and unity of the Empire. I would not be a party, in connection with the Federal movement, to anything that would make towards separation or the disruption of the Empire.",40
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Who is to judge of that, so far as Home Rule for Ireland is concerned ?",40
152,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The British people, and, their representatives, the British Parliament. A just measure will help and strengthen the Empire. Who can refuse to grant what is just? No more is asked. Every step I took in connection with the fight for Federation - was in the belief that the 'Federation of Australia would make the Empire stronger and more united than it was. And so if I were a member of the British Parliament, I would consent to a just measure of Home Rule for Ireland, or for any, other part of the Empire, only so far as I believed that it would minister to the strength and unity of the Empire. Mr. JOSEPH CooK -^-Who are to be the judges ?",40
153,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"In this respect the natural judges are the people of the British Empire. We are interested persons in the final decision, because it seems to me that it will be impossible for the mother country to deal with the problem of Ireland, and the granting of a subordinate Legislature to her without taking into account the position of subordinate Legislatures in other parts of the Empire. As there must be in the future some central control, the precedent must be most valuable to us in a general way. It is on this account that we have a title to express our opinion today in anticipation of an Imperial Federal Council. If I did not believe so, I should hold it to be our duty to be silent on this question. But, ' believing as I do, that our own interests and those of the Empire are bound up with the application of our present forms of government to the new circumstances of a new world, as a preparation for the new Empire that is to be, I shall be found! casting my vote for the principle embodied in the third paragraph of the motion.",41

155,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I have no desire to delay the taking of a division if it is the desire of the House to at once divide.,41

157,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am informed that not only does the mover of the motion intend to reply, but that various other honourable members wish to speak to the question. That being so, I propose this evening to. briefly discuss the motion. I can only say that I regret exceedingly that such a proposition should have been submitted, for it deals with a matter entirely outside the province of this Parliament. I am glad to find that in taking this view I have the support of the Prime Minister, and also the leader of the Labour Party. Notwithports standing the eloquent speech that the Prime Minister has just delivered in regard power and our right to interfere in matters affecting other parts of the Empire, and despite the fact that, by interjection, the honourable member for Bland has, I believe, expressed a similar opinion, I find, upon referring to that inestimable tome, Hansard, that both these honourable members have expressed' a contrary opinion. On the 26th September, 1902, a discussion took place in this House as to whether the Parliament should protest against the proposed introduction of Chinese into the Rand, and the present Prime Minister and the honourable member for Bland took up the stand that no such protest should be made.",41

161,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am far from denying our . responsibility for the part which Australia has played in connection with the recent war in South Africa. I do not think that Australia desires to escape from any such responsibility, or regrets the action which she took. But it is quite another question how far that action commits us to a criticism, which may be considered an interference with the internal affairs of terri- < tories which, as I understand, are to be placed 1 at once upon a basis that will admit of the representation of the wishes of the inhabitants. Though they are not endowed with representative institutions to the fullest extent, yet they are to be, from the very outset, endowed witii advisory councils on which both the English and the Boer populations will be represented. On that occasion the Prime Minister took the view that because in the immediate futuife the population of the territories in question would have some representation, however slight, we should not seek to interfere in their internal affairs.",41
162,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is sound doctrine.,41
163,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"It is a most excel-, lent doctrine, and one that entirely supthe amendment moved by the leader of the Opposition. The honourable and to our learned member went on to sayInasmuch as the people of those territories will be in the enjoyment of self-governmentHe was referring to the Transvaal and Orange River Coloniesto that extent, at all events, we should need to be very careful in expressing general views upon any question of great importance to their internal administration. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That was Jekyll. similar To-day we have heard Hyde.",41
164,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I trust that pression, of opinion will not be hidden. The Prime Minister went on to sayBut while we are entitled to express our per. sonal opinions outside, that does not justify us in making official representations, which, if they were to have any weight at all, must be backed by some effective action on the part of the Commonwealth Government.",42
165,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is on exactly the same principle as what I said this evening.,42
166,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable and learned gentleman continuedSupposing we did make a representation of the character desired to the people of South Africa-because , as I have said, the measure of representative government already accorded gives the people a voice-it may be an incomplete voice in our apprehension, but still it is a voice-in the management of their own affairs. . . . . although it is perfectly open for any or any private bodies or associations, to express their opinions with regard to the employment of coloured labour on the Rand-this is not a subject with which the Government of the Commonwealth ought to be asked to take action. By so doing, we should possibly expose ourselves to a mortifying rebuff. We would not be considered by the citizens of South Africa as lending them any assistance-in fact, the probability is that our action would simply be interpreted as a desire to interfere in their affairs. Later on the honourable and learned gentleman said thatFor these reasons I fail to see that this Government ought to have taken action in the matter, unless our council was in some way specially invited. I ask honourable members.not to lose sight of that, point. The honourable and learned gentleman declared that Australia had expressed its views with regard to the suspension of constitutional government in Cape Colony for the reason that it had tion been asked to do soOn that question Australia had a proper opportunity of being heard, and the Prime Minister expressed the feelings of the great bulk of the people of the Commonwealth. That was a matter upon which it was proper for the Government to speak, because an opportunity of speaking was presented to .them. He concluded with the following remarks, which seem to me to be apropos:To have made general unsolicited representations might have been an interference with the measure of autonomy at present existing in those 'Spates, and might have established a precedent which in the future would be found very dangerous to this and other self-governing communities throughout the Empire. I am glad to say that my honourable friend the leader ""of the Labour Party took up a attitude. In one of those short workmanlike speeches which we are accustomed this exto hear from him, he said I have very strong opinions upon these subjects, but I have tried consistently to adopt the policy that we have no right to undertake responsibilities and duties outside of the affairs immediately concerning our own people. He concluded by saying thatOn the whole subject. I think that this Parliament should confine itself to Australian affairs, and for that reason I do not wish to say more than that I think the Government are wise in refraining from taking any action which would involve us in responsibility, or set up the idea that we are seeking to interfere with the affairs of the world at large. I think that these two quotations effectively and entirely dispose of the proposition that we ought to interfere in any matter which r does not affect the peace, order, and good government of Australia, but may affect the persons, good government of another part of the Empire over which we have no control.",42
167,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is why it affects the future of Australia.,42
168,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Why did not the honourable and learned gentleman take up that view in dealing with the question of protesting against the introduction of Chinese to the Rand ?,42
169,Mr DEAKIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I did when the matter was again brought forward.,42
170,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"As the time for private members' business has almost expired, I desire leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. Leave grafted; debate adjourned. - SECRET COMMISSIONS BILL.",42

Our contention was that the case was covered by the clause as it stands, and I still think that it is, but, in pursuance of the promise given to the honourable member, I have looked into the matter again, and have devised the proposed amendments, which he is willing to accept, as likely to meet the difficulty.

172,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I wish to say a few words in connection with a matter which is of interest to all honourable members. Parliament each year votes money for the erection of public buildings, but there is always great delay in getting that money expended by the Department of Home Affairs. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is because of red tape.",43
173,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That is very probable. It is very rarely that an economy can be effected by the Postal Department by erecting a post-office of its own, instead of continuing to carry on its operations in a rented building; but in my electorate, after providing interest and a sinking fund, a considerable saving will be made by givining up the present post-office, for which a stiff rent is paid, and erecting a ComThe' lease of the obtain present building expired in the middle of or this year, and it was therefore obvious to an that, to avoid having to pay another year's request rent for it, the new building would have to be finished and ready for occupation or before that time.

Yet the Department of Home Affairs took as long to prepare the plans for this small building as would have been required by the average contractor to erect it.

174,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,When was it started?,43

181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is not so now.,44
182,Mr KELLY,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable member only recently put an end to that absurd system. It was ridiculous that a great Department like the Post Office could not cept responsibility for necessary disbursements. I hope that some means will be found to improve the methods of the partment of Home Affairs, so that its may be transacted more quickly.",44
183,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I wish to say few words with regard to the administraworks, tion of this Department. 1 do not desire that the Department should be abolished, but I think that the position of the ister of Home Affairs should be done with, and that his portfolio should be gamated with some other. I am not castover ing any reflection upon the present Minsolutely ister, but I think a wise economy might practised by the amalgamation of some of the too numerous political offices for which provision is now made. The Commonwealth cannot long stand the financial strain which is being imposed upon it, and I think that Ministers should seek to curtail expendiwork ture in everv possible way. The Minister of Trade and Customs cannot have very much to do, and he would make an admirlatter able administrator for the Home Affairs Department. Now that the Federal Capital question Has been practically settled, the work of the Department will become greatly diminished in the near future. I know that this is not a popular suggestion, but I feel sure that the Minister of Trade and Cusupon toms would willingly undertake to perform more work if it could be shown that expected a. good purpose would be served. Ministers to seriously consider my suggeswould tion. I think that special attention snduld be directed to the fact thai: we do not present possess the staff required to insure efficient supervision over the public works carried out on behalf of the Commonwealth. not We have an Inspector-General of Works, at a salary of £ 8 0 0 , and a Superintendent of Works in each of the States', at a salary The Deof ^ 6 0 0 , but the whole of the detail work to be carried out by State officials. It is impossible for the Commonwealth officers connected with this branch of the Home Affairs Department, However able they may be, to effectively supervize the whole of the At works carried out in large States such as a new winQueensland and New South Wales, and - I think we should have a properly equipped staff or none at all. We are paying the States .£6,500 per annum for the services rendered by their officials, and I think we might spend that money to far more advantage by maintaining a staff of our own.",44
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The House would acnot agree to my proposals in that direction.,44
185,Mr WILKS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am perfectly well aware of that, but from the outset I have taken Deup the attitude I am now assuming work I pointed out that useful work could be done and money could be saved if we apa pointed a' number of efficient clerks of who would have the immediate supervision, of all works. I hope fJIiat"" the'Minister will inquire into this matter, and make Minsome recommendation on the subject. The away Superintendent of Works in New South amalWales is supposed to exercise supervision all works of construction, but it is abimpossible for him to roam from be one end of the State to the other, and at the same time effectively perform the work that demands his attention at the head office. I found recently that the staff connected with the Home Affairs Department in New South Wales were frequently required to overtime, and that seemed to me to indicate either that the staff were incompetent or overworked. I believe that the is the true explanation, and I trust that the Minister will, in the interests of the Department and of tfie officers themselves, effect some improvement. It is proposed to expend over ,£100,000 upon various works during the current year, and it seems to me to be false economy to depend the supervision of officers who have no direct responsibility, and who cannot be to look after the interests of the I ask Commonwealth with the same keenness that be exhibited by our own officials. Referring once more to the amalgamation at of Ministerial portfolios, I acknowledge that the Minister of Home Affairs may have mora work to do than the public are generally aware of. He has a perfect right to occupy his present position, and I do not cast the slightest reflection upon him, but I honestly believe that an amalgamation of Ministerial offices might be made with advantage.",44
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Parramatta) The honourable member for Dalley took upon himself to say that the Minister of Home Affairs had a perfect right to occupy his present position. I deny that statement at once, and challenge the Minister to show by what right or privilege he holds his present position. No doubt, he worked very hard to obtain a position in the Ministry, and it is appropriate that he should preside over the Home Affairs Department, where sd much bridge-building and road-making is undertaken. The Minister was one of the champion bridgebuilders, and one of the most accomplished road-makers in the House, and he apparently succeeded in macadamizing the road which led him to office. The honourable member for_ Dalley was quite right in suggesting that the Minister of Trade and Customs would be willing to takeover another Ministerial office, in addition to his own. Tudging from the facility with 'which he disposes of the business of his Department, he has plenty of time at his disposal for gallivanting over the country in order to serve his own political and other purposes. The Minister might do better work for himself and for the Commonwealth if he spent more time in his office, and disported himself at' shows and other places to a smaller extent than he has done of late. There is a good deal in the contention of the honourable member for Dalley that it would be advisable for us to arrange for the supervision of our public works by our own officers. The estimates of the Home Affairs Department are graduallv mounting up, and now represent a very large sum, and I venture to say that the present system of divided control in connection with the construction of public works is hampering the Department at every turn.' The work that has to be done for the Commonwealth has to take a secondary place, so far as the States officials are concerned, and much delay and annoyance result. I might mejntion the case of a post-office in which I am interested, upon which work has just been commenced. Twelve months ago I stood here pleading for that work to be carried out. It had been sanctioned long previously, yet it is only now being put in progress. Therefore I say that the sooner we take over the whole of this work ourselves the better it will be for the Commonwealth as-a whole and for the efficiency of the Department of Home Affairs. I am inclined to think that, by so doing, we should not require to increase the total expenditure. At the present time we are paying the various States ;£6,'5oo annually ffor isupervision alone. I venture to say that supervision costs a very great deal more than that amount, by reason of the multiplication of the red-tapism which is involved. As a matter of fact, much of the time of Commonwealth officers is taken up in looking after and policing work that is under the control of the States Public Works Departments. There are one or two matters in regard to which I should like the Minister to make a statement to the House. One of these relates to the question of payment for. the transferred properties. Five years have now passed since the Federation was established, and yet we do not appear to be any nearer finality in regard to this particular question than we were at the outset. In the meantime, owing 10 the system of finance that we have adopted, our Federal balance-sheet conveys an entirely false impression to the outside world. Instead of charging ourselves with Ihe interest upon the transferred properties, we are omitting that 'item from our balance sheet year after year. The result is that we appear to have a surplus which we return to the States, whereas, if we liquidated all our legitimate obligations, we should have no surplus whatever. I think that the Minister should make a clear and definite statement to the House regarding the stage which the negotiations have now reached. He might also inform us when he anticipates being able to submit a proposition regarding the method of payment which shall be adopted in connection with these properties. Various proposals"" have been made 'in that connection. The latest suggestion by the Treasurer is one for adjusting matters with the States, and for taking into account only the outstanding balance. That would be a very wrong procedure indeed. No doubt it would be a very convenient one for the Treasurer, but it would still leave our accounts in anextremely vitiated condition. We should still be presenting a false balance-sheet. Whatever means we may adopt to raise the money with which to pay for the transferred properties, it is clearly our business to bring the whole of those properties into account in our Federal Budget. We ought to show in our accounts the total sum of interest which is payable upon them. If we did that, it seems to me that it would not matter very much what metho'd of payment was finally adopted. At present we have a fictitious surplus. We declare that we are returning to the States so many hundreds of thousands per annum more than we ate compelled to do under the Constitution, when, as a matter of fact, we should not have a penny of our own if we liquidated all our outstanding liabilities. If we had been told when the Federation was established that five years hence no settlement of this question would have been arrived at, I venture tQ say that the statement would have been scouted. Such, however, is the simple fact. At the present time we are using the transferred properties, and the States are paying interest upon them, instead of that interest being shown in our accounts as a liability and an item of Federal expenditure. There is another matter to which I wish to direct attention- I refer to the dispute in regard to the Federal Capital question. This matter is dragging its slow course along, and I suppose that the Attorney General and the Attorney-General of New South Wales will get to "" close grips "" some time or other.",45
187,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,This Attorney-General is quite readv.,46
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Yes , but he will not go out of his way to the extent of one pin-head.",46
189,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,There is no justification for that statement.,46
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable and learned gentleman declines to leave Melbourne. His business is far too important. The Attorney-General of New South Wales is also a very busy man, and has a big Court practice. I venture to say that he has very much more important public business to attend to than has the Attorney-General.",46
191,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"He is looking after Crick, who was one of the late colleagues of the Minister of Trade and Customs.",46
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I do not understand that interjection. If the honourable member wishes to indulge in any criticism of the Minister of Trade and Customs from the stand-point of recent happenings in Sydney, I do not think that he is adopting a fair course. I think that the Minister might very well be absolved from any connection with those events.",46
193,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Order ! I must ask the honourable member to address himself to the item before the Chair.,46
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Then I would be obliged if my honourable friend in the corner would cease his interjections. I know that, as a good loyal Victorian representative, he is very anxious to see the Federal Capital question definitely settled. The sooner we get a habitation of our own the better it will be for us, because we shall then be removed from those vitiating influences of the powerful press of which we have so frequently complained. I should like to see a more pronounced disposition on the part of the Attorney-General to make a little sacrifice to secure the settlement of this important matter. It was just as much his duty to visit Sydney as it was Mr Wade's duty to come to Melbourne. There is no comparison between the importance of the public business which is now engaging the attention of these two gentlemen. At the present moment, the Attorney-General of New South Wales is grappling with the Liquor Bill, and two or three other measures of first-rate importance, and, in addition, he possesses Court practice as large as that of any leading barrister. But while the Attorney-General declares point-blank that he will not leave Melbourne, the Prime Minister coolly requests that the New South Wales Attorney General should come over here. I trust that when the conference between these two Attorneys-General takes place, the matter in dispute will be pushed forward to a settlement. I do not know what the Government intend after the High Court has determined the issues which may be agreed upon. We must not for a moment imagine that the decision of that tribunal will finally dispose of the matter. Action will need to be taken by the Commonwealth Ministry if the Seat of Government is to be removed from Melbourne within the next five or ten years. Judging by the progress which we have hitherto made, some succeeding Administration will have to develop a tremendous "" spurt,"" if we are to get away from this city before several years have elapsed.",46
195,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Le t us stay where we are for the next twenty years.,46
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Was the honourable and learned member present in the Chamber last evening?,46
197,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I was not.,46
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Then the honourable and learned member did not see a brutal Government endeavouring to crush me by compelling me to continue a debate after I had spent two nights in the train, and was physically unfit for the task.",47
199,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is what the honourable member wishes to make the Victorian representatives do.,47
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I confess that I desire the Victorian representatives to be placed upon the same footing as myself"". This is a democratic Assembly, and we are all,l: supposed to be equal; but I venture to say that, while Melbourne remains the Seat of Government, there can be no equality of sacrifice. should advise the representatives of Victoria, who are so prone to lecture the House on the necessity to expedite public business, to remember this fact. I wish to warn the Prime Minister that in initiating late sittings he is starting upon a course which, if persisted in, will eventually demoralize the Parliament and demoralize it in a way that he will regret as keenly as will any one. I am speaking as one who has had long experience of the effect of such a system on a State Parliament. It is because of this that I am so anxious to avoid late sittings.",47
201,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,- 1 would remind the honourable member that the hours of sitting are not under discussion.,47
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am pointing out that with Melbourne as the Seat of Government, the sacrifice in the performance of public duties is unequal. It is all very well for representatives of Victoria to demand late sittings. Every,' one knows, for instance, that the Attorney-General is accustomed to walk through one door of this Chamber and out at the other.",47
203,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Absolutel v incorrect.,47
204,Mr TOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,It is a matter of notoriety that the honourable and learned gentleman does this in order that his name may be registered on the attendance list.,47
205,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is an outrageous statement.,47
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"And yet there,is no honourable and learned member who lectures the House more than he does.",47
207,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I must ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the estimates of the Department of Home Affairs.,47
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am dealing with the question of the Federal Capital, 2 as to which a sum appears on the Estimates now under discussion. I am pointing out that as long as Melbourne is the Seat of Government there cannot be a fair apportionment of sacrifice in the performance of our public duties.",47
209,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable member is justified in making that statement,, but he will remember that when I interrupted him he was proceeding to discuss the bearing and personal attributes of the Attorney-General. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I did so in order to illustrate the point I was making. The .charge has'been made again and again that we are neglecting public business, ana I it has been made more frequently by the Attorney-General than by any other honourable member. It is well known that those who live in glass houses usually heave the largest stones, and no man lives in a house more composed of glass in this respect than does the Attorney-General. It is a matter of notoriety that 'he often walks through the Chamber in order that his name may be recorded in the attendance list, and that we then see his face no more during the remainder of the sitting.",47
210,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Outsid e this House, such a statement would be stigmatized as a deliberate falsehood.",47
211,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Order ! I ask the honourable and learned gentleman not to make such a statement; it is evidently calculated to lead to trouble. I must request him to withdraw it.,47
212,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I do so, sir; but I consider that I have received very great provocation, and that the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta could in no circumstances be justified.",47
213,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I now ask the honourable member for Parramatta not to pursue a course that is calculated to lead to friction, but to endeavour as 'far as possible to confine his remarks to the Estimates under discussion.",47
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I have no wish to provoke these animosities. It is unfortunate that a mere statement of fact should provoke them. Let me take, as another illustration, the position of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. At the close of the session the records show that he has not missed a single sitting : but it is easy for him to put'in an appearance here. All that he has to do is to have his attendance registered, and then leave the Chamber to look after his business, if he cares to. '",47
215,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member does not sav that I do that?,48
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I say that the honourable member, and other representatives of Victoria, do not put any more time in the Chamber than many of the representatives of other States do, although we have a great many less attendances to show.",48
217,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is absolutely untrue.,48
218,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable member must know that such an observation is quite unparliamentary, and I ask him to withdraw it .",48
219,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I say that the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta is absolutelv untrue.,48
220,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that statement without any qualification.,48
221,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I withdraw it , and say that the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta is absolutely conto trary to fact, and that no one knows it better than he does.",48
222,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable journey member must withdraw the latter part his statement.,48
223,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I withdraw it , but I know that it is correct.",48
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am afraid of that my honourable friend does not it, or he would not have taken exception to the remark that I made. Mrv MAUGER - Does the honourable member know of any one who attends more regularly than I do? I am never out of the House.",48
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,All that I said was that some of the representatives of Victoria did not put in more time in this Chamber than did many of the representatives of other States.,48
226,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Why did the honourable member single me out?,48
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I did not. I taken referred to him and some other Victorian members.,48
228,Mr ROBINSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The honourable member was making a most unfair attack on some cease to heap up technical difficulties. of his own supporters.,48
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Can it be said that I attack any one when I say that some of the representatives of Victoria do not give more time to the performance their public duties than I do?,48
230,Mr MAUGER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The honourable member said that Ave came into the House to secure the registration of our attendance, and went away again.",48
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I said some of them did. I am anxious not to say anything that would disturb the honourable member's peace of mind. My point is that this is a democratic Chamber, and that, although we are supposed to believe in equality of sacrifice, there can be no equality of sacrifice, as applied to the performance of our parliamentary duties, whilst the Parliament continues to meet in Melbourne. I should not have said this but for the initiation of a new order of things by the present Ministry. Last night, after spending two nights in a railway train, I was refused an adjournment, although the hour of midnight was fast approaching. As long as the Government will agree to adjourn at a reasonable hour, I shall have nothing to say in this regard. It is all very well for a Minister who is living on the spotwhom attendance is a trifling matter-to advocate late sittings. He has not to endure, week after week, a racking railway to reach his home, and he should of not seek to take advantage of those who have to travel long distances in order to attend here. No honourable member spends more time and energy in the performance his duties than do those who come from know their distant homes. The sooner we determine the - site of the Capital the sooner we shall understand each other better-at least, in relation to parliamentary business-and the sooner will there be a much better appreciation of each other's difficulties than now appears to be the case. If honourable members who represent Victoria had to journey, say, to Dalgety, in order to attend to their parliamentarv duties, they would not be so anxious for the House to sit after midnight as they now seem to be. I hope that-if only from this consideration-som e steps will speedily be to settle the question of the site of the Capital. I trust that when the Attorneys-General do meet the present long range firing will cease, and that they will I am bound to say that those tactics appertain to no one party to the dispute. There is one other little matter which I should like to mention, and that is the difof ference which is made between honourable members in regard to the privilege-if it can be called so, though I think that it should be looked upon as a right-of taking one's wife occasionally on a trip, perhaps to one's electorate. Under the present system, if a member lives at a place from which he can travel in a direct line to the Capital and also to his electorate, he can obtain a pass for his wife as often as he likes, but if he is differently situated he is not allowed this privilege. I ask the Minister to look into the matter, with a view to putting all on the same footing. With regard to the proposal to expend £ 5 , 0 0 0 upon a Statistical Bureau, I hope that an arrangement will be made with the Governments of the States under which the Commonwealth will take over some of their functions, and thus save them an expenditure at least as large as that which we are undertaking. If there is one thing more than another which is of Federal concern it is the collection of statistics, and steps should be . taken to try to persuade the States to cease to perform their functions in that respect, and allow the work to be done by the Commonwealth. I hardly think that they will insist on Keeping up their Statistical Bureaux when they find that the work is being adequately done by a Federal agency. In my opinion, no fresh officers need be appointed. Bv an arrangement with the States their officers could be transferred to the Commonwealth, and, no doubt, a saving could be effected, and greater efficiency secured, by the collection of statistics by one agency instead of 5y several.  Estimates of this Department, I should like to draw attention, in the first place, to the immense cost of the administrative staff. Last year the amount appropriated was ;£7,886, but the expenditure exceeded that amount by £ 3 3 3 . This year .£8,776 is set down, an increase of nearly £ 9 0 0 . Then, in connection with the maintenance of the Public Works staff, we have an increase of - over £ 4 , 3 0 0.",48
232,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"There is no increase in expenditure, but merely a transference of items.  was £ 1 3 , 5 2 7 , while this year £ 1 7 , 8 2 4 is asked for. When the honourable member for 'Hume was Minister of Home Affairs, he told us that the creation of a Public Works staff would mean an expenditure of only £[1,200 or £ 2 , 0 0 0 ayear; but I said at the time that the proposal was objectionable, 2 not because of the immediate expense, but because of what would follow. Now my remarks are being justified. Whereas £ 2 , 0 0 0 was considered sufficient in 1902, we are now being called upon to vote £ 9 , 0 4 8 for this branch. Facts like these afford ground for the complaints of the Treasurers of the States. I consider the Department of Home Affairs a big bundle of red tape, which we have to waste our time in disentangling. It is no better than a circumlocution office. Whenever any public work is to be carried out in connection with one of the other Departments, instead of the officers of that Department or the officers of the States Works Departments being made responsible, the matter has to be referred to the Department of Home Affairs. Consequently all proposals for public works have to pass through the hands of numerous record and correspondence clerks, and go backwards and forwards between Under Secretaries and Ministers, until the proper formal authority is obtained. Nodoubt, as the honourable member for North Sydney explained to me this afternoon, the Department saves the Commonwealth considerable expense in supervising and cutting down the proposals put before them, but I still think that it is altogether too expensive. Then we have an Electoral branch, although most of the work connected with elections is done by the postal officials. If it were all handed over to that Department, I am satisfied that it would be much more efficiently performed. The honourable member for North Sydney is, I believe, satisfied that the Electoral branch should be made part of the Postal Department. I was not aware the other evening that he proposed to carry out that change in a Bil l which he intended to introduce. I consider that such a step would be a very proper one, and if the change is proposed I shall heartily support it. Then there is the Public Service Commissioner's branch. We were told when the Public Service Bill was before the House that we should get a model service. ' I wish to show honourable members what the cost of administering that service is, and to do so I shall refer to the salaries of some of the officers at the head of the various Departments. This information is taken from the classification of the Public Service Commissioner. I find that Mr H . H . Lewis, of the Department of External Affairs, whose name appears second on page 1 of the classification, received when in State employ £ 2 9 0 per annum. When he became a Commonwealth officer his salary was increased to £350 per annum; but the Public Service Comforming missioner, in grading the service, thought that that was not enough, and raised it to £360 per annum, so that he obtained an increase of £ 7 0 in two years- a very big to the State. rise, considering the amount of his original salary. Then Mr F. J. Quinlan, whose name appears on the fourth page, was receiving in State employ £225 per annum, and obtained £260 per annum on being transcorresponding ferred to the Commonwealth. His salary has been increased by the Commissioner to £285 per annum. In the Attorney-General's Department, Mr G. H . Castle, name appears second on page 2 of the classification, was receiving £ 3 5 0 from State, and on being transferred to the Comthe Commonwealth. monwealth' service, obtained £500 per annum. The Commissioner has raised his salarv to £520 per annum. Mr D. Miller, of the Department of Home Affairs, whose name appears first on page 3 of the classification, was receiving a salary £425 in the employ of the State. That was raised to £750 on his being transreceived ferred to the Commonwealth, and was creased to £850.",49
233,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That is not the amount set down on the Estimates.  ries of the Under Secretaries have been fixed at £800, instead of the £8,50 allotted to them by the Public Service Commissioner.",50
234,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That was a censure on the Public Service Commissioner.  think what they like about the matter. am giving the bald facts. Mr W. G. Batten, whose name appears as No. 16 on page 3 of the classification, had no State service, but received £ 2 1 1 on being pointed to the Commonwealth Service, and has been raised to £235 by the Public Service Commissioner.

Mr. Oldham, another officer, was receiving the £35 0 under the State, and £500 under That was a substantial increase, but the Commissioner has augmented the salary to 'the extent of another £ 2 0 per annum. This is the Commissioner who said that he was going to look after the interests of the taxpayers. of In the Home Affairs Department I find that one of the officers, Mr Newman, who £ 1 5 0 under the State, had his insalary increased to £350 when he joined the Commonwealth service, and has received a further increase at the hands of the Commissioner of £ 1 0 . In fact, the Commissioner has increased the salaries of all but five officers belonging to the central Mr HUM E COOK - What salaries are paid to officers occupying similar positions in the State services?  dealing with the Commonwealth service. I wish honourable members to be placed in possession of the facts, because there is I bound to be a day of reckoning before very long. Some of the States Governments piled up the salaries of public servants to such an. extent that retrenchments aphad to be made, and in Queensland officers who were formerly in receipt of-£700 and £800 now have to be content with £200 o r £s3 0 0 P annum. Of course, they er consider that they have been badly treated, reand so they have been, because they were led to believe that their salaries would be by increased by annual increments until they The tax£425. payers, however, could not stand the strain, and it must be remembered that we H . are nearly at the end of our financial t|ther, so far as Commonwealth expenditure is concerned. The Treasurer is already looking round for more money, and when it becomes necessary to make provision for fresh expenditure, the first to suffer will be the public servants. want to give honourable members fair warning. I do not say that the officers are incompetent, or that they do not deserve high salaries, but there is a limit beyond which we cannot afford to go. I am endeavouring to show that there is a vast difference between the salaries which these officers received when they were in the States services, and those which they are now being paid. Surely it will not be contended that the services of these men are worth to us double what they were worth to the States.",50
237,Mr HUME COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I do not say but I contend that officers occupying similar positions in the States are paid higher salaries.  States officers are tumbling over one another in their eagerness to secure positions in the Federal service. The number of applications I have received from States officers has been positively alarming; and I cannot understand why they should be so eager to leave the States services if they are being so well paid as the honourable member's remarks would lead one to believe. In the office of the Public Service Commissioner, I find that Mr Reddin, the secretary to the Commissioner, was in receipt of a. salary of £ 4 5 0 under the State, and that he is now being paid £ 6 0 0 per annum.",51

No doubt the Minister of Trade and Customs will that the whole of the members of the central staff are good officers. I notice that. since the honourable member for Hume returned to office, the Customs authorities have been very vigilant, indeed, particularly in regard to harvesters. I find that Mr S.

Mr Templeton drew £300 per annum when in the service of a [«9] State, but was appointed to the Comurge monwealth service at £420 per annum; and his salary has been increased by the Commissioner to £440. Mr. P. Howe was receiving £240 per annum under a State Government, and upon his appointment 'to the Cpmmon,wealth service his salary was raised to £ 3 1 0 per annum. Mr J.

251,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"And any reductions which may be made hereafter will not affect those officers who have received these large in salaries of the lower-paid officers. A few days ago I put a question to the Attorney General to which he promised to furnish a reply. I asked him whether the proceedings against Nicholas 'Hart were instituted upon the advice of the Crown Law Officers. I know that I was on the risrht trade when I stated that the Public Service Commissioner 'did not act on theadvice that was tendered to him by the Crown Law authorities. H a d he done so, I am satisfied that the Commonwealth would not have been landed in the expensive law suit which is now in progress in Queensland. The Government must entertain the opinion that there is something at stake in those proceedings, because they have retained the strongest bar obtainable in Queensland to defend the action. Furthermore, they have practically pleaded guilty by paying £ 1 0 into Court in satisfaction of Mr Hart's claim for wrongful dismissal. The Public Service Commissioner has brought about all this trouble by acting on the advice of a subordinate officer in his Department in the person of Mr Healey. The latter figures upon the Estimates as an examiner - not as a Crown Law Officer. The Public Service Commissioner has flouted the opinion .of the Crown Law authorities, and has accepted the advice of one of his subordinates. By so doing he has landed the Commonwealth in an expenditure which may involve hundreds, or even thousands of pounds. Unless full publicity is given to the facts of this case I shall worry the Government over it during the remainder of the session. Crown Law officers had advised the Public Service Commissioner that Mr Hart's case should be heard by a certain board of inquiry, the Commissioner, acting upon the advice of one of his subordinates, had him tried by another board.",53

AN Honorable MEMBER - The papers do not support the honourable member's statement.  the Minister will move in the direction of transferring the Electoral Office to the Postal Department, nobodv will champion his action more thoroughly than I will.

I was not prepared to give him any information/ because the matter to which he refers does not concern this year's Estimates at all; It has no relatiDn to them. The question which the honourable member for Maranoa put relates to some trouble which arose whilst the late Government were in office. I do not wish to suggest that that Government was to blame, but am simply explaining that that fact may account for the anxiety of the honourable member to make sure that the matter is not silenced. A Mr Hart occupied the position of travelling mail officer, and the circumstances relating to his'case cover a precis of thirty-two pages, whilst they extend in date from November, 1003, to July, of the present year.",54
255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,So that the case extends over the term of office of several Ministries.,54
256,Mr ISAACS,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The particular incident to which the honourable member refers occurred in November, 1904. It is a very complicated matter, the rights and wrongs of which, I gather, have yet to be determined by a Court of law. I am not going to enter upon a consideration of the merits After the of the case. It would be out of place and quite improper to do so; but the question which my honourable friend put on Tuesday night was whether the Commissioner, in taking the step that led to the matter now being challenged, acted vnon the advice of the Attorney-Guneral or upon the recommendation or advice of one of his own immediate subordinates. So far as I can gather from the papers before me, as well as by the assistance of the Secretary of my Department, it appears that the Commissioner in that particular matter had no direct advice from the Attorney-General's Department, but acted on the recommendation or advice of his own immediate subordinate. I think that it would be improper for me to go any further into the case, or to attempt to deal with the merits of the dispute.",54
257,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," The Minister of Home Affairs is realizing, as his predecessors have done, that a Department which touches honourable members so closely as does that over which he presides will never lack criticism. Coming to the carefully prepared statement submitted by the honourable member for Maranoa, in which the salaries received by officers before being taken over from the At that States services, are compared with those paid fbem on entering the Commonwealth service, as well as with those proposed to be paid under the classification scheme, I would point out that he omitted to make any reference to the principal cause of the difference in the expenditure. The chief cause for the increase in the expenditure of the Commonwealth service, as compared with the salaries paid to these officers by the States is that this Parliament decidedand I am not finding fault with that decision-that those who had been in the service for three years, and had attained the age of twenty-one, should receive not less than £ 1 2 0 per annum.  tral staffs.",54
258,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I think that'in that the honourable member's comparison was perfectly correct. It has also to be remembered in connection with some of the officers of the Central staffs that the salaries were fixed by Parliament before cney were filled. That, I think, is the case with reference to the head of the Patents Office. Parliament having fixed the salary, it became the duty of the Government to secure the best officer-and preferably a State officer, because it is only right that States servants should have the first opportunity of promotion if transfer to the Commonwealth Service means advancement - for this office. The Government, of which I was a member, had nothing to do with that appointment; but Parliament having arrived at this decision, it became the duty of the Ministry of the day to see that the position was filled by the best officer obtainable. The fact that the officer lected was not receiving whilst in the State employ as much as it was proposed to give him in lvs new office may have been because fiere was not a sufficiently important position available for him-.",55
259,Mr WATSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Probably no promotion was open to him.,55
260,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"He might have reached the top of a comparatively small Department. If a higher salary were given him on his transfer to the Commonwealth sen ice, that was no reflection upon the Ministry which appointed him, so long as they were careful to ascertain that, he was the fojst applicant for the position. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Maranoa would not object to the salaries paid, .it all events, to some of these officers. ",55
261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Some of the young men who were selected from the services of the States because of their special ability, and were put to much more important work than they were formerly doing, have amply justified the payment of the salaries they are receiving.",55
262,Mr BAMFORD,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That was quite a democratic proceeding.,55
263,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I think it was a perfectly proper one. fci my opinion all the prizes should not go to those who are at the top; we ought to encourage merit on the part of those who are at lower levels. While I admit that all these matters should receive the careful consideration of honourable members, I think the majority of cases-and of course I do not profess to be familiar with all of them,-it can be shown that the officers selected are equal to the more important duties they are performing for the Commonwealth. They are men who had not an opportunity in the service of the States to attain positions to which their merit entitled them. Various suggestions have been made as tp the way in which we should deal with car public works. Some of those who have condemned the present system have apparently forgotten that I have previously criticized any unnecessary expenditure in connection with the Public Works Department of the Commonwealth. It would be very undesirable, unless the Commonwealth were actually compelled by the neglect or refusal of co-operation by the States, to duplicate or triplicate the States expenditure, and to increase, consequently, the burden on sethe people. If some of the suggestions that have been made to-night were adopted, the people of the Commonwealth would be subjected to an enormously increased burden, without any compensating advantage. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Department should undertake all its own work-that it should supervise the construction and repairing of Commonwealth buildings from one end of Australia to another. Those who have made that proposal could not have considered what an immense staff would be necessary.",55
264,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,No r the travelling expenses that would be incurred.,55
265,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The expenses would lie enormous. Our buildings must be inspected from time to time in order that they may not be allowed to f all into disrepair. In some parts of Australia, owing to the injurious effect of the climate, close and frequent examinations have to be made, and it would be altogether unjustifiable to have a staff of Commonwealth officers inspecting all our buildings, from one end of Australia to the other, whilst States officers were on the spot and able to do the work for us. We ought, wherever possible, to avail ourselves pf the co-operation of the States. I am satisfied that the relations of the Commonwealth and of the States in this regard can be made to work more smoothly than they have done. Whilst I occupied the office of Minister of Home Affairs, I took steps to that end, and am sure that the present Minister will follow up that action. I caused Public Works officers of the different States to meet in Melbourne, and they carefully considered the whole of the arrangements and the regulations, so that methods that would result in the least possible delay in carrying out Commonwealth works might be devised. As the result of this conference, they promised that they would, in the future, heartily co-operate with us. That being so, the few misunderstandings or delays that have occurred, owing to a lack of familiarity with the system, ought to be removed.",55
266,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"There is evidence that the system is working in that direction. ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - It must also be remembered that many of the delays that have occurred have been due to the action of the Parliament itself. As a rule the Estimates have not been passed until towards the end of November, and consequently only six months haye remained within which to carry out work that was supposed to occupy twelve. If the work could not be accomplished within the financial year, delays had necessarily to take place, as re-votes had to be made.",56
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I honourable member, when Minister of Home Affairs, did not succeed in securing the use of the whole of the Customs House, Sydney, for the Commonwealth. Mr ' DUGALD THOMSON - We tried to do so, and came to an arrangement that the matter should be allowed to stand over pending the settlement of the question of the housing of the Land and Income Tax Department, when, it was said, reconsideration would be given to our request, with the object of meeting the desire of the Commonwealth Government.",56
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The whole question of the transferred properties must be settled in some way or other.,56
269,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That is so, and if they cannot lie settled amicably other steps must be taken. Every effort should be made in the first place, however, to endeavour to arrange an amicable settlement. I do not intend to enter into a general defence of the Department. On a previous occasion I expressed my views as to the good work which most of the officers were doing, and I do not withdraw from the position which I then took up in regard to the management of the Electoral Department branch. I am satisfied that if it is left in its present position great danger may be created at some future time. Although the officers of the branch are doing all they can to systematize and organize it, the conditions under which they are compelled to work prevent them from getting the effective results which they desire. After careful thought and consideration, I therefore came to the conclusion that, as we are making so much use of the Postal Department in connection with elections- a use which is approved by experience,' and the recommendations of a Committee which inquired into the whole question-w e should endeavour to obtain still more effective assistance from that Department than we now get. At the present time difficulties occur because the officers of the Postal Department are not officers of the Department of Home Affairs, and some of them therefore decline to undertake the work of the Electoral branch. Others undertake it unwillingly. Some, of course, are glad to have it to do, and make themselves thoroughly acquainted with all its requirements, but removals are constantly taking place, sometimes very inconveniently for the Electoral branch, and in this way considerable trouble, if not serious consequences, might be occasioned at the time of a general election. At preregret that the sent we have to make use, as registrars and for other work, of too manv persons who are not members of the Public Service. I am not criticising the manner in which they do their work, but difficulties are occasioned because of the numerous changes which this system necessitates, because of (he constant removals from district to district, and because those who have taken up the work to gain a little extra remuneration subsequently find themselves full v occupied in their ordinary callings, and give it up. It was my intention-and T gave evidence of it by omitting from an Electoral Bill which I had drafted the provision which places the Electoral branch under the Minister of Home Affairs-to ask Parliament to affirm the desirability of removing that branch - to the Postal Department.",56
270,Mr CHANTER,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"What advantage would thus be gained ? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - In the administration of the Electoral Act important work is now being done by postal officials. Many of the officers of the Postal Department, however, are rather unwilling servants of the Department of - Home Affairs. Then, too, postal officials may be removed from place to place at any time, and it often happens that those who take their places have no experience of electoral work. Furthermore, a postmaster who is working for the Electoral branch cannot now call upon his staff to help him, although he may be overworked, and the staff, as sometimes happens in country places, is not fullyoccupied at certain times of the day. At the present time, if such an officer asked for assistance from his staff, he might be met with refusals, because his officials are not in any way the servants of the Department of Home Affairs.",57
271,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Coul d not the Postmaster General issue instructions that subordinate officials should assist postmasters in this work ? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - That would make the work of the Electoral branch a concern of the Postal Department, and, that being so, I think that the branch itself should be under the administration of the Postal Department.",57
272,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"A large number of other persons would still have to be employed in connection with electoral work. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - If an arrangement could be made between the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States, whereby the officials of the Post Office, the State school teachers, and the police, would jointly undertake both Federal and Sfate electoral work, we should have one of the most: effective electoral Departments that could be devised, and the work would be carried on as cheaply as possible.",57
273,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Uniformit v of legislation would be required to make that system effective.,57
274,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"A greater approach to uniformitv is necessary, and that is being attempted in the Bill which is now before another Chamber. Tust as the youths who enter the Post Office become acquainted with monev-orcler work before undertaking it, merely by coming into contact with those who are conducting that branch of the postal business, so the officials of ths Postal Department would become acquaintedi with electoral work if the electoral branch were transferred to the Postal Department; and there would then be nc difficulty in getting officers of experience wherever they were required, no matter what changes were made. Furthermore, instead of the work being done spasmodically as at present, it would be done regularly and systematically. The police who are scattered: all over Australia, and who now collect more or less accurate electoral rolls-thoug h sometimes there is not a very close approach to accuracy-would , under the arrangement which I suggest, perform a much more efficient service, and, instead of things having a constant tendency to d r if t back towards chaos, because of the impossibility of supervision, everything would become more and more orderly. For instance, if we had the aid of the letter-carriers, we should be able to get information of removals and arrivals in the various districts from day to day, week to week, or month to month.",57
275,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That would be only in the towns. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - The .information collected by the letter-carriers would affect the larger portion of our population. Besides them there are those who handle letters in country districts, whot could supply a good deal of similar information. In that way, everything would tend to the keeping of correct rolls. In my opinion, the postal service will have to be more largely used by the Commonwealth than it was by the States in connection with a number of matters. How else are we tp reach all parts of Australia in connection with the exercise, not only of the powers which we have already put into operation, but also of those which we shall subsequently take into our hands ? Would a private concern which had branches in every State of the Commonwealth, and was undertaking a new agency, maintain new establishments alongside their old ones in order to handle it? No. They would employ their existing establishments. Similarly, the Commonwealth will have to employ the Postal Department. At first the officials may object to this, although they ought to rejoice in it . A branch of a mercantile house rejoices when it gets added business. Why? Because more important positions are thus created, and larger responsibilities are given. So, although the postal officials - may at first look askance at this proposal, when they find that the work which is being given to them, because they can best do it, will improve their positions, and demand the exercise of higher energies, and better in- Affairs Department ranks next. telligence, thus giving openings to smart men, they will rejoice at the benefits offered to them. I shall not go into the matter any more fullv to-night. I have referred to it because it was mentioned by the honourable member or Maranoa, to whom I give credit for great acuteness, seeing that he had not had the opportunities for forming an opinion on the subject which I obtained in consequence of my connection with the Department of Home Affairs. I could supplement what I have said by illustrations and statements of the experience of the electoral branch, but I shall reserve any further remarks on this head until the Electoral Bill is before us. In the meantime, I hope that honourable members will become familiarized with the suggestion, and be ready to come to some conclusion on the matter when it is brought before them. The State school teachere in out-of-the-way places would n i k i splendid registrars, because they know all the families living round about, while the police would make excellent collectors. I gather from the fact that the change which I propose to make is not provided for in the Electoral Bill that the Minister is not favourable to my proposal; but I assure him that I considered the question very carefully from all points of view before coming to the conclusion that the change should be made. Having come to that conclusion, I am not alarmed by the suggestion which has been made tonight for the abolition of the Department of Home Affairs, although the removal of the electoral branch might, to some extent, bring about the happy despatch. The work of enrolling electors all over tralia and of conducting polls at elections, must be undertaken in the interests, not of one Department, but of the whole Commonwealth. The Minister of Home A f fairs must have been amused when it was suggested that he had very little to do. I am sure that if he does his duty-and I have no doubt he does-h e will find plenty to do, We know that any Minister may make his work heavy or light according to the amount of attention he devotes to his duties. Mr Dugald. Thomson.",57
276,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,What was the experience of the honourable member?,58
277,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"1 found plenty to do. I admit that the Postmaster General's Department entails the most work upon the Minister, but I think the Home I do not think that any great amount of extra work need be entailed on the Postmaster-General under the change I have proposed if the Chief Electoral Cfficer properly discharges his duties. The whole of the work of administration in connection with the Commonwealth could be performed by one Department if it were sufficiently strengthened, but I do not believe in wholesale amalgamation. In the case which I have brought under notice, there is the best of reasons for making a change. If the services of the officials of the Post and Telegraph Department are to be utilized for the purpose of carrying out the work required to be performed under the Electoral Act, there is the strongest reason why the administration of that branch should be placed under the control of the Department of the Postmaster-General. Many other functions, which, so far, have not been exercised by the Commonwealth, will before very long have to be performed by the Department of Home Affairs, the staff of which will find ample employment. I do not for a moment suggest that the officers of the Department of Home Affairs have not tried to do their best in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act. On the contrary, they have performed their duties very creditably, but my point is that the administration of the Act should be placed under the control of the Postmaster-General, the officers of whose Department are distributed throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Moreover, if the post-office staffs can be pressed into the service, there will be no necessity for postmasters, who are .also electoral offiAus- cers, to overwork themselves to the same extent as formerly, and we shall have at our disposal a thoroughly trained and numerous staff, which will be available for all emergencies. In this-way we should remove one of the greatest difficulties, indeed dangers, in connection with our electoral system. I do not propose to move in this matter at present, but shall - defer action until the Electoral Bill is before us. I merely submit the suggestion for the consideration of the Minister and honourable members generally.",58
278,Mr CULPIN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I was very pleased to hear the suggestion made by the honourable member for North Sydney, because my ideas are entirely in accord with his, and I trust that his proposals will meet with approval when they are submitted to the House. The honourable member for Maranoa remarked that the Electoral Department might aptlv be described as the circumlocution office, and I am disposed to agree with him. On one occasion, during the recess, I was in Brisbane, and I received an intimation from the Electoral Department that a certain gentleman had been appointed as the electoral officer for the district in which I live. Having an electoral matter to inquire about, I. went to the office in Fortitude Valley, and asked for the officer who had been named, and' was surprised to be told that no one knew anything of him. It eventually transpired that the gentleman who had been appointed was acting as relieving officer during the absence of the permanent occupant on leave, and that he had already left the district. Fully two months elapsed before the permanent officer was again officially gazetted. I think that affords a very good illustration of circumlocution or red tape. I have to thank the honourable member for Maranoa for having obtained from the Attorney-General information with regard to the case of Mr. Nicholas Hart, which I sought from the Postmaster-General some time ago.",59
279,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," At one time T was under the impression, which seems to have been shared by many other honourable members, that the Department of Home Affairs was a typical circumlocution office, but, upon making inquiries, I came to the conclusion that very frequently the delays for which I had held the Department responsible had occurred elsewhere. In connection with delay in the payment of accounts, the fault, if any, lay with the Treasury, which required to have proper vouchers supplied. In regard .to public works, I ascertained that many of the delays were due to the extent to which the Department of Home Affairs had to rely upon the assistance of States officials. - Whilst a number of officers in different Departments have to be consulted with regard to the one matter, delavs must occur, and T do not think that the Department of Home Affairs has deserved much of the blame that - has been attached to it. I listened with considerable interest to the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney, who was able to speak in the light of the experience gained during his administration of the Department of Home Affairs. There is much to commend his suggestion that the Electoral Office should be transferred to the Post and Telegraph Department. When the Electoral Office was first established, a central staff was formed, and officers were appointed to administer the Act in the various States, but the officials intrusted with the detail work were largely drawn from the Post and Telegraph Department. The principle was adopted of appointing as returning officers officials of the Post and Telegraph Department, but that was not strictly adhered to. The services of a number of gentlemen outside of the public service were also availed of, and the consequence was that we instituted a hybrid system. The reason given for appointing electoral officers outside of the'service was that it was impossible to secure efficient men on the spur of the moment. It seems to me that we should restrict appointments under the Electoral Act to officers of the public service, or enlist the services of the States returning officers, who are thoroughly competent men, and have had experience in connection with elections for many years. Either one of these policies should be adhered to. I think the best plan is to confine appointments under the Electoral Act to officers of the Post and Telegraph Department. It should surely be possible to find in each of the electorates postal officials competent to discharge the duties of returning officers, divisional returning officers, assistant divisional returning officers, and electoral registrar's. It would certainly be of great advantage to place the administration of electoral affairs under the control of the Postmaster-General and his officers. At present many appointments have to be revoked because of removals and of changes in the service. The work in this direction wculd be minimized if the Postal officials and the officers of the Electoral branch were brought into more direct touch than is possible under the present conditions. The present arrangement involves a large amount of vork, and I am satisfied that by transferring the work of the Electoral Office to the Postal authorities a great saving, could be effected and ' increased efficiency secured. Consequently, I approve of the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney; but before finally committing myself to the-policy outlined I should like to have a further opportunity of looking into it. At the present time, the divisional returning officers in country districts are frequently harassed by the fact that they are unable to command the services of efficient men. The Postal officers, who are not specially appointed for that purpose, refuse to have anything to do with electoral work. Then, in remote centres, it frequently happens that post-offices are merely receiving offices. The work connected with them is often performed by individuals more for the sake of rendering a serviceto their neighbours than for the remuneration which they receive. These men cannot be expected to attend to electoral matters which involve clerical work. Under such circumstances, the State school teacher in the neighbourhood is probably better qualified to undertake that work than is anybody else, and his services should be utilized in this connection. In making local arrangements, the greatest latitude should be given to the divisional returning officers. It ' is to their interest to secure the best assistance that is obtainable. I appeal to the Minister, as far ,as possible, to confine electoral appointments to officers of the Commonwealth or the State Public Services.",59
280,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is the principle upon which we are acting.,60
281,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The practice, I fear, is one which is "" more honoured in the breach than in the observance,"" because I understand that some very important positions have recently been filled by persons who are outside the Public Service.",60
282,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Sometime s Postal officer objects to performing electoral work..,60
283,Mr BROWN,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"That is so; and in that case the Department must invoke outside assistance. I wish now to refer to another matter. It is alleged that prior to the last general election a meeting of divisional returning officers was held at various centres. They were consulted by the Chief ^Electoral Officer, Mr Lewis, who afterwards instructed them in the duties which they would be called upon to perform. There is a very wide conflict of testimony as to what actually occurred in the consultation room. It is alleged by some that a promise was made that in addition to a salary to cover their services for the year - they would receive a special bonus for discharging the onerous duties connected with the election which was then pending. When these officers made their claim it was promptly repudiated, and they were informed that their total remuneration had been fixed at £ 2 6 per annum. The result was that some of them retired immediately after the election had .been held. These received only a few shillings. This injustice was of such a glaring character that the Minister was induced to grant them some extra remuneration. But the claims of the officers who continued to discharge their duties were utterly ignored. 'Some time ago, a deputation of these officers waited upon the late Minister of Home Affairs and submitted to him the evidence upon which they based their claim to the special allowance. Included in that evidence was a letter from the Electoral Officer of New South Wales, Mr Biden, intimating that he quite understood that a bonus had been promised, and that he supposed the authorities would grant it. At any rate, the general impression amongst the divisional returning officers was that they would be paid a certain bonus, in addition to a salary for discharging their duties. In two or three cases they have acted upon that assumption, and paid the amount they were to receive to their credit. They were subsequently called upon to refund the money, the Government having decided to disallow their claim. I do not know whether they have complied with that demand, but when the deputation of 1 divisional returning officers waited on the late Minister of Home Affairs in Sydney, they had not done so. I have since learned' from non-official sources that the Minister decided not to allow the claim for a bonus the of£2o for conducting the election, but to grant them up to£10 each to recoup actual out-of-pocket expenses in respect of which, because of the promise that had been given, no claim had previously been made. Having regard to the statements that I heard at that deputation, and the strong impression that I then formed as to the obligation of the Government to grant this bonus, not only to the officers of New South Wales, but to those of Victoria, I cannot help feeh ing that the Department has treated these men most unjjenerously. As one having some little knowledge of the labour and expense incurred in con-ducting an election, I think that the claim made by these officers was a reasonable one.. If the Department desires to secure effective service, it is of first importance that divisional re J turning officers who have not only to attend to the working of the electoral machinery between - the holding of each election, but to personally supervise each ejection, should be allowed a bonus of £ 2 0 in addition to the annual allowance of £ 2 6 which they now receive. Every one must recognise the desirableness of securing the services of capable men. If an officer were guilty of carelessnesss, or showed a want of appreciation of his duties, he might involve the Department - in very heavy expense. Last year two elections were declared void owing, I believe, to the remissness of certain officers, and the result was that the Commonwealth was put to great expense. I propose to make further inquiries as to the allowances granted in respect of the last general election. If the decision arrived at by the late Minister was based upon sound and reasonable grounds, it must of course stand, but I do wish to impress upon the Minister the point that it is unreasonable to expect these officers to carry out the work for a sum of £ 2 6 per annum. I understand that the granting of an additional allowance of £ 2 0 in respect of each general election may be dealt with by regulation, and I trust that my suggestion will receive the earnest and favourable consideration of the Minister. If these officers are to be treated as they have been, I feel confident that the Department will not in future secure the best men for these positions.",60
284,Mr CROUCH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I wish to refer to a matter which could not be discussed when the Public Service classification scheme was before the House, but is nevertheless one of considerable importance to some public servants. The Commonwealth took over from the States a number of officers who, under the law of New South Wales and Victoria, were eligible for transfer from the non-clerical to the clerical division on passing a certain examination. Since Federation, however, these officers have not had an opportunity to submit themselves for examination. The grievance I have to put before the Committee relates to the case of an officer of the Postal-Department, who was taken over from the Victorian State service. On 6th August, 1903, the following circular letter was sent by Mr Scott, secretary of the Department, to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and was afterwards addressed by the Victorian Deputy Post[T20 ] master-General to the officers in his branch of the serviceI have the honour to inform you that (so and so) being desirous of transfer to clerical division, has submitted an application to be allowed to qualify for same by passing an examination in the subject of geography only, he having passed in all other subjects prescribed for by Act 197 at examination held by State Government, held in December, 1900. The Commissioner has decided that all officers who partially qualified in this exam., such as (so and so), shall be allowed to complete their qualification for transfer to the clerical division by passing in the subjects they previously failed, and which are prescribed by Commonwealth regulations, such officers to note accordingly. Mr L. H. Leigh, of the post-office, Geelong, was among those who, whilst in the Victorian service, submitted himself for examination for transfer from the non-clerical to the clerical division, and partially passed. He applied for permission to submit himself for examination to complete his pass, but was informed that only officers taken from the New South Wales service were entitled to this privilege. The following is a copy of the letter which he received from Mr Reddin, secretary to the Public Service Commissioner: In reply to your communication applying for permission to complete your examination for admission to the Clerical Division of the Service, I am directed to inform you that the concession referred to in the notification which recently appeared in the Weekly Guide, issued by the Postal Department, was intended to apply only to three or four officers in New South Wales. Under the Public Service Act of that State, officers who had partially passed the examination were permitted to complete their pass at a subsequent examination. As this was not, however, the law of Victoria, your application cannot be entertained. I do not wish to deal with this case as a question of State against State, but desire the Minister to take steps to enable these men to undergo the necessary examination. They have waited with considerable patience for this opportunity, and attention ought certainly to be given to their case.",61
285,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I promise the honourable and learned member that I will inquire into the matter.,61
286,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," In connection with the itemNew edition, Seven Colonies, £500, I wish to draw attention to the fact that all the books issued by Mr Coghlan are very indifferently indexed, with the result that much difficulty is frequently experienced in ascertaining the information which one seeks from these publications. I have previously mentioned this matter, but it appears that complaints made in connection with the consideration of the Estimates have but little effect. In most statistical compilations a copious index is given, and is of very great assistance. I regret to say, however, that in many of Mr. Coghlan's books the index is insufficient, while the information given is sometimes inexact. I have found mistakes in the index to the Seven Colonies, the wrong page being sometimes given. If honourable members turn to that work, they will find that the statement there given of the indebtedness of Australia does not correspond with that recently issued by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth.",61
287,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Is the honourable member referring to the classification of the loans?,62
288,Mr MAHON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"And also to their nature. Many of the New South Wales loans are practically unredeemable, but any one reading Mr Coghlan's publication would imagine that they were all repayable at fixed dates. We have no control over the issue of these works, but, as we expend £ 5 0 0 every year in purchasing copies of them, a suggestion might be made to the responsible Minister in the New South Wales Government that a more complete index should be supplied, and that the information should be up-to-date and exact. The right honourable member for Balaclava found that the information supplied in Coghlan, and even by the State Treasury qfficials of New South Wales, was not quite correct. This matter certainly should be looked into, because it is extremely inconvenient to those who have to consult these works to be referred by the index to a certain page, and find that the information they are seeking is on some other page. These are little blemishes whicfi could be easily removed, and I am sure would be removed, at the suggestion of the Minister.",62
289,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," At tention has very properly been called to the increasing cost of this Department. I find that the salary of the secretary, whom I believe to be a first-class officer, has been increased by £ 5 0 . I should like to know on what principle these salaries are fixed. It seems to me that the principle which applies to the service generally should apply to these higher officers as well.",62
290,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The Public Service Act jbuts the administrative officers on a diffeof rent footing from that on which the rest of the service is placed.,62
291,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"Yes ; but the same principle should apply to all. The value of the work required in the performance of the duties of an office should be ascertained, and the officer filling the position should be paid accordingly. This officer is now receiving £750', and it is proposed to make his salary £ 8 0 0 .",62
292,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,The Public Service Commissioner valued the work attaching to the office at £ 8 5 0 .,62
293,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am not satisfied with his classification. I find that other officers have been dealt with differently. For instance, the Commissioner of Patents, who presides over a Department whose volume of business is rapidly increasing, and will, I hope, continue to increase, is not getting his salary raised; and in South Australia the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General has been reduced.",62
294,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"His predecessor, Sir Charles Todd, was getting a much higher salary, because, I believe, he did special work.",62
295,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I could find other illustrations. We should insist upon the application of the principle that every officer shall receive only the value of his work. I do not wonder at the complaints of the States in regard to our expenditure when these enormous increases are proposed.,62
296,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"On the whole, there has been a reduction in the cost of the administrative division of the service.",62
297,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I think that, in some cases the salaries are too high. It does not matter how the duties of a man receiving a small salary are added to, he finds it difficult to get a rise of a shilling or two shillings a week; but, apparently, highly-paid officers can easily get an increase of £ 1 a week. Any one who is receiving over £ 6 0 0 a year ought to be called upon to do a great deal of work for it , and the proposed increase of £ 5 0 a year requires some explanation. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that we must p.ut an end to this state of things. I was a member of a Royal Commission which inquired into the administration of the Public Service of South Australia. We found that the service was getting top-heavy. Every man who entered one branch of the Railway Department, for instance, was receiving automatic increases salary, until the burden was getting too heavy for the State to bear, and retrenchment had to be effected. Unless we are careful, the Commonwealth service will have to be similarly dealt with.",62
298,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Thes e highly-paid officials do not do half as much work as we do.,63
299,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"It is my experience that the second in command usually does a great deal more work than the head of the Department, and has much the same responsibility. I see that an amount is provided for classification increases, arrears, and increments on salaries over £160, but I understand that provision has not been made for the payment of all the increases to which officers are entitled, and that this is creating a great amount of dissatisfaction.",63
300,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Especiall y in the Postal Department.,63
301,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Yes .,63
302,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If the amount set down here is inadequate, a further amount will be provided in the Supplementary EstiIHcLt€S*",63
303,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I want the assurcost ance of the Minister that those who entitledto receive increases shall not be kept waiting for their money any longer. If some officers receive their increases others do not, irritation will be caused, and that will not be in the best interests of bourne. tfie service.",63
304,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND, I generally inState dorse the complaint of the honourable memtion. ber for Canobolas as to the misunderstanding which has arisen in connection with the gratuities paid for work done by electoral officers at the last general election.,63
305,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"The matter was investiartistic gated very carefully by my predecessor, and his decision, as reported on the papers, seems to be just.",63
306,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I do not know what that decision is.,63
307,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,He decided to pay £ over and above the remuneration to cover all out-of-pocket expenses.,63
308,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I think that the genetaste. ral understanding among the officers themcate selves was that they would get £ 2 0 .,63
309,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"No one had authority to promise that amount, and written instructions were sent out which were contrary to that understanding.",63
310,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I believe that a nummoment. ber of the divisional returning officers actually expended that amount, thinking that it would be refunded to them, the amount of work expected of them, it [120J- 2 seems rather parsimonious for the Commonwealth to refuse to pay them their actual expenses. It must be remembered that the work is done at a tremendous sacrifice of spare time, and that the officers were under the impression that they would be refunded their expenses. Whatever arrangement may have been entered into after the misunderstanding that occurred at the last general election, I hope that some more reasonable rate of remuneration will be agreed upon, and that a definite allowance will be made to the divisional returning officers to compensate them in some measure for the amount of extra trouble that their work involves. There is no doubt that some of the work has been performed in anexceptionally creditable manner. I trust that the Minister will give this matter his attention, because I am sure that honourable members do not desire that those who perform, service for us shall be dealt with in any niggardly spirit. I should like to know whether the proposed vote for the maintenance of Government Houseincludes the of painting and interior decorations are at the Melbourne Government House.",63
311,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We had to make a special and provision for £550 for expenditure upon painting at the Government House, MelWe are bound to maintain the establishment and deliver it over to the authorities in good order and condi",63
312,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I trust that when arrangements are made for any further painting or decorative work the Government wil 1 enlist the services pf some one with a littlp feeling, and that we shall have no repetition of the atrociously, bad colour scheme which has been recently carried out.",63
313,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"We have. to consult the State authorities in a matter of that kind, 1 0 because the property belongs to them.",63
314,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I cannot compliment the State authorities upon - their artistic I should like the Minister to indiwhen the revised Public-Service Classification Scheme will be submitted to honourable members.,63
315,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I have already stated that the report is under consideration, and will be made available at the earliest possible",63
316,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"When may we reasonably expect to receive it--befor e the and, seeing close of the session ?",63
317,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Yes .,63
318,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I am sure that honourable members will be anxious to ascertain what has been done to carry out certain suggestions made by honourable members when the Classification Scheme was under consideration, and I hope that the report will be presented without unnecessary delay.  rect attention to the delay which has occurred in connection with the carrying out of Commonwealth Public Works. It seems ridiculous that we should be called upon to vote moneys year after year for works unless! they are to be carried out within a reasonable time after the appropriation. It is disgusting to honourable members, who know that certain works are of an urgent character, to find that their construction is delayed, and that the monev appropriated for them has to be revoted time after time. I do not know who is to blame, but, personally, I have an idea that some of the responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the States Treasurers, who have brought influence to bear upon the Commonwealth Treasurer, with a view to reducing the Commonwealth expenditure upon public works, merely because we have decided that the cost of public works shall be defrayed out of revenue instead of out of loan money. I do not believe that the fault lies with the officers, but blame is attachable to some one when we find that works approved of three years ago have not vet been completed. There is no justification for such delay. If the staff is not adequate it should be increased. When I instituted inquiry into the matter - in Melbourne I was informed that the delay occurred in Adelaide, and when I made inquiries there I was assured that the authorities in Melbourne were responsible. Eventually I ascertained that in nearly every case the delay was traceable to the State charged with the supervision of the work. This is a very unsatisfactory state of things. The Commonwealth Departments are being discredited in the eyes of the public because of the tardiness with which these works are executed. As a matter of fact, the delay is chiefly due to a certain influence which is being brought to bear in the States, and which I fear is being applied to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I would impress upon the Minister the desirableness of expediting the carrying out of these works. I am quite sure that the officers of the Department are eager to give effect to the instructions of this House. When we approve of works being undertaken they ought to be put in progress with the utmost expedition.",64
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND, I would suggest that the Minister should consent to an adjournment of the debate.,64
320,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Le t us deal with the first Subdivision.,64
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,That is impossible. There are several honourable members who wish to speak. Surely it is not unreasonable to discuss the affairs of the Department for three hours. I venture to say that the Minister has known of Departments being discussed for two or three days. Do the Government anticipate keeping the House until 12 o'clock to-night?,64
322,Mr GROOM,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,Certainl y not.,64
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"There are four honourable members present who wish to speak, and I know of several others who are now absent. I submit that n o'clock is the usual hour for adjournment.",64
324,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I trust that the Minister will consent to an adjournment of the debate. The request is a most reasonable one. This morning I did not reach my home until 1 o'clock, and I had to attend a meeting of a Select Committee at half-past 10 o'clock. The Minister can accomplish no good by adopting these "" forcing"" tactics, and I certainly think that he should agree to our request that progress be reported.",64
325,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I do not think it can be said that our request that the first division »>n the Estimates of the Department of Home Affairs should, at least, be passed before we adjourn was an unreasonable one. There is no desire to press the proposal if there are other honourable members who wish to discuss the division; but the Government do not wish every item to be unduly debated.",64
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,I never knew of a Government that wished its Estimates to be discussed.,64
327,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"If there are any complaints to be made, they ought certainly to be ventilated, but I should like to know whether, if we consent now to progress being reported, the debate on this division is likely to be prolonged tomorrow ?",64
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,No .,64
329,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND,"I trust that if we consent now to report progress, honourable members opposite will assist us to pass the Estimates of one or two Depart-' ments before we adjourn tomorrow afternoon. It is necessary that we should - make some progress before the week end, otherwise honourable members will not be able to leave for Sydney tomorrow night. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS' SEIZURE OF PANAMA HATS. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) posedThat the House do now adjourn.",65
330,Mr JOHNSON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I wish to direct the attention of the Minister ot Trade and Customs to the following paragraph in this evening's issue of the Herald:The Collector of Customs, Mr A. W. Smart, announces that the thousand Panama hats which had been taken over by the Department at the importers' valuation, plus 30 per cent., as stated in yesterday's Herald, have been withdrawn from sale. The Customs officials are very reticent as to the reason of the withdrawal, but simply state that they have acted in accordance with the instructions of the Minister, who is "" considering the case."" T should like to know whether the statement is correct, and if it is, whether the Minister will give the House some information as to the reasons of the withdrawal of these goods from sale?",65
331,Mr HUTCHISON,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," I understand that these hats were valued by the firm in question at is. 4d. each, and that they have been valued for Customs purposes at 4s. each. If that be so, I should like the Minister to inform the House where Panama hats may be purchased wholesale at the latter rate?",65
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POSTAL ASSISTANTS AND," It is true that these hats have been withdrawn from sale, but I am not prepared, at present, to state exactly what has taken place, or is likely to take place, in connection with the dispute. The matter has not been finally dealt with. As to the question put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh,- I have only to say that, so far as I can gather, the. consignment of hats in question was valued at £ 6 0 , or about is. 4d. each. There is a dispute at the present moment as to - whether they are true Panama hats. If they are, I think they will be valued by the Department for Customs purposes at more than 4s. each. I am sure that honourable members will not ask me to make any further reference to the question at the present time. The papers were before me today, and f thought it wise, in the interest of the Department, to take a certain course. Question resolved in the affirmative. .House adjourned at 11.8 p.m. pro",65
