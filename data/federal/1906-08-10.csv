1,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, u f o n notice I. As Lance-Scrgcant John Hanks, who did not pay £ 1 0 iSs. 6d. till he had been sued for the amount, was tried by court-martial and dismissed with ignominy from the Western Australian branch of the Commonwealth Military Forces, why has Lieutenant Alexander John Russell, of the Perth Highlanders, who allowed himself to be sued for ^400, and who dishonorably evaded payment by pleading the Gaming Act, and was therefore expelled from the Stock Exchange of Perth, not been similarly dealt with ? 2. Is there a different code of honour in the Commonwealth Forces for commissioned officers and for non-commissioned officers? 3. Is there any truth in the assertion that Lieutenant Russell escaped punishment because he is a well-known society and business man, a member of the Weld arid Perth clubs, and a personal friend of a leading officer?",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Lance-Sergeant Honks was tried by court martial forConduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that, on the 24th February, 1906, although repeatedly called updn, and, after promising to do so, he failed to account for, or produce, the sum of £ 1 0 18s. gd., the property of the officer commanding the nth Australian - Infantry Regiment,which failure 'necessitated action being taken in the Police Court, Perth, in order to recover same, such - recovery being obtained in consequence of an order of the Court, made on the 7th March, 1906. He was found guilty, and sentenced to be discharged with ignominy. With regard to Lieutenant A. J. Russell, of the Western Australian Infantry Regiment- a cutting from the Sunday Times, of Western Australia, commenting on the expulsion of Mr. Russell from the Perth Stock Exchange was brought under the notice of the Minister, who referred it to the Commandant of Western Australia. The Commandant, in replv, stated that he had been watching the case very closely, and had been informed that Mr Russell has instituted proceedings against the Sunday Times, and recommended that no action be taken until such time as the Court has given judgment. 2. No. 3. No.",13
3,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,He was from the Stock Exchange.,14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I understand that that was in consequence of a statement published in the newspaper against whose proprietors he is bringing a, libel action. PENNY POSTAGE.",14
5,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether he will supplement, the information already given as to the loss in each State on the adoption of penny postage, by a statement showing the number of letters, in each case, to which the loss applies?",14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Yes ; the information will be furnished on Tuesday next. GENER AL BUSINESS ,14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [10.34] - I move That, until otherwise ordered, the Order of the House giving precedence to General Business on each Thursday until half-past six o'clock be suspended, and that Government Business shall have precedence on each day of sitting. There are but a few weeks left in which to transact a great deal of important business, and while many questions of mag- nitude are raised by the notices on the business-paper in the names of private members, if our time is insufficient for the transaction of Government business it must be impossible to dispose effectively of their business. They are, therefore, not being asked to sacrifice real opportunities. If we are to do the work which remains to be clone this session, and ,go to the country as early as is desired, there remains but a very short time in which to do it.",14
8,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If an to deal with private members' business presents itself, will the honourable and learned gentleman allow us to take advantage of it?",14
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Of course.,14
10,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [10.35] - At this stage of the session the proposal of the Government is a perfectly justifiable one, especially in view of the lamentable condition of the artisans in the foundries of Victoria. The Attorney-General about Christmas time drew a most affecting picture of the miserable state of the firesides of Victoria for want of a relief which would be afforded after the reports of the Tariff Commission were piesented. I understand that those reports are now to'hand, expelled and, no doubt, one of the objects of the motion is to allow the Government to deal with these cases of harrowing distress.",14
11,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [ - 3 7 ] - - I have on the notice-paper a very 10 important motion, affecting a very large section of the community, but I recognise that the Tariff proposals of the Government, which affect an even larger section, are of more, pressing importance. As the Prime Minister has said that he will, if possible, give honourable members an opportunity to deal with their business, I am only too willing to support the motion.",14
12,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [10.38] Whilst agreeing with the Prime Minister in the desire for the expedition of business, I think that consideration might be given to the fact that some private members have ver y important motions on the business paper already partly dealt with or altogether untouched. I have set down for the 30th August a motion dealing with reciprocal trade relations with New Zealand, having surrendered my right to proceed with it earlier in the session to allow honourable members to visit Queenscliff on .the occasion of the sending of the first message by wireless telegraphy from the mainland to Tasmania.",14
13,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Othe r honourable members did the same.,14
14,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I admit that. While recognising the reasonableness of the Government proposals, I ask the Prime Minister whether if at any time during the remainder of the session an opportunity presents itself to proceed with, private business in Government time, he will allow us to take advantage of it?",14
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . opportunity Mr STORRER (Bass) [10.39] - I intend to oppose proposals such as this so long as the Government allow honourable members to occupy three or four hours in speaking on the business brought before us.,14
16,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Darwin, for instance, took three or four 'hours to deliver himself in regard to the Budget.",14
17,Mr STORRER,Unknown,I am not responsible for any conduct but my own; but I feel that if honourable members curtailed their remarks we could get through the business on the notice-paper within a month.,14
18,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [10.40]. - I have a motion om the business paper which, if not dealt with this session, cannot have any effect for the next three years, since it relates to the holding of general elections. I wish to provide that every person on the roll of electors shall be compelled to accept the full responsibilities citizenship by casting his vote on the occasion of Parliamentary elections, and if the motion is not carried into effect this session so. as to apply to the next general elections it will - not be applicable until three years later;. My own speeches in this Chamber will be very brief and to the point, and I hope that if an opportunity occurs to allow this very important matter to be dealt with the Prime Minister will allow us to take advantage of it .",15
19,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [10.41] - I have some very important motions on the business paper, but am even more anxious than is the leader of the Opposition to proceed with Tariff reforms. It is a matter of very great regret to me that not a line of the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission has been made available to honourable members.",15
20,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Who m does the honourable member blame for that?,15
21,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The members of the Tariff Commission. That evidence should have been sent to honourable members as it was given, instead of being filtered through the newspapers. I have not known a Commission to act as this Commission has done. The result of its arrangements will be that we shall get a whole pile of evidence at one time, and shall have a great mass of details put before us which it will be impossible to go through.",15
22,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,This is a protectionist speaking ! He wants an excuse for not dealing with the matter now.,15
23,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am speaking, not in mv owji interest, but in that of those situated like the honourable member.",15
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I am prepared to deal with the subject at once, but the honourable member is trying to shirk the settlement of the question, though he has continually been saying that it is necessary to have it dealt with.",15
25,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The evidence ought to be in the hands of honourable members, so that we can form an opinion upon it apart from .the recommendations embodied in the reports of the Commissioners. As it is, we are in possession of nothing.",15
26,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable member has read the newspaper reports.,15
27,Mr REID,Unknown,"It is assistance, not evidence, that his friends want.",15
28,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I desire that the matter may be settled in such a way that of it will not be re-opened for a considerable time. If it is only patched up by the removal of so-called anomalies, it will soon be re-opened.",15
29,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable memberdoes not wish it to lie settled before thegeneral elections.,15
30,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I wish it to be settled' as soon as the honourable member does.  too, have an important _motion on the business paper- I believe the most important there. It deals with the taking over by the Commonwealth of the Northern Territory of South Australia, and I hope that the House will come to some decision? in regard to it . I trust that the Ministry, who I believe are in earnest, will attempt to arrive at a settlement between South Australia and the Commonwealth on the subject.",15
31,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"How would the appointment of a Royal Commission suit the honourable member?  would delay matters. A big effort has. been made in South Australia to prevent the Commonwealth from obtaining control"" of the Northern Territory, and if. the matter is allowed to rest, steps may be taken by a section of the politicians of that State which will prevent the Commonwealth from doing anything in regard to it for a long time to come. I believe that, in the interests of the State and .of the Commonwealth, the Territory should be.under our control. Hence I am anxious that, notwithstanding the pressure of business before us, we should have an opportunity to come to some decision-to make some offer. At present we are standing off from each other.",15
32,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"Canobolas) [10.46] - If the motion be agreed to, it will prevent the House from proceeding any further with private member's' business. I have some little interest in this matter, because I have obtained permission to introduce a Bill to amend the Public Service Act in a somewhat important particular. I understand that members of the Opposition have some objection to my dealing with the subject, and I should be very glad if the Government would take it in hand. Question resolved in the affirmative. BUDGET. In Committee of Supply: Debate resumed from 9th August (vide page 2631), on motion by Sir JOHN FORRESTThat the itenf? ""' President, £ 1 ,100"" be agreed to.",15
33,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.47] Last night I was endeavouring to show how the principle applied by the Minister of War to Great Britain's second line of defence might be applied with equal reason to-that of the Commonwealth. There was nothing new in the proposition, but I think I should be able to show that the risk to Australia, if ever her second line of defence is called into requisition, will be much more considerable than has been -'enerally apprehended. There is very little danger at any time for the next decade or so of the Imperial command of the seas being absolutely lost, but it is possible that a combination of the whole of the naval powers of Europe against Great Britain might compel the latter to so concentrate her forces in a particular place, as to render it necessary for her to temporarily surrender her control of the eastern seas. It is by no means certain that in such an event the Asiatic powers that might be involved would trouble Australia. There are other points of the Empire in the eastern seas that might be more vulnerable and of greater importance from a military point of view, especially when one considers that control of the eastern seas by such powers would be only temporary, and that as soon as the menace to England by the European Powers had been removed, she would once more assert her supremacy in the East. Therefore, an Asiatic power might not care to embark upon a large expedition with the object of"" territorial occupation so far from her base. We must, however, be prepared for all eventualities, and, therefore, I would suggest that what is needed as a second line of defence is the skeleton of a vast citizen force- a skeleton which, in the event of an outbreak of war, could be rapidly clothed with flesh, and blood. should like to quote from a French technical paper called Armee et Marine, which expresses itself as follows: Le detroit de Malacca, passage si frequent^, porte des mers d'Extreme-Orient, est un des not vet dealt. points strategiques les plus monde. Sur ses bords, Singapore est devenu depuis longtemps"" un port commercial et un entrep6t de premiere importance. L'Angleterre va l'eriger en station navale, point d'appui de la flotte et grand dep6t de charbon pour la marine. II etait encore depourvu de clocks pour les reparations des grands croiseurs et des cuirasses; on va les lui donner. L'agrandissement des docks de Singapore va donner une valeur toute nouvelle a ce port splendide qui pourrait reunir routes les flottes britanniques. 11 etait deja le point de rendezvous oil les chefs des escadres angiaises de Chine, d'Australie et d'Extreme-Orient se plaisaient a concerter leurs plans devolutions et de manoeuvres. Desormais, port 'de guerre de premier ordre, flanquant le passage le plus commode et le plus frequente entre l'Ocean Indien et les mers de l'Asie Orientale, ce point va devenir un centre strategique incomparable et dont l'importance depassera celle de Gibraltar. Pour qui cherche a penetrer les desseins de l'amiraute britannique, i l est curieux de noter que ce renforcement de puissance coincide avec le renouvellement du traite d'alliance anglojaponais et l'entente cordiale de la France et de l'Angleterre. La Grande-Bretagne, libre d'intervenir partout, se reserve de pouvoir sans danger concentrer ailleurs to us ses efforts. I think that this clear testimony to the value of Singapore from a military point of view indicates that in the event of the control of the eastern seas being temporarily surrendered by Great Britain, Australia might still remain immune, because of the greater opportunities open elsewhere to the enemy. If we neglect our first line of defence upon, which our security will depend, we shall expose ourselves to undue risk. If , on the other hand, we endeavour, in addition, to maintain a large standing army, our Treasury will soon be exhausted. Therefore, I suggest that we should not relax our efforts to bring about a proper system of naval co-operation between the various portions of the Empire. So far as the second line of defence is concerned-the provision of an army to repel invasion- I suggest that only such parts of that organisation as cannot, be readily brought into existence should be kept in a state of preparedness. This organisation would include the staff, the administration, the military stores, the higher officers, and a pattern force, upon which others could be modelled. All these things could be provided for without incurring exceptional I expense, and we should be able to put the flesh on the skeleton when a time of crisis arrived, and turn out the rank and file in a thoroughly efficient state. There is one side of our land defences with which I have I refer to the coastal importants du defence force. At the present time, practically the whole of our defence forces might be included in that definition. forces must always be ready, because coastal defence is complementary to sea power, and is liable to be put to the test even while command of the seas is still held. honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, perhaps in his anxiety to follow the opinions of his political patron, the honourable member for Bland, fell into a curious error. At page 2431 of Hansard he is reported as having statedWith an islan-1 continent the first thing to be looked for is coastal defence. Notwithstanding all the rifles, guns, and forts, nothing compares in importance with coastal defence. The honourable member seems to have forgotten that forts and guns are usually regarded as forming an essential part of coastal defence. A very distinguished writer on these matters, who perhaps has done more than any other man to advance sea power- I refer to Captain A . P. Mahan-says "" The best protection against an enemy's fire,"" said Farragut, "" is a well-directed fire from our own guns."" Analogically, the best defence for one's own shores is to harass and threaten seriously those of the opponent; but this best defence cannot be employed to the utmost, if the inferior, passive defence of fication has been neglected. The fencer who wears also a breastplate may be looser in his guard. Seaports cannot strike beyond the range of their guns; but if the great commercial ports and naval stations can strike effectively so far, the fleet can launch into the deep rejoicing, knowing that its home interests behind the buckler of the fixed defences are safe till it returns. If , therefore, in maritime war, you wish permanent defences for your coasts, rely exclusively upon stationary works, if the conditions admit, not upon floating batteries which have the weaknesses of ships. If you wish offensive war carried on vigorously upon the seas, rely exclusively upon ships that have the qualities of ships and not of floating batteries. So much for this curious misconception of the honourable and .learned member. should like to ask honourable members who are interested in this matter what particular purpose torpedo vessels would serve in connection with our coastal defence ? Such vessels would be smaller than those which the Naval Director, in his last report, has shown to be too small for work upon the rough coast line of Australia. They would he infinitelv smaller than anv hostile vessel that would come to these waters. They are designed particularly for attack upon dark nights and in thick weather, and they were Mr Kelly. tried during the late war between Russia and Japan, with the most disappointing These results. Such vessels would not have the effect of frightening any invading ship away from our coast. If they met a raider, their position would be reminiscent of the The charge of the Watch in Much Ado About Nothing.",16
34,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Is the honourable member referring to the ships in connection with which we pay the naval subsidy ? Mr KELLY. - No , I am referring to Captain Creswell's proposed torpedo vessels^ - Mr WATSON - The ships in regard to which we pay a subsidy are stated by the Admiralty to be of' very little value-mos t of them should be on the scrap heap.",17
35,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member is evidently under a misconception, because at present the vessels for which we are paying as d r ill ships are of the very newestdesign.",17
36,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Powerful is of old design.,17
37,Mr KELLY,Unknown,We are not paying for the Powerful.,17
38,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , we are.",17
39,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I am speaking of the forti- arrangement that certain vessels should be kept here.,17
40,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Includin g an armoured cruiser, and there is no armoured cruiser on the Australian station.",17
41,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member ought to know that the Powerful has recently been altered, and that she* is now practically an armoured cruiser.",17
42,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Sh e is not, nor anything approaching it .",17
43,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member is reiving upon an old definition of the term "" armoured cruiser.""",17
44,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that most of the vessels for which we have been paying are now upon the scrap heap? I Mr KELLY - I can only answer one interjection at a time. The honourable member for Bland in speaking the other dav appeared to take it for granted that these ships were withdrawn from Australian waters in order that our coast line mi""ht be open to attack.",17
45,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I did not sav they were withdrawn in order to accomplish that. I said that they were withdrawn.,17
46,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It may cause the honourable member great surprise to learn that the reason why these vessels leave us is that they may the better discover any ship which may be contemplating an attack upon it,17
47,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I have heard of that, and I have also heard something about a person looking for a needle in a haystack.",18
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member has a good deal to learn in this connection.,18
49,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Unfortunately , honourable member himself thinks he has not.",18
50,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I should like to know what instructions would be 'gjven to the Australian torpedo flotilla .in case of the outbreak of hostilities. Certajuily, they ought to partake of the nature of the advice which was given by Dogberry to the watch in the third act of Much Ado About Nothing. There, Dogberry, addressing the commander of the watch, saysYou are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore, bear you the lantern. This is your charge : You shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince's name. Thereupon, the second man of the watch inquiresHow if he will not stand ? To which Dogberry repliesWhy then, take no note of him, but let him go; ancl presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave. That would necessarily be the attitude adopted by the Australian torpedo flotilla so far as raiders are concerned. should bid the enemy stand in the Prince's name, and if he will not stand, they should let him go, and thank God that t'hey are rid of a knave. That is about as much as our mosquito fleet could achieve in time of war. I should like to ascertain from the Treasurer whether any provision has been made in the Estimates for 'giving effect to the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee so far as our coastal forts are concerned ?",18
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No provision has been made. Mr KELLY : - I do not know what are the recommendations of that body, because, ought so far, they have not been made public. [Quorum formed.'] But I think it is certain to recommend the conversion of our slow hydro-pneumatic ordnance to a quick-firing gun, probably mark 7 6-inch gun. That conversion will auestion 'of national defence. involve a certain capital outla.v, although it will eventually result in lightening the burdens of the taxpayer. I am sorry that np provision has been made in that direction. Am I right in assuming that the Minister will provide for it in a special Bill?",18
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I cannot say at present.,18
53,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is quite possible that the Committee will recommend the abolithe tion of the submarine mine establishment, for the purpose of bringing all the ports of the Empire into line in this regard. That recommendation would not imply that the submarine mine is not an. efficient weapon, because, as a matter of fact, the German Government have recently been increasing their submarine mine strength. But the reason which will probably be urged for its abolition is that the British authorities have* not confidence in the control by shore authorities of submarine mines. The same consideration must necessarily apply to torpedo flotillas under local control in harbors. If the Imperial Admiral upon the station does not understand the discipline of such flotillas, there is no doubt that he would much rather dispense with - their services entirely, because they would be a source of danger to himself, as well as to the enemy. I hope that the Treasurer will carefully consider this aspect of the question. I do not desire to delay the Committee at any greater length. I merely wish to say that honourable members must recognise the new position of the Commonwealth, so far as her defence proThey blem is concerned. The rise of the great powers in the East makes it imperative that the naval strength of the Empire shall increase proportionately with that of Europe and Asia combined. Therefore, we should do our best by manly co-operation with .the other sections of the Empire to maintain a. common I m perial Navv which will be strong enough to meet all possible dangers, from whatever part of the world they may come.",18

55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think that we fo have a quorum present. 1,18
56,Mr REID,Unknown,"I recognise the very intelligent interest which the honourable mema ber for Wentworth has exhibited in the With reference to the preceding speech which was delivered last night by the honourable member for Gwydir, I feel very grateful to you, sir, for having called on the honourable member instead of upon lowing the established rule of alternating the speakers from different sides of the House, which is a very proper cause he has provided us with the missing Jink in the practical politics of Australia today. The Treasurer proudly that there were no political skeletons the cupboard of the Ministry, but I know of half-a-dozen, and one of them - is this question of , a Federal progressive tax. It is .rather surprising-in the important bearings of such a proposition, and the demand which has been made upon the Government by the .great body of their nominal supporters in the Labour corner-that the Treasurer in his exhaustive survev of the affairs of Australia-and incidentally I must give him credit for the great industry which he displayed in the Budget recently presented to us-did not even mention this matter. ing, I wish to recognise in the fullest possible way the ample information has been given by the Treasurer in connection with"" the public finances. - same time, we must not forget great debt of obligation which we owe to the right honourable member for Balaclava in this connection. Unfortunately his health precludes his attendance regularly in this House. But I look upon the labours of that eminent statesman in laying the foundations of a proper system for the exhibition of the financial affairs of Australia as services which ought long to be remembered. He has formulated a plan which I am glad to see the Treasurer has faithfully observed. In my opinion, nothing could exceed the completeness of the which the right honourable member for Balaclava, as Treasurer, gave to us in years gone by in his Budget statements. connection I wish also to express-and think I may express it on behalf of honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber-mv sense of obligation to the permanent officials of the Treasury Nobody knows better than does the Treasurer how invaluable are the labours of these officers in connection with this great question of Australian finance. to the speech of the honourable member for Gwydir, I should like to say that in the most exhaustive and thorough way he has revealed to us the result of the caucus deliberations upon the vexed question of a Federal progressive land tax. Of course, Mr Reid. we are not privileged to send reporters to mvself-fol- the meetings of that body",18
57,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The right honourable member does not invite us to the meetings of his rule-be- party.,19
58,Mr REID,Unknown,"We have very seldom the slightest chance of learning the nature of the boasted deliberations of the caucus, and I do not in think that we have even yet discovered where it meets. That is still a matter of profound speculation. But wherever it land may meet, we are sometimes indebted to view of an unusually verdant member of the party for a limelight exhibition of the effect of the proceedings which are elaborated in the hidden recess where the caucus assembles. The honourable member for Gwydir disclosed the policy of the Labour Party in reference to the imposition of a progressive land tax with a thoroughness and enthusiasm which left nothing to be desired. I am glad to see that he has recovered from his great In pass- effort, and is looking excellently well. I should like to express my acknowledgments which to him for the thorough and earnest way in. which he expounded the views of the At the Labour and Socialistic Party upon the the question of a Federal land tax. In the first place, setting aside the policy which is in view, my matured opinion is that the project of making use of the powers of the Federal Parliament to impose direct taxation in order to burst up big estates amounts to a deliberate attempt to ouorar/e the fundamental principles of the Federal Constitution.",19
59,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Nonsense .,19
60,Mr REID,Unknown,"I may be wrong, but I am simply claiming my right to express information my own opinions on the subject.",19
61,Mr WATSON,Unknown,On e might as well claim that the adoption of the policy of proIn .this tection is an outrage of the principles of I the Constitution.,19
62,Mr REID,Unknown,I am not expressing the views of the honourable member; I am simply endeavouring to express my own Department. views on this question.,19
63,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Are they authenticated?,19
64,Mr REID,Unknown,"We listened to the honourable member last nieht when, for, about Reverting three hours, he perspired teairs, not of blood, but of bathos, and surely he will permit me to briefly express my views. I do not know what order the honourable member observes in the caucus, but he ought to behave himself better when he is in the Chamber. I wish to briefly explain my reasons for taking the view of this question that I have just enunQueensland ciated. The lands of the States are left under the sovereign control of each of And so with all the States. them. The electors of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South AustraParliament, lia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are not enabled by the Federal Constitution serves to exercise the slightest control over respective policies of those respective the States. Victoria has sovereign control over its land problems, and so with New South Wales and the remaining States. Each State has complete control and sovereignty over all questions affecting land settlement and' the ownership of the land. On the principle that the Federal Constitution vests in the Parliament of Commonwealth, only that power which is expressly given, and that all that is not given is left to the States, this Legisthe lature has nothing to do with the lands of Australia, save in regard to the imposure sition of direct taxation. The object o the proposals of the Labour Partv is not to fill the Treasury with revenue in some emergency, because at this very when a progressive land tax is being advocated, the Federal Government are proposing to give away revenue to the extent of ,£200,000 per annum- a sacrifice for which no one has asked. That being so, there is no pretence of an emergency relation to the Federal Treasury. endeavour to make use of the power given to the Commonwealth Parliaobjection ment to impose taxation for revenue purposes, in order to do something has that has everything to do with the land, policies of the States, and nothing to do with the raising of revenue is a direct attempt to twist our powers under the Constitution-to invade the rights the States in one of the most vital blems in Australian politics today. we took over the burden of the manageon ment of the lands of Australia, the case would be different, but in an arena where none of the anxieties of land problems have to be dealt with, we are assuming to interfere in a vital way with the administration of the lands of the States. State today is perfectly free to pass any system of progressive land taxation that it pleases. In considering such questions, the people of one State have not the slightknows est right to interfere with the decisions another. What right would the people of New South Wales or Victoria; have to terfere with the views of the people as to the way in which the land policy of that State should be settled? When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was before the Prime Minister-who , whether his opinion was right or wrong, dea large degree of credit for his action the - viewe d an amendment with reference to> application of the Bill to States railwayservants as an infringement of States, rights. Greatly to the regret of a large number of honourable members who voted for that amendment, he took the view that he could not honourably remain in office, having regard to that outrage on the principles of the Constitution, and the consequent aggression on the rights of the States. the Within a few short years, however, we find him lending his support to a project of this so kind which would seriously interfere with sovereign rights of the States in a matter of infinitely more vital concern. I am that the Treasurer will not even, be1 f cause of his official position, pretend to sympathize /w.ith such an outrage on the Constitution. He is man enough to says moment, that he would not do so.",19

The honof orable member drew a picture which somesimple person in thegallery might havethought was wrung from a bleeding, lacerated heart, but which we, knowing him, recognise as_ simply one of his amateurish efforts a't rhetorical effect. He attempted to draw a picture-whic h was painful enough to move even one of these massive pillars in the House-of the horrible sufferings of the Australian artisan because at present he has not a farm. It is the artisans who, according ,to ""the honourable member, are to go on the farms to be opened up to Australian industry. The honourable member, in drawing his touching picture about the inalienable right of the States to the ownership of land, should have remembered that he was twisting the Constitutioni and proposing to put it to an unworthy use. In England, in days of old, the sovereign was the owner of the land, and so, in one sense, the State-no t the Federal Parliament, but each of the States-is the owner of the land within its boundaries. But when an ownerof land sells that to an individual, an'd takes money for it, and then talks of his inalienable right to occupy that land-h e is a rogue, or else holds the view-a n honourable view it may be that the proceeding itself was one that was attended with some fraud or inequity. The position in this democratic country which has unlocked the lands, and which, under a democratic system of manhood suffrage, has sold it . is different from that which may be said to have existed in older countries. The position of the Australian democracy in reference to the land is that that land was vested in it by the Crown, and that it sold it and",20
71,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Go t the money.,21
72,Mr REID,Unknown,"And got the money. When the honourable member for Gwydir says that, in spite of that transaction, the State still has a right to the land, and should take it by, means of bursting up big estates",21
73,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I did not say anything of the kind.,21
74,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member went as nearly as he could to making such a statement.,21
75,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The right honourable member should not attribute to me statean ments that I have not made.,21
76,Mr REID,Unknown,I can never thoroughly preciate the views of the honourable because he cannot express himself clearly.,21
77,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is the right honorhonorable able member's denseness that makes him unable to appreciate my views.,21
78,Mr REID,Unknown,What I was able to gather from the remarks of the honourable member was that,21
79,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Bette r judges than the right honourable member have said,21
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Order !,21
81,Mr REID,Unknown,I think that the honourable member ought to take punishment better. We all have to take it in turn.,21
82,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The right honourable member leaves the Chamber when another honourable member proceeds to criticise him.,21
83,Mr REID,Unknown,I have had to take a fair amount of punishment in my time.,21
84,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The right honourable member takes very little in this Chamber.,21
85,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member spoke of the inalienable right of the people to the land. I recognise that, in the sense that no man has a stronger belief than I have in the principle of breaking up big estates. So far from having any' conserland vative view on this subject, I hold that Australia will never be anything like a country fit to develop on broad national lines until its enormous estates are broken up. I admit that no statesman in any State could have a stronger or more beneficial policy in view. That being so, it is not from any antagonism to the object which the honourable member and his party have in view that I am criticising the means by which they seek to achieve it. I merely say that the Federal Parliament has no more right to take up the process of breaking up large estates than has an individual to pull down the fences which subdivide them. Every individual has just as much right to do that as the Federal Parliament has to endeavour to break them up. There is. a very simple method of dealing with this problem. All that is necessary is to resume the land for the purpose of closer settlement, and to pay its honest value. That is a simple method, which will solve all difficulties in regard to the large estates.",21
86,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Compulsor y resumption?,21
87,Mr REID,Unknown,"Compulsor y resumptidn. - Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member would be described in some places as anarchist for making such a proposal. Mr REIT ) - I am expressing the view apthat I enunciated before a large gathering member, in Adelaide a night or two ago.",21
88,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,And did not the right member's audience howl at it?,21
89,Mr REID,Unknown,"No ; and even the honourable member's supporters did not howl at me when 1 was dealing with other points. I am very grateful to the people of Adelaide for the magnificent hearing they gave me. It will be seen from what I have said that it is not because of any unfriendliness to the policy of closer settlement that I object to the Labour Party's proposal. My opinion is that if the Federal Parliament begins, even for a good object, to twist the Constitution today, it will create a precedent which may be followed for the most pernicious and wicked objects. I am glad that the Labour Party, as represented by the honourable member for Gwydir, has, in the most candid Way, put forth its views in connection with this subject. On this issue I am prepared to meet the Labour Party all over Australia. The land of Australia can be thrown open to the young Australian farmer tomorrow, or as soon as the people of any State are in favour of closer settlement. lieve that the majority of them are. The simple plan to adopt would be to more full y exercise the power of resumption which is now being exercised in several of the States. But we must pay honestly for the land according to its value. Mr W ILKI NSON - M u c h of it was dummied and stolen.",21
90,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is a matter which may be investigated on its merits. We must not confound' the man who holds land under honest conditions with those who have abused the laws of the country. It would be a novel way of finding the path of equity to confound the man who has abused the land laws with the man .who has honestly taken upland under those laws. Besides, it must be remembered that, in imposing taxation, we cannot pick out one man, and another, and not apply it to all. May I remind' honourable members who sit in the Government corner benches that the Western Australian Labour Federation, whose members cannot be. accused of sympathizing with the holders of large estates, have passed a resolution, denouncing the policy of the Labour Party as an incentive to frauds on the revenue?",22
91,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"And they, in their turn, are being denounced for having taken such action.",22
92,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is a matter which Labour members must settle amongst themselves. The Labour Federation of Western Australia has denounced the policy of the Labour Party, on the ground' that it offers incentive to fraud, and would interfere with those who have bond fide exercised the powers given to them by the States. My strong point is that the policy of closer settlement is a policy for the people of each State to deal with. We have no more right to use our power of taxation to solve the land problems of the States than we have to put our hands into the States Treasuries.",22
93,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If that is the only argument to which we have to reply, we shall be able to meet it .",22
94,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The difficulty is that each State Parliament has an Upper House.,22
95,Mr REID,Unknown,"My difficulty lies in having to acknowledge valueless interjections which cause a painful waste of time. There are several subjects upon fwhich I wish to touch, and I shall proceed now to refer briefly to some of the salient features in the I be- Financial Statement. In the first place, I notice that, whereas last year the Commonwealth returned £ 8 2 9 , 0 0 0 to the States, in. addition to three-fourths of the revenue for Customs and Excise, this year it will return only £311,000- a drop of over .£500,000. To Victoria and New South Wales that may not be a very serious matter, but it is most serious for Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Their finances are not on a large scale, though their difficulties are. The difficulty they find im making both ends meet is very great. Therefore the reduction I speak of is a most serious thing to them, and I cannot congratulate the Treasurer, or the country upon it . If we were paying interest on the properties which we have taken over from the States-the post-offices, telegraph and telephone lines, defences, and public buildings generally-w e should have no surplus to return to the States, because it has been estimated that, having regard to both interest and depreciation, £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 should have been deducted from our revenues, which has not been so deducted, because no arrangement has yet been made for paying for the transferred properties.",22
96,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"The amount of the interest due is ,£2,300,000.",22
97,Mr REID,Unknown,"I put it at ,£2,000,000 in oider to be on the safe side. These figures have to be considered in the light of facts which we must not forget. The Treasurer estimates that our revenue for next year will show an increase on the revenue of last year of about f per cent., which means practically stagnation. In a time of admitted prosperity, he estimates that our revenue will not increase at the rate of i per cent. But, nevertheless, he proposes to increase our expenditure by 1 2 per 1 cent. One of the most unsatisfactory and astounding features of the Budget is that the Treasurer, with a practically stagnant wevenue, is proposing to increase the public expenditure by 12J per cent., or somethink like ,£500,000. I admit that the expenditure of ,£50,000 or ,£60,000 on the forthcoming general elections is a special item.",22
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There was a good deal underdrawn last year.,23
99,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes ; but the broad result affecting the finances of the States is that they will receive back this year more than ,£500,000 less then they received last year, and that, with a practically stagnant revenue, our expenditure is to be increased by 12J per cent., while ,£200,000 which - should be obtained for services rendered is to* be surrendered. Revenue to the amount of ,,£200,000 is to be given up without any demand from the public for such action. The picnic of the Postmaster General to Rome is going to cost the Commonwealth a large sum of money. He must have got the idea there, when mingling with the distinguished men who formed the Conference which he attended. He has come back with these grand ideas, but let us see how they affect the position of the States. No State has had a more bitter trial with misfortune than has Queensland during the last few years.",23
100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,O r Tasmania.,23
101,Mr REID,Unknown,"The finances of Tasmania and of South Australia have also been strained. Those three States have suffered severely. Queensland has just had another blow, owing to our very proper action in regard to the opium trade, whereby the State loses revenue to the amount of ,£22,000 per annum. We do not mind that, because the object which is being achieved is such a good one; but on top of this loss of ,£22,000 is to come a loss of ,£'29,000 in carrying out the proposal of the Postmaster-General, or a total loss of ,£50,000. To New South Wales a loss of revenue of ,£50,000 or £""100,000 per annum would not mean much.",23
102,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"In addition to the loss of which the right honourable member speaks, there will be a great curtailment of country services.",23
103,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes . That aspect must not be forgotten. Tasmania will lose ;£i4,ooo a year and South Australia about ,£22,000.",23
104,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Togethe r with ,£7,000 in connection with the opium reform, making about ,£30,000 altogether.",23
105,Mr REID,Unknown,"I look upon the establishment of penny postage throughout Australia as a noble idea, but, like many other splendid ideas, it must be approached rather slowly. I do not think that there is a man in this Chamber who would"" grudge the expenditure of money for extending the facilities of the post-office to the most remote settlements. That is the direction in which we should be liberal. If we have £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 to spare, we might very well spend it in extending the postal service to the most remote parts of Australia.",23
106,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,And in giving better telephone facilities.,23
107,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not think that the Committee would grudge the expenditure of ,£200,000 in extending the postal service, and in giving better telegraph and telephone facilities to our pioneers. The gieat bulk of the advantage to be gained by the adoption of the Postmaster-General's proposal will go, not to the poor or to the pioneers, but to the great commercial interests of Australia. If the state of the revenue would allow us to make the sacrifice, I would agree to the giving of this boon to the commercial classes, because of its probable effect in increasing trade. But, at a time when the revenue is practically stagnant, and our liabilities increasing, the proposal is indefensible. Of course, it will be popular in business circles; but it stands out in singular contrast to the action of the Postmaster-General in trying to get a few extra pennies from the telephone service by the adoption of the toll system. There is no consistency in the honourable gentleman's policy.",23
108,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,In both cases a reduction is proposed.,23
109,Mr REID,Unknown,"I admit that the object is a good one, but I do not think we are at the present moment justified in giving up this large amount of revenue.",23
110,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does the right honourable member think that we should be justified in raising the Victorian postage rates to the level of the New South Wales postage rates?,23
111,Mr REID,Unknown,"I shall be willing to consider the matter when a proposal to that effect is brought forward by the Postmaster-General. With reference to our trade, I should like to mention some rather interesting results, which. I have obtained from the statistics which have been so well prepared by the Treasury Department. In the first place, the importance of our primary industries stands out when the total value of. our exports of primary produce is seen. In an export trade valued at ,£54,000,000, more than .£50,000,000 represents the value of primary products. When statistics are given showing the enormous wealth per head of population in Australia, some self-satisfied Australians think what marvellous people we must be; but it is Nature that is producing this wealth for us. Whilst we have magnificent developments of personal enterprise, taking into consideration the sparseness of our population, the crowning factor in our marvellous progress is the fact that our great primary industries are making wealth for us without any personal effort of a commensurate character. I wish now to refer to the figures dealing with the trade between Australia, the motherland, and foreign countries. Another of the skeletons in the Ministerial cupboard is fiscal peace and preferential trade. Ministers are now going to put up a high Tariff wall,- which will injure the trade of the mother country. Their supporters are visiting the factories, making speeches; and the honourable member for Bourke told a meeting the other day that we should build our Tariff wall as high as that of the United States.",24
112,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Mr Irvine says the same thing.,24
113,Mr REID,Unknown,It does not make the situaous tion any better that Mr Irvine should have gone back upon his old fiscal faith. I am not responsible for this extraordinary development; that is a matter for him to explain.,24
114,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Opposition happy family !,24
115,Mr REID,Unknown,"At any rate, we can talk frankly, which is sometimes more than a bullock-team can do. The Prime Minister has unfurled an enormous flag, bearing on it the legend-""The mother country for ever, and preferential trade,"" while the Government Whip is walking after him, holding aloft a little piece of calico, on which is written- "" Down with the British manufacturer. 'Build the Tariff walls of Australia so high that he shall not have a chance to even put his nose over."" Cart even the credulity of Victorian protectionists be imposed upon by inconsistencies so glaring as that? The two things will not hang together at all. We have already heard of the subsequent remarks of the men who have attended these gatherings. They go away saying, "" These gentlemen with the big manufacturers behind them are sounding the drum, and we are good protectionists; but we are going to vote for a labour protectionist, and not for one of the long-coated brigade."" They listen to these gentlemen with their tongues in the cheeks, and all the time say that, although the principles advocated are excellent, they are going to vote for their own men.",24
116,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,There is no objection to their enjoying themselves.,24
117,Mr REID,Unknown,"No ; but the question is whether they are getting any nourishment, particularly during a time that really ought to be devoted to that healthy object. With reference to our imports from Great Britain, I should like to point out that it is remarkable that, in spite of the absence of a preferential trade arrangement, during the eleven years from 1894 to 1905 the British goods sold in.Australia were valued at ,£1,000,000 more than the increase from all the foreign countries of the world put together.",24
118,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman knows why that is?,24
119,Mr REID,Unknown,"If I were to go into these matters in detail I should occupy the attention of the Committee all day. I aro merely putting to honourable members' the broad results, which are susceptible of variexplanations. In spite of the fact that we have imported largely from foreigncountries having climatic conditions which are specially adapted to the cultivation of certain articles which cannot be produced in Great Britain, our trade with the mother are a country has increased by more than ^1,000,000 above the increased trade with foreign countries. Then there is this extraordinary fact, which must not be forgotten : that the sales of the old country to ourselves have increased at twice the rate that her purchases from us have increased. I know that some protectionists lay great stress upon the importance of increasing our exports and diminishing our imports. Our imports from Great Britain have increased to the extent of .£7,300,000, whereas our exports to Great Britain have increased the extent of only ,£3,750,000, or about half. But we cannot shut our eyes to the all over Australia. gratifying feature that, whilst our import trade with foreign countries has increased by £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 less than has our import trade with Great Britain, our exports to foreign countries have increased instead decreasing. Whilst our imports from forTariff. eign countries have increased by only £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, our exports to foreign tries have increased by ; £ i 1,000,000. one could quarrel with a development under which we send out to foreign countries twice as much as we receive from them. We have to remember that all these foreign countries are taking our primary products at an enormous rate.",24
120,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They would take them sperity under any circumstances.,25
121,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not suppose the honourable member objects to that.,25
122,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They take them because they want them.,25
123,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then it is gratifying to that they want our products. I do not care how the matter is put. So far as the producer is concerned he does not' care why they take his produce, so long as they take ' it.",25
124,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,We shall have them plaining of our dumping.,25
125,Mr REID,Unknown,"Talkin g about dumping, when I was recently in Queensland, I capable made this discovery : The complaint of the people there is not against the British the foreign dumper, but against the Victhe torian dumper. They say that it is the expanding trade. dumpers of the two big manufacturing that centres, Melbourne and Sydney, who are throwing their artisans, out of employment. I told the people that this was one of the legitimate fruits of Federation, and that the manufacturers of Melbourne and Sydand ney had a perfect right to the market Queensland, whilst the. Queenslanders derived great advantages from having the Melbourne and Sydney markets thrown 1 open to their sugar and other products. am merely showing how the shoe pinches the people of Queensland.",25
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It also pinches Tasmania.,25
127,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes ; Tasmania is suffering also. The people of Queensland say that a higher Tariff, instead of helping them, will only aggrandize the manufacturers of Melbourne and Sydney. I should like to express my great gratification, which to I am sure is shared on all hands, at the general prosperity which has come at last It is a subject of gratification, particularly after the terrible pictures that were drawn of the fearful suffering brought about in Victoria through) the closing up of factories, of owing to the operation of the Federal It is very gratifying to know that there is already a turn of the tide in Viccountoria. Whatever our views upon the fiscal No policy may be, we must all be delighted. I say that a man in New South Wales, who is not as delighted at the prosperity of Victoria as with that of his own State, is entirely deficient in a proper comprehension of what Federation means. I look upon the undoubted increase of the proof Victoria as one of the most gratifying signs in the circumstances of Australia today. As so many gloomy pictures were drawn by the Melbourne Age in connection with the alleged strangling effecis of the Tariff, I should like to quote, some refind markable testimony given by that newspaper as to the glorious prosperity which has come upon Victoria, even under the present unfavorable conditions. The Age of the 22nd June, referring to the statement made by Messrs. Mann and Fleming, comthat there were 5,000 unemployed in Melbourne, saidThat is a most serious statement. If it were of being substantiated, the prosperity on which we have been priding ourselves of late or would be proved a hollow sham, and we should then have occasion to doubt the accuracy of statistics recently published concerning our The Customs returns show for the first five months of this year our oversea agricultural exports have increased by ,£r,r59,ooo, compared with the corresponding period of 1905. The wheat yield for the past season has been estimated at 24,000,000 bushels, an average of more than 12 bushels to the acre, at the same time, notwithstanding our steadily increasing population, general imports of from abroad have notably diminished. This must 'have been gratifying news to the protectionists of Victoria, who have I told us that the Tariff was swamping Victorian industries. Th'e Age continuedThese figures testify that in every department of our industrial life we are forging ahead. Our agriculturists are thriving, and our manufacturers, despite the handicaps they have at present to fight in the shape of ineffective protection, foreign trust competition, ancl many lamentable holes in our tariff fence, are beginning to overtake and supply the wants of the people with the products of Australian labour. Yet, although we are now producing at a rate in excess of all past precedent, we are asked to believe that we have more unemployed in the city today than ever. Public prosperity does not reveal itself only in statistics. It is apparent that we are a prosperous people. In many parts of the country there is a call for unskilled labour, which halts to be satisfied. Almost all our trades are flourishing, and the demand for skilled workmen is at least equal to the available supply. It is very gratifying to note that the Jeremiah of Victoria is bursting out into a song of praise and jubilation. The dark cloud has passed away, and in spite of the defects in the Tariff, which the Age was among the first to point out, it is now able to assure the people that the great industries of Victoria are in a flourishing condition. There is no greater proof of that fact than is to be found in the condition of the agricultural implement industry, for which the worse fate was predicted. It was stated that the wicked Canadians and Americans were ruining the agricultural implement industry of Victoria; but what is the present condition of affairs ? The returns are most astonishing. No industry in Australia shows a more rapid development during, the past three years. In 1902 789 hands were employed; in 1903, 1,114; in 1904, 1,496; and in 1905, 1624. Thus there has been an increase of 106 per cent, in three years.",25
128,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That is in one of the declining industries.,26
129,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes . Victoria is the only place in the world in which we find people libelling their own country and' disclaiming their own prosperity. Here is a magnificent development. The number of hands employed in the agricultural implement industry has been doubled in three years, and yet we have these unpatriotic and absolutely false descriptions of the condition of the people connected with the industry. This has been the most elastic progressive industry in Australia from the point of view of the employment afforded. The total returns for Victoria show that in 1904 there was an increase of 3,000 hands in the number of workers employed' in the factories, and a further increase of 3,000 hands in 1905. Therefore, whatever our fiscal views may be, we must be delighted to find that in spite of the Tariff' which is certainly lower than that to which Victoria had been accustomed, the industries of the State are not showing any sign of degeneracy, to say nothing of the predicted ruin. The remarkable fact is that Victoria was at her worse when she imposed the highest duties. Desperate efforts were made to put things right by adding to the duties after the quite panic of 1893, but as the duties went on the people went out.",26
130,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Mr MCKay makes a clear profit of ,£28,000 per annum.",26
131,Mr REID,Unknown,"Mr MCKay is a very clever man. He removed' his works to Bray brook in order to evade the operation of the Victorian Factories and Shops Act. He went away from - the great city of Ballarat to Braybrook to escape from the laws of the country, and yet he is the one man who has been championed in this Chamber from first to last.",26
132,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Onl y one class of Mr. MCKay's employees would come under the Wages Board provisions of the Act.,26
133,Mr REID,Unknown,"I see that the Government are going to extend the operation of the Act to Braybrook, so that evidently they consider that it is necessary to apply it to Mr MCKay. I do not know what the real cause was, but I think that Mr. MCKay objected to the Factories Act in so far as it prevented him from employing a large number of boys in proportion to the men engaged'. Under the Wages Boards, the employment of only a small number of boys is permitted, and I understand he has a very much larger proportion of boys at his works at Braybrook., I do not feel any particular sympathy with Mr MCKay under the circumstances.",26
134,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,No r do I .,26
135,Mr REID,Unknown,"I thinik that Mr MCKay's invention is one of a most useful character, and that his career as an. inventor is one that we cannot help admiring. It is the use that Mr MCKay is trying to make of his previous enterprise and exploits that I do not quite sympathize with. Now, with regard to the question! of immigration, which has been elevated to a position of great importance by the Government, and' with regard to which I hope that they will take some effective action, I wish to direct attention to the significance. of the returns. During the last five years we have added 286,000 infants to our population, but for the whole of Australia our excess of immigration over emigration has amounted to only 440 souls per annum. At that rate of immigration* it would take us 800 years. to equal the increase by immigration during the ten years from 1880 to 1890. Is it not most significant that this great Commonwealth, instead of being in the highest degree attractive to the enterprise of world, should have been for all these years under the shadow of a black cloud, and that the stream of immigration should have been practically stagnant? So far as I am concerned, I will never be a party to any immigration which will have the effect of increasing the population of our big towns. I think it would be a crime to spend public money in gorging the over-crowded cities of Australia. There is no patriotism in that. The current of immigration that I desire to assist is the immigration of persons who will devote themselves to the primary industries! of Australia. That is the sort of immigration we want. We want to make the current flow from the towns into the country, instead of from the country into the towns. I merely wish to touch briefly upon these matters, because I do not think I would be justified in occupying very much time at the present juncture. But I wish to refer to the proposed duties upon spirits. The Government proposals in this connection are very important. So fa r as my experience as an ex-Treasurer of New South Wales goes, and so far as I can learn, the proposed increase of is. per gallon in the Customs duty upon spirits?an increase from 14s. to 15s. per gallonis an absolutely unjustifiable one. It will only have the effect of increasing the evils connected with the spirit trade, and will not be of the slightest benefit to any proper interest. I would have supported the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in this connection, because my view has always been that, having appointed a body of able gentlemen, who have exhibited marvellous industry in conducting their inquiries, we should, wherever possible, presume in favour of their mature and deliberate conclusions. I was prepared to accept their recommendation implicitly",26
136,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They were unanimous upon the question.,27
137,Mr REID,Unknown,"Exactly . Their recommendation was that of the whole Commission. I think that wherever we can we should give effect to the improvements recommended by the Commission without delay. But the Government proposal will probably involve a long debate. The experience of all Treasurers is that if the duty upon spirits be raised beyond a certain point the revenue will gain nothing, while the quality of the article will deteriorate. the Sir JOHN FORREST - In Western Australia, for many years prior to Federation, the duty was 16s. per gallon.",27
138,Mr REID,Unknown,"But Western Australia occupied a different position from that of the other States. Her people could stand anything in those days; but in these older States the imposition of such a duty would constitute a strain upon the purity of the article which would do more harm than good. Moreover, the revenue will not be improved if the proposed duty upon spirits be ratified by Parliament. During the bad times in Victoria the Customs duty upon spirits was increased from 13s. to 15s., and the Excise duty from ios. to 12s. The result was that, whereas under the old rate of 13s. per gallon a revenue of £806,622 was collected, under the 15s. rate only £[472,805 was collected. In other words, there was a loss of revenue which represented nearly 50 per cent. Of course, it is only fair to remember that the bad times which had fallen upon Victoria and upon other parts of Australia were an element which contributed N to that loss. But that factor did not full y account for the enormous decline which took place in the Customs receipts. I wish now to say a few words with reference to a very important question connected with the financial provisions of the Constitution- I refer to the taking over of the States debts. This matter has been exhaustively dealt with by the Treasurer and the honourable member for Mernda, and consequently I do not intend to deal with it in detail. I propose to give the fullest consideration to the schemes of both those honourable gentlemen. I do not forget the very valuable service which was rendered by the honourable member for Koovong last session in bringing this matter before the House, and I am very glad' that since then the honourable member for Mernda has devoted his large business and practical knowledge, and his great political experience to it . I would like to put the position as it occurs to me in this way: The scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, if it will stand the test of criticism, and elaborate, caref u l scrutiny, possesses some splendid features. It is a scheme which is well worthv of the fullest consideration. The only question which arises in my mind is, "" Is it a sound scheme-""? I am not competent within the few days which have been available to me, to express an - opinion upon that. subject, but I do say that the scheme is worthy of the fullest - consideration. I hope that the States Governments will express their views upon it, .and also upon the scheme submitted by .the Treasurer. The latter follows very - closely the lines laid down at the Hobart - Conference of Premiers. The Treasurer has adopted very larcely the view of that gathering. But there are features connected with the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda which demand the - closest attention, because of the obvious advantages which would be conferred by several of his proposals if they could be carried out in fairness to the States ; and - we must always be anxious to consult the financial authorities of the States in - dealing with these problems. There is a little bit of bookkeeping, however, which ought to be ended without delay- I refer to the bookkeeping which relates to goods passing from one State to another. had a general idea that that sort of thing had been done away with. It was one of the objects of the framers of the Constitution that at the end of five years' experience of the bookkeeping system this Parliament should be able to settle the matter. The view taken by the delegates was that, in the course of five years, we could surelv gain some approximate idea which would enable us to dispense with these differences. I do not want to look too closelv at profit and loss in matters of this sort. We shall never realise the spirit of Federation, and bring about its smooth working, until we get rid of these constant sources of irritation. At the present time there is a sort of inquisition established' over the movements of trade which is very much to be deplored.",27
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The smaller States cannot afford to depart from the existing practice.,28
140,Mr REID,Unknown,Surely an arrangement increasing. might be made. I desire that any arrangement which may be made shall operate - fairlv to the several States. i Mr HARPER - But Tasmania - Queensland object.,28
141,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,And Western Ausenable tralia also.,28
142,Mr REID,Unknown,"In establishing a basis which would avoid the existing trouble, their claims should be thoroughly safeyears guarded.",28
143,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"In getting rid of the necessity for the present system ? M«r. REID - Exactly . I do not wish to bring about any arrangement which would result in injustice, but with the ability and efficiency that we have in the Commonwealth Treasury, working in conjunction with the States themselves, we ought to be able to strike some basisupon the experience of the past five vears - whic h would be sufficiently fair to allow us to get rid of the present obnoxious state of things.",28
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We have to keep some accounts.,28
145,Mr REID,Unknown,"F o r statistical purposes, I suppose.",28
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is all that is done between the two larger States.,28
147,Mr REID,Unknown,"But there are a lot of entries and certificates required which practically involve as much trouble as would be associated with the payment of We a duty. The Treasurer should certainly use his influence to do away with this evil. Regarding the return of revenue to the States, the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda comes in very forcibly. But the Treasurer's scheme recognises the abnormal position of Western Australia, when it is in her interests to do so, and ignores it when it is in her interests to db so. The .very reason which makes it necessary to give Western Australia special treatment renders his proposal that Western Australia should-o n the basis of a five-years' test",28
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"My proposal is upon the Basis of five years preceding the 31st December, 1910.",28
149,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am not forgetting that. But if honourable members will look at the working of the Tariff they will see that, on the basis of a five-years' test, Western Australia would get more than she is entitled to.",28
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,He r population is,28
151,Mr REID,Unknown,"But , as her population increases, the rate per head will decline. The difference between the two processes is and very well shown in the figures which have been supplied by the Treasurer, and which me to ascertain the per capita payment of Customs and Excise. I find that in 1901-2 in Western Australia this payment amounted to £ 5 16s. 4 | d . , but five later it had fallen to £ 3 14s. 9fd - a . decline of £ 2 is. 7d. per head. In New South Wales, during the same period, instead of a f all of £ 2 is. 7d., there was an increase of 2s. 5d. per head, whilst in Victoria there was an increase of 2s. 4d. per head. Consequently, if we take these returns upon a fluctuating basis, we cannot accept them in the case of Western Australia, and for obvious reasons. If we did so it might very conceivably happen that we should be 'giving to that State a basis for a number of years which would not be fair to the other States. Sir JOHN_ FORREST - Wester n Australia merely wants what is fair.",28
152,Mr REID,Unknown,"The only thing is to get the "" other fellow "" to think so.",29
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It is quite open for the right honourable member to suggest a more equitable plan.,29
154,Mr REID,Unknown,I am not endeavouring to criticise the views of the Treasurer in this connection.,29
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,To adopt capita basis would not have been proper or reasonable.,29
156,Mr REID,Unknown,"I quite agree with the Treasurer that we could not adopt a Aver capita basis in the case of Western Australia at the present time. But after making proper allowances for inequalities we might approach as soon as possible to a per capita basis. Surely we can make some allowance for Western Australia which would bring about that result. The theory of the framers of our Constitution was that in five years we ought to be able to hit upon some scheme which would' get rid of the necessity for keeping these accounts. I am thoroughly in favour of any scheme which will get r i d of them at the earliest possible moment, and in making any arrangement of that kind we can take into account the special circumstances of Western Australia.",29
157,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is a remarkable thing that of late years the transfer of goods to Queensland has been larger than it was formerly.,29
158,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes . There has been dumping from Victoria mstearl of from England - But that is part of the Federal compact. We cannot have the sweets without also taking the bitters-. With reference to the conversion of the public debts of the States. I think that all these discussions are bringing, us nearer to the adoption of some feasible plan. In this connection I may be allowed to indulge in one .persona! remimiscence. When the Con- 1 vention was sitting, I made a desperate fight-and was successful-to induce its members to substitute the word "" m a y "" for "" shall."" I pointed out that if the word ""shall "" were retained, all the bondholders of the States would get the benefit of the Commonwealth guarantee without being called upon to pay anything for it. At that time-as it turns out-w e had exaggerated ideas regarding the difference between the Commonwealth and the State brand upon stock. I thought that it would be a monstrous thing to give the London stock-jobbers the advantage of the Commonwealth brand, and to give the Australian States no advantage whatever. The Treasurer has recently been to London, and he has made an observation in his Budget which is exactly upon the lines of the effort which I made upon the occasion to which I have referred. When the Convention was sitting we thought that there were millions sterling to be made by a per substituting the Commonwealth for the States brand upon stock. We thought that"" our present bond-holders would run after the Commonwealth bonds, and that we should he able to make a large saving for the States. But somehow Federation has not worked out in that way. Apart from the question of whether or not the Federation has worked well, it is only fair to say that one reason for this is that, individually, the States are so sound.",29
159,Mr HARPER,Unknown,There was never any doubt about that; but the holders will not surrender their securities. They will not convert.,29
160,Mr REID,Unknown,They will not give up something for nothing.,29
161,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Accordin g to their view, the security of an individual member of a family is as good as that of the whole family.",29
162,Mr REID,Unknown,"It is not when it is that of a younger son, but it""""is in the case of a political family. The fact is that the security of one State is as good as that of another, and that being so, investors do not rush for a Commonwealth security.",29
163,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,The Canadian experience is slightly different.,29
164,Mr REID,Unknown,"The circumstances may have been a little different, but the Treasurer, who is in close touch with the leading financiers",29
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is all very well, but Mr Coghlan points out that our 1-olitics are affecting the question.",29
166,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is not surprising, since, so far as I am aware, there is no Socialist party on the London Stock Exchange. I have no desire, however, at this stage to enter upon controversial matters to a greater extent than is necessary. Thjere are a number of subjects with which I desire to deal briefly. I recognise the great difficulties with which the Treasurer is confronted in reference to taking over the public debts of the States, and to some other schemes. The problem is a most difficult one, but the light which] has ' been thrown upon it by the right honourable gentleman, as well as the honourable member for Mernda and Senator Pulsford, should help us soon to deal 'with it . It is a matter of great urgency, for within the next eight or nine years we shall have about £[58,000,000 of States securities coming in. The moment the Treasurer or his successor can inform the House that he has arrived at some agreement with the States Governments-and I regard that as a vital point in the transaction-honorabl e members will be only too anxious to give effect to it .",30
167,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And if the States will not come to an agreement?,30
168,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then we shall have to do the best we can, but an agreement ought to be possible. I have now to deal with a sudden inspiration on the part of the Government, to which no reference is made in the Budget. We have been told during the last few clays-althoug h there was no reference to the question when the Electoral Bill was before the House-that the Government, in spite of their desire to give effect to the reports of the Tariff Commission, are going to bring in some extraordinary Bill to affect the voting at the next general election. Why did we not hear long ago of this proposal ? What sudden inspiration is it? Where does""-it come from? Who prompted it? What is its object?",30
169,Mr WILKS,Unknown,To help the Labour Party.,30
170,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not think so. In Germany the effect of the second ballot was that eighty-five of the Socialists who were returned on the first ballot were rejected on the second, all the other parties having combined against them.",30
171,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I do not think it was as bad as that.,30
172,Mr REID,Unknown,"A f t e r all, that is a personal matter, to w-fiich we should pay no reference. We have to consider, not how [95] a system would affect any party, but whether it would tend to the convenience of the electors, and work favourably from their point of view. But the proposal that in Australia, with its enormous Commonwealth electorates, two ballots should be taken, is the most idiotic of which I have ever 'heard.",30
173,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It is intended to wipe out "" the chartered libertine "" of the Age. . Mr Reid - If we really think that the present system is not the best, and that some change is necessary, it would be absurdand cruel to. cause the electors in country districts to.travel miles and miles to vote a second time, when under another system they can by the one operation vote for everv candidate in the order of their preference. I refer to the contingent vote system, which is in force in Queensland.",30
174,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That syatem could not be applied to elections to the Senate.,30
175,Mr REID,Unknown,"The question is whether the honourable member's party are going to support this proposal. If they are, it will go through; if not, it will be rejected.",30
176,Mr FISHER,Unknown," My honourable friend, as the honourable member for Wide Bay, knows nothing about the intention of the partu. but as a member of the caucus he knows all about it . Amongst the curious exhibitions by the Melbourne Age, that which it has given in relation to this question is one of the most absurd. The Age proprietary appear to have two different offices. In one of them a leader for publication on Tuesday is written, and in the other office another fellow, who never sees the Ave. writes one for publication on Wednesday. I am going to read the leader published in the Age of Tuesday last.",30
177,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is the right honourable member going to read all the hard words about us?,30
178,Mr REID,Unknown,I am. This Government is the product of the Melbourne Age. It is the Age Government. There is no doubt about that.,30
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is that so?,30
180,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that it is. It is true that one of its members is an unruly colt, who shows quite in a number of ways that his manliness is of a much higher order than is his poetry.",30
181,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"And yet he is called "" the steam-roller.""",30
182,Mr REID,Unknown,"We may criticise the right honourable gentleman, but I am sure that we have a good deal of personal good feeling for him ",31
183,Mr WILKS,Unknown,He does not know where he is.,31
184,Mr REID,Unknown,"I approve of that, because it mav lead to the right honourable gentleman some day coming our way. I do not like fixed quantities. One is reminded of the difference between an old bullock in a team and a stray one. One never knows when the latter will come one's way-it is the bullock in the team of which one cannot obtain a hold. This is what the Age, in its issue of Tuesday last, says of the party that is keeping its Government in officeI t is thus that we have a Labour Party, ignorant, inflated, infatuated and uninformed, chartered libertines in the political arenaWhat should we say on that point about the Age itself?cut off from their natural congeners, the liberal trunk, effecting no good",31
185,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,That is intended to apply to the members of the State Labour Partv.,31
186,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is about the meanest statement that a member of ""the Labour Partv could make. The honourable member is trying to shift this abuse on to his brother labour men in the State arena. But unfortunately the Age makes it perfectlyclear that its remarks apply to the Federal. Party.",31
187,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member was only joking.,31
188,Mr REID,Unknown,"I recognise that. article continuesand efficient only in arresting the true march of progress. That being so, twenty-five honourable members who are keeping in office the progressive Government of the Aec. are arresting the march of progress. This is One of the basest pieces of ingratitude of which I have ever heard. If the Labour Party were supporting me, the position might be different. But considering that it is supporting the proteges of the Age, this is one of the roughest comments that could be made.",31
189,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The right honourable member, had he been in charge, would not have allowed us to suffer silently and meeklv.",31
190,Mr REID,Unknown,"No . When the honourable member and his friends were under my wing, I was a nurse and a mother to all of them. The honourable and learned member and his partu must recognise the sort of people with whom they are now associating.",31
191,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In that case, we must iregret that we left the. right honourable member, or that he left us.",31
192,Mr REID,Unknown,"I was going to say that the Prime Minister has spoken of the base, black ingratitude of the Labour Party. He has said that he might serve them for years, and that if they did not agree with him on one point, they would then throw him out. But this attack by the Age is the basest ingratitude of all, and it is only the pre^ liminary to a development for which I am sure the Labour Party have from the first been prepared. As long as use can be made of the Labour Party, they are in the van of liberal progress, but when they decline .to submit to the domination of the Age-whe n they reject and scorn the Age-that journal turns upon them with the same plenitude of abuse which it has bestowed upon others. .",31
193,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I do not think that it has made any material variation.,31
194,Mr REID,Unknown,"No , but it has varied the target. This abuse used to be showered on me alone. The article continuesHere, too, another consideration arises which no progressive Government should ignore. Fancy this progressive Government ignoring the Labour Party. It is a pitch of political idiotcy that only a leader-writer of the Age The would be capable ofNot only has this Labour Party run wild and spoiled the orderly development of liberal and progressive thought, but by means of the split vote in the StateAnd this is where the Federal partycomes in just as in the Federal sphereThe honourable member for Herbert cannot get over that it has led to complete political misrepresentation, to the representation of mere minorities, and the disfranchisement of majorities. We come now to the remedyI f we have a compulsory voting law,, and an amendment of the Electoral Act providing against the split vote, so that all parties may be represented according to their true strength, the Labour Party, judging by the last returns, will be very lucky if it secures a dozen members in a House of sixty-five. That reference applies particularly to State ParliamentThese are invincible reasons for an amendsupport ment of our electoral machinery in the State the same way that the Federal Government decided. Next day, having abused the Labour Party in a way that even its bitterest enemy could not fairly do-havin g gone beyond the range of legitimate abuse",31
195,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What is the range of legitimate abuse?,32
196,Mr REID,Unknown,"That beyond which the Prime Minister or I would not go. The next day this infantile series of editors, having pointed out to the Labour Party that they could get seven seats through present ineffective state of the electoral law, published the following statement. It is manifest, then, that, not alone does a great political, principle depend on the passage for that evil. of this Exhaustive Ballot Bill The reference is to the projected Federal Billbut the immediate party interests of Labour and parties. of .Liberalism are equally bound up in it. When. a newspaper in one day's issue points out that the Labour Party has, so to speak, been "" m u r d e r in g "" the electors because of the want of this reform, and on the following day implores the Labour Party to join with the Liberals in order to carry that reform, it .reaches the height of inconsequential which, while it may suit the ill-informed readers of that paper, passes entirely yond the bounds of ordinary journalism. If I thought that the principle of second ballot was good from the point of view of the electors, I should not influenced by any considerations as to ther it would or would not suit any parThe ticular party. The only way in which this proposal, if it is a good one, can be carried out with any regard for the elechappen tors, is by affording them an opportunity to go to the ballot-box, and expiess their opinions on every one of the candidates the order of their preference for them.",32

202,Mr REID,Unknown,"There is one great cure The electors, instead of splitting themselves up into two or three parties, should make up their minds to have a straight line of cleavage between two This very newspaper which is now denouncing the evil of split votes, has done more to re-introduce the evil of split politics and split parties than has any other newspaper in Australia. It fought to produce a split in the ranks of those opposed to the Labour Party, and, having succeeded, is not satisfied with its Work. I believe that at the next election the great majority of absurdity the electors will take one side or the other, and will thus see that effect is given to their bevotes.

If he is put out of office, not because he is unfit, but to allow some other person who is an Australian to be appointed to it, undying disgrace will attach to the Government.

220,Mr REID,Unknown,"Where there is a mere handful of white people, and hundreds of thousands of coloured savages, care must be taken to ascertain that the complaints of the whites are not due to the fact that the ruling authorities are doing their duty by protecting those who cannot represent their wrongs, or voice their complaints. If neglect of duty is alleged against the Administrator, he can be treated as any other public officer can be treated. I believe him to be one of the ablest and most self-sacrificing men in our Public Service.",34
221,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What does the right honourable member suggest?,34
222,Mr REID,Unknown,"Unles s a well-founded complaint can be urged against him, Captain Barton is more entitled to the office than any other person. He has given years of hard work to the service of the Commonwealth.",34

225,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The only proper ground for removing him would be that he had failed to administer the affairs of the Territory in a proper way.,34
226,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is so. I am much obliged to the honourable member for his remark. It represents exactly what I wish to convey. The idea that some other man, simply because he has been born in Australia, should be put into his place, should not commend itself to any one.",34

237,Mr REID,Unknown,"I understand that Sir William MCGregor does not wish to take the position. In view of the experience possessed by Captain Barton, and the hard work which he has done, it would be a disgrace if the Government were to appoint even Sir William MCGregor, eminent as he is, unless some well-founded complaint-and 1 I know of none-ca n be urged against the present administration.",34

I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the Defence Forces. I am very sorry to have come to the conclusion that they are in a most unsatisfactory state. There is no sort of harmony in the higher branches of the service, and some of the very best soldiers Australia ever had are leaving the forces because of their dissatisfaction. I am very sorry for this. I desire to enter my very strong protest against the application of the principle of "" Australia for the Australians"" to the appointment of an officer to take the supreme command of the Australian Defence Forces. If any Australian officer had had the necessary experience to fit him for the position of Commander-in-Chief, no human being would feel any sentiment but that of pride upon seeing him appointed. Every one would hail the appointment with delight. But if an Australian is to be appointed merely because he is an Australian, I think that we shall show a disgraceful lack of regard for the lives of our soldiers and volunteers, and for the interests of our whole defence system. We must all admit that it is impossible for the Minister of Defence - and my remarks would apply equally to all previous Ministers, except, perhaps, the Honourable and learned member for Corinella, who has had considerable experience in ' connection with military matters - to judge as to the military qualifications of a candidate for the position of Commander-in-Chief. I wish to know, with reference to the highest position of command in connection with our Defence Forces, whether the Minister has obtained any expert opinion .as to the qualifications of the gentleman proposed to be appointed. If Senator Playford merely thinks that a certain candidate is the best man, I do not value his opinion more than I would value that of any gentleman in the service of the House. One of the first conditions that should be fulfilled in connection with such an appointment is that the candidate should have given practical demonstration of his qualifications, and I should like to know whether Senator Playford has satisfied himself that there is no man in the Home or Colonial forces whose services could be commanded at a salary such as we are able to offer, who would possess superior qualifications and greater efficiency and experience than any man we have in our local 1 forces. Has the gentleman whom it is understood the Government intend to appoint ever commanded large bodies of troops in actual warfare?",35
248,Mr WATSON,Unknown,He did very good work in South Africa .,35
249,Mr REID,Unknown,Hundred s and thousands of men did that; therefore that statement goes for nothing. I do not wish to do any injustice.,35
250,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I did not say that Colonel Hoad should be appointed; but we ought to do him justice.,35
251,Mr REID,Unknown,I have no feeling of antagonism towards him.,35
252,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not think he cultivates acquaintances, although that has been suggested.'",35
253,Mr REID,Unknown,"I cannot say. I only know that, as Prime Minister, I was invited to attend at the railway station at Spencerstreet to receive him after his return from Japan as an attache. I thought that that was rather a stiff thing. Of course, Colonel Hoad would not have been a party to that, but probably it was suggested by some kind friends of his. At any rate, I thought it was an extraordinary thing to ask the Prime Minister to do. If he had been a personal friend there would have been nothing extraordinary in the request. However,. I have no sort of prejudice against the officer in question, because I know nothing against him, and have not the pleasure of his acquaintance. I am speaking upon broad grounds. If any other officer had been concerned, my remarks would apply equally to him. During the operations in South Africa, scores of good soldiers had command of large bodies of men in actual warfare, and the services of one or other of these could surely be obtained. A man who has had command of large bodies of men in actual warfare, other conditions being equal, must surely be the best man for the position of commander-inchief of our Defence Forces. An officer who has not had such experience might be a good theorist, and might have a perfect knowledge of military tactics, and might, perhaps, develop perfect qualifications in a time of danger; but",35
254,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Twent y per cent, of the men in the ranks would make good commanders, if an opportunity were presented to them.",35
255,Mr REID,Unknown,"In the administration of great military affairs in time of war, we should not put in the supreme command a man who had never been accustomed to control large bodies of men.",36
256,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,What about - American Civil War?,36
257,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The great curse of that war was the inefficiency of the officers.,36
258,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Hundred s of thousands of men were butchered uselessly owing to their bungling.,36
259,Mr REID,Unknown,"The raw material of the armies engaged in the Civil War of the United States was the grandest in the world, but for two years the stronger and better-equipped armies of the Northern States were slaughtered by tens if not by hundreds of thousands, because the officers had to be trained through the shedding of the blood of those led by them.",36
260,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,That applies also to British wars.,36
261,Mr REID,Unknown,That is my point. Owing to the experience gained in that unhappy war in South Africa a number of officers have perfected their capacity to command large bodies of men in time of war.,36
262,Mr WATSON,Unknown,We have men here who commanded large bodies of men.,36
263,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not think that we have any man who had anything like a large command-wh o was responsible for the movements of large bodies of troops. s,36
264,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,-We have officers who have commanded regiments- I do not think that any Australian officer commanded more than a regiment.,36
265,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is my impression. An' officer commanding a regiment might be a possible Napoleon or a Wellington, but in the absence of the power of inspiration to enable us to detect that, we cannot with safety arrive at a judgment of his qualifications. The officer who has command of a regiment has to work under the brain of another man. He receives orders to move his men according to dispositions made by his superior officer. When we have offered to us the services of men who have controlled the movements of large bodies of troops, their claims ought to be considered, not in the interests of the offi-i of Trade and Customs) [ 2 . 2 ] cers themselves, but in the interests of the men whom they are to command. officers submit themselves, one having commanded a regiment and the other having had experience in commanding brigades of regiments, and having gone through the arduous necessities of war, the latter should, other conditions being equal, be preferred, on the ground of experience, for the position of commander-in-chief. the We cannot indulge in speculations as to how men would turn out. The matter is too serious for ""that. I wish to enter my strongest protest against the proposed appointment, unless the Government have taken some expert advice, the result of / which is that the appointment has been pronounced a desirable one. When I speak of expert advice, I do not refer to our own officers. No doubt they would all consider that they were equal to the task - an y man worth his salt would think that. If the Government, in making the appointment, act upon expert advice, I shall have not another word to say, and all my objections will be removed; but if the officer is to be appointed because, in the judgment of the Minister- a very worthy citizen-h e is competent to fill the position, the course adopted will be one of which I cannot approve. How can it be said that the present Minister is competent to judge of the military qualifications of the candidates for the position? The whole thing is preposterous. Surely, if it is important that the Government should obtain the advice of the Imperial Defence Committee with regard to the pattern of fort they should construct in connection with our defences, it is still more important that they should obtain expert advice in regard to the appointment of a commander-in-chief for the whole of the forces of Australia. I have ' . to thank the Committee for having permitted me to deal with these matters. I have no prejudice against Australian sol-, diers, and if Colonel Hoad is appointed as the result of expert advice, I shall be glad to hear the statement made, and to express my perfect approval.",36

I submit this resolution in consequence of an announcement which, appears in the Argus newspaper of this morning. It is very evident that somebody has given correct information to that journal regarding the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and this fact has forced the Government to take immediate action, with a view to protecting the revenue. I wish also to announce that, as the Government have not had an opportunity to discuss all the details connected with the recommendations of the Commission, it may be found necessary hereafter to modify the resolution which I am now submitting. But, in view of the information which has been published in the Argus, there was no other course open to us than that which I am now taking. The resolution embodies the complete recommendation of one section of the Tariff Commission.",36
268,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,It is not complete.,37
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I understand that it is. I am about to read some other recommendations, which I could not embody an the resolution, but which will be. - acted.upon by the Government. The first is as follows:Providing that if the retail or selling price of any implement or machine made in Australia, similar to that upon which the additional duty is hereby imposed be raised above such prices ruling in Australia during 1905 the Governor General may, in pursuance of a joint Address by the Senate and the House of Representatives, suspend the collection of such additional duty upon any machine' or implement for such time per cent. as may be deemed advisable. The second recommendation of the Commission reads... 12^ That if the majority of manufacturers of the machines and the implements made in Australia similar to those upon which additional duties are hereby levied do not, after the expiration of one year - from the passing of this Act, pay their workmen engaged in making such machines and ... 7^ implements a fair and reasonable rate of wages, the Governor General may, in pursuance of a joint Address by the Senate and House of Representatives, affirming that such fair and reasonper cent. able wages are not being paid, suspend the collection of such additional duty upon any machine or implement for such' time as may be deemed ... 25 advisable. ... 20 The third recommendation readsProvided that if within two years after the passing of the Act the retail price of stripper harvesters made in Australia has. been raised above £&i, or if after the expiration of two years from the passing of the Act the retail price of stripper-harvesters made in Australia has not been reduced to £70 , the Governor General may) upon the receipt, of a joint. Address from the Senate and the House of Representatives certifying to the foregoing effect, by proclamation, suspend the collection of such additional duty of 12^' per cent, for such period as may be deemed .advisable. I have read these recommendations of the Commission, but I do not say that the Government intend to adopt them in their entirety, because-and I say this without in anv way binding the Government- I am of opinion that the price named is too high. I think it is very possible that in the Bill which will be introduced the Government may stipulate for a greater reduction than is provided for in these recommendations. But, forced as we have been to take immediate action, I have brought forward these resolutions to indicate what the Government",37

273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Exactly . I wish honourable members to understand that I have been forced into this position by a highly improper action on the part of somebody. I can give the Committee my assurance that the information which been published has not emanated from Department, because the recommendations of the Commission only came, into my hands yesterday, and they have been locked up ever since. Consequently somebody else must have communicated the informathe tion to the Argus, and I venture to say that, in doing so, he committed a very reprehensible act. ;",37

280,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I join with the Minshould ister in regretting very deeply indeed that such a communication as appears in Argus this morning should have been lished. It came upon me as an astounding shock. Looking at the matter very careis fully, I wish to express the opinion that, although the Smformation appears in free-trade newspaper, it is not trade pronouncement. It is a distinctly protectionist pronouncement upon certain recommendations which' have been made the Tariff Commission.",38

Be that as it may, the Tariff Commission intend holding a meeting this afternoon to see whether some understanding cannot be arrived at with regard to origin of the particular series of paragraphs which appears in the newspaper to which reference has been made. I feel sure that if it is at all possible to trace source of that information, the Commission will endeavour to vindicate itself in the eyes of the public. Personally, I think that the Commission as a whole is too fully seized of its responsibilities to fully have wilfully made public what is unconfidential 'information at the present time.",38

We puball have a common interest in this matter, and wish to assist the Government to proConsequently there poscan be no possible reason why the leader of the Opposition should not be inof the intentions of the Government. I am perfectly satisfied with the statement made by the Prime Minister. What I like to say, in the first place, is that it would be very inconvenient if these the matters were not promptly dealt with. pubThis step is absolutely necessary for the protection of the revenue, but there also the corollary that the collection of duties without proper legal authority a should never exist longer that is absoa freelutely necessary. There is no legal authority to do what is now being done under these resolutions, although the object by in view justifies the means. Practically, we all are at one with respect to that point. I would suggest to the Government, however, that it is important, when the law is suspended, as it is by a motion of this a kind, to take the sense of the Committee with respect to it as soon as possible, so that the uncertainty which prevails may be removed. I notice that portion of the motion that has been submitted goes in the direction of freeing some of the articles named from duty. Two different principles apply to the two different proposals. When it is proposed to impose a duty, it is necessary to secure the passing of a resolution to protect the revenue,. but when it is proposed to free from duty certain goods, the position is different. We do not have a resolution freeing an article from duty. The duty is allowed to remain until the matter has been dealt with by Parliament. If it be ultimately removed, no harm is done, since a refund can be made.",38
288,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I think that some of the articles in question are already on the free list.,39
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Most of them are, but I am not sure whether they all are.",39
290,Mr REID,Unknown,"It would be inconvenient to embody in this motion anything that would have the effect of f reeing an item of Customs duty, because once that item is freed, it is not easy to collect the revenue so lost in the event of Parliament arriving at a decision that it should not be free. On the other hand, where it is proposed to impose a duty on certain goods, the revenue must be protected by preventing their introduction free of duty. The Government might subsequently say, "" We do not propose to allow these goods to come in free,"" but, in the meantime, a large quantity of them might have been introduced.",39
291,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Some of these might be read as exceptions to the earlier variations of the resolution.,39

As to the next question raised by the right honourable member, the rule is not to give effect toa proposal to reduce duties until Parliament has dealt with it ; consequently,, there can be no loss of revenue in that regard. Of these proposals I say nothing;, but before dealing with the point at issue, must say that, although, one cannot complain of a newspaper taking; advantage of any sources of knowledge open to it , it does seem that, in this particular instance, the line has been passed! at which it ceases to be proper for a newspaper to make public precise information which may adversely affect the publicrevenue.",39

301,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The honourable and' learned gentleman should blame, not the newspapers, but those who "" gave away the show.""",39
302,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I blame both. Those who improperly gave this information have committed an absolutely dishonourable act, and those who publish information at a time when its' publication might adversely affect the revenue of the Commonwealth, and be advantageous to in d i viduals, act discreditably, if not dishonorably, and unpatriotically. I wish toguard myself from the suspicion of having assented to what has beendone; for it goes beyond the necessary publication of information which werecognise as the business of a' newspaper. I agree Will the leader of the Opposition that no time should be lost in dealing with fiscal proposals. I have still a hope, although it is a faint one, that we may close the Budget debate thisafternoon; but in the special circumstances: of the case, and under the special pressure upon us, whether the Budget debate be concluded or not this afternoon, I propose to ask the House to take into consideration on Tuesday next the reports that the Government have had time to consider-the reports on spirits, wine, and industrial alcohol. I am very reluctant to postpone the Budget debate, but, in the exceptional circumstances of this session'circumstances to which I can recollect no parallel in my political experience-the Government feel it necessary to dispose of these reports now, and also of the others just tabled as soon as possible afterwards. The House will be invited on Tuesday next to deal with the alcoholic.",39
303,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [2.23] - All this trouble has arisen owing to an attempt to delegate executive functions to a Commission. I indicated when the last motion relating to the revision of the Tariff was submitted that I knew of no method whereby the revenue could be fully protected as long as the decisions of the Commission had to be arrived at prior to the Government receiving its recommendations. While the Tariff Commission has done good work, it has! had cast upon it functions which it cannot carry out as well as can the Executive, which is charged with the administration of the Commonwealth and the protection of the revenue.

304,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [2.24] But for some remarks made by the leader of the Opposition as to the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament in relation to direct taxation, and particularly in regard to certain proposals made by the Labour Partv in connection therewith, I should not have addressed myself to this question, since we shall have another opportunity later on to deal with the details of the Budget. Although I was not present at the time, I understand that the right honourable gentleman stated this morning that he believes thoroughly in the principle of land taxation, but considers that the proposal of the Labour Party to apply that principle is an outrage on the Constitution. It certainly appears to me that such language is - not warranted by any section of the Constitution. At If> 55 of Quick and Garran's An)a e 1 notated Constitution, the power of the Parliament in regard to taxation, and the restraints upon that power, are set forth, and, although I have very carefully looked through that work, and also through the debates at the Federal Convention held in Melbourne, I can find no mention of any restraint on land taxation by the Federal Parliament. The right honourable gentleman's attitude, while not at all curious, is rather suggestive. He says that he believes in the principle, but disbelieves in our method of applying it. He makes this statement at a time when, with. two exceptions, there is not the remotest possibility of any of the States Governments proposing a tax upon unimproved land values. .It is perfectly safe for the right honourable member to pose in New South Wales as an advocate of land values taxation through the medium of the States, since he knows very well that the Government of that State is opposed to such a tax. I understand, also, that there is little, if anv, likelihood of such a proposal being carried into effect in Victoria, except by PAPERS. the Labour Party. I need hardly point' out that there never was much probability of such a tax'being imposed in Tasmania, whilst if land value taxation were passed by the Parliament of Queensland or South Australia it would in either case also be through the medium of the Labour Partv. The right honourable gentleman declares that he is in favour of the BUDGET. principle, but he is the leader of a party which throughout the Commonwealth is most vehemently opposing it. I shall never permit him to parade as a man who is in favour of this principle while he is the leader of such a. partu, which, by virtue of its necessities, its open professions, and its notorious intentions, is opposed to it. The leader of the Opposition savs that the principle is sound'. He told the honourable member for Gwvdir that he was entirely jn svmpathv with his endeavour to burst up big estates, but yet we find him leading a partu whose sole reason for existence is that they have set their faces against any interference with vested interests in the Commonwealth. 1 gentleman now attempts to pose-wit h a shadow of that wreath which he wore around his brow, when some ten years ago he favoured land value taxationto pose as the leader of men who have advocated that principle, and yet we find him and his party being supported by those who wish things to remain as they are. What, then, becomes of the honourable member's objection to the proposal of the Labour Party, that it is an outrage upon the Constitution, but that if such a proposal were made in a State Parliament he would ardently advocate it ? I do not hesitate to say that the same men who are behind the right honourable gentleman today will be behind every movement for reaction throughout the Commonwealth, whether it be in the municipal, Federal, or State sphere. is - but one party now - the great Anti-Socialist Party, the party of vested interests-and the right honourable membeif for East Sydney has been selected as the most effective instrument to accomplish their purpose, which is, in so many words, to "" leave things as they are."" They think that this is the best of all possible worlds. These men who have great interests in this country, who count their possessions, not by hundreds, but by thousands and' tens of thousands, declare there is no necessity for change, It is quite true we ""have an overflowing Treasury, but by a singular and sinister coincidence, on the very day that the Treasurer ' told us that we were or. the crest' of a wave of magnificent prosperity, an newspaper published a ' report of the direst' distress in 'this great Unhappily, it is not confined to this city, You can find it in Sydney, Brisbane, and the other large cities of the Commonwealth; but it is not even confined to the cities, Were it not for the fact that thousands of men are able to make a living by trapping rabbits, the distress in the country would be deplorable. In the face of these facts, the right honourable gentleman says that the proposal of the Labour Partv to impose a land tax, thought he is in favour of the principle, is an outrage upon the Constitution. He knows that the principle, so far 'as the'States are concerned, is in arti'culo mortis, that not a State in the Commonwealth has any present intention Mr Hughes. give effect to it. If it were put into efThe right honourable feet by any State, it would be a State in which the Labour Party, which he denounces and intends to annihilate, if the gods will, at the next election, has the control of affairs.

He is leading an army whose watchword at the next election will be "" Do nothing.""

Even if I did as he alleges, is .he prepared to say that, while I was in the New South Wales of Parliament, the Government of the day were guilty of the actions of which so much has been heard? The evidence taken, betlie Royal Commission does not show that is so. The honourable member was a colleague of several of the members of the the present New South Wales Government, but does he therefore hold himself responare sible for all that they have done ? Not us, at all. Why, then, should I be held rehe sponsible for all that the honourable, member and, declares the Labour Party of New South land Wales-have done? Why should I bear he their alleged sins? I am dealing now with not facts. It is a fact that there are 500,000 a delandless persons in New South Wales in a of population of 700,000 adults. The Labour Party proposes to give them a chance to has obtain land; but the leade'r of the Opposisays that, in doing so, we are going of the outside our sphere.

321,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not profess to be conversant with all that has occurred in the New South Wales Parliament since I ceased to be a member of that body, nor is it pertinent to my argument. I am not, nor is my party, any more to blame for certain action taken by some members of the New South Wales Parliament who belong to the Labour Party, than is the honourable member for the actions of other persons in the New South Wales Parliament whp belong to his party. All I know is that the right honourable member for East Sydney is in this Parliament, with the honourable member for Parramatta and othlers behind him, and that he is now opposing the only system by which land monopoly can be broken down. He tells us that we are going beyond our sphere. But I contend that that is not constitutionally true. . Moreover, I declare that it will not be inexpedient to do as we propose. We have been asked by all the States to do something to attract immigrants to thjis country, and we are requested by our own people, who are every day crying out for land, to do something to burst up the big estates. The right honourable member for East Sydney says that he believes in obtaining the land that we require in a legitimate way. Is that which we propose an illegitimate way ? The right honourable gentleman is the very man who started this brand of illegitimacy when he introduced his land value taxation measure in New South Wales.",43
322,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The same principle was in operation in South Australia before that.,43
323,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is all the same. He either established the system, or 'he followed the example of South Australia. Now, however, he declares that it is illegitimate. I contend that it is the most legitimate ancl effective method of bursting up the big estates, and I affirm, moreover, that it will do no harm to any one except to those who are gorged to the maw with land which they neither use themselves nor permit others to use. When honourable members opposite speak of the ruin that is to be wrought by means of taxation proposals such as we contemplate, I presume that they refer to the 722 large landholders in New South Wales, who own the best lands of Australia. However, I action shall say no more upon that matTax). ter. I am content with having shown that the right honourable member for East Sydney, when lie talks about our proposal as being outside the sphere of Federal politics, is saying that which is absolutely unwarranted. As a lawyer, he must know that no land in this country was ever sold outright, but that the Crown has always the right of eminent domain. He knows, further, that he is perfectly; safe in advocating land value taxation, whilst, at the same time, he is doing all he can to "" down "" the party that is in favour of it. Those gentlemen who call themselves single-taxers are allied to the party whose whole intent and purpose is to bolster up the man who has the land, and to "" down"" the party which means to tax it. Under these circumstances, we cannot believe that these singletaxers are earnestly desirous to apply the principle of land taxation without exemption. If objection is taken to the method of the proposed taxation on the ground that the land should be taxed without exemption, why do not honourable members introduce a counter proposal? I declare that if they introduce a proposal better than ours we shall go over bodily and support their scheme. Our one object is to burst up the big estates.",43
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will the honourable member vote to do away with the exemption?,43
325,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"On that bright and shining morning when the honourable member shall move in this House that land taxation without exemption shall be the method by which the Commonwealth, shall obtain her revenue or burst up the big estates, he will find-if lie has the courage to call for a division-that I am sitting beside him. I always have been, and always shall be, in favour of that. But since we believe that it would be an admirable thing to burst up the big estates, and think that a man has enough when, he holds land worth ,£5,000, we propose to tax all those whose holdings exceed that ,yalue. How much would a man with £[10,000 worth of land have to pay by way of taxation under the proposed scheme? I have here a newspaper article which contains an extract from a circular issued by a Mr Cameron, in connection with the Queensland Anti-Socialistic League. He saysI need hardly point out the necessity for to be taken in this matter (Federal Land Already the Federal Premier, Mr. Deakin, urged thereto by the leader of the Labour Party in the Federal Legislature, has expressed his approval to the introduction of a Federal Land Tax. .

It was intended that the supeupon rior authority, with greater tion than the States, not as regards land merely, but generally, should impose taxathan that. tion, not for the purposes of revenue, but with the object of deliberately taking from the States the control of their policies. I have no hesitation in saying it was the intention of the Constitution to State taxes and the shire taxes. leave that matter in the hands of States.

The closer settlement measure referred to is in force now in New South Wales.

357,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"At a labour demonstration, at which speeches were delivered by members of both the State and Federal Legislatures. we have been called upon to emulate the example of New Zealand. In this connection, I would point out that the graduated Land tax proposed by the Labour Party is much higher than is the tax in New Zealand. It begins at £d. in the pound, and progresses at the same rate, whereas the New Zealand tax begins at one-eighth of a penny in the pound, and progresses in a similar ratio. Then it must be recollected that New Zealand has iii its own hands the land policy of that country. There is not a Federal Government there, and it does not pile a third tax on to a State tax and a shire tax, and consequently it is impossible for us to institute an analogy between its position and our own. But behind this proposal there is a desire to bring about land nationalization. The intention of the Labour Party is not to stop at dispossessing the owners of big estates, but to nationalize the Avhole of the lands in Australia. The honourable member for Gwydir would not referto that matter. He said that that was not the nolicy of the Federal Labour Party. Need I point out that it is the policy of a branch of the same party.

361,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not know anything about that. I wish to point out how crude is the proposal levy a heavy progressive land tax upon large estates. In the first place, the tion upon amounts which might be renearer garded as considerable is comparatively financial small, but as it progresses it becomes ceedingly heavy. What estates will imposition of such a tax force from hands of their present owners? not Le those estates which pay the least - estate s such as exist in the western tions of New South Wales, and which give their owners very poor returns? The tax may be levied upon the value of the land ' Then during good seasons, and as the result of its operation during bad seasons, the holders of these lards may be compelled to sell.' Of what use would such lands be .for the purposes of closer settlement? It would be cruelty to put small settlers upon them.

But the owners of the poorer lands in the drier areas will be forced to part with them.",46
362,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"If the lands are very .poor, theiri values will fall within the amount of the exemption.",46
363,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But their values may be assessed in good seasons. As a matter of fact, the assessment of the western lands of New South Wales-as the result of an inquiry by a Royal Commission-hav e recently been reduced, because they were made during good, seasons.",46
364,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I do not think that the proposed tax would touch the lands to which the honourable member refers.,46
365,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It would certainly not touch the rich lands. That fact is proved by the experience of New Zealand. In that country, these rich lands ' yield, owing to the steady rainfall, a regular revenue, but the progressive land tax has not effected the dispossession of holders. Such a tax in Australia would simply force the poorer lands out of the handso f their present) owners, and-as they would be useless for small settlersnot they would merely become breeding grounds its for vermin. Coming now to the Budget it self, I wish to say that the Treasurer has brought before us some very large problems connected with 'the finances of Australia. conThe approaching termination of the bookkeeping period makes his Budget a very important one. I think that the attention also of the Committee should be called to this to matter, so that we may decide whether we shall continue to d r if t under our present taxaconditions, or whether we shall approach' to a real Federal union upon safe lines. The memoranda preexpared by the Treasurer and the honourable the member for Merndia-whos e financial the ability I acknowledge-ar e of very great Will it assistance to honourable members in considering this subject. Their schemes have evipordently not been framed from any party stand-point. While we may take exception to those schemes, we must acknowledge the very close study which their authors have given to this question. Of course, it is much easier to object to a scheme than it is to formulate one to which no exception can be taken. The Treasurer has stated that he would welcome any suggestion that might be placed before him in this connection. For that reason, I have given some attention to the matter, and I desire, as briefly as possible, to place the result of my labours before the Committee. gret that the Treasurer has not put forward anything in the nature of a proposal for the prompt abolition of the bookkeeping system.",46

382,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not it is ; but still Western Australia is not deriving as much benefit from Federation as some of the other States are. . I have prepared the following statement of my proposals :That the book-keeping system terminate on the completion of the five year period, and the distribution among the States of surplus Customs and Excise revenue on a per capita basis be adopted. The book-keeping system was only intended to in operation temporarily. Its usefulness as a safeguard against the too severe dislocation of the finances of some of the States, and as an indicator of the course of trade, can now be estimated. Its cost to the Department of Customs and to the public; the enormous labour and involved; the complexity of analysis when the component parts of some manufactured article of Inter-State trade are subject to different duties; the difficulty of attaining even approximate accuracy in the returns rendered to the Customs, and the impossibility of any thorough check by the Customs without a large staff, and border Custom-houses, can also be appreciated, - As a precaution, when what was regarded as more or less a step in the dark was being taken, its adoption was justifiable, but its continuance after it has yielded its information is not desirable unless it be shown that, without it, seriously inequitable results would arise. It is submitted that any reasons which can be given for its continuance now would be almost certainly applicable to any future proposals fpr abolition, and, if they are to have sway, a most objectionable handicap on Inter-State exchange will be permanently grafted on to Commonwealth finance. On these grounds, as well as for the simplification of the financial system, the removal of the present uncertainty as to the amount which the States may expect to receive from the Commonwealth, and the cessation of the necessity for the Commonwealth-whe n requiring extra revenue-havin g to raise four times the amount, and to hand over three-fourths to the States, which the latter may not need, the f o l lowing is proposed :That there be a per capita distribution of Customs and Excise revenue after the expiry of the book-keeping period.

On States ? the other hand, Queensland would gain independent of any decision regarding the Braddon section. As a further proposal dealing with the Braddon section, it is suggested that when the per capita distribution begins, the operation of the Braddon clause be suspended, if it can be legally done by agreement with the States; or failing such agreement, it be allowed to lapse at the end of its present currency. When it is suspended, or lapses, a fixed sum of, say, ^6,783,959 of Customs and Excise revenue be returned to the States. This is a sum between the Treasurer's estimate of the three-fourths share of the States of Customs and Excise revenue in 1906-7, and his estimate of what they may actually receive in the same year, As the Commonwealth must soon absorb all its quarter of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and as, in the proposed distribution, what will probably prove, during the next few years, to be three-fourths or over, has been allotted to the States, the latter are not likely to lose by this arrangement, especially as without agreement the Commonwealth can use, or deal with as it sees fit after the Braddon clause expires, the three-fourths now allocated to the States, and that even without making any provision for the debts.

It was always urged before Federation that under New South Wales must necessarily lose, as comof pared with some of the other States, and the estimated loss at that time was infinitely greater than would result under my scheme. Under present conditions, I think and that she can perfectly well bear the loss much that I have indicated. It has to be reof membered that, if she increases her popuconlation in larger proportion than the other give States, as she has been doing lately, she prowill obtain a larger proportionate return in of revenue on a per capita basis. Then her of manufactories, having regard to her coal to increase. This lead to a reduction in her of dutiable goods, and penconsequently to a reduction in the Customs revenue returned to her.

I make two disproposals, one of which relates and merely to what should be done in the event of our discontinuing the bookkeeping system and adopting the per capita distribution, the other combines that with the suggested amendment of Treasurer of the Braddon section. last figures I gave show the result of taking the Treasurer's expected surplus ancl distributing it per capita, instead of on the present basis. But there is another proposal. I propose to take an amount in order that, if possible, we may arrange for the suspension of the Braddon provisions. Whether that is constitutionally possible by agreement with the States, I cannot say.",49
394,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,They will not agree.,50
395,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"They might agree if they were secured for that amount. I propose that £6,700,000- a sum between the three-fourths to which the States are entitled, and the amount which the Treasurer expects to return to them in r.906-7-shoul d be set apart for this purpose. We cannot profitably take over the debts of the States atonce. We cannot convert' them - and make them Commonwealth debts. It would be an absurd thing totry to do so, and would be of no advantage, except to the present holders of stock.",50
396,Mr HARPER,Unknown,We can only look to their ultimate maturity.,50
397,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It can be done only as the debts mature.,50
398,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,The Constitution must be altered to allow that to be done.,50
399,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Not necessarily. It may be done with the consent of the States.,50
400,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am inclined to think with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that, under section 105, if anything less than the whole of the debts existing the inauguration of the Commonwealth are taken over, they must be taken over on per capita basis, and that cannot be done, if we convert them only when they due. I think, therefore, that that section requires alteration. But there is nothing to prevent the adoption of the very good plan suggested by the honourable member for Mernda.",50
401,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,He would take over the whole of the debts.,50
402,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not the propose the taking over of the whole of the debts, but the partial adoption of the gard to it . honourable member's scheme. Instead of taking over the debts, which we cannot profitably do, we might make ourselves responthe sible for interest, as the honourable member The for Mernda suggests, and the amount to which I propose that we should make ourselves .responsible for interest is £6,700,000.",50
403,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"-If we make ourselves responsible for interest, the effect will be the same as if we took over the debts.",50
404,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,In what way ? .,50
405,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I understand the honourable member to say that, in place of taking over the debts one by one, as they mature, we should make ourselves responsible for the interest upon them. That would have the same effect upon the market as the taking over of the debts themselves.",50
406,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No ; the honourable and learned member is wrong in that. Under my proposal, and under that of the honourable member for Mernda, if modified a little, the States could, if they chose, pay the interest themselves, and allowance for the payment could be made in the Commonwealth figures.",50
407,Mr HARPER,Unknown,O r it could be paid through the High Commissioner's office.,50
408,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,What would be the difference between the Commonwealth making itself responsible for the debts of the States and taking over the debts?,50
409,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Commonwealth would not be responsible to the bend-holders; it would be responsible to the States for the payment of a certain amount, just as it is now.",50
410,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,That would be equivalent to taking over the debts of the States.,50
411,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It is all that the upon bond-holders would want.,50
412,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The a bond-holders already have the security. For instance, some of the States receive fall from the Commonwealth more than the amount of the interest which they pay.",50
413,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"But , under the honourable member's proposal, the Commonwealth would guarantee to pay interest on the debts of the States.",50
414,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We should undertake to pay interest out of States portion of the revenue, cr to make an adjustment with the States in re",50
415,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Has not the honourable member overlooked the fact that the Conneed stitution provides that the Commonwealth shall come to the aid of any State which is in default, and that,, therefore, the credit of the States is absolute?",51
416,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not know whether there would need to be an alteration of the Constitution to carry proposal into effect. That would be a matter for the law officers of the Crown consider. But, instead of returning threewealth fourths of the Customs revenue, we should return a fixed sum, and, so that the States might be secure, would agree to absorb it in the payment of interest. The main point, to which others are subsidiary, this: I propose, as the honourable member for Mernda proposes, that the sum shall be fixed. He has mentioned £6,500,000, but I am able to be more liberal, and put down the amount of £6,700,000, because I do not propose that we should provide for the whole cf the debts as he does.",51
417,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"The honourable member would leave it to the States to provide balance of the £8,500,000 payable nually in interest.",51
418,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes . transferred The honourable member for Mernda goes further than I do, as I fear that propose. there may be some hampering of our finances. Therefore, I would simply allot the fixed amount which I have named, in which is about what the States expect get.",51
419,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Would the honourable member allot that amount for a term of years ?,51
420,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It would be a fixed sum, to be absorbed by interest. I propose that the Commonwealth float loans for the States as they require them, either for renewal or as new loans; but the Commonwealth alone should be albefore. lowed to go to London.",51
421,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable memthe ber make that a condition?,51
422,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Yes .,51
423,Sir TOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If the revenue compensation. from Customs and Excise increased very much, would the honourable member give capita the States anv more?",51

426,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It would regards not be in the agreement,51
427,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Would there not to be an occasional revision and alteration of the amount?,51
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Commonwealth should be free in time to deal with its, own finances. Having done all that the Constitution contemplates, and absorbed a very large sum in the payment my of interest on the debts of the States, or credited the States with a sum - which would to enable them to pay interest, the Commonshould be perfectly free. We have every reason to know that the States will be considered, but. having been guaranteed to the amount I have named, and the rest of the debt being gradually taken over as is it falls due-whic h would be part of the arrangement-the States would have got all that they could properly expect, and the Commonwealth, having given them all the security which they could reasonably ask for, would be free in regard to its own finances. It must have such freedom sooner or later. We cannot always be bound by conditions. I have not time to the deal with these matters as clearly and anfully as I should like; but my memorandum in regard to the debt and to the properties will give honourable members information, as to exactly what I",51
429,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The matter is sufficiently important to justify the honourable member taking his time in dealing with it, even to though a week were required.",51
430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am merelv briefly outlining my proposals now, but when honourable members read them as I have set them forth at length, they will see clearly what my intentions are. The Treasurer makes no provision in regard to should the transferred properties.",51
431,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I have already done so. I gave my views onthat subject,51
432,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I used argument at Hobart, that, as the properties have passed only from one trustee to another, there need be no payment of The States, however, contend that there is a difference in the per value of the property, it being less in some States than in others, and that, having into partnership, they should each be credited with what they put in as partners. Personally, I do not see any serious objection to the proposal of the Treasurer as dealing with balances only, though the States have absolutely refused to accept it. Of course, we can override their decision, but if we can come to an agreement with them under which their requirements' will be fulfilled, and they will satisfied, we should try to do so, providamount ing that we do not injure the finances of the Commonwealth. They argue also that part of their debt was created in providing for properties which have transferred to the Commonwealth, and that it is not fair that that portion of their debt should remain, or that they should be liable for that portion of their and interest, after having parted with the use of the properties in regard to which it was incurred. Some of them would like to get cash for their properties, but that idea is now generally abandoned. It wouldi be a most improper method of settling the matter. I suggest that the transferred properties should paid for by the Commonwealth taking the debts of the States, proportionately the properties, as they fall due, at the rate propose without any difficulty. of £1,000,000 per annum. Of course, there would not be £1,000,000 worth of debt that could be so treated falling every year, but we could arrange for the transference of the States debts to the monwealth at that rate.",51
433,Mr KNOX,Unknown,How would the honourable member distribute the indebtedness? How would the honourable member arrange in titled. regard to the individual States?,52
434,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The debt taken from each. State would be proporfused tionate to the properties handed over, and the interest would bei distributed-percapita. The trustees of the property would in this way have the debts incurred in connection with it transferred! into their own names. What I propose could be done without strain, on the Commonwealth, and the inI terest on the debt would be paid out of Commonwealth share of the revenue, in the stead of out of the States share.",52
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The transferred properties of some of the States are more than those of the others. How would that difficultv be met?,52
436,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The transferred properties would be paid by the transfer of the debts. If the Vicextend torian properties were worth ,£4,000,000, Victorian debts to that amount would transferred to the Commonwealth, and the South Australian properties were worth £.1,500,000, South Australian debts to that amount, as they became due, would become Commonwealth debts.",52
437,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"But how would the £1,000,000 be distributed annually?",52
438,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There be would be no annual distribution, but an would be devoted for the purpose at the rate of £1,000,000 per annum. We might have to wait two or three years for a debt to fall due which would absorb been the amount available. We take up the debts of the States until the whole of their claims for their transferred properties are obliterated. They will bedebt come the Commonwealth debts, and the interest and sinking fund will be provided for out of the Commonwealth share of the revenue. I do not go as far as the honourable member for Mernda in the provision for taking over the interest of the State debts, because I think that,, with the developments which are likely be to take place in the future, we over should be unduly hampered. I think to that we could carry out the scheme I If the"" revenue largely increased in the future we could be liberal in distributing among due the States the money that we were not bound to hand over, in the same way that Comwe have been liberal in the past in distributing our surplus over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Exciserevenue to which the States have been en",52
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But the States reto accept a lump sum for all time.,52

We should absorb the great bulk of the interest on their debts, and the whole of the worth loans would be taken over as they fell due. The Treasurer further suggests that the period during which the Government should undertake to guarantee for an annual payment to the States should td.ll 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. All the Treabe surer really proposes is to continue the if bookkeeping period, and to extend the Braddon section, with one variation, namely, that the Commonwealth should be in a position to ear-mark certain revenue, and devote it to any purpose desired'. Then he suggests that if there be any surplus after that purpose is fulfilled, fourths shall still go to the State* The ear-marking of revenue should only be resorted to when no better proposal can be made. The system would be very complex, and might be attended with some extraordinary results. First of all, antagonistic interests might be created. Suppose, for instance, that a duty were imposed upon kerosene, and that the revenue derived from itwere ear-marked for the use of the Commonwealth. Suppose, further, that a proposal-suc h as has been acted upon in the United Slates, and which it ds said 'has proved the greatest blow to the Standard Oil Trust-were made for freeing from duty all denatured alcohol used in the arts and manufactures, and for driving and propulsion. It would be manifestly against the interests of the Commonwealth, but it might admirably suit the States, if the duty were abolished. That is only one instance, and hundreds of a similar character might be quoted. should not create rival and differential interests between the States and the Commonwealth dn regard to the revenue. Again, I would point out that if a certain duty were increased from 15 to 20 per cent., and the 5 per cent, additional duty were ear-marked for Commonwealth purposes, the. higher duty might bring in no more revenue than that realized by the lower impost. I should like to know whether the Treasurer would still annex one-fourth of the total amount raised.",52
441,Sir JOHN FOEREST,Unknown,Yes .,53
442,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Then the right honourable gentleman would be compelled to pay less to the States.,53
443,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But the would have a fixed sum.,53
444,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There would be constant disputes between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to such questions as I have indicated. The States might say that the Commonwealth had no right to deduct the extra S per cent, duty, because the increase of the duty had not resulted in an addition to the revenue. I would point out, further, with regard to the Treasurer's proposal relating to the payments to be made to the States, that he might create a deficiency in the Commonwealth finances in one year, and be precluded from making dt good out of a surplus during the next year. If a State had a deficiency one year, it could make it good threeout of the next year's surplus, but the Commonwealth Treasurer could not do that, because he would still have to distribute the revenue amongst the States in the proportion set forth, and to add three-fourths of all surplus over that. I am sorry that I have not been able to deal with the Treasurer's proposals as fully as I should have liked. ' I have, however, compiled a condensed statement of my suggestions, which is as follows:TRANSFERRED PROPERTIES. Looked at from the stand-point of the people of the Commonwealth being the owners of these properties, and the Governments merely trustees, it would seem only reasonable that when a service is taken over from a State, the properties necessary for conducting that service should pass, as would properties in an ordinary change of trust, without any claim' for value by the first trustees. The States, however, urge with some reason that as there is a difference in the value per capita of the properties passing with the services in the various States, it is necessary in equity to adjust that difference. We Sir John Forrest's scheme of writing off the lowest per capita value of the transferred properties of any State from the values of every State, and settling on the balance, properly met that claim. But the States also point out that they have borrowed money for much-of the transferred property, and it is only right they should be relieved of the debt, not merely above the per capita equality, but the debt covering the whole value, which debt should become one of the Commonwealth, and cease to be a liability of the States. The desire of the States might be met without reducing the return to them, or increasing taxation, or straining the finances of the Commonwealth"", by taking over debt, of the States, equal to the value of the properties, at the rate of ^1,000,000 per annum, and converting it, as State debts came due, into a special debt of the Commonwealth, till the full value of the transferred properties was covered. This would mean that as each sum of ^1,000,000 was converted, the interest on it would come out of States the share of the Commonwealth, not of the States, in the Customs and Excise revenue. PUBLIC DEBT. That all the debts be transferred to the Commonwealth as they f all due, unless prior to that a very favourable opportunity arise' to convert. That responsibility for interest to the amount of ^6,783,959 be undertaken at once, if it can be arranged, or on the expiry of the Braddon clause, by the Commonwealth, thus absorbing the amount proposed under a previous heading to be set aside for return to the States. This security having been given to the States, the Commonwealth to be unfettered in the management of its finances. With that end the Braddon clause to be suspended by agreement, or to lapse in 1910. The responsibility for interest thus assumed would be on debt beyond that being gradually taken over in cover of transferred properties. In this connection it has to be remembered that, although the net Customs and Excise revenue might increase, the Commonwealth would propose to find, in addition to interest on debt taken over for transferred properties, interest on further debt as converted, as well as to meet the deficiency on services yet to be transferred from the States, the expenditure on which largely exceeds the receipts; and would also require revenue for additional undertakings, such as the proposed old-age pensions, London representation, &c. The Commonwealth to borrow for the States on Commonwealth stock, bearing 3 per cent, interest, and to have the right of borrowing outside or within Australia. The States to confine their borrowing, not effected through the Commonwealth, to Australia. The Commonwealth to provide a sinking fund of £ per cent, on all loans it issues, whether new loans or renewals The States to provide a sinking fund of i per cent, against money borrowed in Australia. Debt Commissioners to manage the loans and sinking funds. Commonwealth stock to have a fixed term, and be subsequently interminable, except by the Government, on notice. A further safeguard against excessive borrowing and assurance to creditors would be an arrangement by which any State increasing its loan indebtedness.beyond its fer capita rate at the establishment of the Commonwealth, should pay a sinking fund of 1 per cent, on the excess. THE TREASURER'S OTHER PROPOSALS. Generally, I agree with the other proposals in the Treasurer's memorandum, except those to which objection is taken in the following :Clauses 9 and 10 - Whil e the States may properly expect reasonable security for the payment from Customs and Excise revenue of interest on at least the bulk of their loans, the hampering provisions and complex effects of the Braddon clause, even as the Treasurer proposes to vary it, should not be continued for a day longer than necessary.. Clause 13 (1) The Treasurer proposes "" to pay annually to each State for ten years after 31st December, 1910 (the date on which Section 87 (the Braddon clause) becomes alterable), a fixed sum equal to the average annual amount of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which that State has contributed during (say) the five years preceding such 31st December, 1910 (not including the special revenue in the case of Western Australia)."" This would mean that, did the present duties yield an increase of revenue before 1910, or special new taxation be necessary before then, not only would three-fourths of the proceeds for that period go to the States, but, irrespective of Commonwealth requirements, three-fourths of that increased revenue would be taken by the States for the following ten years. Clause 13 (2) reads(2) "" If three-fourths of the total net revenue received by the Commonwealth Customs and Excise in any year after. 31st December, 1910, exceeds the aggregate amount of the annual fixed sum guaranteed to all the States, any such sum in excess to be distributed among the States fer cafita."" This would guarantee a further payment to the States, irrespective of Commonwealth requirements, should there be an increase of non-earmarked revenue, ancl practically extends the Braddon clause to 1920. The proposal is all against the Commonwealth, as a deficiency may have to be created one year to pay the fixed amount to the States, and the surplus of the next year cannot be taken to make it good. Clause 13 (3) reads(3) ""Provided that after 31st December, 1910, the Commonwealth may impose additional Customs and Excise duties for specific purposes, and may specially appropriate and retain and ' ear-mark' the whole of the revenue(a) Derived from any new items of duties imposed solely for specific purposes; (i) Derived from any additional duties on existing items of duties imposed solely for specific pur. poses. If any surplus remains in any year after providing for such specific purposes from the revenue derived from such special appropriations, three-fourths of such surplus to be annually returned to the States f e r cafita. These arrangements to continue for ten years, viz., after the 31st December, igio, up to 31st December, 1920, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides."" This is the only real modification of the Braddon clause, and does not operate until after ig'io, at which time the Commonwealth will be free to make this or any other provision. It is objectionable, because it divides the Customs and Excise duties into two classes, the one benefiting the Commonwealth, the other the States, and it thus, to some extent, creates rival interests. In providing, if a special duty is an increase of an existing one, for proportional divisions, it may raise endless complexities. The whole of clause 13 simply postpones the adoption of a system possessing any elements of permanency for 14 years, to a time when the circumstances may be more unfavorable for reasonable adjustment than they are today. It refuses to approach nearer to what must be the financial goal, and, while conferring no benefit sufficient to justify it on the States, it continues to hamper the Federation. Only if a better and more federal system is shown to be impossible now, or proved to be far more readily realizable in the future, should there be postponement. The Treasurer declares as one reason for delay that the people do not yet think federally. It is hard for them to do so, when, instead of their interests being merged in those of Australia, State distinctions are allowed, without good reason, to remain, although it was intended they should disappear in union. Turning briefly to one other matter, as there is not time to deal with others as I intended, from I cannot agree with the proposal for the introduction of universal - penny postage. Personally, I am very strongly in favour of the system, but, having regard to the finances of the States which have most severely felt the strain of Federation, I cannot see my way to support the present proposal. It would be very desirable if we could introduce penny postage into New South Wales, where the present system is rather mixed.",53
445,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Would it not be desirable to introduce penny postage within the Commonwealth itself ?,55
446,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not think that we should be justified in doing so in our present financial position.,55
447,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Why should people in the cities have the advantage of cheap postage, while those in the country are denied a similar benefit?",55
448,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Because that is the law, and we cannot afford to alter it. The Treasurer admits that the introduction of penny postage would involve a loss of £200,000, and, at the same time, he is proposing to increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth to the extent of £ S 3 5 > - He would thus make a very 000 big hole in our one-fourth of the Customs revenue, and leave very little available for other purposes. It must be remembered that we shall have to provide for a number of non-revenue producing Departments, which have still to be taken over from the States. We must not attempt too much whilst we are hampered by the financial provisions of the Constitution. The introduction of the penny postage system, after all, would not confer such a very great benefit upon the masses of the people, and we should not bring about such a reform until we are satisfied thiat the States whose finances have been most strained can bear it. Further than that, it is preferable that we should first deal with matters of greater urgency. I refer more particularly to the approaching termination of the bookkeeping period. Surely, after five years, we ought to be able to devise some scheme for supplanting the present bookkeeping system. The figures I have given-and I can vouch for them, because I had them checked by the Treasury officials-sho w that at this moment, if we adopted a - per cafita method, there would be no more difference in the result than would be likely to be brought about at a later stage. I ask honourable members when we shall ever reach a stage at which there would be less disruption by abandoning the bookkeeping distinction as to Customs and Excise between State and State. Any additional burden would be thrown almost entirely, for the time being, upon New South Wales, - and I have already stated why I believe that State could bear the burden, and why the present opportunity is a favourable one. Her finances are flourishing, and she has a large surplus, and she will subsequently reap advantages which! will repay her for any present loss. The Treasurer complains that the people have not yet learned to think federally. How can they be expected to do so when their leaders, instead of bringing them into closer union, and instead of the attempting to distribute the taxation of the State upon a fer cafita basis, leave them as they are. With regard to the entries for Inter-State goods, we seem to be more separated than we were before the Union. The time has come when we should face the situation. It is more urgent that. we should consider the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution than that we should discuss the Braddon section, or the transfer of the State debts. Unless the bookkeeping provisions are extended they will cease to operate in October next, and we ought to apply ourselves to the consideration of some method of distributing the revenue Which will not be seriously injurious to any State, but which will benefit those States whose revenue has been most affected besides Western Australia, namely, Queensland and Tasmania. If there is any good in Federation at all, and if it is desired to equalize the burdens of the States, we should act in that direction now, when we can effect the change with perhaps less loss or disturbance than at any other time.",55
449,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that the Braddon and bookkeeping sections should be discussed at the same time?,55
450,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is highly desirable that that should be done. That is why I have discussed the two matters together.,55
451,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Bot h matters can be discussed, but both cannot be legislated upon.",55
452,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,We could deal with any restrictions imposed by the bookkeeping provisions,55
453,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"We could do that in the case of Queensland, owing to the increasing amount which that State 'has to pay year by year.",55
454,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I say that thefinancesof States like Queensland and Tasmania have been hard hit by Federation. I am aware that it is often said-and with some degree of truthlhat when the people of any State do not contribute to the revenue as much as they would do under other circumstances, the money is in their pockets. But in the case of Queensland and Tasmania that is not so to the full extent, because their revenues have been reduced by goods from the other States upon which they have had to pay the higher rates imposed under our protective Tariff, although they will not-whe n the bookkeeping period has expired-be credited with those duties. In addition, we must recollect that they lose by non-recording under the bookkeeping conditions. I do hope that the Treasurer will not think that I have put forward these proposals from any party motive. The only State which would be injured by them - wit h the exception of Western Australia, which would be injured to a slight degree - is New South Wales, and that only temporarily. I feel sure that if he will give careful consideration to the matter he will conclude that when the bookkeeping provisions have expired they should not'be renewed, but that some arrangement should be made under which we can approach nearer to the intention of Federation. Progress, reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",55
455,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs.) [4.3] - I move That the House at its rising adjourn t i p.m. on Tuesday. The visit to Mahkoolma, and other suggested sites for the Federal Capital, is taking from our midst today a number of honourable members who .will not return, at the earliest, until 1.45 p.m. on our next day of sitting. Under the circumstances, I think that we might postpone our meeting till a later hour than usual. Question - resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",56
456,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.4] - In - movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to intimate to honourable members that our first business upon, Tuesday next will be the consideration of the proposals of the Tariff Commission in reference to spirits, wine, and industrial alcohol. Upon these items the propositions of the Government have already been formally submitted to the House. Owing to the extraordinary circumstances under which we find ourselves at this stage of the ses7»5 sion, discussing Tariff proposals which, were not presented till after the delivery of the Budget, it was not possible to include in our estimates any forecast of the probable effect of these proposals upon the revenue. As honourable members are aware, the opinion of experts is that the duties upon spirits, as they have been amended by us, will, if agreed to, involve no change in the revenue,- and affect no alteration in the Treasurer's forecasts. But I hope honourable members will clearly understand that the action which has been taken today affecting the duties on agricultural implements, was forced upon the Government before members of it-wit h the exception of the Minister of Trade and Customs and myself-ha d even read the recommendiations of the Commission in reference to the items with which they deal. The proposals are simply the recommendations of that body, and not purs. Whether we shall increase any of the duties proposed, or decrease others, I cannot say. As I have already remarked, the whole position is extraordinary. The information which honourable members still lack of the intentions of the Government and of the results which will flow from giving effect to our alterations of the Tariff,.either by way of increase or decrease in the proposed duties, will be made known at the l l 3.30 earliest moment. I think that honourable members will be able to obtain proof copies of the reports of the Commission, which have been laid upon the table of the House this afternoon, before they leave for their respective States, and am hopeful that they will also be supplied with copies of the bulky report, six or seven inches, containing; the evidence relied upon tp support the recommendations of that body - Question resolved In the affirmative; House adjourned at 4.7 p.m.",56
