Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (11:53): I rise member's bill, the National Electricity Bill 2012. the huge increases in electricity prices seen bill from the member for Lyne does nothing to real underlying issues that have caused electricity significantly in 2007 as a result of rising investment in infrastructure such as poles and other government policies-most notably the carbon tax. First and foremost, the member for Lyne carbon tax. So I do question his genuine commitment for Australians. The carbon tax is expressly to hurt the hip pocket of Australians. We know carbon tax are already having a significant company revealed that 65,000 customers a month electricity and gas bills. In addition, there is costs for our manufacturing sector, which only Australia's carbon tax does nothing to help difference in Australia, we have to buy almost from overseas at an annual cost to Australia each year, rising to $57 billion per year by to reduce power bills by $250 a year and to Prime Minister noted that there had been significant failed to point out that all of this occurred been noticeably silent on the situation in Queensland. years to 2012 capital expenditure on poles resulting in an increased debt of more than repayments are passed on to consumers.

In the EnergyAustralia price increases of between five per cent and six to have reforms to bring down prices, and we territories. Not having that cooperation would states have their own energy laws, which I deal with in the legislation that has been put this issue as I would have liked, but certainly of agreed market reforms. We do not want layer to the mix. We have seen new rules for the that new ways of reducing these prices can be to speak on the member for Lyne's private Australians want to see real action to reverse across our nation since 2007. Unfortunately, this address those concerns, and fails to address the prices to rise. Prices began to rise charges for our energy networks, including overwires, increases in wholesale energy costs, and voted to pass the world's only economy-wide towards lowering the cost of electricity designed to make electricity more expensive, and that higher electricity prices as a result of the impact on Australians. In March a major energy are seeking extensions to pay their rising the 14.5 per cent average increase in electricity adds to the pressure on jobs. Worse than that, the environment. Instead of making any real 100,000,000 tonnes of emissions reduction by 2020 of approximately $3.7 billion per year, 2050.

It is to be talking about infrastructure in this place, the Howard government during its 11½ years in is being invested by this federal Labor alone. That more than doubles the annual under the Howard government. Under the Victorian was being spent on transport spent on the state's transport infrastructure. not committed to the infrastructure and the that respect, there are a number of infrastructure Victoria in relation to transport which I will go agree with this motion, we absolutely agree with Melbourne is a very significant issue and is To the extent that this motion highlights around Melbourne, it is an important motion critical process that we need to go through and the that traffic congestion. All the goodwill in the not get the decisions around traffic congestion Link has flawed thinking associated with it. where we are able to wave a magic wand and is no question about that. But the problem is a kind of Harry Potter version of going about would be a magic wand that you could just wave come down to Geelong about a month ago. His to just convince Ford to export their Territory could wave a magic wand and get Detroit to do am not sure that Tony Abbott has ever done any production line in Corio to produce a left-hand to see. In any event, what we have seen from the is this waving of the magic wand. The reality of what the state government is doing are very adverse to the people of the Greater Geelong in terms of our access to the Melbourne CBD. The first issue is this: it completely ignores building our transport infrastructure, in terms system within Melbourne. That is why we do not have a modern train system within state government proposal of funding a rail ever see it, but nothing like that happens without the prioritising of the East West Link, there rail. We have committed to Melbourne Metro in which is a $3.2 billion project, we have Victoria's major regional centres including dedicated rail line which will see people Bendigo-get access to Southern Cross Station congestion which is on the metro rail line at important. The second issue, which is why the East see a proper process undertaken whereby Infrastructure in which it is built. In other words, do you start terms of the Harry Potter-style public policy vague sense from the Victorian government really like you to build the East West Link do that,' without them ever going through Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you know this today and commute from Geelong to Melbourne, longer than it was five years ago. The congestion interchange is enormous. As somebody who has years, prior to entering this place, I know minutes longer than it was five years ago. That rocket science to reach that conclusion.

I will not be supporting the motion, had a discussion about the issue. any given morning during the working week you see is cars backed up bumper to bumper, and you Parade or going down Hoddle Street. The is a great swathe of green land down the That land was reserved over 30 years ago for a hands on a copy of the 1980 Melway, you will meant to be for a rail line out to Doncaster. state Labor and Liberal governments have the people who live in the eastern suburbs public transport option to get to work. And as in my electorate on Hoddle Street, on If we are serious about fixing congestion in rail line out to Doncaster, and the second step the Melbourne Metro rail project. What common study that has been conducted shows-is that the east don't want to go west; as good as the They are wanting to come into the city-to what do they do? They come down Hoddle Street runs through other parts of our electorate. This somehow a massive, unmet, east-west demand furphy. People are wanting to come into the tollway-which was first floated by the state the federal opposition-will do is increase congestion turn the electorate of Melbourne into a rat's relieve congestion and allow people to spend home. One of the best ways that we could free up to get around is to get people out of the cars Eastern Freeway and then into a Metro train. the very real prospect that one of the things about to be wrecked. I know that for many elsewhere, the inner suburbs of Melbourne are somewhere else. But for us, it is where we live. to see effective public transport in Greater of building more roads is just building more proposal that has come into Melbourne that congestion. Building more roads to cure congestion All it will do is extend the The people of Melbourne and those public proposal for years. We first heard it floated such stiff opposition it adopted some kind of election. Now we are seeing it coming committing to Melbourne Metro rail. I think it pushed for for some time-it is $3 billion, worried about is this: if the polls are right come September, there is a very real risk that number one priority identified by Infrastructure even make the list at all because there is not And so earlier today I introduced into the House proof the inner-city suburbs of Melbourne and first-before we fund East West. And I hope to build Melbourne Metro rail, also gets behind find out Labor's true position on the East West Link.",253
64,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The question is: That the amendment be agreed to. Melbourne, the first step should be to build that should then be to supplement that by building sense and reason tell us-but also as every most of those people who are coming in from west is, that is not where they are wanting to go. go work, to study or for other reasons. And so or Alexandra Parade, or they take the rat idea of the East West Link, and that there is from the cars that are coming in is just a city. All that the proposal for an east-west Labor government, and now it has got legs from in the inner city of Melbourne. It will nest of on and off ramps. It will do nothing to more time with their families or more time at space on our roads for light commercial freight and into trains; into a train coming down the But because of that lack of vision we now have that makes Melbourne such a great place to live is of the people sitting here in this chamber or just a place that you go through on your way People are sick of the congestion.

Then when it faced middle position in the lead-up to the last state up again. I congratulate the government for is a very good initiative and one that has been and a very worthy investment.

I am very worried that we are yet to",254
65,Mr BILSON,BILLS," Thank you, the original motion about an important project to the amendment as well. It is bewildering many years-but it seems that whenever it comes always late to the party. We in this place coalition members had to get the Scoresby betrayal of Labor when they promised before the Scoresby Freeway but the freeway became commitment they used to try to show the electors they finally got the issue in relation to a electorate shortly after. We have seen it again down my way. I have Peninsula Link, the Frankston bypass, constructed. 'There's no need for this. There's no case for one that was instigated by the Howard-Costello Dunkley electorate, stood at one of the most Australia in October 2007 and made a $150 million free Frankston bypass. That built the momentum Running around saying it was completely community. Yet we know in the Dunkley electorate that is for enterprise opportunities, for access and for the quality of the experience that peninsula. It is a wonderful asset and a wonderful party. Here we see it again when it comes to this critically for the east and south-eastern suburbs only think that what needs to be moved around Moving people is an important task, but moving important. You never hear that being spoken The RACV has made it clear that it is a clear it is a No. 1 priority. There was chaos Bolte Bridge brought much of the city to a standstill. the very project that would have given their relief and their businesses the capacity to evidence was enormous in people's eyes there. You hear some people say that it is all about city functions. You cannot get a tradesperson to a job. You cannot get a manufacturer from and high-value products to the market on a train. will provide enormous relief in terms of congestion move a container on a passenger train. You actually and a balanced approach to your infrastructure planning. This motion talks about that but the amendment that east-west project off the ground. Is it merely Deputy Speaker. I was pleased to support for the great city of Melbourne, and I will talk to me-and I have been in this parliament for to major infrastructure projects, Labor is would remember the extraordinary battle that Freeway off the ground. We remember the a state election that there would be no tolls on a fee-way under Labor. They abandoned the of the east and south-east of Melbourne that toll-free Scoresby Freeway only to betray that had to work year after year to try to get the Labor ministers like Peter Batchelor said: it.' Have a look at the success of that projectgovernment. Peter Costello came down to the congested intersections on the continent of commitment to the construction of a tollof that project. Again, where was Labor? unnecessary and would not add anything to the and in the region what a vital carriageway to education, for people to access a livelihood many visitors to the region can have on the commitment. Again Labor was late to the east-west project. This is an important project of Melbourne. Those against it seemingly the great metropolis of Melbourne is people. freight, businesses and enterprise is equally about by those who criticise the east-west link. No. 1 priority.

I say that stages of planning, in that Infrastructure Australia Abbott promised $1.5 billion to begin building him that the East West Link was the No. 1 priority. many times, and that is plainly untrue. It is told him that. He went out and deliberately that he had taken the advice of Infrastructure case. Isn't that against everything that the proper business case.' Their hypocrisy is endless. When it comes to infrastructure, this government more than doubled the annual infrastructure have spent an unprecedented $6.8 billion from states' road, rail and public transport. We are infrastructure funding decisions. We have for-where projects get assessed You only have to look at the Victorian manage a chook raffle in a pub, let alone a multibillion-dollar project history in Victoria, such as the lie that build a $130 million bypass to take truck traffic traffic flow.

It was interesting to hear that this job budget was supposed to be about jobs and reduction in the rates of economic growth in rate-so much for it being about jobs and growth. But it does put it on par with the last Treasurer when he said-and this was last year's budget: This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, that, strengthening over time. He went on to promise: The deficit years of the global recession have done in these circumstances. Tony Abbott he would favour when he addressed the right-wing on 5 April.

These are the values I stand by. I am interesting that the member for Fowler did not but the vast bulk of the time he did use he It is supposed to be a budget born out of and somehow it was economically responsibleof that. And then he went on to talk about how and he struggled to identify who those of trash talk and assertion, setting up to the not reflect the coalition's position at all. This government is so dysfunctional, so tired It is supposed to be the high watermark for all the virtue that is in the budget as some to strengthen our country.

In fact rather than the four year of surplus, extraordinary budget broken promise about we are now greeted with figures pointing to a years to come. Nineteen billion dollars, the fifth next financial year will be $18 billion, the sixth after that $11 billion. Now that is not the seventh, seventh largest budget deficit back in 1995-96.

We cannot treat this government with seriousness They are dodgy. They are rubbery. They are member for Fowler not even use his time available lacking is it in virtue. He could not even coalition. That is what is wrong with this government: nothing positive to say.

Labor delivered the government is that if you elect Labor for a A fourth election win will enable the Australian had one since their initial election in 2007, and before 2013 election and Labor hopes that if might get a budget surplus.

That revenue is growing substantially. As I travel around Australia. I know small revenue growing at over seven per cent. They but they do not because the economy is tough There are no easy margins.

There are no sloppy profits anywhere. are just running to stand still in this economy growth in revenue the government has got. that but they have spent more and driven us into spent $192 billion more than it has raised over as a percentage of GDP higher every year under government.

Even in here there is a very concerning talks about what the government calls its program actually saw $325 million pulled out Again, you are expected to vote for Labor four to ask of people I would submit to you. It also that the structural deficits are made a little these two signature projects. Why is it saying Parliamentary Budget Office knows that there forward years of the estimates. That takes the created. They give the government an implied budget structural deficit. But then they say, jump again; the expenditure is supposed to see some upside. Here is the warning saying Labor has created and inculcated into our financial disability program and the increase in the money is being raised to pay for the trials is fully rolled out there is nowhere near enough the Parliamentary Budget Office is belling the finances, and that is causing great We have heard some people say, 'Well, fantastic budget address-in-reply by the Leader speech.

It was clear detail than Labor or any opposition leader in the you could keep what was supposed to be the without the hurt of the carbon tax and how that that the government has created we will all difficult financial decisions.

The Treasury is basically Treasury believe they have greater forecasting of the other forecasters in the world, and forward prices are actually half. If that is the out and spend billions of dollars buying up Treasury tells us it is going to go to $12. And guess what: it gets better. They say that forecasts are a farce. They make a complete autonomy of our Treasury and the accuracy of carbon tax, it is also the same with the mining has hardly raised any revenue and yet we are tax-going up and up and up-contrary Then we have the asylum seekers, a government.

Central to this issue is cross-subsidisation. of the Senate Community Affairs References comments from coalition senators-the member comments noted that there is not a good understanding is at the centre of this motion today. Nobody system possible but continually this government a sector, it blunders on through with a noble everybody. That is exactly what has happened The sector says, quite clearly: The largest provider of private day oncology near my electoratethe Sydney Adventist Hospital, said the funding infusions, provision of a limited range Nobody would want to see that. If the sector is and we do not have anything better to replace treatment, then obviously you have to do something here today discussing a motion in relation nobody wants to politicise these issues. These saying they cannot convince the government, Robertson, about this issue-that they have and measured motion that calls on the government negotiate on the price about this. If the government do have a noble and objective they will not get any argument from me something to replace it with that is better. You leave people in serious health situations in year, in November, we saw Senator Nick opposition's-side with the shadow minister for Greens offered their support. Maybe the government all these people are saying there The government itself has basically acknowledged on 5 May 2013 it said it would initiate a funding million in the 2013-14 budget to provide an for only six months. This was basically an admission last year was never going to work, that the patients work, and it took the government six months government-it is not rigorous with the detail; attempt to do something with the highest and to the price reduction of the chemotherapy drug on the treatment of cancer patients. that this is a concern of the sector, including cent of all cancer care in Australia. More than dispensed by community and private hospital The member for Robertson mentioned the report Committee, and I want to refer to the additional for Robertson should read them. Their of cross-subsidisation, which is what is saying that cross-subsidisation is the best interferes in an area, it ignores the advice of objective and it ends up doing a lot of damage to here. We are hearing that from the sector itself. services on the North Shore and north-west Sydneyapproach could lead to ""cessation of all chemotherapy of treatments and pharmacy staff reductions"". telling us that if cross-subsidisation is removed it with that could lead to the cessation of about it. Of course we do not want to be to cancer treatment and chemotherapy drugsare not political footballs. But the sector is and they cannot convince the member for a problem. So we have put forward a reasonable to consult with the sector, that says to intention of saving taxpayers' moneyabout saving taxpayers' money-they must have must have a better alternative. It is not right to the lurch. That is what we have seen here. Last Xenophon, an Independent-no friend of the health to say what an issue this is. Even the could have a look at that and say that if is a concern, there might be a concern. the problem.

That is the criticism we have of this it is not across the detail.

As everyone cars in 2016 and this once mighty car company, since 1925, will come to a halt. Our immediate who will be losing their jobs as a result of than just the Ford workers. First, there are including businesses in my electorate who customer. Second, it delivers a very significant There is no single thing which has led to harder than they need be. First of all, the government the price of electricity for Ford and for manufacturers. That is estimated to equate Second, the Labor has added 20,000 new regulations out about 200 in that time. Thirdly, it has automotive industry but also across all manufacturing. confidence through its reckless spending, policies without proper consultation. Manufacturing today is in crisis and we and New Zealand can have strong manufacturing Australia cannot also. I have a particular interest manufacturing presence. There are about employing about 10,000 people. Many are announce the closing down of its tablet-packaging Boronia in my electorate would be lost. A down in my electorate, another prominent recent times. Many others that I speak to on this is one of the worse years that they have ever had. We have to give hope to these manufacturers hope to the people who work in these manufacturing and that there are future growth prospects on we as policy makers can do-and that we will September. Firstly, we can make energy cheaper carbon tax. Energy is one of the major input adds between 10 and 20 per cent on top of everyday much harder for those manufacturers. It operates businesses from overseas do not have to pay those taxes. Secondly, we must get rid of some of the that we will get rid of a billion dollars worth relation to environmental approvals. Thirdly, Aston Electorate: Manufacturing Postal Services Community Safety I have available this evening, I would like to local issues in my electorate. The first of across Australia knows, Ford will stop producing which has been in operation in Australia thoughts are of course with the 1,200 people Ford's decision. However, the impacts are broader suppliers across Melbourne who will suffer, rely upon the car industry as their primary blow to manufacturing confidence. Ford closing, but the government has made things introduced the carbon tax, which put up other motor vehicle manufacturers and other to an amount of $400 per Australian made car. over the last six years and has only taken re-empowered the unions, particularly in the Fourthly, it has driven down business massive budget deficits and constant change to need to rebuild confidence. If Germany and Japan sectors, there is no reason why we here in in this because my electorate has such a large 1,000 manufacturers located in my electorate, struggling. We recently had GlaxoSmithKline business, which meant that 120 jobs from factory from the Hastie Group has had to close example, and many others have closed down in a regular basis say that are struggling and that that times can be better. We have to give businesses that their jobs can be secure the horizon. There are a number of things that do should the coalition win government in for the manufacturers by getting rid of the costs into manufacturing. The carbon tax itself electricity prices. That makes things so like a reverse tariff because their competitor red and green tape. We have announced already of red tape, and we will have a one-stop shop in we can provide some more flexibility in the industrial relations space-and we have already as, equally importantly, stamping down on union militancy. Fourthly, we must build some of the economic upon. Our manufacturers are often exporting, Therefore the roads need to be in place and manufacturers in my electorate, the East West from the eastern side of Melbourne across stuck in traffic. That would make it cheaper as well. All of these things would make a difference manufacturers across Australia. In addition to accelerated depreciation of capital assets to they can purchase capital assets, capital equipment, accelerate that and therefore set their businesses businesses confidence that they can invest, The second issue I would like to raise concerns one of those services which are respected electorate people have difficulties accessing tremendous growth in the Rowville and Lysterfield the post office in Stud Park in Rowville.

I can report that with senior Australia Post officials, and hopeful that at some stage we will get some and that would make a real difference Finally, in the last couple of minutes community safety. I recently did a survey responses to the survey. One of the issues safety. In fact, of those 2½ thousand people, safe in the Knox area, which I think is particularly that they did not feel safe around precincts, particularly at night. There are many things that we can do to assist of the community groups, particularly Mountain their particular shopping precincts. Some security they are already making a difference, particularly protective services officers who are now operating announced our policy in this area-as well infrastructure which our manufacturers rely or they are selling their wares across the nation. the rails need to be in place. Importantly for Link must be built so that they can quickly get to the western side of Melbourne without being in reducing costs for local manufacturers and this, if the budget allowed, I would like to see take advantage of the high Aussie dollar so that today, frequently from overseas, quickly up for the future. Most of all, we have to give knowing that a government supports them. Australian postal services. Australia Post is and valued across Australia. But in parts of my Australian postal services because of the areas.

It is because of this issue that I rise to talk facts on the record. Whatever Ford's business business model-which were plainly caused some decisions by Ford in Detroit prevented important for us to acknowledge that any car hypercompetitive situation. It is an unusually different brands from all over the world coming for a car making country. The problem has been exacerbated over that the Australian dollar has been high, because it is regarded as a safeguard currency. banks, as well as many other foreign investors, as a safe economy in a world which is awash and with unemployment, and in a world awash island of economic growth, of economic certainty our success is working against us-it is keeping trend lower.

Collectively Automotive Industry The member for Aston spoke about Ford in the 1,200 workers in Broadmeadows and Geelong a terrible thing-I saw it many times as a union and there is a great deal of uncertainty about up doing. It is important that the government to workers on the ground and make sure they We do not want to see any worker who is in that about the car industry tonight and to place some issues, whatever the problems with their by the lack of an export model, and perhaps the production of an export model-it is maker in the Australian domestic market faces a competitive market where there are many into what is the freest car market in the world the past few years by our currency-by the fact at first because of commodity prices and now It is important to note that some 19 central are investing in Australia because they see it with uncertainty, with debt, with low growth with unemployment Australia stands as an and of low unemployment. Paradoxically, our dollar high even as commodity prices has faced this situation, and it is certainly an at a higher value than the fundamentals would whether they be European countries or Japan currencies that are notably weaker than they States and Japan, it is because they are printing Of course this has the additional effect cars and United States cars are cheaper on dollar high but also their currencies are low. Of German cars in particular, are artificially low a recession they have almost made certain that the Eurozone is and so the Euro currency fundamentals. Unsurprisingly, we are getting This is likely to be a temporary situation. It is make sure that we provide our car industry during this time to make sure that we retain the what happened at Ford Broadmeadows and Ford my home state with Holden. Holden is of critical importance to the South for the state government on 4 February 2011, Adelaide, pointed out that Holden's operations billion in gross state product, or about 1.3 jobs, or 1.5 per cent of employment, and to taxation. That is a critical figure, and it is would happen if Holden were not there. The suddenly absented itself from the South Australian $1.3 billion in gross state product, 16,000 jobs base. It is pretty obvious that, without Holden suffer from, in effect, a recession. It would be want to see Holden go. Holden have issued a statement on the withdrawal Ford made their announcement on the same Commodore, which is a really great car. But 10-year manufacturing plan that was agreed on the economic and marketing conditions at billion in the country and producing two all-new out to 2022. That is an absolutely critical thing the things that Holden's statement on 23 May 2013 said is: The industry needs swift action to make Australia's globally competitive as quickly as possible. It then goes on to say Holden is working closely with the Australian Governments to ensure the viability of the industry … What Holden is begging for in that statement billion-dollar investment to South Australia about this investment is that it maintains an with the dollar, which will affect whatever place. The high dollar is not a Labor-only issue, beneficiary of the fundamentals changing bipartisan commitment. I wish I could tell the House that we had do not, because the Leader of the Opposition have heard him, on the closure of Ford, saying, I know people love being nostalgic in this building. like being nostalgic about that period, and I is now very low compared to Germany's a lot of German-made cars in the marketplace. not likely to persist indefinitely, but we need to with as much assistance as can possibly be given car industry and do not see more tragedies like Geelong. I certainly do not want to see it in Australian state economy. In a report prepared Barry Burgan, who is with the University of were estimated to provide at that time $1.1 per cent of gross state product, and about 11,700 directly contribute $65 million a year to state important to know that he also had a look at what conclusion he came to was that, if Holden economy, we would lose in the order of and $83 million per year to the state taxation in the state economy, South Australia would a brutal blow to my state, and I certainly do not of Ford. It was very unfortunate that day that Holden were launching the VF Holden's statement made it clear that they have a with the Australian government in 2012, based that time. The plan sees Holden investing $1 global vehicles, which will take production for South Australia. Most importantly, one of automotive policy settings clear, consistent and Government, Federal Coalition and the State is a bipartisan commitment to secure this critical and to the country. The most important thing Australian choice once we are past these issues government sits on the Treasury bench in this although some future government may be the around the world. But Holden are begging for a that bipartisan commitment, but unfortunately we persists in maintaining the rhetoric. You would 'We will keep the Howard government's plan.'

Sometimes I get nostalgic for the easier times before the global financial crisis. cut $500 million from automotive assistance, were to happen, it would jeopardise $1 billion government were to abandon in effect what industry in this country and jeopardise that same situation that has happened at Ford, that it would plunge southern Australia-not just recession.

Debate adjourned. But the problem is that that plan in effect will and Holden have made it very clear that, if that worth of investment. If an incoming coalition has been a bipartisan commitment to the car investment or see it not happen, leading to the would be a very great tragedy indeed, because South Australia but Victoria as well-into a It might well have a very detrimental impact So my plea to the coalition-and it is a the nostalgia of the past, meet with Holden Federation Chamber adjourned at 21:40 Mr Hartsuyker asked the Minister representing March 2013: Further to the Minister's answer to question page 154), can he indicate why the Chairman of Minister for Sport and the Minister for Broadband, assistance in finalising the FFA television rights November 2012.",355
