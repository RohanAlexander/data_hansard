2,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN TO WRIT,"I have received a return to the writ which I issued on 24 December 1993 for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Werriwa in the state of New South Wales to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the Hon. John Charles Kerin. By the endorsement on the writ, it is certified that Mark Latham has been elected. NA Australian National Audit Office",11
3,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to statements reported yesterday that the Auditor-General believes that thegovemment and government departments are trying to stymie his overall work. The Auditor-General commented: One would be forgiven for thinking that they ,want an Auditor-General who is seen and not heard. They are not interested in the sort of checks and balances we can provide. He is also reported to have described the Australian National Audit Office as 'running on borrowed time'. I ask the Prime Minister to assure the House of the certainty of the future of the audit office under his government and to ensure that the Auditor-General is given full support in the conduct of his duties. Furthermore, Prime Minister, will you instruct your ministers to cooperate fully with the Auditor-General in his inquiries?",11
4,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am one of those people who think that an auditor and an audit office are very important parts of government and accountability-I always have, regardless of who the auditor is from time to time. I think departments should be appropriately accountable to the mandate which the auditor enjoys, but I do not think any questioning by departments of what that mandate is from time to time in relation to particular requests by the auditor diminishes in any way the regard which the government has for the process of audit any more than I believe that the notion of ongoing consultations between the audit office· and the Department of Finance about an auditor's resources and the productivity of the audit office should be removed from the processes of the scrutiny of the Public Service. Over the years we have seen a very high level of produCti-ity emerge from the Australian Public Service, and there has been an efficiency dividend required of departments. The Department of Finance, which has a fairly ferocious reputation in this respect, bates down quite heavily on departments to see that that efficiency dividend is actually produced. No doubt, in all staffing matters and in the allocation of resources, all agencies of government which have a legitimate task in the service of the public of this country have got to account for their own resources. This is just as true of the auditor and therefore it· should not be assumed by him or anybody else that in any way this is a government trying to diminish his resources. In fact, I believe that the Audit Act and the whole process of audit are important to the functioning of government, the resources of the Commonwealth, the allocation of Commonwealth funds and the management of Commonwealth programs. If the auditor is correctly reported in his remarks that the government's current attitude is to thwart him where possible, I can simply say that he is mistaken. We support the audit process, but we do not believe that the audit office itself should be removed from the process of consultation, staffing reviews and all the other things which every agency of government is subjected to.

On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Taxation: Fringe Benefits",11
6,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Assistant Treasurer seen reports in the media today that the government has backed away from fringe benefits tax rules on business entertainment? What is the government's intention with regard to FBT oil entertainment? .,12
7,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen an article in this morning's Australian Financial Review headed 'Backdown on FBT rules means lunch is still on'. This is clearly wrong. In fact, story is very positive about the way in which the government consults and listens to the business community in designing the detail of its tax laws. In the article, Elsa Payne, a tax partner with Price 'Waterhouse, is quoted as saying that the reported change was in .line with the federal government's recent willingness to modify its fringe benefits legislation in response to legitimate business concerns. I think that is a very favourable reflection on the way in which this government goes about the important business of law making, especially when we are trying to keep compliance costs for businesses to a minimum. The fact of the matter in this case is that there has not been a. backdown. To say that there has been suggests that the government is changing or moving away from a policy that it has adopted. This is clearly not the case. In last year's budget, the government announced that, where an employer paid the entertainment expenses of an employee, the employer could claim an income tax deduction for those expenses and they would be subject to FBT. This change is consistent with our policy that the tax burden should be shared fairly and that all income should be treated equally, whether it is from salary or benefits in kind. We do not want to return to the bad old. days of the opposition's tax policies when tax avoidance salary packages were rampant. The government absolutely stands by this policy objective. Because of the way in which theFBT law is structured, the way in which entertainment is paid can make a difference. If the entertainment is paid using a corporate credit card, only that portion of the expense that relates to the employee would be subject to FBT. However, if an employee paid for entertainment using his personal credit card, cash or cheque and then sought reimbursement from his employer, the whole amountof the expense would be subject to FBT even though only part of it related to the employee. Obviously, the government never intended that the manner of payment should lead to different tax treatments. It should make no difference to tax liability whether the employ the ee pays cash for the entertainment, gets a receipt and then claims it back from his employer, or whether the employer pays direct by corporate credit card, cheque or any other method. The government has recognised, in listening to the concerns of business, that because of the way the FBT law is structured there is confusion and unnecessary compliance costs in employers ensuring that only the right amount of FBT is paid. The government has no intention of insisting business must provide all employees who are required to entertain clients, no matter how infrequently, with a corporate credit card simply for taxation purposes. Accordingly, the government will be making changes to the FBT rules to eliminate the significance of the mode of payment. The FBT law will be changed so that reimbursements made by an employer to an employee to cover expenses incurred by the employee in entertaining clients will be exempt from FBT and non-deductible for income tax purposes. However, this exemption will not apply to the costs of entertain7 ment provided to the employee or associates of the employee. This change will ensure equal treatment of the provision of entertainment under the FBT law irrespective of how the entertainment is paid for. The Taxation Office will be monitoring the new rules to make sure there is no abuse. This case highlights some of the problems inherent in our complex tax system and the government is concerned to make our tax system more efficient, less complex, more certain and fairer to all taxpayers. This change to FBT r!.des is only one example. On 17 December 1993, the then Treasurer announced a tax law improvement project. This project, headed by Brian Nolan, a former second commissioner of taxation, will modernise the structure and the language of the existing income tax law so that it can be more easily understood and complied with by business and taxpayers in general. Community Grants",12
8,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories discuss the sports grants program with the Prime Minister before she made decisions about the distribution of the grants? Was the method she used to administer the grants agreed to by the Prime Minister and the cabinet?",13
9,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not discuss the distribution of any specific funds at all with the Prime Minister. Mr Downer--'No, the program.",13
10,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was a review done of round two of the program before round three was funded. The program was funded in the normal budget context, and in the normal budget context the program had approval. Superannuation",13
11,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the contribution made to Australia's savings by the government's superannuation policies? Does he believe that compulsory employer funded superannuation is necessary to provide a comfortable retirement income for Australian employees? What would be the effect of cancelling scheduled increases in employer funded superannuation?,13
12,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the significant developments of the 1?80s and early 1990s has been the extension of benefits of superannuation to ordinary Australians. When this government took office, superannuation benefits were exclusively given to those in the upper echelons of the private sector or to employees of the government sector; that is, the great bulk of privately employed Australians had no access to them. They were often in their design a tax dodge so that executives could get very high payments in the last year or two of their service and then go out with a very high tax-free lump sum. The government's policy changes have resulted in an increase in employer contributions to superannuation funds-so much so that, in the early 1980s when the government introduced the program, there was $34 billion dollars in superannuation fund assets and today there is $170 billion in superannuation fund assets, around 40 per cent of GOP. On the current schedule of increased contributions from employers, superannuation savings in Australia will more than double to well over $300 billion by the end of the decade. In 1993 dollars, the likelihood is that we will see a doubling of the current level to around that figure. In other words, we are creating a savings pool equal to three-quarters of today's national annual output. There is no doubt that our superannuation policies are making a huge contribution to national savings. They always have the dual aim of complementing national savings and providing a higher income in retirement for Australia's employees. The appalling fact is that, over the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition threatened to destroy the program if he came to office. He backed down on his tariff policy and on his bulkbilling policy and he has said that he is just as determined now to destroy superannuation ,for Australian employees as he was in March last year. He said that if he came to office he would end the program of increased contributions-in other words, .they would be stopped at six per cent-for employees and 'not go on to nine per cent and then to 12 per cent to a mature contribution, which would give them tax concessions.

17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting across the table.,13
18,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The country needs an increase in national savings arid people need a higher standard of living in retirement. As a consequence of the rise to nine per cent and then to 12 per cent, the nation will have a large savings pool to fund its investment from without calling on, overseas savings and overseas debt. With everybody admitting that it is hard to change the savings propensity of a nation, this has been one way to change it. In the changing of it, people can look forward to a higher standard of living in retirement. The consequence of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition would be to wipe billions from national savings. All of these organisations which support him, such as the AMP and National Mutual-all the people who turned up in monkey suits to the Intercontinental Hotel to welcome the so-called new Prime Minister in on election nightwere barracking for a set of policies which would pull their organisations down. There is a major reassessment going on within the stuffy portals of some of these mutuals saying, 'The government's policies of seeing national savings rise to nine per cent and on to 12 per cent are sensible, rational and decent', because we have asked the work force to take nine per cent to 12 per cent of their savings",14

22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,",.The Leader of the Opposition has been requested not to interject across the table.",14
23,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The work force agreed to take nine per cent to 12 per cent of their income as savings. The Leader of the Opposition interjected a moment ago, 'Oh, it's another tax'. If employers do not fund superannuation accounts, they will pay it as wages; they will pay it as cash. If they do not pay it as wages and cash, what profit share is the Leader of the Opposition arguing for? He is arguing for a profit share beyond even the current level, which is beyond any other historical experience. except the late 1980s. he wants the employers to pocket that which the employees would otherwise take as cash and are now having banked as superannuation, what profit share is he arguing for? What would the superannuation concession be for if it were only for wealthy people to get a tax break again, given the fact that we have introduced the reasonable benefits limit so that in the last year of their employment people cannot take very high salaries as executives and walk out with massive lump sums? Does the Leader of the Opposition never learn anything that is sensible and decent for the country? We do need national savings. There is a high problem about savings across the 1990s, particularly now with the whole worldMr Downer-Why? Why?",14
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo.,14
25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because Russia, China, South America and India are out there bidding for international savings as never before-that is why. And that is why we need a pool of national savings ourselves. But snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, here is the Liberal Party saying, 'Oh, no, a pool of national savings is not what we need. Higher incomes for Australians in retirement is not what we need. We need a few shonky tax breaks for senior executives-that is what we need'. We have the temerity of this person, a refugee from the Sydney financial community, saying, 'Oh, no, this is not good enough for my peers who expect to be on a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year and, hopefully, to get a couple of big year pay-outs before they leave so that they can ramp up a super package. Let's not give the ordinary wage and salary earners a decent break by letting them put part of their income away as savings to add to the national level of savings and give the whole country a better fiscal situation and, not only that, a better standard of living in retirement' . ' The remarks of the weekend show this: talk about learn nothing and forget nothing. The Bourbons of the Liberal Party have taken the election defeat and learned nothing. The If Leader of the Opposition is still out there basically trying to knock off superannuation benefits and also saying that we should not have a capital gains tax. Let it be recorded, and let the millions of Australian working men and women understand, that the Leader of the Opposition wants to' knock off their superannuation. He wants to take away the higher incomes in retirement and the addition to their private savings, which the government has allowed for them in superannuation. Let it be recorded again that the Liberal Party wants to cut their savings out, wants to cut their savings down and wants to denude them of the savings which the government has provided for them and not allow them to have the kind of income in retirement which the country can afford and which the country should provide them with.

I hope that they will respond and work together for a majority report. Bulk-billing",15
33,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Finance provide the House with details of the effect on fiscal policy of maintaining bulk-billing for medical services plus tax deductibility for private health insurance? What are the government's intentions in this matter?,15
34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition in his presentation in this place and in his presentation outside gets increasingly schizophrenic. He sits in this place lecturing us on fiscal responsibility; he walks out of the place and does exactly as he pleases. He has established a pretty strong reputation out there for backing off from positions that he holds with great firmness. For example, we all remember his statement on the GST: 'If people move to get rid of the GST from the package they have to remove me'. He got in a bit ahead of them, because the moment he walked out from an electoral defeat and before there was any chance of the Liberal Party meeting on the subject he had decided to abandon the GST position. So he removed the GST before the Liberal Party removed him. What we have had from the Leader of the Opposition in recent times is another set of back-aways from policy and the maintenance of policy that he can no longer afford not to back away from. Of course, it is all done in the same unilateral manner that is totally disturbing to his members. wi have the report in the Sydney Morning He/aid today of the last set of backdowns over/the weekend. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Senator Short asked for clarification by Dr Hewson as to how his announcements in a television interview on Sunday fitted with his commitments to establish a more orthodox policy development process which provided an opportunity for wide input. I might well say that the opposition would express some concern in that regard, because we have had a great song and dance made by the Leader of the. Opposition in defence of himself against his detractors about how this is going to be the 'policy year'. We have also had similar complaints from Mr MCLachlanMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I refer to standing order 145 and relevance. Usually we have a pretence at answering the question for. a minute or two before we get this sort of nonsense which is not relevant at all. In this case the Leader of the House has not even made the pretence to answer the question. I ask you to either bring him back to the question, which was specifically about fiscal consequences of bulk-billing and another matter, or sit him down.",15
35,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,16
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister will resume his seat. I have not ruled on this matter yet.,16
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Menzies actually makes a very valid point, although I would say to him that in the case of leaders-and, indeed, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business-some tolerance is given. However, I say to the Leader of the House that on this occasion that tolerance is being stretched and I ask him to come to the substance of the question.",16
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have no problem with that, Mr Speaker, because the subject of the question goes absolutely to the heart of the points I was making by way of preamble; and that is, of course, that over the weekend one of the policies that the Leader of the Opposition decided to dump was the policy on bulkbilling but not the policy on tax deductibility for private health insurance. What would be the cost of tax deductibility for private health insurance? I will go on the opposition's estimates during its election campaign when it was offsetting these measures by the introduction of a GST raising something like $18 billion. According to the opposition, there is an $850 million hole which, on top of all the other elements of that hole, now sits very finnly inside Liberal Party policy, without any offsetting taxation arrangements or anycredible cuts in other government outlays added to it. So what we now have is opposition members endlessly standing up in this place telling us that we have no responsibility in the area of fiscal policy, but when they get themselves into trouble, they get up and say anything at all as far as that is concerned. It is an $850 million hold just like that. It is no wonder the finance spokesperson of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Higgins, should apparently get up and, as this article says, express concern about the financial implications of revising opposition health policy. Well might the would be deputy leader or leader of the Liberal Party express concern about that, because there is much concern that ought to be expressed. I always try to find a historical situation that provides us with a useful analogy for the circumstances in which the Leader of the Opposition finds himself, where every initiative that he takes falls foul of some commitment that he has given-either to the country or to his party-in a way that disturbs them. I can do no better to find a description of this situation than go to the Marquess of Queensberry rules, which were handed helpfully to me by one of my colleagues the other day. Rule 5 states: 'A man hanging on the ropes in a helpless state, with his toes off the ground, shall be considered down'. Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories",16
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Does the minister agree that, whatever debate there may be concerning the principle of ministerial responsibility, the practice has almost invariably been that a minister resigns when his or her continued presence in a government is causing damage and embarrassment to that government? Did not her colleague Senator Richardson resign precisely because his continued presence would cause damage to the government? Is not her continued presence damaging the Keating government? Why does she not take a leaf out of Senator Richardson's book and, if she will not do the right thing by the nation, at least do the right thing by the Australian Labor Party-to which she owes everything-and resign immediately?",16
40,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What a hypocritical question that is! All of you sat there while Mr Howard asked that question and you are all out to get the Leader of the Oppositionthat every single one of you. You, you and you are trying to get him. You want him to resign and yet you ask such a hypocritical question. If there is anyone resigning from this House, it will be you, Dr Hewson.",16

42,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of proposals for tax breaks for families and can he inform the House of the benefits of such proposals compared with direct payments to families?,17
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the Prime Minister, I remind the House that I remarked a moment ago that, in the course of question time and the running of this House, the leaders of parties and indeed the managers of the business of the House and opposition spokesmen get some tolerance. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, as I have constantly during question time today, not to talk across the table. My patience is running out. I call the Prime Minister.",17

59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is answering the question. The House will come to order.,17
60,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was here when the MCCabe-Lafranchi report was pres-nted. I have a corporate memory of the history of the honourable member for Bennelong. Let me turn to the question of families. Since the government has been in office, we have significantly transformed financial assistance to families. The transformation has occurred because we have focused on the needs of children, particularly children in low income families-those families in greatest need of financial support. Under this government, financial assistance for children in low income families has increased in real terms by between 50 per cent and over 100 per cent, depending on the numbers and ages of the children. Family payment for two children in a low income family living in private rental accommodation is now $123 a week. That is $123 a week for two children in a low income family in private rental accommodation! The increase will be maintained as, for the first time ever under this government, all payments for children are being indexed. We have also followed this policy with a deliberate one of directing financial support for children to the person with primary refor the daily care of the children-usually the mother. This is critical to ensure that, as far as possible, the money goes to support the children. The government now pays over $5 billion a year in direct payments to the parent caring for the children. The government will do more later in the year when the dependent spouse rebate is cashed out with a new home child-care allowance which will direct a further $1.2 billion a year to parents caring full time for children and provide many women at home with a source of independent income and recognition. The opposition, however, is talking about going the other way with the recycled income splitting policy of the honourable member for Bennelong. Instead of. focusing on families most in need, income splitting would give most benefits to families with the highest incomes. The higher the income, the more a person would gain. We have had some work done in the social security department which I' think is very interesting because it shows that over a million families, nearly 900,000 of them with incomes less than $30,000, would lose under income splitting, whereas more than 600,000 families, with incomes over $60,000, would gain about $2,000 a year.",17

74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the,goveOlment of which he, was Treasurer, the real value of financial support for children jn low income families actually fell. This is someone who is professing an interest in families, and while he was Treasurer the real· value of financial support for children in low income families actually fell. The International Year of the Family gives us all the opportunity to focus on the importance of the family. But what have those opposite done? They are arguing amongst themselves about income splitting'. The honourable member for Bennelong is saying that he will raise it at every opportunity, and Senator Vanstone is counterattacking and dismissing. income splitting as tax breaks for wealthy families-and she is right. Just today, the honourable member for Mayo raised concerns about whether income splitting would be affordable and fair. We all know that it would not be fair. Senator Vanstone has already told us that it would not be fair. We also know that it would cost about $3,000 million-$3 billion. The honourable member for Bennelong supports incorp,e splitting. Senator Vanstone is saying, 'No, it would be unfair; it would go to the highest income people'. That comment is being supported by the honourable member for Mayo. The cost would be about $3 billion. Opposition members are' also arguing amongst themselves about what defines a proper family-for God's sake! The Deputy Leader of the National Party cruelly labelled children from sole parent families as being less civilised. Where do these people get off? They are now going to have a' conference to sort it out. Senator Newman,' the spokesperson on family matters, is organising a conference. What has been the response to that? The alliance forum, referred to as' the social troglodyte rump of the coalition, is planning an alternative family conference. As one of the journalists in the gallery-my friend the Kookaburra-remarked yesterday, 'The coalition family is busting up with the custody battle over policy about to be fought'. That is it. When is the Liberal Party ever going to learn? The Leader of the Opposition is trying to give superannuation tax breaks to high income earners against the benefit of the great body of the work force and the honourable member for Bennelong is trying to give income splitting tax breaks to families with two high income earners. The opposition always goes back to the same thing: trying to support high income people against the great body of the community that can see a sensible set of family payments and superannuation payments for itself. The Leader of the Opposition will not be able to hide from this one. Basically, the shadow Treasurer",18

How does the minister intend addressing the report's conclusions that the Australian Customs Service has lost direction and that its management is generally unresponsive to industry requirements? Does the minister intend simply to take refuge behind the resignation today of the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Frank Kelly? Is Mr Kelly to be the fall guy for government instead of the minister accepting proper responsibility for the maladministration of his department?",19
80,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Honourable members and honourable senators would have received a copy of the report of the inquiry, which has been conducted by Mr Conroy and two assistants. The government intends to consult widely amongst those who have a stake in the reform of the Australian Customs Service before final decisions are made. It is to the credit of the minister, Senator Schacht, that he was prepared to set up the inquiry and to get to the bottom of this and to ensure that there are proper reforms in place. The minister for customs will do just that. Censorship",19
81,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Attorney-General would be aware of community concern about violence and sexually. explicit material being made available to children through computer games and computer networks. My question to the Attorney-General is: will the government take steps to ensure that parents are able to make proper judgments about the type of material their children use for information and entertainment?,19
82,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1991 the Law Reform Commission delivered a very comprehensive report on the Australian censorship regime. Since that time, the Commonwealth and state censorship ministers have been discussing the report and the changes needed to bring our censorship system up to date. This discussion will reach a very important point next week when the ministers discuss a new chissification system for film, video literature and com- . puter games. The Commonwealth's position on this issue is guided by three basic principIes: firstly, that adults are entitled to see and hear what they wish; secondly, however, that people should not be offended by unsolicited material; and, thirdly, that our system should afford sufficient protection, particularly to children, from harm from offensive material. Honourable members may be aware of to proposals to bring a censorship regime into place for computer games. Hopefully, this also be finalised next week. It will be broadly along the same lines as that which applies film and video but with one important differalcoholised ence: the addition of a new classification system----,the G8 system-designed to cover children aged eight years and younger. That is felt to be of considerable importance video game area, given the particular nature of those games. The fact that violent games .are now very lifelike in their representation of violence, means that we need to ensure that parents have adequate information at the time of purchasing a game to know what their children will be involved with. Flowing from the examination of computer games was the issue of similar games being available through computer bulletin boards: Evidence is now coming forward to the effect that a range of other illegal and offensive materials is available through these bulletin boards. Apparently the boards have been used to circulate stolen credit card numbers which can then be used by people to access some unfortunate person's account. Clearly,the Commonwealth needs to look at this area. Accordingly, the minister for communications and his department, in conjunction with the Attorney-General's Department, will set up joint task force to examine the legal and technical issues involved with bringing appropriate regime for computer bulletin boards and computer networks. It is a difficult area given that the technology is such that makes regulation and any enforcement very problematic. Nonetheless, given the evidence that confronts ministers on this issue, it incumbent upon the Commonwealth to examlocal ine what is hopefully an appropriate response. It is possible that the same model that applies to 0055 telephone services-a complaints based model-could apply to computer bullebecause read, tin boards. This matter will come to a head at the censorship meeting next week and, hopefully flowing from that, Australia will have a modem and up-to-date censorship regime. Sales Tax ' Mr ANDREW-My. question is addressed the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aWare that the protracted budget decision of last August will to raise the sales tax on wine by almost 50 per cent has been accompanied by a rise of to almost 100 per cent in the sales tax on debeverages? Did the government deliberately choose to make this alcohol-free alternative beverage relatively less affordable, or is this anomaly an unintended consequence in the of a poorly prepared budget?",19
83,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of the detail of this matter but I will certainly look into it for the honourable member and give him an answer. I can say that the wine tax, as originally proposed, was very substantially amended. In the event, the wine tax that was put forward, after consultation with the industry, was to be phased in over time to a rather lesser degree than the wine tax originally proposed in the budget. In all the circumstances, it is a tax which· was put through with the support of the industry, particularly as it involved an independent inquiry into the wine industry as well as other measures to assist the industry. But with respect to the other aspects of.the question, I will get back to the honourable member with an answer. Film Industry",20
84,Mr BARRY JONES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is ada dressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. In the aftermath of the successin an ful launch of the film Schindler s ArkSchindler s List, I am sorry-, based on Tom Keneally's novel Schindler s Ark and continuit ing international acclaim for Jane Campion's The Piano, can the minister indicate the. significance of Australia's film industry in genis erating .export earnings and recognition for artists? Can he advise the House of recent developments in this area?",20
85,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lalor for his question and the correction I thought we almost had him make a mistake with respect to film, and I am glad to see that was not the case. The film industry is essentially an international marketplace. We in Australia get access to a large number of films from other countries, especially froin the United States. Just as we in Australia form impressions about other countries, based on the films and television programs we get from other countries, people in other nations form impressions about Australia based on our television programs and films. Our two most successful recent examples",20
86,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,'-Reckless Kelly.,21
87,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member might consider that his aim or model in life, but two better examples would be Crocodile Dundee and Strictly Ballroom, which not only were great international successes and earned a lot of export· dollars for Australia but also contained a uniquely Australian view of life. The honourable member for Lalor mentioned The Piano and Schindler - List, which have Australian participation. They are doing very well internationally and are in the running for the Academy Award nominations, which are announced tomorrow. We hope the Australians and others involved with those two films do well tomorrow. At the end of the day, it is essential that have an Australian film industry which includes Australian views and attitudes, which helps to create jobs for Australians by being made by Australians and which uses international themes as well as Australian themes. With this goal in mind, the government seeks to foster and develop the film industry in a number of ways. We have the Australian Film, Television and Radio' School, which helps to train our filmmakers; the Australian Film Commission, which helps to promote our film industry; and the National Film and Sound Archive, which helps to preserve our film heritage. . Each of the Commonwealth agencies has mternational programs which try to assist in exporting our services and which try to ensure that we can sell our films and programs overseas and, in that way, help develop export earnings for the country. Our Film Finance Corporation tries to ensure that films which are being supported by the FFC have sufficient private sector .support, and that is usually indicated in a good way by foreign presales or distribution guarantees. One example which might be of interest to the honourable member for Lalor is a recent Australia-Japan co-venture to produce a fourpart documentary series called Heaven Breath. This four-part documentary series is perhaps the first time an FFC backed documentary has achieved such a high level of foreign backing while retaining Australian creative control. While the British author of the best selling book Heaven s Breath is a consultant to the project and will also be the narrator, Australian creative control will be maintained. In fact, not only will it be filmed in Australia-but also will the post-production take place here in Australia, which is something all of us should be encouraging. Australia has developed a vibrant film industry-I believe we can ensure it will continue to foster-with an outstanding reputation. As some of us saw last Sunday night, Australia can consider itself second to none in many areas of the' arts, whether it is in the 'symphony orchestra, the Chorale in Melbourne or our film industry. In the early we part of the second half of this year, I will be deliv-ring the government's cultural policy statement to outline ways in which we can try to foster a better environment for the development of the arts. That will allow us to take advantage of the Prime Minister's decision to amalgamate arts and communications-something which the honourable member for Lalor has advocated for some time. Finally, I had the honour of representing the government at last night's premiere of Schindler s List, referred to by the honourable member for Lalor. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong were present from this House, Tom Keneally's Booker prize-winning story has been brought to life by Steven Spielberg. With all of its horror and its message of hope, it is a story about this century's darkest days. We should all be proud that an Australian author has played such a role in reminding all of us that we should· never forget. .",21

93,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the parliament yesterday, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said, in eff-ct, that I should spend a bit more time looking after my electorate and a bit less time playing football. I wish to make it clear that I have not played football since 1987, when my illustrious career of 200 games came to an end. Further, I stopped coaching in 1992-after a couple of premierships. It is quite flattering. But the honourable member went on to say: . . . those opposite are entitled to oppose the concept of sports and cultural grants. As I am one of the honourable members opposite, I need to contradict that point. Unfortunately, the honourable member blurred the difference between concern over the allocation of money and in principle opposition to the grants.

115,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for dis'cussion, namely: . The total failure of the government to adequately address key environmental issues in Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places- .",23
116,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I believe this government's failure to address the real and genuine issues of the environment is a matter of public importance. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), through the sports rorts affair, has shown herself totally devoid of ethics, integrity or ministerial responsibility. This minister's incompetence has not been limited to the sports portfolio; her incompetence extends to the entire administration of environment policy in Australia. This minister PAPERS has engaged in self-promotion and superficial policies and, in the meantime, Australia's standing relative to other developed countries has plummeted. The environmental health of Australians has suffered and the Australian environment itself has deteriorated. Minister, in addressing this MPI today, one of the big problems I had was exactly what to leave out. Because you have been so poor in your administration of this department, there are so many gaping holes, minister, that I could have been going all day. and it would have looked like a dog's breakfast. I could ask you where the biodiversity strategy is'. I could ask you where the NEPA legislation is papers: that we were promised a year ago. Mrs Kelly interjecting",23
117,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will get a chance to speak in a moment.,23
118,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Minister, I can ask you where the forest policy advisory committee is. I can ask you why you, as minister for the environment, have not mentioned the major problems in Australia of water and land degradation. I can ask you why we have no feral animal policy. And I can ask you why, in the recent events of the fire in New South Wales, when we had the death of so many animals and mammals in the parks, the only thing we heard from you, minister, was that you were attending a party at Nick Whitlam's in Whale Beach. That is where you were, minister. But let us get back to the point of last week. 'What happened when we brought into this House the report, which you said you had not seen-remember A Green League of Nations? What did this report show about Australia's environmental standing in the world? It showed that· out of 21 countries-'where did we rate? Where would you expect us to rate? You have heard this minister. You have heard this government say what great environmental policies we have, so where do you think we would rate? You would think that we would rate pretty highly, would you not? Maybe one; two; or with these environment policies, maybe five or six; or if we were not doing too good, maybe 15. But where did we come? Out of 21 countries we came in 18th--':after Turkey, Portugal, Greece and a few other countries. That is Australia's standing in the world, minister. Minister, have a look at some of those indices that they had a look at at the OECD. Have a look at waste management. Where would you think that Australia came in waste management in the world? Mr Downer-First.",23
119,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Surely.,24
120,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You would think that we would be with the best, would you not, because we have a minister who cares about waste management? Where did Australia come amongst the world's developed countries? We came last. How do you think that makes the people of Australia feel that our rating in the world amongst dyveloped countries is right down at the bottom? If that was not bad enough, have a look at some of the other indices. What about sulfur oxides? Do you know why sulfur oxides are bad? They are bad because when sulfur oxide gets in the atmosphere we get acid rain. Mr Chynoweth-Will you ask her to face us? We cannot hear her.",24
121,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Dunkley, although not getting the call, did raise a valid point. If you speak the microphone everyone can hear.",24
122,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I take your point, Mr Speaker, and I will do my best to speak into the microphone. Where were we? We were looking at sulfur oxides which bring acid rain. Australia is not one of the heavy industrialised countries in the world, is it? Compare it with some of the European countries. Compare us with Japan and you would think that we were doing fairly well. Where did we come? We were the second worse country in the OECD. If that were not enough, let us have a look at carbon dioxide-the key greenhouse gas. The minister seems to find this funny. , Mrs KELLY - I do; I find it absolutely hilarious.",24
123,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is that your standard, minister? Our comparisons' with the OECD are so bad and you find that funny. What sort of reflection is that on you, minister, and on your competence in this portfolio? You are right to joke because you have made this policy and this department a joke. Mr Ronaldson-Where do we come on the list of sports rorts?",24
124,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We did very well with sports rorts. Between 1985 and 1990 Australia became less energy efficient. While this minister has been touting what we have been doing for. greenhouse gases, we· have been becoming less efficient. This brings us to what the report A Green League of Nations stated about Australia. Along with Ireland, we were the worse country for supplying information to the OECD. Why would Australia, along with Ireland, be the worse country supplying information to the OECD? Minister, could it be that you had something to hide-that you were so ashamed qf Australia's record on the environment that you did not send the figures to the OECD because you knew how bad they made us look? This was despite the fact that in 1991, along with other nations, you agreed to provide the environmental information but did not. There was no information from Australia on municipal solid waste; no information on into water use; and no information on waste water treatment, including sewage. We would like to know why. Minister, when this was introduced to the House last week, we asked you about the figures in this report. You said that you had not seen the report so could not comment. But how come I had a copy of the report but you, with the resources of your department, could not get a copy of the report? Forgive me if I am just a.Iittle sceptical of that answer. What about the OECD figures themselves? The minister is finding this extremely funny. Is this the way she administers her department-to laugh? ,)",24
125,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am laughing at you.,24
126,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Minister, do you really think nobody else is laughing? Turn around and have a look at your back bench. You are pathetic! If this is your answer to Australia's environmental standards-to sit and gigglethen I am ashamed, and I am ashamed for my country, that we have such a poor minister. Minister, how come you did not know about these figures when these figures have been produced by the OECD every second year since 1985? Why have you not addressed them? I knew about these figures and I addressed them in parliament in 1991, but you have yet to address them. Let us look at Australia's standing on some other issues. What about the minister's famed lead strategy? The minister pointed out quite rightly to the Australian parliament and the Australian people this year that we had a problem with lead in the environment. This was going to be the minister's great environmental stand. It was going to be what she was going to do to save Australian children as a result of the problems we had. What the minister failed to say was that Australian standards compared with the rest of the world were absolutely abysmal and had been abysmal for lO years under this government. This government has failed to reach even the minimum standard that other countries have reached in previous years. Let us look at Australia's lead standards compared with other countries",24
127,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I know. That's why we're fixing it.,25
128,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are not fixing it; that is what I am coming to. In some parts of Australia we have lead levels of 0.8. What are they in other countries? In Japan and Canada, there is no lead in petrol. In the United it is 0.026. In other countries, it is O.IS. But what do we have in Australia? We have lead levels as high as 0.6. Let us look at the government's policy. What was decided by the government, as announced by this minister? It was decided that the price of leaded petrol would go up Sc a litre-that was going to solve the problem. Minister, why do you think the poorer families of Australia actually have older cars? Is it because they prefer to drive a 1983 Commodore Or could it be that they just cannot afford to change? That is why the extra 5c a litre was unacceptable to the lower income earners and you were forced to withdraw it. For somebody who cares so much for the people of Australia, how much money did the minister actually put aside in the budget to address the lead problem? Of the $1 billionodd that she would have got from the increase of Sc per litre in the price of petrol, she allocated $lOO,OOO to develop a lead strategy. It was only when the Senate addressed the same problem that the amount for a lead strategy was raised to $4 million. What has the minister's answer been since then? The minister has come up with her old strategy of a public education campaign. We had one last year and we have another one this year. Let us have a look at it. How, according to this minister, are we going to solve the lead problem in Australia? We are going to educate the public. The advertisement that I am holding in my hand at the moment is the type of education we are giving the public: telling them that older cars can take unleaded petrol. Let us have a look at this advertisement. What are t-e makes of the older cars that Australians drive? I believe they would drive Commodores, Kingswoods and Falcons. Would opposition members not agree with my estimation of what people with older cars, and who cannot afford newer ones, drive? Yet this list does not mention the Commodore, the Kingswood or the Falcon because, to put it simply, they cannot take unleaded petrol. If they can take it, why are they not listed in the minister's advertiseme-t? There is something even better, and that is States, your recommendation that older cars use super-unleaded petrol. That is a joke, is it not, minister? You are asking the person with a Toyota Corona to pay lOc extra per litre. That person might be saying, 'I cannot afford the margarine or the bread because I am out of a job, but that's okay. We'll take the old car down and fill it up with petrol that costs lOc a litre extra'. Minister, I have come to the end of the MPI today and I have not even addressed your incompetence in the area of World Heritage and how you have turned World Heritage in this country into an absolute farce and a joke. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has ignored the sports rorts affair, showing his contempt for standards of ministerial responsibility and integrity, but he cannot continue to protect the Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories. Her record condemns her and it condemns this government. This government and this minister have used the environment as a political tool. Their policies have been high in rhetoric and totally devoid of substance. If the Prime Minister takes his responraised sibility seriously, he must dismiss this truly incompetent minister. (TIme expired)",25
129,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Canberra-Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women) (3.10 p.m.)-I have heard some hypocrisy while in this parliament but nothing beats the speech of the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). In the 11 months she has been in this House, although her shadow portfolio is the environment, the two questions she has asked me have been about sport. We have never had any major policy initiative from her at all; we have had comments on OECD studies. Let me tell honourable members something about these reports from the OECD. The Commonwealth has been open and .is very proud of its achievements on the provision of data on the environment We responded with over 30 pages to the OECD, mainly on forests, fauna and protected areas. We came out extremely ,well on the areas of natural environment because on many occasions over the years this government has acted against the states and against the views of the opposipoint tion to protect World Heritage areas. Those opposite hypocritically stand up here and ask, why we do not provide statistics, when our statistics on protection of the natural environment are second to none. Had those opposite been in government, do they think that the Kakadu would have been saved? There would have been logging in the wet tropics of Queensland and the Franklin Dam would have existed-the Franklin would have been dammed. That is the hypocrisy of the opposition. We are doing extremely well internationally and domestically in protecting the natural environment because we have made a standwithout the support of those opposite on those occasions. We have protected World Heritage areas, and I am proud of it. While I have been the minister, we have added Shark Bay and Fraser Island to the list and we have an inquiry into Shoal water Bay. I am very proud of our achievements. The second matter the honourable member relates to another area of statistics asked for. She was correct 'in trying to get information on' issues such as waste, water and air. She may not understand that in the history of this country we happen - to have states. States have been managing gm;bage for a very long time. The federal government has not been involved in those areas. TheParliamentary Secretary to the Minister. for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Crosio), who is in the chamber, was Minister for Water Resources when she was in the New South Wales government. The states have looked after the issues of water, air and garbage. I do not think it is good enough for all the states to go their own way and flot have standards. The reason for the information coming from Australia being quite disjointed is that each state has to provide the information. Knowing that there is a gap there, I decided that when I became minister I would take national leadership on this matter and get standards established on air, water quality and the management of waste in this nation, for the first time ever. '  of order. My colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh was called to order by the Speaker for not speaking into the microphone. I· notice that the minister is not speaking into the microphone, and I ask you to call her to order.",26
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.· The minister will continue.,26
131,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What is the attitude of the opposition to the view of establishing standards for Australia? Yesterday, the' shadow minister for the environment put out a statement. She said that, if Western Australia does not agree to go along with the establishment of a national standards council, forget it. Let the states have a veto. Well, I will not. The difference between those opposite and us is that we will take national leadership and we will not let the states dominate environmental policy in this country. That is the fundamental difference between us and them. At the end of the day, they will kowtow to the states on every occasion. Whether it be on the natural environment, the brown agenda or lead, those opposite will kowtow to the states and we will not. That is the fundamental difference between us and them. That is the reason that today the Franklin is saved. That is the reason that today we have the World Heritage areas of northern Queensland. That is the reason that today we have Shark Bay. That is the reason that today we have Fraser Island. We will not kowtow to the states and we will not do it in relation to Lake Eyre either. Nor will I allow it to happen in Western Australia. We are about to get involved in a major dispute with the Western Australian government on the protection of a wetland area called. Creery. Has the honourable member for Hindmarsh ever heard of that? What is her view about that? Will she stand up to the Western Australian government? The answer is no. We do try to get cooperation with the states and on the lead strategy we have done that. I am very thankful for the cooperation that I have received from the states. But let me tell honourable members that, if I had not dragged New South Wales in screaming and yelling, we would not have agreement today on a reduction of lead in' the atmosphere. The industry, community groups and I sat down at a round table in Parliament House and dragged the states· screaming into a lead reduction strategy. It is true that lead levels Australia are too high. We had to work cooperatively with the oil companies to bring those levels down, and we are doing that. What is the honourable member's policy in relation to this? She says that she is going to pay everybody to get the old cars off the road. I wonder whether the shadow Treasurer actually understands that policy. We will continue to have very firm environmental policies, whether they be in relation to lead, whether they be in relation to the Creery wetlands, or whether they be in relation to other measures to protect Australia's waterways. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is about time that the federal government took a stronger role with the states in relation to water. I will do it. Will she? I do not believe that she will. We try a cooperl\tive approach and I think that is the way we should go. In certain states, particularly Queensland now, I get a lot of cooperation. But I did not get any cooperation from the Bjelke-Petersen government. It does not seem that I am going to get very much cooperation from the, Court government in Western Australia. We have seen its attitude on Mabo and we are seeing its attitude on the environment almost on a daily basis. At the end of the day, I give a commitment to this House and to this parliament that I will use whatever powers the Commonwealth has to ensure the protection of Australia's natural environment and our air and water. I will use whatever powers we have. Will opposition members? Will they stand up to the states? The answer is no. They have not done before and they will not now. Our record on the environment is a very proud one for me. As I go through the wet tropics of Queensland, I am very proud of the achievement of Labor governments. Sure, there will be battles. This portfolio is full of battles, whether they be in relation to the forests,_ whether they be in relation to trying to get national standards. But I will lead that national debate and, at the end of the day, I will use every single power we have to ensure protection of our environment. Members of the opposition have some very interesting views, as we saw reflected in the in shadow minister's speech a moment ago with her garbled message about lead. She admitted that lead is a problem in the atmosphere but her solution was to get rid of leaded petrol. We would all like to do that, but her view is that we do it quickly. Mrs Gallus-What about MTBE?",26
132,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What about MTBE? A million dollars is being spent on looking at alternatives. Does the honourable member know what sort of damage MTBE would do to the environment? Has she tested that? The answer is no. It is a typical situation of talk first, ask questions second; harm the environment without testing it. Is that her policy? In the last few months we have had some very interesting statements.",27
133,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Put the honourable member for Hindmarsh out of her misery. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER"""":""'Order! The Leader of the House will resume his' seat. There are far too many interjections on both sides of the chamber and, too much extraneous noise. The minister will continue.",28
134,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the last month we have heard some very interesting comments from the shadow minister for the environment, but I would just like to take honourable members through some titbits of what the opposition will probably be developing as, its policy. First of all, she putout a statement saying they wanted the inclusion of golf courses in the national reserve system. I am sure the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) will enjoy that. The shadow minister wanted special licences to allow four-wheel drivers access to all wilderness areas-I suppose, she has been talking to the New South Wales Nats about that. She wanted the removal of the sales tax on new cars and the tax on unleaded petrol-I hope she has discussed that with the shadow Treasurer. She wants legislation to immediately remove lead from petrol and to provide funds for drivers of older cars so that everyone can buy new cars. This is a lovely fairyland. If only we could! The shadow minister should close her eyes and think of what she would like to wish for next. That is the wish list, but what is the reality? The reality is much closer to the policy opposition took to the last election. the reality-a little bit different from the dreams of Cinderella. It is going to give the states veto over national environmental policy-that is' its first policy, the took to the last election. I' do not know whether there has been a change ,since then, we have not heard anything from them except these little statements from the shadow minister. The next policy it has is mining in national instead of talkingparks; of course, it also includes uranium mining as a very important part of that policy and it also has nuclear power stations. Now I think there has· been a change of policy in relation to nuclear power stations. The fundamental difference between them and us is that they will never stand up to the states. That was clearly indicated yesterday. We have worked with the states for two years to try to get agreement on developing standards for this nation-one environment, one lot of standards. Can we get Western Australia to join us? We are trying, but Western Australia said that it does not want to be part of Australia; it wants to go its own way. And the shadow minister put out a statement saying that, if Western Australia cannot join, it will not work; therefore, do not go ahead with it. Well, we are going ahead. The rest of the Commonwealth-the remaining states and territories-are joining. Where is the legislation? It will be introduced into the parliament in the next session. It is going to the heads of government at their very next mel'<ting and let us hope that you use your powers in a constructive way to get yourself over to Western Australia, and have a talk to Premier Court, if he will see you, and tell him that it would be very useful if he could join the rest of Australia in the protection of one environment. Then I heard these smart alec comments about the bushfires. I was quite horrified. Did you ring Chris Hartcher and ask him what I did to assist him in relation to the bush fires? Mrs Gallus interjecting",28
135,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I did not grandstand about our role in the bushfires; I did not put out a the statement like you did bagging people. What Listen to I did instead-',28
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Hindmarsh will cease interjecting and the minister will address her policy it remarks through the chair.,28
137,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"was go along and see my colleague the New South Wales minister for the environment and ask him what help he wanted. He has given me some proposals and I will be assisting him. Why did you not, .",28
138,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of. order. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have already asked the minister once to address her remarks through the chair; she chose to ignore that. Will you make sure she understands.",28
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The minister will address her remarks through the chair.,29
140,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I simply ask the shadow minister for the environment: before she makes a statement why does she not check her facts? She should have asked Chris Hartcher what role I played, had I seen him and had I offered him assistance. I suggest that she take the advice that she gave to Bronwyn Bishop a couple of weeks ago when she said: It's very easy to make glib statements ... It's harder to know those policy areas in depth and make a contribution knowing all the facts. I suggest, before she speaks next time, that she actually learn a few facts.",29
141,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Today we have before the parliament a matter of public importance which is about the total failure of the government to adequately address key environmental issues in Australia. I must say that it is interesting to listen to the Minister for the Environmef!t, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in regard to federal relationships with the states and the role that they play. I want to remind tl}e House that certainly we work within a federal system in Australia but, when the previous Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, was trying to ensure the success of this relationship so that we could have a united approach to environmental matters and a few others, what did this minister say about those attempts to get a better relationship? She said it was crass politics. The minister said it was crass politics to try to bring a united approach to many of these n-tional affairs. At that stage she was talking wIth the environmentalists. She said that trying to improve communication within statefederal relationships to get a national approach to many of these issues was crass politics. I remind the House that what she was really interested in at that stage was internal pa-y politics before national policy or national ISSUes. That is typical· of this minister. During this debate I want to mention a couple of things which are typical of this government and are very well illustrated by this minister. The first thing that is symptomatic of this government is that it hides from public accountability. Secondly, it is a poor manager of taxpayers' funds, particularly sports funds. Today we learn from this report, put out by a group from the United Kingdom, that the government is also a very poor manager of the environment. It is not the coalition or any state government that is saying this; it is an independent OECD report commenting about Australia's achievement in regard to the environment. The report says that, out of the 21 OECD countries, Australa lot is-after 10 years of this government, which has trumpeted what it has achieved for the environment-is ranked 18th. This is after 10 years of Labor Party government! This minister is more interested in outward appearance than in real substance. I remind honourable members of an environmental kit that was put out in mid-1992. First the kit was endorsed by the minister. Then she decided that she had better disown what was in the kit because it was obviously totally unacceptable. Then she said, 'I deny it. I don't endorse it'. But what was on the cover? Her signature and her photograph. Of course, the substance did not matter. That is also the situation in regard to the urban environment in Australia today. From this OECD report we get a very clear indication that Australia is failing dismally compared with many other countries. To put that into perspective, I note that countries - uch as Portugal and Spain are doing very well. During this period, not only did we not go ahead; in some of these indicators we went backwards. Who was in government during this time? The Labor Party-and this minister is responsible for this situation. We have gone backwards since 1985 in regard to several of these indicators. I think we ought to run through them again so· that we are clear on where Australia stands. In regard to carbon dioxide emissions, ,the report said that the United States is the highest emitter, with Canada and Australia also causing high per capita emissions. Under the minister's proposals and policies we have not been able to drop emissions. She said that she had firm environmental policies, but the fact is that they are never put into action. If t-ey are firm policies, why are results not showmg up in this independent DECO report? There are no runs on the board. As I said, there is a very poor level of public accountability. It is typical of this government that it does not want to account for its policies. Here we see a total lack of accountability with regard to its environmental policies. We already know that the minister is interested only in the outside covers of reports. With regard to the sports rorts, the head of her department said, 'But we are not sure that they will respond sensibly'. Honourable members will remember that comment from yesterday",29
142,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He is not the head of the department; he is the first assistant secretary.,30
143,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will put that straight then: he is the first assistant secretary for sport and recreation. But what are the details of the opening section of the DECO report? It is headed 'Some problems with the selected indicators'. It then lists two countries that to give information, stating: Ireland and Australia did not provide data to the DECO for several indicators even though such data were officially and quite easily obtainable. For three months, this minister has tried to cover. up with regard to the sports rorts. Australia, it seems, is trying to withhold information from the DECO. Certainly, we did not provide the information. That is not something that the coalition is saying; that is something that the DECO report is saying. It is saying that it was not provided with information that was readily available here in Australia. This minister and her department chose not to provide it. I emphasise the lack of accountability demonstrated by this minister and her desire to cover up things. She does not expose information nor is she open about things, and she shows a clear lack of accountability. Since the sports rorts debate has been going on for quite a while, I thought that I would check out a few facts concerning Tasmania. The results were interesting. Prior to the last election, the Liberal Party held four seats in Tasmania",30
144,Mrs KELLY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order regarding relevance. This is supposed to be an MPI on the environment. Do those opposite not have enough details or policies to conduct a lO-minute debate on the environment?",30
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member for Braddon will get to the subject of the MPI.,30
146,Mr MILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is a total lack of accountability by this minister in so many areas of her portfolio. In Tasmania, one Labor electorate got $550,OOO-odd, while the other electorates within that state got less in total than that one electorate. That is the reality of it, yet this minister wants to obfuscate and skirt around the issues. After 10 years in office, this government holds up an in-ernational report that states that, with regard to 11 major environmental indicators, we come 18th out of the 21 DECO countries. Yet this minister fronts up here and says, 'Look, we have a beautiful record'. How is that so? The simple answer is that this fail minister is all show and no substance. As we have seen in so many other areas, she does not follow through on detail. With regard to the environment, we now have concrete evidence that this government's policies, including the policies under this minister, are an abysmal failure.",30
147,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is it any wonder that the Australian Labor Party has won five successive federal elections? The way the opposition is performing, particularly in bringing this MPI into the parliament today, it is inevitable that we will win six elections in a row. The opposition not only has no shame but also is totally incompetent and totally hypocritical when it comes t9 the environment. In researching what I would say today, I came across a cartoon from Patrick Cook which sums it all up. The cartoon is about the conservatives on conservation and it shows a worker with a chainsaw confronting a greenie. The caption reads, 'What about sustainable rape, loot and pillage?'. Nothing has changed. It sums up the conservative policy when it comes to the environment. What do those opposite do? They do not use Commonwealth powers. They come into the Commonwealth parliament and advocate states' rights. In relation to the environment, whom do they hand over to? The states. There are plenty of quotes on the record. We cannot forget the Liberal Party's failure in 1983 to protect the Franklin River, resulting in the election of the Labor government. Fraser handed' over the Commonwealth's rights to the control of the territorial sea to state control. On the opposition's general policy, in Tasmania on 23 October 1992 the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) stated: We've' taken the view that onenvirbnmental matters we look to the states first The Australian Conservation Foundation analysed answers given to 50 questions put to all parties prior to the 1993 federal election. The coalition's environmental policies were placed last, some measures being described as disastrous. The ACF said that the coalition's answers 'reflect a poor environmental stance'. The ACF's chief concern was the coalition's refusal to override state decisions concerning the environment. What are those opposite saying here today in their MPI? That the government is not doing enough to protect the' environment? This is what their leader had tb say on 24 September 1991 in an address at a' leader's lunch in Adelaide, and he has repeated these sorts of statements in recent years. Is he criticising us for where we stand on green issues? What he says is very relevant today. His words were: I don't mind taking flack on a daily basis. In fact, I am getting used to it. We know where the flack is coming from today. During the Gulf War it was called friendly fire. It is not so friendly fire that is being directed to the Leader of the Opposition now, because it is coming from his own front bench and his own back bench. Members of the opposition are absolutely determined to drag him down before the next election. Why? Because they got done like a dinner at the last election. We won the election before last in 1990 when the environment was the issueMrs Gallus- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not think this is addressing the issue of the environment, which is the subject of the matter of public importance today.",30
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)The MPI today has been a rather wide ranging debate, but I would hope that the honourable member for Banks would be getting back to the substance of the matter of public importance.",31
149,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition continued: But it would be nice if one or two other people actually stood up from time to time and said, now that's right, that's what has got to be done in this country. Otherwise you can continue with the sort of system you had where the Government has pulled everything to itself and governed in the interests of a few mates-a few leaders of the green movement, or the Aboriginal heritage movement; or the ACTU ... Mrs Gallus.,- Mr Deputy Speaker, on another point of order: again, this is not addressing the subject of the MPI. What the Leader of the Opposition said about the Prime Minister is hardly relevant to the topic. Perhaps the honourable member could find something on which to defend his minister instead of going so far afield.",31
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Banks will get back to the substance of the MPI.,31
151,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a pity that thehonoura.ble member for Hindmarsh did not read her MPI that she wrote out and sent. It states: The total failure of the government to adequately addresS key environmental issues in Australia. The word 'government' includes the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), government policy and its history. What does the honourable member for Hindmarsh want to do? Does she want to talk about last week, the last two weeks, or does. she want to go back even further? I want to talk about the record of the conservative parties, because it is abysmal. I remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. That is what those opposite . are. doing and that. is the greatest act of hypocrisy. What we have here is a concerted campaign by the opposition along the lines of a MCCarthy-style witch-hunt. But those opposite are so incompetent that there is no substance to it. It is ring-a-ring-a-rosy. They raised one MPI yesterday and another one today. I wonder what tomorrow's MPI will be about? Will it target the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) again? Why are those opposite doing this? It is because they lack substance and policy. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has been running around a great deal. Frankly, I think he is just a second-rate lawyer. He comes into this parliament and makes all sorts of allegations, but where is he when it com(fS to the crunch? Why is he not asking questions on the House of Representatives committee looking into this matter? He got done like a dinner by Kerry Packer during the print media inquiry and is too afraid to front up on this inquiry. The honourable member for Hindmarsh should explain to the House why a coalition government would have· slashed funding to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. The Leader of the Opposition seems to view environmentalists as an enemy that must be destroyed. In an address to the Business Council of Australia in October 1991, he stated: It is going to take a long time, I think, to reeducate almost a whole generation of Australians about the nature of the balance that has got struck between the environment and development. It won't be easy, in my position when you visit schools on a regular basis you see just how well entrenched is the green movement, at the level of our children. That is the approach those opposite take. Considering their track record over the last decade, it is an absolute act of hypocrisy for them to come into this parliament to debate an MPI such as this. What else do those opposite want to do? Their policy on nuclear enrichment, amongst other· things, changes from one day to the next. That is what we should be looking at under the teons of this MPI - something that has not been addressed at all by the opposition speakers. All they have brought up today is bile and innuendo. But where are the facts? Those opposite have had their chance and have not got past first base because they just ain't got it. They handed us the 1983 election on a platter and they have continued to give us every election since because, especially when it comes to the environment, there is no comparison between the parties. It is chalk and cheese. Is it any wonder then that some members of the opposition are reluctant to assume the mantle of leader for the next election. It is a poisoned chalice-certainly in relation to the environment. Only recently, they let Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia, run their agenda on Mabo. Where was their national perspective in relation to that issue? What cant! What hypocrisy! Those opposite should all run for state parliament since that is where they think the power resides. Mrs Gallus- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The subject of the debate is the government's record on the environment. We would love to hear whether the honourable member could possibly defend that record.",31
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will resume her seat.,32
153,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Over the last decade, the Labor government has made many significant environmental decisions. It can be said with absolute certainty that, had Labor not been in government over the last 10 years, the Franklin River would have been dammed, Kakadu to be would have been mined, Coronation Hill would have been mined, and the rainforests of the wet tropics would have been logged. So let those opposite keep it up because I have never seen a more incompetent bunch in a shadow ministry-a ministry that grows like Topsy. If this is the best they can do, it is all over, Red Rover.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1993-94 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",32
155,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, firstly, that was a terrific speech by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I congratulate her; it was well done. Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1993-94, together with Appropriation Bill (No.4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the additional estimates for 1993-94. In these bills, parliament is asked to approprirepresents ate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1993-94 under Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. The additional appropriations in these three bills total $710 million; $542.1 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No.3), $165.9 million in Appropriation Bill (No- 4) and $2 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 1993-94, reflecting the government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. The savings in the appropriations, amounting to $545.5 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document Statement of Sav1993 ings Expected in Annual Appropriations, which has been distributed to honourable members. After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $164.5 million in appropriations for 199394, an increase of 0.5 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1993-94 budget. This compares with the level of supplementation sought in 1992-93 of $1,185.6 million, an increase of 3.2 per cent on that year's budget appropriations, and is consistent with the downwards revision of outlays growth for 1993-94, as announced recently by the Treasurer (Mr Willis). This lower growth in estimated outlays reflects the continuing strength of the Australian economy. I tum now to the main areas for which the government seeks additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1993-94 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the government. Although the budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, it is not practice to appropriate these amounts at budget time. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from salary increases. The amount of $150.2 million is included in Appropriation Bill (No.3) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies, including the costs associated with agreed wage and salary increases. This an increase of 1.3 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No.1). Other factors affecting running costs include transfers between financial years and some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced. Gross additional estimates of $175.7 million are sought for the defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No.3). This figure includes: . $88.6 million for defence facilities, largely due to the payment of the defence. capital contribution for the Russell Offices redevelopment; higher than previously anticipated expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation in Sydney; and costs associated with the connection of sewerage systems at Holdsworthy/Moorebank; and · $71.7 million for defence housing, reflecting advance rental payments to the Defence Housing Authority, the DHA, and an additional capital subvention for the DHA. The increases have been offset by reductions elsewhere in the Defence appropriations, giving a net increase of some $139 million. In addition, Appropriation Bill (No.3) includes provision for: · an increase of $49.3 million for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry, reflecting the government's commitment to assist the long-term unemployed to return to work; · $42; 1 . million for child-care fee relief, which reflects growth in average fee relief and in the number of private sector places; · $15.2 million for payment to Australian Hearing Services, mainly due to higher than anticipated demand following the extension of pensioner fringe benefits from 1 April 1993; and · $14.6 million for the. care 6f veterans in non-departmental institutions, reflecting increased patient numbers following the sale of the Repatriation General Hospital Hollywood in Western Australia. The balance of some $95 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No.3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies. These additional appropriations are required to meet undertakings made by the government since the budget, as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other economic parameter changes since the budget was prepared. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1993-94 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure arid recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",33
156,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1993-94, appropriations totalling $165.9 million-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No.2) 1993-94-are sought for capital works and services; payments to or for the states, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; advances and loans; and for other services. The proposed appropriations are required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that act. The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No.2) 1993-94 include: A $50 million grant to New South Wales for capital works at Homebush Bay to assist in the infrastructure for the staging of the year 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney; $25.2 million for compensation for defendants and others in the Midford Paramount case: as an interim measure, these payments were made in 1993 from the Advance to the Minister for Finance; $20.7 million in additional funding for the states under the rural adjustment scheme; $8.9 million for the development of a package of measures to reform the private health sector; $7.3 million in additional assistance to those affected by the New South Wales bushfires; $7.3 million to ATSIC for assistance in the preparation and presentation of native title claims; and . $5.4 million for payments to the states and mainland territories to reduce the waiting time for elective surgery. The remaining $41.1 million included in Appropriation Bill (No.4) comprises minor increases in a number of programs for a range of portfolios. I commend the bill to the House.

158,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (3.56 p.m.)I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca). Mr . Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). This is a particularly difficult piece of legislation to deal with, because it is an omnibus bill. It therefore contains a number of provisions which, intellectually, are difficult, to link together. I suppose the only common factor is that they all relate to or arise out of the Social Security Act and, therefore, are in one bill. The social security legislation covers a wide range of issues and the provisions that we are dealing with here are therefore equally wide ranging. In assisting the members of the House to understand the approach that I will take to this bill, I intend to go through a number of the items, particularly those on which we will concur with the government's views, and support the legislation. I will then identify several matters in relatiori to why we cannot support the proposals and flag that at the committee stage we will be opposing certain parts of the bill. There will be other matters that we will seek to have referred to a committee-in the Senate, these matters will be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They are matters which I think do raise important questions on the application of the Social Security Act in the context of some wider principles in relation to statutory interReference pretation and the way in which the government might proceed with particular initiatives that are contained in this legislation. I believe it is more important, when we are dealing with issues which are so discrete, that we deal with them as separate items of legislation rather than as an omnibus bill of this sort. The first matter that I will address relates to the provisions dealing with the mobility allowance. The explanatory memorandum tells us that, from the day of royal assent, the qualification conditions for a mobility allowance will be extended to allow the mobility allowance to be paid to people with a disability who are unable to use public transport, are undertaking jobsearch activities and are under a competitive employment placement and training program. It becomes apparent that the very reason we are amending this bill in this context,for a benefit which will apply to some 400 people, is that it was largely administrative oversight that led to a situation in which, previously, these people had not been covered. It was clearly intended that they should be covered and that those who were embarking upon training programs to make themselves able to enter competitive employment ought to be covered. Those who were already in employment are so covered. It is quite clear that the mobility allowance was intended to apply. Obviously, we support this initiative-though it is not an initiative; it is a measure taken a result of an oversight in that it was intended that these people should hav- been covered before. .Another amendment relates to the provisions dealing with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal stay orders. This will amend the way in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions are dealt with. It reverses a situation which arose where the AAT could order a stay of a decision under review where the Social Security Appeals Tribunal had already affirmed the department's decision. In a situation where a stay is operating, I assume that a person may continue to receive benefits or payments. In some circumstances, the purpose of an appeal could lead to a situation where moneys would continue to be paid. This amendment will create a new category of recoverable debt so that debts arising from where a person benefits from a stay that was not justified-the decision goes against them-are recoverable by the Crown. It seems to me that that is a proper approach to take where it is clear from the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal that the benefit might not be being paid properly and· that one ought not to continue to get the benefit of that by pursuing appeals. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills looked at this matter and raised one point of concern, and that was that the way in which the bill was first drafted might have meant that the government could recover debts where an appeal was already under way and the stay had been granted and, therefore, it would have a retrospective effect. With the advice of the Senate committee, the government has come to the view-the opposition would have supported this advice-that it should not have a retrospective application. The government will be moving an amendment today. I am glad it is-it saves me doing so-and the opposition will support that. The principal act is to be amended to allow a widow B pension to be payable in circumstances where the person is already a beneficiary. The amendment is obviating the necessity of that person having to make a further proper claim in order to be eligible for the as widow B pension. That already happens with the sole supporting parent payments. It seems obvious that those arrangements, which do not require the provision of any additional information but merely the lodgement of a form, should not deny anybody the entitlement from the date it might otherwise have been due simply because a person had failed to lodge a form which would not have provided any new information to the department. Obviously, the opposition will not oppose this amendment. On retirement villages, the explanatory memorandum states: The Principal Act will be amended to clarify the existing retirement village definition. This amendment aims at preserving the original intention underlying the definition. It ensures that accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at an age which is more than 55 years is treated in the same way as accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at least 55 years of age, that is, as accommodation in a retirement village. That sounds unduly complex, but again the amendment arises because something needed to be clarified. It is only a minor amendment, and we will not be opposing it. It demonstrates that the legislation which first dealt with this matter was deficient. We are now having to come back to make amendments to correct another oversight. Mr Sciacca-It is a decision of the rehabilitation commission. MrRUDDOCK-That is what it involves' that is what the explanatory memorandusays. More effort ought to be put into getting it right from the beginning. Mr Sciacca interjecting",35
159,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary can advise me later on that. I welcome his constructive advice when it is offered, but I have no intention of picking it up at this stage. The new international social security agreement between Australia and Italy is also endorsed. Mr Sciacca-A good one.",37
160,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The parliamentary secretary says that this is a good one. I notice that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) himself took the opportunity of going to Italy to sign it. MrSciacca-It was very important; it was worth $350 million.,37
161,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary says that it was very important that the minister went. It was about the only purpose that the minister had in making a trip to continental Europe. It is interesting. This social security agreement was a prototype and it has been in place for a long time. The parliamentary secretary says that this is an important agreement which will save $350 million. I do not find that figure in the explasions. natory memorandum. This amendment arises because governments before have signed agreements with Italy to provide access to social security payments and this is an updating of that agreement. The explanatory memorandum does not mention $350 million. The financial implications of this agreement will be $0.2 million in 1994-95 and $1.7 million in 1995-96. Mr Sciacca-That's now. I am talking about how much they bring into this country. Mr Ruddock-We are not demurring, but let us not have this hype that we have some great new agreement.. The government sent officers overseas. I have an interesting schedule here outlining the number of visits that were necessary to undertake these negotia $21,000 or so each between September and October last year to negotiate agreements. Mr Godfrey was sent to do much the same thing, and he spent $10,000. Mr Stewart was sent over, but he spent a good deal less-only $8,000. One would wonder why, in the modem world of communications, we need so many officers travelling overseas in the space of one year to negotiate updates to an agreement of this sort when we could deal with these matters in a sensible way. I do not intend to complain about that matter either. We are supporting the incorporation of the agreement. Let us wait until we get to the matters about which there is some element of disagreement. Mr Sciacca-We'll run out of time.",37
162,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I can assure the parliamentary secretary that I will not ron out of time; we have a committee stage yet. I take the opportunity to deal with the matter of confidentiality. The explanatory memorandum explains that we are extending the definition of 'protected information', introducing anew offence relating to the deliberate use of protected information obtained innocently and rationalising related sections. There are some other minor consequential amendments as well. Without going into any detail in relation to this matter, let me simply say that the opposition will support the confidentiality proviThey are a move in the right direction. However, it needs to be said that the Department of Social Security has not gone without a good deal of critical comment, particularly from the Auditor-General and the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, which have identified the department as one place where information has been released for unauthorised purposes. According to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, information has been sold by some officers of the department; provided incorrectly to state and local government agencies through a legitimate arrangement known as a client confirmation service; and, in some cases, obtained by deception over the telephone. The Auditor-General made it very clear that there needs to be a strengthening of confidentiality measures. He found the need for a far more effective approach for clients who require enhanced protection. The Auditor-General sees considerable risks in a department with some 23,000 staff having access to personal client details: Many of the staff have the capacity to obtain a' print-out of those details. The Auditor-General raised a very interesting prospect of trailing the computer system so that the people accessing information can be later identifie4 if it is found that information has been improperly disclosed. It seems to me, as it did to the Auditor General, that audit trailing could provide evidence of unauthorised access to information and could be a powerful deterrent from unauthorised disclosure. He noted that audit trailing has not been reviewed since 1985 and that technological changes may now have made it economically feasible and technologically possible. Those are matters that need to be addressed by the government. At this stage, we will be supporting this legislation. Although it is really only a token measure for dealing with the major problems identified by the Auditor-General and the Independent Commission Against Corruption, even tokens are welcome. The opposition has given very serious consideration to whether or not the measures dealing with the removal of the IS-day sitting requirement for ministerial determinations on public interest disclosures should be supported but, on balance, we will support the measure. However, I wish to highlight a potential problem which I have already raised in discussions with the parliamentary secretary's officers. The capacity for parliamentary review can be lost if there is a determination to disclose information in a particular case where the parliament considers it inappropriate. As the legislation currently operates, one would be in a position to disclose that information immediately the determination is made, even though at a later time, when disallowance can be looked at, the parliament may regard the disclosure as inappropriate. Essentially having taken this matter on trust, if the opposition finds that there has been some error of judgment in relation to it,we will come back to it at a later date. It is a trust given that the department acts responsibly and properly, but it needs to be acted upon with appropriate care. I move on now to other matters of concern to me. The first relates to the value of assets used in primary production. The explanatory memorandum states: The Principal Act will be amended to give effect to the original intention that where a liability exists in relation to an asset that is in any part exempt for the purposes of the assets test, then the apportionment rule will apply. This measure will commence on the day of Royal Assent. This is a difficult issue-I have had some difficulty understanding it myself-but, put simply, this measure relates to a person who owns a property used for primary production but which may have on it a house not used for primary production. In calculating the value of assets used for primary production, the house is excluded and only the assets used for primary production are taken into account. However, when money is borrowed, it is borrowed on both the house and the assets used for the primary production because the bank says, in effect, 'We want the money to be secured against all of the property'. So the financial institutions put those conditions on lending. The government now wants to look at the debt and apportion some of it to the assets used for primary production and some to the house. Of course, that will increase the value of the assets used in primary production, thereby excluding some people from obtaining benefits-which is precisely the purpose of the provision. While I understand the government's intention-it argues that it was always its intention-it is rather interesting to note from the explanatory memorandum that the government sees this particular measure as being generous to people involved in primary industry. I must say that some of my colleagues in rural seats were surprised to hear that. Colleagues who have taken an interest in these matters find the notion of this being a generous test an extraordinary proposition. They see it as being a very onerous test, particularly in relation to the circumstances in which to ensure many farmers have found themselvesblighted by flood or drought. Some have had to seek assistance from social security and have found these tests very successful in making them ineligible for benefits because they suggest that they are asset rich, even though they may have next to no income as a result of drought or flood. "" Mr Dobie-And cannot sell their properties.",37
163,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"That, is so; the owners cannot realise on them. Those sorts of things are part and parcel of the hardships faced by those in primary industry. In relation to these matters, the opposition has taken the view that we should be more generous in the way in which properties are tested for asset purposes. M:r Sciacca-We are very compassionate in these matters.",39
164,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In that case, the parliamentary secretary may care to support our amendment because, unlike the government, we do not see the current tests as being particularly g-nerous. In fact, we see them creating enormous hardship. In relation to the passage of these particular provisions, the government will not have our cooperation; they will be opposed by the opposition. As the explanatory memorandum makes clear, the government has two other matters that it intends to deal with in the course of these amendments. The first is in relation to certain life interests created by wills. The government wants to treat them as an assessable asset. The explanatory memorandum states: From the day of Royal Assent, the Principal Act will be amended to provide that certain assets are not to be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets under the assets test on pensions and benefits. In particular, the v,alue of certain interests will not be disregarqeq in calculating the value of a person's assets. It goes on to say: The amendments are intended to ensure ,that people cannot gain an advantage under the assets test by converting an absolute intereSt in property to a life interest only. ' There is a second matter relating to investment income. The explanatory memorandum states: The Principal Act currently allows the assessable period of a client to be taken into account when the client realises a 'saved' non-superannuation investment. It goes on to say: The Principal Act will be amended, from the day of Royal Assent to ensure that the assessable period of a non-client partner is also taken into account. Let me just make the point-this will not come as a great surprise to the governmentthat these amendments will not have our support. It is not that they might not have our support in the context of a thorough review of assets and income testing. As I mentioned yesterday in the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3), a review has' been flagged, but the government seems to be going slow on it. While that is happening, there will be no cooperation from this side of the House on the ,passage of amendments' that are designed to enhance, assist or in any,way supplement or add to the assets and income testing regime. Our view is that the regime is deficient particularly in the context of managed investments and the unrealised capital gains test that is applied to shares. Until those matters have been thoroughly investigated and we have a thoroughgoing review of assets and income testing, the opposition will not be cooperating in further modification of legislation on these matters. In the few minutes that I need to deal with other matters I will not traverse that point any further. I will come back to it in the committee stage. Life interests are the reason we will refer this matter to another place, to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I do not know the basis on life which the department's practices are carried out. It may be that they were properly carried out in this maUer. The advice in the explanatory memorandum is that the government has already been applying this test on assets even though it is not part of the law. I do riot know on what basis that is happening. In my view, we cannot impose a test on people's assets if, at a later point, we come to the parliament and say, 'We need now to validate this legislation to ensure that the test we are applying is a proper tesf. It is a very serious matter if the department has been applying a test for which there is no proper legislative basis. That is a matter that needs to be more fully investigated and is a matter of very serious moment. The final matter I will address in the few moments that are left to me relates to the penalty interest charge. The explanatory memorandum states: The administrative charge currently applicable under the Principal Act in relation to certain debts will be abolished. The administrative charge will be replaced with a penalty interest charge that can be applied to any debt owed under the Act if (and only it) the person who owes the debt is not a current client and refuses to enter into an agreement to repay the debt or if, having entered into such an agreement, the person defaults on the agreement. The government hopes to make quite substantial savings from this measure. In fact, in the context of this bill, it is the one area in which there will be substantial savings which run to almost $2 112 million. It is a matter that requires further examination. I would not like to think that we are seeking additional revenue for the Commonwealth from this measure; I would like to think that it is a measure of proper administration in which the penalty interest charge will properly arise. The concern that we have-I too have this concernis that, in relation to the way in which these interest charges will arise where people are given notice by the department, notice will be sent through the mail to their last known address. If there is no reply within a certain period, the penalty will start to occur. The penalty will be a penalty interest rate which the legislation prescribes of 20 per cent, or a lesser amount if prescribed. It will be 20 per cent under this legislation, unless at a later date it is prescribed that it will be a smaller figure. The penalty interest will occur if a person has not entered into a contract with the department within those time limits. It may be impossible for so,ne reason to enter into a mutually satisfactory agreement. It may be that a person is perfectly willing to make an offer to the department but that the department says that it was not satisfactory. It may well be that the person had moved innocently and nobody had referred the mail on, so he or she was never given any notice. Mail-outs with the Department of Social Security have been particularly flawed in recent months. I want the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Gonstitutional Affairs to look at these more detailed arrangements. There might be a way in which these arrangements can be looked at in order to develop a regime that is fairer on the department's clients. Under the proposals before us, it seems to me that the onus is being put very heavily on the department's clients, raising very significant debts, which in certain circumstances could be quite unconscionable. (TIme expired)",39
165,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The legislation before the House is of an omnibus nature and covers a range of issues. As the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has said, most of the amendments are relatively minor. He listed virtually all of the aspects they cover. It is surprising that, on the one hand, he was suggesting that they were areas of deficiency but, on the other hand, he failed to point out that a number of them had arisen because of interpretations by the court. The Federal Court, in one particular case regarding the definition of a retirement village and the 55 or 60 years of age minimum-this is quite surprising to me; my not being a lawyer, I suppose, would explain why I am surprised-said that an aged hostel, where the minimum age is 60, is not a retirement village because the requirement of the retirement village is that the minimum age must be 55. The fact that the age was exceeded disqualified it. I would have thought it would be the opposite. It took the court to interpret that and the Federal Court to say that that needed to be redefined. In other cases, it resulted from interpretations of acts and legislation by tribunals of one form or another. This is quite normal and it does go on. The idea that somehow the acts or the bills of this parliament are drafted perfectly and stay the same in interpretation forever and a day is obviously quite fallacious. As I said, the thrust of the shadow minister's comments were that somehow these were major deficiencies and incompetencies when they are quite simply interpretations by courts. It is quite possible that if a matter went back to a court again with a different judge there might be a different result. We are all used to that and know that that can happen. The response from the government is to clearly define and achieve what the legislation was originally intended to do and what the parliament originally sought. If the legislation fails so, then the onus is on the government to act as promptly as possible to correct that. Virtually all the amendments are of that nature. I refer, with some humour, to the point the shadow minister made regarding the Italian and Australian social security update, which is what it is. He was attempting to make some quite unfair imputations on the people involved, which indicates the pedantic, petty nature of the opposition at this stage. Major agreements are being developed by the government-with Italy, Greece and other countries-to try to recognise that people do have entitlements in other countries. It took years to negotiate originally. Given the differences in legislation in different countries, they were enormously complex documents. In Italy people pay into a credit system-there is actually a contribution-whereas in Australia it is enough to be living in the country. There is a need to normalise and standardise the different languages, taking into account the different systems, so that the terminology is compatible. Every time we change anything in our legislation we will have to revisit the agreements. The agreements are enormously important and enormously complex, but it is very important that they are done well because people who are affected by them deserve to be treated in the same way as .any other welfare recipient. The shadow minister is virtually saying that, if a social security case comes up which affects a Western Australian, that person is treated differentand ly from the person covered by the Italian government. We should not talk to the Italian government in the way we talk to the Western Australian government or community. The need to update these agreements on a continuing basis is enormously important. I am disappointed by the pettiness of the opposition in trying to demean that process and in trying to suggest that somehow that updating was improper. Incorporating those amendments into this bill is simply a normal housekeeping process. The shadow minister took up quite strongly the question of changes in the area of confidentiality. He very clearly made the point that to do the changes were seen to be token, given the comments of the Independent Commission Against Corruption-ICAC-in New South Wales, and the comments of the Auditor General. The fact is that these amendments redefine the responsibilities of departmental staff. When looking at information from social security, the ICAC inquiry identified the behaviour of individuals as a major issue. The shadow minister is saying that somehow we can legislate so that people will not break the law. That is absolutely foolish and stupid. It demeans the intent of this legislation. It also 1llakes a fool of ICAC, because the ICAC report was not about making sure that every person employed in a Commonwealth department is totally honest and above corruption. ICAC was about making sure that we accurately define privacy. When I first came into this parliament not all that many years ago, the word 'privacy' existed in the dictionary but not in legislation. The concept of privacy did not exist in Commonwealth departments, other than in the taxation department. As a member of parliament I could make inquiries of any department about almost any constituent. Information about people was not seen as being important to protect. This government has pioneered and grafted its way through enormously complex procedures and protocols and legislation to give people rights of protection of their information. It has taken us a long time. It is a continuing process because, as we make those changes, the community'S understanding of privacy becomes more demanding more sophisticated. This is just one more step in the process, with the department clarifying and better defining what is meant by privacy and departmental responsibility. It also applies to people other than the department, but in terms of social security information. In other words, an officer should have a reasonable idea whether or not information is confidential. As the situation stands at the moment, before an officer is guilty of an offence we effectively have to be able to prove that the officer knew that information was confidential. That is what came forward from ICAC. It is the old Barwick bottom-of the-harbour scheme. With the tax scheme it was a case of proving that the intent was in the person's mind, otherwise.the commissioner would lose. That is what happened. It is a similar situation here. In a sense, at the moment, the government has to prove that the officer knew that the information was confidential. That is how the current situation can be interpreted. This amendment changes that in a slight but very important way, so that it is now a case of whether it is reasonable to interpret that the officer would have expected it to be confidential. In the current context of training protocols that is relatively easy. But it is a very important legal shift. It is absolutely foolish to suggest that it is token. The other aspect of privacy is to do with the protocols that go with the legislation-not simply the laws themselves but how they are applied and how the department is managed and how we as governments and as parliamentarians deal with our staff. If a person is going to be corrupt and dishonest and break the laws, it is a matter of how we find that out and how we deal with it. That is not covered. That is not part of the act. It is quite a separate issue which is more to do with the management of the department. If the shadow mini1iter wishes to take that up, then he has done himself no justice in suggesting. that these measures are both token and inappropriate in tenns of the response to the question of ICAC. I turn to the matter of the incorporation of assets or how assets and liabilities are treated and the matter of life interest. These matters have arisen out of interpretations of legislation by other bodies, which puts the onus back on the government. We either redefine or more accurately define or we wear what is seen to be a wrong interpretation. For example, it would surprise many people to realise that it appears to be possible for somebody to will a life interest in a property in which they may have an intrinsic interest and therefore be exempted from application of the assets test. I think that many people would find that a fascinating way of dealing with assets. I suspect that it was no accident that that was done in that way. The incorporation ofliabilities against assets, or the treatment of liabilities against assets, particularly for fanners, was very important. The more generous treatment of the value of assets for fanners was also an important measure. Most fanners would have accepted that using exempt assets in the same way as non-exempt assets is a bit of double dipping or double-dealing. It is not all that straight. Most fanners that I know are honest and would rather be dealt with in the same way as anybody else. Farmers would not see it as appropriate that a slight loophole might be available to them but not to other people. The same thing applies with life interest. The idea that somehow people design wills to leave their partner a life interest in what would likely be a mutual property, so that while that person is alive they are exempted from the assets test, is a bit of clever legalistic footwork. We have a tribunal interpretation of that; clearly, the onus is on the government to define it. If the opposition wants to go around the country and say that it is appropriate, it does smack of bottom-of-the-harbour. The spirit of the act is quite clear about assets. The shadow minister is saying that if a loophole can be found we should leave it open. In the past 10 or 11 years I have watched the shift from this House to the other place. In almost every debate that I take part in these days with the shadow minister I hear him talking about the Senate committee, the Senate inquiry, the Senate constitutional committee, or the Senate bills committee. I wonder why he is down here. I thought he would have retired to the other place instead. It seems to be where most of his attention is focused. A comment was made earlier today that many of those opposite appear to have a preference for state parliament because they want to defer the rights of the federal parliament to the states. The shadow minister for social security seems to want to defer all his responsibilities to the other House. I find that passing strange. There is an absence of policy and an absence of clear directions, along with petty, pedantic nit-picking on what are really machinery, straight housekeeping amendments which bring the act back to where it was before some of these tribunals and courts found in the way they have found. Along with modifying the agreement with the Italian government, those are quite straight forward procedures. I thought that when Senator BB from next door came down here she would take the social security portfolio, because that is one area where there was a need for a new thrust in policy. The kind of pettifogging that is going on with these amendments does the shadow minister no good service; it does the House no good service. These are straightforward procedural matters that I thought would have enjoyed reasonable bipartisan support because they really do not change the underlying act, the intention of the act, or the of the act. To suggest that the social security legislation wills assets away through life interest obviously denies the spirit of the legislation. To suggest that not taking into account all assets, exempt or otherwise, in terms of primary industry, is clearly not in the spirit of what was intended in the act. So to correct those anomalies is to obey the spirit of the act. I would have thought that these amendments would have been very straightforward. If the opposition wants to go back and start the assets test debate all over again, then let us do that. Some years ago that was part of its federal election policies and the public very clearly said, 'No, no way' and it was dropped like a hot potato-almost as fast as the GST; not quite as fast, but almost. If the opposition is going to put the assets test back on its agenda as an electoral issue, then it should do so. The opposition should not do it through this backdoor way of blocking off corrections to the act-interpretations of a legalistic nature-to satisfy the legal jungle and the loophole finders. If the opposition is going to do so, it should do so openly. It should come out in the open and say that it wants the assets test to be removed. It should not try to give assets test privileges to a certain few-those who can actually arrange their affairs accordingly. The amendments are very straightforward. It is logical to put forward, in this fashion, an omnibus amending bill. I am disappointed that, yet again, I am forced to follow a shadow minister who spoke in a pedantic and pettifogging manner. I commend the amendments to the House. .",40
166,Mr DOBIE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Having been a member of this House since 1966, I always believed in the sincerity of all members of parliament who, wherever they sit in this parliament, are all sincerely concerned with social security matters and the welfare of all disadvantaged Australians until experience proved differently. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), is the Chairman of the Standing spirit Committee on Community Affairs, of which I am vice-chairman. I thought this would bring him back into the House. I happen to believe in his sincerity on social security matters very much, but I am very disturbed when I hear him attributing the 'too pedantic' attitude to people on this side. It would haY,e been my hope that members of the government, including the honourable member who has just left the chamber, would have been pedantic when looking at problems of social security and, particularly, amendment bills. I rise here today as chairman of the coalition's social policy committee, and I want to add my comments to this debate. As my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) said in his contribution, many of the items contained within this bill are not contentious and, therefore, will not be opposed by the coalition. Indeed, the coalition has a proud record on matters of social security and will readily support measures debated in this House which will be of some assistance to people in need. However, the coalition also has a record of objecting to those proposals which will have harmful consequences to those who find themselves on social security payments. It is unfortunate that this government has yet again brought before the House a bill which has such intentions and it will, therefore, come as no surprise that the coalition will be opposing measures. The specific measures contained within this bill need to be considered within the overall context Of the government's social security agenda. I do not think many members would be surprised to learn that the comments coming back to my office are less than vourable to the Keating government-I hope that is not being peda1'\tic. Equally not surprising is that the most common complaint ment, relates, at the moment, to the government's decision to reduce the family allowance earlier, threshold for payments from January 1 this year. The irony in this measure from the government is tragic. Let this House remember that the first act of the Keating government in this, the International Year of the Family, was to stop family allowance payments to many. Australassumption Ian families. It did not waste any time in doing so either. On the very first day of the International Year of the Family, many families had this payment stopped. So it comes as no surprise that this fine gesture this Keating government is the single most common cause of. complaint from social security clients-many of whom are now exSocial social security clients, having had their family payment stopped. Similarly, another great cause of concern amongst social security recipients in my electorate concerns the treatment of fringe benefits in regard to the payment of social security benefits-and I underline 'benefits'. There is a degree of concern among many Suffice recipients of social security payments that the new .regulations which take into account certain employer provided fringe benefits within the income test for family payments are unfair. I raise that point in the context this debate for it exhibits the degre- of tration that exists among many people in the community regarding the administration of constant and ever-recurring changes to social security payments. As the representative of those people in this parliament, I also see it incumbent upon me to represent the views of those people in this place. The. other overriding issue which the regional office of my electorate is aware these concerns the issue of pensioners who hold shares or managed investments. I have spoken on this issue before in this House, and I shall have more to say on that subject in the course of the debate on this bill. Suffice it to say in the meantime, many pensioners are rightly aggrieved at the-dare I say-shabby way fathis government has treated them. Mr Ruddock-That is an understatement.",43
167,Mr DOBIE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is indeed an understatebut I am using the current language of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As I said this bill contains provisions which are largely non-contentious. The changes to the mobility allowance would fall into this category. My understanding is that this measure to grant an allowance to disabled persons to .find work will cost an additional $500,000. I believe that is based on the department's that this measure will benefit 400 people. I would be pleased to hear from the minister, or the parliamentary secretary, what arrangements these 400 people-and this is their estimated number-have had to make in by the intervening period whilst they have not had access to this allowance because they did not qualify under paragraph 1035(c) of the Security Act 1991. I would sincerely hope that people with a disability were not hampered in their efforts to find work because they fell outside the scope of the original amendment. I do not wish to canvass the issue of stay orders, which I believe has been well covered by the honourable member for Berowra. it to say, this particular item illustrates the complexities which are inherent within the Social Security Act and the anomalies which occur from time to time. It is indeed, then, little wonder that a lot of confusion exists of regarding social security payments, particularfrusly when either the client or the department itself appeals a decision. Nor is it my intenthe tion to recanvass the issue of the widow B pension, which is also contai-ed within this bill. However, I would like to raise some issues regarding the issue of confidentiality which this bill. addresses. The issue of confidentiality has concerned me for some time. I believe the of divulging of departmental information to be a most serious offence and the findings of both the Commonwealth Auditor-General and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales are especially relevant. The Auditor-General has found that the Department of Social Security needed to strengthen its confidentiality procedures. I think that most members would be aware of ICAC's findings of the sale of information from government departments, of which the Department of Social Security was one to be named. In this age of computerised records and data collection, it is imperative that there safeguards of information collected. Information, as we have seen, is a valuable commodity and one in which there has been evidence of illicit trading. Such activities can, and do, have tragic consequences. There have been instances within my electorate of breaches of privacy regulations. I can inform the House that the consequences of such actions are harmful and I believe it is imperative that all government departments must exercise a duty of care in protecting the confidentiality of their clients. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA NA",44
168,Mr KEATING,PROCEDURE," by leave-Honourable members will recall that during the valedictory remarks at the end of last year's budget sittings I made some comments about the refqrm of our procedures here in the House of Representatives, especially in relation to question time. The new parliamentary year is a good time for us to be acting on the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Procedure in its report, About time. We set up this committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) to look at the procedures and standing orders of the parliament. The committee has reported, and the title of its report has a lot of merit. If we want to preserve the institutions of our democracy, and if we want them to work more effectively, we have to be prepared to change them where necessary. Of course, there have been great changes since many of these institutions and procedures were first adopted. These changes are overdue, as I said last year, and the honourable member for Bonython and other members of the procedure committee have done us all a great service in the preparation of that report. This week the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will be tabling a detailed government response to the committee's report, and the House will be considering revised sessional orders, but there are some points that I wish to highlight. The procedure committee be proper report dealt with three main areas: first, the. handling of legislation-particularly the need to free up chamber time for the proposed consideration of legislation by providing a main committee, or second chamber, for handling routine and uncontroversial bills second, parliamentary questions, and particularly question time, and third, when, and for how long, we sit. The government has given consideration to these matters over the summer recess. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that we intend to accept, in whole or in part, the great majority of the committee's recommendations. Sitting times Let me first tum to sitting times. It is clear that the time has come to change the hours the House of Representatives sits. As we all know, and as the committee has confirmed, sitting late into the night, night after night, is not a productive or particularly sensible way to conduct our business. Except at the beginning of new sittings and on public holidays, from Monday, 21 February we shall sit Monday to Thursday each sitting week. So far as possible, we will stick to the two-on, twooff pattern; that is, two weeks on and two weeks off. In the other place, the Senate, senators will also be sitting four days a week. It will be convenient for the two houses to have similar patterns of sittings. Our normal starting and finishing times will be: Monday 12.30 to 8.00 Tuesday 12.30 to 8.00 Wednesday 9.30 to 8.00, and Thursday 9.30 to 6.00 This will give honourable members time to lead something like more normal lives. They will at least be able to see one another socially; that is, of course, when they 'are not working on either party or parliamentary committees, which will also probably operate after 8 o'clock at night. By rising at 6 o'clock on Thursdays, it should be possible for most honourable members to get air transport out of Canberra and back to the extremities of the country in Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, as well as all the places in between. Questions The idea of reforming question time goes back a long way. In an article on question time in the Journal of Public Administration in 1972, a scholar by the name of John Howard-John H. Howard-concluded that 'new procedures and parliamentary institutions must be implemented. It is no longer acceptable to rely on conventions and precedents that were established over 100 years ago'. The question time he describes sounds remarkably like the one we hear complaints about today. 'The modern aim of Question Time', Mr Howard wrote, 'appears to be not so much to seek information as to impart it, or establish debating points'. He quoted a senior politician, saying that question time 'enlists information to secure a political advantage and to embarrass the Minister concerned'. 'The first concern of a member of Parliament when' he is in the House', Mr Howard said, 'does not lie with the conduct of public administration. It lies with the survival of his party, whether it be in Government or Opposition'. All the same criticisms were there in 1972: · fewer and fewer questions being asked · the practice of so-called dorothy dixers · the intervention of broadcasting and press publicity which are alleged to have encouraged the diversion of question time into dorothy dixers and attempts to score by the opposition · the lack of tranquillity in the chamber . the impossibility of enforcing standing orders-as the Liberal Party Speaker Sir William Aston said, 'It is impossible to enforce all the Standing Orders at Question Time. I believe that if I did that, possibly we would have no Question Time at all.' I know-as does the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-that this Mr Howard was describing it accurately, because I was there at the time. And, in fact, Mr Speaker, as you will see in the Hansard of 18 April 1972, I spoke on the same subject. Question time has always been a great deal less than perfect. As John Uhr wrote in a monograph on the subject a decade ago-and I think these are particularly correct words: ""It would be wrong to look for some golden age of Australian parliamentary affairs when questions were asked and answered in an exemplary mode of non-partisan public service."" It has never been perfect; it has always been, to some degree, in need of reform. But the government of which the honourable member for Bennelong was a minister did not reform it. Although in those days much was written about question time, little came of any prospects for change. I am glad to say that this government will now take up that opportunity. The government accepts the committee's view that question time can be improved and that the time has come to try some new arrangements. The procedure committee recommended we should have a limited experiment with the rostering of ministers for question time. It proposed that ministers other than the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance should attend Monday question times on a roster based on half-hour segments. The government, however, has decided that, if change is needed, there is no point in tinkering at the margins. We have decided to institute a fully rostered question time on a trial basis for the remainder of this session. With other ministers, including the Treasurer (Mr Willis), I shall be available for question time on each Monday and Thursday to take questions ranging across the whole spectrum of government. Other ministers will be rostered to· answer questions relating to their portfolios and those of the Senate ministers they represent. The Leader of the House will be drawing up the roster and will consult the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) in the process. Question time will be at 3.00 p.m. and will last for 45 minutes, as recommended by the committee, with the government nominating a minimum of 14 questions. It should also be remembered that, because on that schedule the House will be sitting at least one extra day in each two-week sittings, there. will be an additional 45-minute opportunity for questioning the government. This will mean that more homework will be needed on both sides of the House. Some members of the opposition's long front bench will have to think up some questions on their shadow portfolio responsibilities, probably for the first time. As the other Mr Howard said in 1972, 'The advantage of the Westminster system is that it makes the questioner have some degree of responsibility as well as the minister who has to provide an answer'. In such a system as I propose, this would probably be more than true. Those, like the honourable member for Bennelong, who complain about question time being used for political purposes at the very least ought to have the honesty to admit that the questions are as political as the answers. I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong does. Mr Speaker, our parliamentary system is based on the Westminster system of government. In my view, it is superior to any other. But, as I have said, this does not mean it should forever close itself off from reform. The reality of the way in which our national politics are conducted is vastly different from that which existed when the current arrangements for question time and sitting patterns were instituted decades ago. The advent of television and other new technology, as well as the many points of accountability outside this place, means that more emphasis is now placed on opportunities, appearances and form as much as substance; more often than not it is on the theatrics rather than the seeking and provision of information. Some honourable members of this place have never required an audience beyond its walls to encourage them. For instance, the former honourable member for MCKellar in the early 1950s was ejected from the House for doing imitations of a gorilla. In fact, I hope there will continue to be room for theatre as there has always been in this and other parliaments. Mr Ruddock- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are part of this place. But those who have gone before do not require gratuitous comments of that sort.",45
169,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEDURE,There is no point of order. Mr Ruddock-I take that point of ordfir. It is offensive to a former member. It should be withdrawn.,47
170,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEDURE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,47
171,Mr SINCLAIR,PROCEDURE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is a standing order which says that one cannot be offensive to a member of this place. The Prime Minister is not saying that the former honourable member acted like a gorilla; he is saying he thought he did.",47
172,Mr BEAZLEY,PROCEDURE,Was he or was he not?,47
173,Mr SINCLAIR,PROCEDURE,Precisely. Was he? The Prime Minister has made an allegation which is not sustainable. .,47
174,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEDURE,I have just ruled that there is no point of order. The right honolU'able member for New England will resume his seat.,47
175,Mr KEATING,PROCEDURE,"I willclear this up. I am quite sure that the former honourable member for MCKellar would be delighted to know that we are speaking in warm terms and metaphors about his parliamentary high jinks and his impact on this place. The point I was making was that members of the place have never required an audience beyond its walls of encouragement. That is, they never in the past required television or other opportunities. They were more than able to do it all themselves for their own entertainment. That is simply the point. I hope there will continue to be room for that theatre. I for one would miss terribly the angry iook of the honourable member for notice  tactical observations of the right honourable member for New England of the kind we saw provided. last week. But I also think the time has come for the emphasis to be reweighted in favour of substance. These new arrangements will not diminish the government's accountability in this place. In many ways, they will increase accountabiliopposition. ty across the breadth of the government. listen to the statements of honourable .. bers opposite about account-bility, one could be forgiven for thinking that I was under constant interrogation in this place and these refonns were designed to protect from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr member Hewson). Of course, this is nonsense, and a quick perusal of the record of question time bears this out. For instance, last questions were asked of me by the government than by the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked, on average, one quesprovides tion of me per sitting week. Under the new arrangements, he can either increase or deway crease this ratio as he and the opposition tactics committee see fit. For reasons best known perhaps to the opposition, in 1993 only 87 questions were asked of me compared with 276 in 1992. It becomes obvious that any opposition chooses its targets according to its perceived political interests. Those on the other side really should not insult anyone's intelligence by pretending that they occupy some high moral ground. Dr Kemp interjecting",47
176,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEDURE,Order! The honourable member for Goldstein will withdraw the comment. Dr Kemp-I withdraw.,48
177,Mr KEATING,PROCEDURE,"In opposition in 1975, the then honourable member for Moreton was all for changing question time. He said it was - choking , the parliament. But did the governbenchers. ment of Malcolm Fraser unchoke it? No fear. Malcolm Fraser did not change a thing. He believed that hono\lrable members who genuinely wanted information, as opposed to publicity, should place their questions on for a written answer. That still obtains change to the fonnat of question time; that is, written questions and answers can be The contemporary record also shows that vast areas of government responsibility go largely unscrutinised by the opposition. More questions are asked of a broader range of ministers by the government than by the In 1992, 70 per cent of all opposiTo tion questions came from the Leader of the memOpposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party. Seventy per cent of all questions in that year that were asked of the Prime Minister and the me Treasurer-of me and the· then honourable for FremantIe. So much for· claims of opportunity for scrutiny of other ministers or questions going to opposition backbenchers, year more or even frontbenchers. Those who lay claim to being the traditionalists of parliament must agree that all this a distorted version of ministerial accountability to the parliament and in no reflects the original intentions of those who framed the existing arrangements. The refonns we propose ensure that more minis-. ters are questioned and provide the opportunity for more policies to be tested and more detailed scrutiny to be given to government departments and their administration. In short, the government's reforms will aid , a return to our genuine parliamentary traditions and help make question time a forum not merely for leaders but for all ministers and parliamentarians. Thes- changes should in fact be supported by traditionalists. It is entirely consistent with our Westminster parliamentary tradition, with its emphasis on collective responsibility, that we should encourage questioning not only of the leading ministers but of all ministers; and not only questions from the opposition leaders and government backbenchers but questions from all backbenchers, including opposition backHandling legislation I tum to the procedure committee's recommendations on the handling of legislation. The government has already made significant changes to improv- the flow of leg-slation, especially by movmg to three penods of sittings. We have made a decision that, generally,legislatio- will be introduced in one sitting for passage m the next. Nonetheless, the government has agreed to a trial of the procedure committee's recommendations and has decided that the machinery should be put in place to allow uncontroversial bills to be considered by a main committee or 'second chamber'. The government has also agreed that there should be a second Deputy Speaker and that he or she will be nominated by the oppositio- .. It will take some time for the necessary supporting arrangements to be put in place, but I would hope to see some initial use of the main committee system during the current autumn sittings. The Leader of the House will this week be giving notice of the necessary sessional orders and amendments to the standing orders of the House. The government intends that the new sitting times and question time arrangements will start on Monday, 21 February. I believe that we are making very worthwhile improvements. Again, let me express my appreciation to all honourable members and others who have contributed to the development of these reforms, particularly the honourable member for Bonython. I conclude by presenting the following paper: House of Representatives Procedures Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not ing 19 minutes.",48
178,Dr HEWSON,PROCEDURE," Mr Speaker, nobody in this parliament should be misled by the arrogance, the glib lines or the attempted humour of the Prime Mini-ter (Mr Keating), because he has just delivered the most fundamental and serious attack on this parliament in the 93 years since Federation. He had the hide to talk about tranquillity when he, more than anybody else in the history of this parliament, has destroyed the very tranquillity which he says he seeks. He talked disparagingly about the idea of high moral ground. He has never understood ,. high moral ground. We have the high moral ground on this issue and he looks on with envy. He has spent his entire career mugging the parliament. He is a great one to come in here talking about high moral ground. What unbounded hypocrisy it was for the Prime Minister to talk about reform, to invoke the Westminster system and to talk about the committee chaired by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). We. know that committee was a facade .. We know that the Prime Minister was always going to do what he wanted to do irrespective of what that committee recommended. , Mark my words, Mr Speaker: no man in the history of this parliament has done more to downgrade, abuse, sabotage, undermine, subvert and threaten the process and procedures of this parliament than the current Prime Minister. His speech has absolutely nothing to do with improving the operation of this parliament. It is all about an accommodation of his arrogant and imperial lifestyle. It has nothing to do with improving the parliament but is about bending the system to suit his own particular ends. It is a massive indulgence. It is emperor Keating in full flight. It is just another attempt by the Prime Minister to work the system to his own advantage at the expense of everybody else involved in the democratic process-most importantly, the people of Australia. Never has so fundamental a change been hidden behind such a flimsy veil as in that ridiculous speech just delivered by the Prime exceedMinister. The centrepiece of the remarks by the Prime Minister was the significance of question time. Now, I acknowledge that question time is very important. It is unquestionably the focus of the parliament-as it should be because it is the one forum in which the government can be held to account for its actions, its policy and its performance. Question time is absolutely fundamental to our democratic process. In fact; question time should be democracy in action. Question time is where the government should be held accountable day by day and where ministers should be subject to scrutiny day by day. In short, question time is the very foundation of our whole democratic systemYet this Prime Minister is intent on destroychange ing the essentials of our parliamentary system by further downgrading the significance. of question time to suit his own ends. We only need look at the way he has behaved in question time in recent years. He walks out of question time when he is under pressure. When the going gets too tough, somebody pulls the back of his coat and out he goes. He cannot hack the pressure. He has often boasted in the past that question time is an opportunity for robust and vigorous exchanges, but all he has done is tum question time into a session of crude and crass abuse. The Prime Minister talked today of his concern about dorothy dixer questions. He then went on to admit that most of the questionsthat he was asked were asked by his own people-all he gets is dorothy dixers. Frankly, it does not· matter who asks the question-whether I ask it or those opposite ask it-we still get a bucketing from the Prime Minister because that is his attitude to question time. He has not once' set out to answer any of our questions. He has not once set out to take matters seriously-and his behaviour is not restricted to question time. We have gone through periods where he has denied us the opportunity to debate matters of public importance and to censure the government for bad performance. The Prime Minister did not even attend when I gave my response to the latest budget speech. There has been a consistent pattern in his attempt to undermine the very significance of this parliament. The Prime Minister has total contempt for the committee system of this parliament. He stops ministers from appearing before parliamentary committees. He is not interested at all in accountability to them because, as he says, he is not prepared to 'slum it' in front of a parliamentary committee. And what does he do when it comes to issues of great debate,' such as Mabo? He imposes the guillotine to undermine further the processes of democracy in this parliament. Mr Speaker, his undermining of parliament extends to his attitude towards you and your standing in this place. None of us will ever forget the events of recent 'days, when you reported the rationale behind your decision to the rules relating to the televising of points of order and comments that an honourable. member might make but subsequently have to withdraw; I remember that when you explained the rationale for that decision on the program Order in the House you said, 'It seems to me quite stupid that people can't watch and understand the flow of the argument and just what is happening'. But the Prime Minister did not care about you; he did not care about your status. He simply instructed the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to come in here and reverse that decision, irrespective of the fact that you had a unanimous committee report recommending acceptance of the changes that you proposed. He humiliated you, Mr Speaker, in front of all these people and in the eyes of the people of Australia. What reason did the Prime Minister give when he was asked about it in this House? He said that he did not want 'vermin', as he described the opposition, getting any air time. This is the man who today comes in and talks about parliamentary reform when he has spent the great bulk of his life in this place and beyond undermining the parliament. . In addition to his remarks about this House, the Prime Minister describes the Senate as 'unrepresentative 'swiII'. He attacks the states at every tum. In fact, throughout his parliamentary career he has gone out of his way to undermine the integrity of our federation. He bullies the Public Service. As a result,he has developed one of the most politicised public services in the history of this country. In recent days we have seen attacks on the Auditor-General. In fact, in one of my questions today I incorporated a comment made by the Auditor-General about the attitude of this government· towards his position-a position fundamental and ,essential to the processes of government accountability, The Auditor-General said: The Government doesn't want the' Auditor-General to have access and has done nothing to help the Auditor-General's office get up to the most modem standards ... They're not interes-ed in the sort checks and balances we can provide. The Prime Minister is damned out of the mouth of a senior and· independent public servant for the extent to which he is prepared toundennine parliament, accountability and parliamentary processes. In fact, the only time the Prime Minister has shown any real interest in the Auditor-General was in the development of Centenary House, when the Auditor General took the lease on it and the ALP made a cool $12 million out of the inflated rental. That is the only time he has shown any genuine interest in the activities of the Auditor-General. But way beyond all of that, throughout his parliamentary career, the Prime Minister has attacked our constitution, he has attacked our flag, and he has attacked and rewritten our history. This is the man who today came into this parliament and had the gall to invoke the Westminster system. He had the gall to talk about refonn of the parliamentary processes. The veil is a very thin one because it is clear that all of this is about twisting the system to accommodate the Prime Minister and reducing the amount of scrutiny to which he and his ministers are subjected on a daily basis in this parliament. It is interesting to look at the justifications that have been given in recent days for some of these changes. The Prime Minister was very careful in his remarks today not to explain to any significant extent why the changes were made. But those opposite have been actively briefing the press gallery as to why the changes should be made along the lines that the Prime Minister has proposed. One of the most interesting things. that I have seen in recent days in the press was a justification for these changes, in particular the fact that the Prime Minister will only come to question time twice a week. The justification is that he wants to mix it more with the people of Australia. Can honourable members just imagine this man mixing it with average Australians? This is the man who criticised his predecessor for wasting his time tripping over television cables in supennarkets. He now wants to go out and discover the people of Australia-the people who were of lied and cheated to at the last election. He suddenly wants to go out and discover them. I can just imagine him going out to one of those Bankstown pubs and sitting down and talking to the people about the vagaries of Thai teak tables. They would be interested in that. They might run home and see if they have any argon lamps like the ones he has in the dining room at the Lodge. The Prime Minister could probably share with them his understanding of how to get a $200,000 extension on a carport. I am sure they would be delighted to hear about that. He might even explain to a small business. man how he can get a loan out of the Commonwealth Bank for a piggery venture that has some obviously doubtful characteristics. He could explain to them how ooe can pay twice the market rate for Gould bird prints for the cabinet room. People will be interested in that-not to mention their interest in unemployment, not to mention the fact that in some cases their kids may not have got into university or that their aged parents may not be able to get hospital treatment. People would be delighted to be able to have the opportunity to mix it-or should I say mix it up-with the Prime Minister on a daily basis. The other justification the government has been using is that it is picking the eyes out of the best of the Westminster system and the procedures of the British House of Commons and bringing them over to Australia. The government is trying to pick up the idea of rotating the Prime Minister's appearance in the House. It is very interesting to make a comparison between the Australian parliament and the British parliament. The fundamental difference is that the Speaker of the British Parliament would be independent. I will not believe that the Prime Minister is fundamentally interested in the refonn of this place until he comes in here and proposes an independent Speaker. He would get a very favourable response from our side if he proposes an independent Speaker. Let us look at the number of days the British Prime Minister answered questions in 1992. In 1992 this parliament sat for 60 days. \ What a disgrace! The people of Australia cannot understand that we sit for so few days. We sat for 60 days in 1992 and for 47 days in 1993. By comparison, the. British parliament sat for 143 days. So the British Prime Minister, even going in for half the time in the British parliament, had about 62 more days of question time than our Prime Minister did. Yet our Prime Minister is now proposing to reduce the amount of time he spends in the parliament by half. So he would be in here for question time for only 30 days a year. 1I have heard talk of a 35-hour week, but a 30day year is a joke for anybody, particularly the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is running from. the scrutiny· that he knows is inherent in the essence of this parliament. He is twisting the system to match his own imperial lifestyle. In the few minutes remaining, let us look a couple of the other changes that are posed by the Prime Minister in this very thin and very undetailed report on parliamentary performance and parliamentary standards. would like to say something about the minisoff terial roster system. I bet that the Minister the Environment, Sport and Territories Kelly can hardly wait for the ministerial roster system. It means that, when we get her under pressure on one day, we are not allowed to pursue her the next day. We are not going to be able to ask her questions the second day, we have to wait until she is rosteredback Does that not make a mockery of ministerial scrutiny and accountability? Here is somebody who has taken $30 million of taxpayers' money and allocated in a blatantly political way, with the possibiliWalker ty of fraud, without being able to account the Auditor-General for the way'those decinear sions were made. What an amazing woman that minister really is! What a memory! A total of 2,800 separate applications were reviewed by her and 726 grants were ml)de by her and, apparently, she keeps in her head. She is an amazing person. The point about this change is that we will not be able to pursue that rriin ister. All change will do is hide a minister like Minister Kelly from the scrutiny she should have in this parliament. It makes an absolute mockery of the system. The argument is that more ministers will have the opportunity to be asked questions. Some .cracks were made about our side in making that point. The Prime Minister knows that has never been the case; he knows that that is not so. 1 can remember asking questions of Minister Tickner and Minister Walker at the time of Mabo. Who stood up and answered them? The Prime Minister did. 1I have seen him answering a question for Minister Kelly. 1I have seen him answer questions for other ministers as well. That is a fiction. The only thing the Prime Minister is admitting to us is that, on the days he is not here, he will not have to sit there and squirm as these ministers come up and try to answer these questions at the box. Their incompetence is phenomenal. . The Prime Minister should look at the at incompetence of his ministers over the last pronine. months. There was not only Dawkins, whom he got rid of after a bad budget, there were also Collins and Beddall and the pay TV 1 debacle. What incompetence! Collins signed under the law and said, 'I didn't know for that 1 had that responsibility. 1 didn't know (Mrs what 1 was signing'. What about Senator Chris Schacht? The fact is that he has divided the science community in Australia and made us the laughing stock of the international and Australian scientific communities. What about Rosemary Crowley and the accreditation of on. child-care centres? Mr Downer-Who?",49
179,Dr HEWSON,PROCEDURE,"Good point. There are other examples of ministerial incompetence it right here-Minister Tickner and· Minister in the handling of the Mabo debate. to The Prime Minister did not let them anywhere some of the detail of that debate. He has a whole string of incompetent ministers. The only conclusion 1 can draw is that he is not prepared to sit here and watch them selfdestruct under the cross-examination that will all the details undoubtedly come. The greatest focus on this rostering of ministers is still going to come back to the this Prime Minister and the fact that he is prepared to come in here for only two days a week to face questions from the other. side. Given that there has not been a significant increase in the number of questions, this is making a mockery of any sense of accountability by the Prime Minister to this parliament and to the people of Australia. Quite frankly, I could not agree more with the editorial in the Advertiser this week, which said that the proposal for the Prime Minister to be rostered on two days per week spits in the face of a sovereign parliament and people. That is precisely what he is doing. He is spitting in the face of a sovereign parliament and the people of Australia in not being prepared to face the scrutiny of this House for four days a week. If we sat four days a week, we would have a 6O-day year. It is just ludicrous to imagine that the Prime Minister is so prepared to debase our democratic structure that he is not even prepared to stay. He is institutionalising the fact that he wants to come in here on only a limited basis. We have said on an earlier occasion that we were interested in parliamentary reform. I thought I heard the Prime Minister say on an earlier occasion in this House that he was genuinely interested in parliamentary reform. It is about time he started to listen to what the people of Australia are saying about parliamentary reform. Let us look at some of the letters to the editor in' recent days about the performance of this parliament and the extent to which the people of Australia have downgraded even further their image and their understanding of what we are about. A letter in the Australian dated 7 February reads: Australians were treated to a demeaning fortyminute tirade in Federal Parliament last Wednesday (2/2}-not only sarcasm but an unnecessary"" foulmouthed attack on the Federal Opposition by Paul Keating, Ros KeIly and Kim Beazley. It was an affront to aIl'decent people and to the office of Parliament. "" In this Year of the Family one would hope our country's leaders would act as role models and set a decent standard of behaviour in Parliament. Another letter draws attention to the following fact: ' If my taxes are paying the salaries of people forget what governing this industry is really I want my money back. The Prime Minister can laugh. He stood here, as he delivered his speech today, and laughed about the changes. He laughed and joked with his backbench about the way he was undermining .the parliament to what he believes to be their benefit. He made a big joke of it. He laughed just then at those two average people in Australia who had taken the trouble to write a letter to the editor because they were concerned. He thinks the whole thing is a joke. He treats the people of Australia with contempt. He treats the whole parliamentary process with contempt. These changes that he has, proposed today are nothing more than self-indulgence at the expense of the int-rests of this parliament, its place in our society and the interests of the people of Australia. The people of Australia will not be fooled because, as a result of these changes, they will not see any better government, they will not see' any greater accountability and they will not see any greater scrutiny. They will just see the continuing downgrading of parliamentary standards that has been the hallmark of the Prime Minister during his time in this place. If we go back over the years, we see that he has made a sustained and deliberate attempt to undermine parliamentary standards to his own benefit. He might think it is a joke, but the people of Australia do not. At the next election, they will show him just how he should be held accountable for undermining the accountability of our parliamentary process. (TIme expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Bilney) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed. MrDOBIE (Cook) (5.28 p.m.)-I feel like the second movement of a concerto. For those who do not know, that is the slow movement in the theatrics of this House. I do not expect anybody to stay and listen to this speech. I pardon honourable members from the chamber; they may' leave with my permission. who Members of the Labor Party have already about, gone. They did not even enjoy the real movement ,we had today of the leaders of both parties speaking., I must confess, before I start my speech again, that I am one of those who believe in reform of this chamber and I welcome the idea of earlier nights. I say that after being here since 1966. The rest is for debate, but we certainly cannot get away from the early sitting times. I just wanted that put on record because I wi11 not get an opportunity to speak in the debate when it comes forward. Before my speech was interrupted, I was talking about the confidentiality of information in the possession of the Department of Social Security and the care that needs to be taken to protect that confidentiality. I am therefore pleased to see that this legislation makes some attempt to improve the privacy provisions within the act. However, I note with some concern that, whilst the bi11 widens the scope of the privacy regulations, the penalty for an offence under the act is to remain the same-two years imprisonment, or a fine or term of imprisonment as determined by a court. In view of the seriousness of this matter, I take this opportunity to inquire of the minister whether this particular item of legislation has been examined. If it has not, it should be, for I believe that, while it is all very well to be improving the regulations as they relate to privacy, we should also be examining the penalties as they relate to the abuse of privacy regulations. I will not traverse the ground covered by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) regarding the privacy aspects of this bill, especially as they relate to the coalition's efforts in setting up the Senate inquiry into privacy: However, I want to place on record my support for measures which will enhance the privacy of clients of the Department of Social Security and any other government department. Other aspects of ihis omnibus bill will not receive any support from the coalition. Indeed, as I foreshadowed in my opening remarks, the coalition wi11 continue to oppose those measures announced by this government that it regards as iniquitous. For example, the clauses in this bill which provide for life interests being counted as assets and for the apportionment rule to apply to certain primary producing assets are iniquitous. However, what is even more disturbing about these measures is that they pre-empt the findings of the income and assets test review which the government has been forced into by the coalition. Again, it is not my intention to traverse old territory but the simple fact remains that this government has shown a total lack of concern for the well-being of pensioners who have investments in either shares or managed investments. These pensioners appear to be fair game for the Keating government. As if the measures enacted last year regarding these investments were not enough, this government has embarked on measures to further reduce the living standards of older Australians-and I am close to being one myself. There is simply no excuse for this. It is now some three months since the government announced the review of the assets and incomes test and we still do not know the name of the consultant or tribunal that will conduct the inquiry. What we do know is that, due to the government's stalling, there wi11 hardly be sufficient time to conduct a proper review of this most serious matter. Obviously, the government has no understanding of the degree of concern many pensioners have regarding the conduct of this review. I am sure that, if there were to be an inquiry into ministerial salaries, the Minister for Social Security would be anxious to know the outcome because it would concern his own standard of living. Why then does the minister continue to delay this important inquiry when the standard of living of many pensioners throughout Australia so clearly depends on the findings of this review regarding the assets and income test? I sincerely believe the government does not understand the magnitude of concern that exists among pensioners about these issues. It is therefore very disappointing to see legislation such as this brought before the House, pre-empting the findings of the report. Equally disturbing are the investment income provisions within the bill. It is my understanding that the bill will actually legalise the common practice that the Department of Social Security has been adopting in this area for some time. One has to be very suspicious of the legality of such behaviour. If, as appears to be the case, the department has been adopting this policy without the necessary legislative basis, we must seriously question the legality of. the practices of the department. I would be greatly interested to 'learn from the minister the exact procedure adopted by the department in this regard. Pensioners deserve better. They deserve a better deal than the one they are presently rec-iving from this government, and they deserve better treatment than the provisions in this bill provide. Another aspect of this bill which concerns me relates to the penalty charges which are to be imposed as a replacement for the administrative charge. This bill will abolish the current administrative charge and replace it with a penalty interest charge in circumstances where 'a person owes money to the Department of Social Security and that person is not currently in receipt of any money from the department. I note that under proposed section 1229B the penalty interest charge is to be set at 20 per cent per annum, or at a lower rate which may be determined by the minister under section 2. I suspect that this arbitrary 20 per cent rate is too high in certain circumstances. Given the complexities inherent within the Social Security Act and the changing nature of people's circumstances in relation to eligibility to claim social security benefits, I believe that this penalty is too severe. Consider the case of a person who has inadvertently misled the Department of Social Security simply because he or she has not fully understood a form that had to be 'completed. In such a situation, and according to the act, that person might find himself or herself liable to the penalty for illegally claiming social security benefits. This bill proposes that if, after a 14-day period, the person does not enter into an agreement with the department for repayment of that money, the 20 per cent penalty charge is to apply, assuming the person is no longer a client of the department. I believe there is some danger attached to this and it is quite foreseeable that the plight of an ordinary person who has made an honest mistake may be compounded unduly by this proposal. I have had similar protests from constituents of mine who have had problems with the Taxation Office. It would seem the tax office is even more draconian in its dealings with people. The tax office imposes a flat rate 25 per cent penalty on the amount of tax which has been deemed by the tax office to have been avoided. It does not matter whether there was any intent to understate the tax liability. As I understand it, the new policy for social security means that the tax office will impose this flat rate regardless of whether people have made an honest mistake or have deliberately set out to defraud the Commonwealth. I would suspect that, for the most part, both the Department of Social Security and the tax office deal with people on average incomes where the amount of the discrepancy would be relatively minor. To impose an arbitrary charge on these amounts of money, regardless of the intent or lack thereof of the person in question, could cause considerable difficulties for the person concerned. I would, therefore, ask the minister, in the light of the new policy of the tax office, to consider this measure of the penalty charge carefully. Perhaps a little discretion in dealing with matters of debts owed to the Commonwealth would be more helpful. I do not propose to take up any more time of the House in relation to this bill. I reiterate my concern for pensioners and for the, dare I say, shabby way they have been treated by this government. This bill does nothing to help the plight of those pensioners and it even makes several amendments to further reduce the standard of living of some pensioners. I suspect that we will again be dividing on this issue and it will come as no surprise to see government members voting in this chamber to reduce the living standard of penl'iioners. That has been the practice of this government for some time now and it is no wonder that the only voice for the aged community in this place comes from the coalition. I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his offer for me to speak for a further 20 minutes but I decline.",52
180,Mr HAVILAND,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Macarthur) (5.38 p.m.)I am pleased to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993. This bill gives effect to a number of policy changes and other technical amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the National Health Act 1953. These include amendments to the mobility allowance, which will now be payable to people with a disability who are unable to use public transport and who are undertaking jobsearch activities under a CETP program. The bill also amends the arrangements for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions of the Department of Social Security which have been confirmed by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The AAT will now order a stay of the decision under review until the appeal is dealt with. However, in cases where the"" AAT affirms the original decision to reduce or withdraw benefits, any resultant overpayment becomes a recoverable debt. What a shame the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) has gone. Mr Dobie-No, he hasn't; he is still here.",55
181,Mr HAVILAND,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"There he is. How could I miss the honourable member in that suit. Other amendments to this bill include the tightening of confidentiality provisions in relation to information on clients held by the Department of Social Security and amendments to the definition of retirement villages under the act. There are a number of other minor technical amendments dealt with in this bill. The bill is really another example of ongoing commitment of this government to legislative reform, particularly to that which brings about social justice and equity. In that respect, of course, the government's commitment contrasts greatly with the attitude of the opposition. We have heard some pretty interesting comments already today from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock),' in his u.sual effort to criticise the government on social security matters, and also from the honourable member for Cook. I will tum immediately to his comment criticising this government for its changes to family payments-changes which came in on New Year's Day in the International Year of the Family. He condemned us for reducing the upper limit for family allowance from $64,000 to $60,000 a year. He seems to have forgotten that under Fightback the opposition was going to slash the upper limit to $55,000. So much for the opposition's concern about family allowance. On the subject of pensioners, whom the honourable member for Cook seems to be so concerned about and whom the opposition alleges are so hard done by, the pension as a percentage of average weekly earnings in February 1983, before this government was elected, was 22.7 per cent and under this government it is now 25.2 per cent. So much for the opposition and its criticism of the government's track record in relation to pensioners and social security. Of course, it is this Labor government that is always reforming and always seeking to review the effects of legislation and the operations of government programs and departments in order to make people's quality of life better. We are the ones that are introducing new programs, coming up with new ideas and new social reforms. In contrast the opposition, of course, has no policies, has a do-nothing program and has nothing to offer the Australian people. The Liberal-Country Party coalition was in office for 23 years, from 1949 to 1972, and did absolutely nothing. They were the Rip Van Winkle years of Menzies and his successors, who, of course, had nothing to offer the Australian people. It is interesting that when the Gough Whitlam was elected Prime Minister we suddenly had some significant amendments to social security. I remember that period quite well because in those days I was a fairly junior employee in the Perth office of the Department of Social Security. I can remember the plethora of reform and legislation that came into the Department of Social Security because, after 23 years of neglecting the ordinary Australians who were social security beneficiaries, we suddenly had some amendments and reforms which caused quite a lot of changes-changes which were long overdue. "" We had the introduction of the single parent benefit, which was then called the supporting mothers benefit. Before that, there was no benefit of that nature for single parents. Some members of the opposition do not believe in single parents; they do not believe that single parents should exist. Recently the Acting Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) made some derogatory comments about children of single parents as opposed to children in other families. I think that is fairly typical of the attitude of those opposite towards single-parent families· and towards people on social security. So let us not have this hypocrisy from the other side. Of course, an even greater example of that hypocrisy is in Fightback-I have already briefly mentioned Fightback-under which we would have had a $10 billion cut in public sector expenditure, including $2 billion from the social security budget; and $3 an hour wages for youth trainees and $3.50 an hour for other people. It was an absolutely outrageous platform and it was, of course, rejected by the Australian people. So let us not have this nonsense coming from the other side attacking the government over social security. I listened with interest to the honourable member for Berowra for half an hour. I was waiting for him to come out and criticise the government. He took half an hour and I still do not know that he really said anything of substance to criticise this government and this bill. I guess I will try again during the committee stage to see if he has anything of substance to say. With all the huff and puff that comes from the oppositionMr Ruddock-He doesn't need a mouthwash, he needs an earwash.",56
182,Mr HAVILAND,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I have got ears and eyes too. I listened with interest but I could not see anything of substance and I am not likely to either from the other side. It is the Labor government that cares about people and is committed to our social security system and to ongoing review and reform of that system. That is why the Labor Party has been elected and re-elected five times-because it cares about people and it does not have these draconian policies which were in Fightback. The only analysis that I can come up with is that it is only the government that cares about people; the opposition does not believe in social security, in income support-it believes in charity. If it had its way we would probably have a Thatcherite system-a system in which people have to hold out their hands, in which the rich give charity to the poorrather than a system in which beneficiaries, the less fortunate in society, can receive with dignity income support from a system which is constantly monitored and reviewed in light of social justice, as this government monitors and reviews our social security system. I commend these amendments to the House. Most of them are fairly minor technical amendments; nevertheless they give another example of the ongoing reform that this government is constantly introducing into this House. I commend the bill to the House.",57
183,Mr VAILE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As has probably already been stated in the debate this evening on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993, the opposition is supporting some aspects of this omnibus bill. There are 12 measures proposed in the bill. We will not oppose eight of those but, as has already been set out by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), we will be opposing four of those measiires for different reasons, as has already been outlined. It is interesting to listen to some of the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), about who best looks after the less fortunate in the community. As we go down the path during this three-year term of the current government we might see some very enlightening facts surface about how this current government treats those people. But I am not going to deal in histrionics about who was right and who was wrong with their policies in that election in March 1993 because I think that the people of Australia will realise by the time we get to March 1996 who was right, who was telling the truth and who was not telling the truth. I will cover some of the measures that have been outlined in this piece of legislation. The opposition will not oppose the proposed change to the mobility allowance. It is a meaSure that I personally believe is important. The mobility allowance is payable to disabled persons engaged in gainful employment, undertaking training under various programs or engaged in approved charitable work and who are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance. The current rate of the allowance is $51.50 per fortnight. Clause 4 will amend section 1035 of the Social Security Act 1991, which is the principal act, to make disabled persons who cannot use public transport without substantial assistance and who are undertaking jobsearch activities under the competitive employment placement and training program eligible for the mobility allowance. This begs a further question as far as the criteria that are applied to job seekers in regional and rural 'areas of Australia are concerned. They have to go along and approach so many employers per fortnight for so many months and then they have to provide documentary evidence that they have done that.' In some areas that places an onerous responsibility on people on jobsearch and newstart allowances. I do not know whether the department, the government or the minister has looked at this area but quite a number of constituents in my area have certainly expressed concerns about their ability to meet those requirements and in some circumstances the draconian way that the department has without notice cut off their benefits. We seem to be addressing one area, with this mobility allowance being extended towards disabled persons who are actually seeking a job under the jobsearch allowance, but I think that we should be extending it and looking at different criteria for accountability as far as a lot of the recipients of jobsearch and newstart allowances are concerned. The second part of this amendment bill relates to changes to the AAT stay orders. We support the general direction of this amendment in trying to simplify the stay orders with the appeals process of the Department of Social Security, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We agree that it is anomalous that two Department of Social Security clients in a similar situation may be treated differently by the law depending on whether the SSAT or the DSS happen to be in agreement or in dispute-which is crazy. Again, we are getting away from the human aspect of what we are trying to do with this social security legislation. We are trying to help people who are disadvantaged, people who are in a less fortunate situation than ourselves. We need to get away from the situation that we see so often in our electorates: these people are disadvantaged because of rigid policy guidelines and the way they are enforced by some officers in those departments. There is a retrospective element in the debt recovery section of this amendment. The department has given an assurance that the amendment was not intended to result in retrospective application. Steps will be taken to ensure that this will not occur. Why not take steps now and make an amendment to clarify what has happened? Surely that would be the simplest thing to do, rather than have the possibility of coming back to this House in the future with a further amendment. Therefore, we will not oppose this section of the bill, but we will support the coalition's attempt to move an amendment preventing retrospective application of the stay order. The next element of the bill relates to the widow B pension, We propose to support the government amendment to this section. On the mid-north coast of New South Wales:where my electorate is-there has been a big problem with what happens when a partner dies. This amendment attempts to address that problem and now places widows in line with sole-parent pensioners. There appears to be no reason why persons who qualify for the widow B pension should be treated differently from sole parent pensioners in similar circumstances. Therefore, we propose to support this aspect of the bill. The coalition does not oppose changes with respect to the confidentiality amendment. As I understand it, the coalition has been at the forefront of criticising the lack of legislation protecting the confidentiality of client information. The coalition was instrumental in the establishment of the 1991 Senate inquiry in this area and has publicised weaknesses in the department's confidentiality measures. I have some personal concern over the introduction of criminal charges against a person who knowingly releases information. The explanatory memorandum states that this extension might apply: if a person happens to find Departmental papers in the street or at the tip (because of defective destruction or cleaning arran-ements or because of a fire in Departmental premIses); or if information is incorrectly released by the Department (eg, because of an incorrectly addressed fax message). Should the person finding the information know that it is protected information and intentionally record, disclose or otherwise use it, he or she be committing an offence. . Surely, the onus should be on the department to destroy records properly and not to send incorrect faxes. If a mistake is made, it should not be covered up by laying criminal charges against innocent individuals. If anything, it is important that the individual does release the information so that departmental accountability is maintained and the public is aware that the department has not destroyed some information properly. The amount of information that these government departments have on every single Australian is absolutely mindboggling. It is terribly important that this confidentiality aspect is reinforced. This goes part way towards doing that. The next element of the bill 'relates to the value of assets used in primary production. As has been set out by the shadow minister, we' propose to vigorously oppose this element of the bill. The government is trying to amend the legislation so that, where a liability exists in relation to an asset that is in any part exempt for the purposes of the assets test, the apportionment rule should apply. The apportionment rule in this case is that, where a primary production asset whose value is partly exempt for the purpose of the assets test, only that part of the liability relating to the nonexempt asset will be allowed as a deduction. Mr Bruce Scott-Tl)at is an outrage ..",57
184,Mr VAILE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is outrageous. It is interesting to note that the National Farmers Federation, which on occasions during the lengthy debate on the Mabo legislation got into bed with the government, is vigorously opposing this element of the legislation. The National Farmers Federation does not agree with this amendment as it believes that the department has taken an arbitrary approach. It believes that the apportionment is an artificial one and it will lead to inequity and is impractical. The coalition policy is to review the assets test in relation to rural property owners. Therefore, we oppose thi- aspect of the legislation. It is fair to say that rural property owners are in a fairly grey area with regard to the department and assets and income testing. But in these hard times this section of the community should be given all the supwill port it can, instead of the department shutting them off from services. Again, the government is showing a lack of understanding of the difficulties that are faced in rural and regional Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, coming from the area that you represent, you should understand this quite clearly. This section of the community faces totally different problems than those faced by most other sections of the community. Therefore, the rural community should be given special attention and consideration for the circumstances which it faces from time to time. If this government is serious about trying to nurture, cultivate and help the rural sector of our community grow and maintain that productive base from which this country has become so wealthy in past generations, it should seriously consider the impact of this aspect of this legislation. I urge the government to have another look at this. As I said, the opposition will be opposing this eleQ1ent of the bill. With respect to the farming community, we should have a little more understanding of the special circumstancesMr Nehl-A lot more understanding.",59
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Newell)Order! I am sure that honourable members appreciate the interest shown by the honourable member for Cowper and the honourable member for Maranoa in attending the chamber to hear the honourable member for Lyne speak, but it is highly disorderly to interject out of your chair.",59
186,Mr VAILE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We cannot emphasise enough that the rural community, the primary producers who generate a lot of wealth for this country, deserves special consideration under this bill. From time to time, primary producers face particularly difficult circumstances where they require different treatment from other sections of the community. The next element of the bill relates to certain life interests created by wills being an assessable asset. Again, the opposition will be opposing this element of the bill. With the review of the incomes and assets test for pensions imminent-I say imminent because the government has been dragging its feet on this issue since before Christmas-it is not timely for legislation of this nature to be introduced until the findings of the review have been released. We sholJld really wait until that happens. The government would be responsible to wait for that review to take place, unless the minister knows something that we do not know-that the review; or the appointment of the consultant to conduct that review, will take longer than we all originally expected when it was promised before Christmas. This amendment will provide that certain assets are not to be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets under the assets test on pensions and benefits-further scheming by the government with regard to the elderly community. That is a very serious point. A person who has a life interest will not derive any benefit other than the current day income from that benefit, which will become part of the income test anyway. But we are talking about the assets test. That person will never gain any benefit. from that life interest other than the income that would ordinarily be considered in the income test aspect of the assets and incomes test. Personally, I believe that it is unfair to introduce amendment to the bill. We strongly oppose this aspect of the legislation. The elderly have already been given harsh treatment with regard to the most ridiculous legislation that I have seen in my short time in parliament, one element of which is the treatment of any unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments as income. I have spoken three or four times on this particular issue. The majority of the inquiries made of my electorate office relate· to this aspect of the social security legislation and the way this government has treated a lot of the people that it coerced into voting for it in March 1993. Labor used a scare campaign of halftruths and untruths relating to what was going to happen to pensions, how it was going to cost more to live under the GST and how people were not going to be looked after as well under Medicare. Yet, immediately on its return to power, this government has attacked them by considering their unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments as income. There are thousands of cases in my electorate of people being affected; people who have been honest in their dealings with government throughout their lives and who were honest in their dealings with the government when they retired. They paid their taxes and were honest when they declared what investments they had. They went along to the Department of Social Security and said, 'This is what we've got. What level of pension will we get?'. The Department of Social Security assessed what level of pension they were going to be paid and that was subsequently paid. Then the government decided to shift the goalposts and there are people who would now have to be considered to be on the breadline and who are absolutely poverty stricken because of the measures that have been taken. The minister still has not implemented the measures that were promised for conducting a revie- of assets and income testing. I have a constituent who recently moved to Port Macquarie from Sydney. He moved to Port Macquarie and bought a unit there to live this in. At the time, he still owned a property in Sydney. So he had his principal place of residence and another asset - a property in Sydney. He went along and made all of the necessary declarations to the Department of Social Security. The department wrote to him and said, 'This is the pension you are going to be getting'. It was reassessed at the end of last year and Mr Frank Baker was informed that, as. of 23 September 1993, his pension was to be increased from $110.90 to $152.30 per fortnight. That was fine. He . had declared that he had household contents and personal effects at $3,000 and accounts and cash at $210,000. This was based on the fact that he had sold the property in Sydney. The money was sitting in the bank. He had $210,000 sitting in the bank, a $4000 motor vehicle and, at the time, $18 000 worth of managed investments-a total - ombined asset of $236,542 which entitled him to a pension of $152.30 per fortnight. That is okay. Honourable members should remember that he had $210,000 in the bank. He then decided that, as a citizen of Australia, that money was not helping the growth of this country; it was not being used to the benefit of Australia. So he invested it in a managed investment portfolio. He did not invest it all; he invested about $190,000 of it because he bought a car. On 13 January 1994, the department wrote to Mr Baker setting out that his yearly income consisted of bank interest of $960 and, because he had $196,000 invested, income from the managed investment was assessed at $52,526-a phenomenal return in anybody's language considering where inflation and interest rates are today. This gave him a total income of $53,486 in the eyes of the Department of Social Security. He did not have an income of $53,000 to go and pay for his petrol or to buy his bread and his milk. He did not have an income of $53,000 to buy some meat or pay the rates. That was his assessed income from the income and assets test as far as his pension was concerned. On 13 January he received a letter from the Department of Social Security which stated: I am writing to you about your pension payments. Your Age Pension will stopnot be reduced to a certain level, but stopafter 13 January 1994. ' Honourable members should remember that that money is invested in companies that are doing business in and on behalf of Australia and are generating income for this country. Do honourable members know what Mr Baker is going to do? Mr Baker is going to sell his units in managed investments and put the proceeds back into the bank, where it is not going to earn any interest, so that he will get his pension again. This has frightened the hell out of him as far as how he and his wife are going to survive for the rest of their retired lives. The goalposts were moved last year by this government after the March 1993 election. The challenge for the government and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), not only from the opposition but also from all those pensioners out there-the ones the government coerced into voting for it last year-is to bring on this review that was promised at the end of last year into the income and assets test so that we can see some genuine treatment for the pensioners ,of Australia.",59
187,Mr KNOTT,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). Before I actually launch into what I have prepared, there are a few things I would like to pick up on that have been mentioned in the debate. I found it quite outlandish that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) should suggest that this government was forced into the assets management review by the opposition. The reality is that this opposition has forced the government to do not one thing. In fact, if the truth be told that review came about as a result of a number of backbenchers-I was one of them-approaching the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). Like the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I have some problems with assets management. I believe that will be taken into full account when the assets management review puts its deliberations to this parliament. Some other statements were made by the honourable member for Lyne relating to the last election. I would like to look to the future, but unfortunately people keep dragging us back. One of the pieces of paper I have with me is something I used during the election campaign . .It was entitled 'Keating Labor government achievements in social security'. Perhaps I should remind the honourable member for Lyne of some of the things on that. It states: The Keating Government has replaced the hand out system of the past with one that stresses responsibilities as well as rights, and restores dignity to the people who need community help. Social security is about dignity. It continues: Through targeting and sophisticated checks on people's entitlements. the Government provides one of the most comprehensive and effective systems of income support in the world. This system provides built-in encouragement for people to provide for themselves where possible. This is a whole new emphasis on client service. People rece-ving Social Security deserve respect, regardless of their circumstances. I think that statement should be brought home to the opposition. Ii goes on: Pensioners Over the life of the Governmentthis was up until the electionthe pension has increased by over 15% in real terms. Absolute lies had been told in this House that pensioners had money taken from them and that their real income was decreased. It continues: Since November ·1990, pensions have been adjusted for inflation 12 weeks after the CPI reference period. Pensioners also receive Phannaceutical Allowance ... Commonwealth and State fringe benefits will be available to all pensioners from April 1993. The Government is also proposing that home owning pensioners will be able to obtain loans of up to $7,500 annually at concessional interest rates ... The 1992-93 budget contained a mobility allowance for people with severe disabilities in employment of $5 per week. That is very pertinent to this bill because we are extending it. It also contained indexation and extension of the allowance for people with disabilities doing more than eight hours training or voluntary work, a 50 per cent increase in the employment entry payment of $300 and the introduction of a $200 education entry payment: As regards special assistance, the government expanded the multilingual telephone information service to handle up to 500,000 calls a year; put on 40 new staffto expand successful programs in Aboriginal communities aimed at boosting nutrition and parenting skills; created special packages for struggling farmers-I hope honourable members of the National Party are listening; and set up 12 youth pilot projects around the country, getting income support to homeless young people where they live and congregate. For carers, the government extended eligibility for carer pensions from July 1993. Carer pensions will be paid for 42 days respite each year. In protecting taxpayers' money, measures have been taken for new claimant details to be matched and for Social Security to collect tax file numbers of DSS recipients. Those are some of the matters I was able to speak of prior to the election. This government is all about social justice. It actually knows what social justice is and it has a definition for it. Our social justice has been all about unemployed people, families, women, young people, older people, people with disabilities, indigenous Australians and rural communities. Let us just look at some of those things that were highlighted in the 1993-94 budget which those opposite went to extraordinary lengths to stop. Over 500 more places have been created in labour market programs at a cost of $1.3 billion, more than double the amount spent in 1991-92. A community and voluntary work scheme, a community activity program, at a cost of $3 million in 1993-94, has been set up to assist some 7,000 persons to gain up-to-date work experience in useful community activities. There has been funding of $55 million over four years to the Commonwealth Employment Service to undertake a case management approach. An additional 1,650 places have been created under a new enterprise and incentive scheme for unemployed people to set up their own businesses. There have been increases in funding for English as a second language training under both the special intervention program to . provide assistance to rion-English speaking job seekers and the adult migration English program. The total expenditure under these programs is $141 million in 1993-94. On income support, there was an increase of $3 a week in the newstart allowance paid to some 285,000 single adults who do not have children. The introduction of home child-care allowance will provide an independent source of incOJ:ne for dependent partners in 840,000 families while they are out of the paid work force caring for children. Access to rent assistance for about 10,000 homeless and independent unemployed people under 18 years of age has been improved by removal of the 18-week waiting period for rent assistance from March 1994. The Commonwealth dental program,. at a cost of around $280 million over four years, will provide access to free dental services for low income families and other health card holders who are at least able to afford proper dental care. The national women's health program has been extended for a further four years at a cost of $40 miIIion on its recurrent major longitudinal study into women's health. . I have spoken before in the House on child care. ,A cash rebate scheme free of income tests, providing up to $28.20 per week for one child and $61.20 per week for two or more children, is to be introduced from 1 July 1994 for all work related child-care expenses in respect of all children up to 12 years of age. ChHd-care places will be increased by 29,000 to advance the government's commitment to meet the demand fdr work related child care by the year 2001. A seniors health card, to be introduced from 1 July 1994, will provide access to concessions for pharmaceuticals, hearing aids, dental care and optometry services under Medicare. There has been an extension of the students at risk program-the STAR program-for it further two years, at a cost of $13.6 million, to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to complete their secondary schooling. I know that is dear to your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker NeweII, just as it is to mine, as we both come from the teaching profession. A national youth housing strategy is to be developed over the next two years. From June 1994, 10 youth service units are to be established, at a cost of more than $4 million over four years, to provide individual case management for about 3,600 young unemployed people each year, including those who are homeless. More than' $9 million has been aIIocated for new programs to improve the post-school work and study options for young people with a disability, including a new jobnet service to ensure that school leavers with a disability do not lose skills and confiHerald dence if they cannot find work soon after leaving school. There will be 80 part-time school liaison officers who will act as a link between schools, teachers, educational institutions, potential employers and .employment services. More than $17 million has been allocated for a new supported wage system, with income supplemented through the social security system to improve access to the open labour market for people with disability who are unable to work at full award rates of pay. People living in rural and remote areas can look forward to the rural counseIIing program to be boosted by $0.7 miIIion in 1993-94, bringing the total Commonwealth funding for the program to $4 million. That is for people in the bush-my people, whom those opposite would expect to vote for the National Party but did not; they voted Labor. They voted Labor because we care; those opposite do not care. They are good with words, they are good on throwing out these one-liners, but they are not very good on following up. Nearly $4 miIIion is to be provided over the next four years for hostels for school students from rural areas. We 'have a social justice policy. The honourable member for Lyne kept going on about our scurrilous actions in the elections. We have honoured our promises; we have actually done what we said we were going to do. Let us have a look at what has been said about those opposite. Let us look at what the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission said about these nongs. It stated: ... any tax system which fails to recognise the obligations of marriage and family must be described as a system of de facto fiscal discrimination against families. Mr Connolly- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have listened to the honourable member with considerable forbearance for some time, but I would ask that the word 'nong' be struck from the record and that he apologise and withdraw it.",61
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I would ask the honourable member for Gilmore to withdraw it.,63
189,Mr KNOTT,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I will withdraw it; I do not think I will apologise. The Sydney Morning of 16 September 1992---""'let us just get this point-quoted the Catholic Commission: ... any tax system which failsthis is probably what upset the honourable memberto recognise the obligations of marriage and family must be described as a system of de facto fiscal discrimination against families. That is what the Catholic Commission thought of the tax policies of those opposite. The commission also stated: From the point of view of its effect upon the poor and families . . . the dignity of the person and meaning of family life, one must question the moral legitimacy of the GST. That was also quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 16 September 1992. I suggest that, since the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission is questioning the moral legitimacy of the opposition, those opposite should be very careful about how they attack the government for what it said in the last election and what it has delivered. Let us have a close look at some of the things that those opposite are about in social security and compare them with what we are about. Payments for children of low income families have increased in real terms in the past 10 years by 74 per cent for children under 13 and by 147 per cent for teenagers. That is Labor. That is our policy. That is what we have. done. Payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by around 22 per cent in real terms and when increases to rent assistance are taken into account they have increased by about 30 per cent. These are not just spurious claims; these are facts. Those opposite do not like it. The people of Australia have seen through those opposite; they have seen what their policies are about. The basic pension rate has increased in real terms by 14 per cent under Labor. Rent assistance has increased by between 81 per cent and 141 per cent, depending on the target group. The alternative under those opposite was that people were supposedly going to be . compensated for the GST. Because there was a $6 billion hole in the calculations of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the opposition's compensation package directed to social security benefits would have been around $2.6 billion. But the consumption tax policies of the Leader of the Opposition would have cut around $2.4 billion off welfare spending. That means that nearly all the compensation given to social security recipients would have been paid for by taking away benefits from other social security recipients. And the honourable member for Lyne has the gall to ask us to remember the election. He has the gall to put his record against ours. The opposition was going to introduce very tough income testing arrangements for the family allowance, including an upper limit of $55,000 for a family with one child. This income test would take the family allowance away from more than 100,000 Australian families-not individuals, but families. About 90 per cent of families with children are presently eligible for the family allowance. Under the opposition's proposals, only 75 per cent would get the family allowance. Many of these families who lose are not well-off, especially given the costs of raising children. Many two-income families would also lose, even. though they have to bear increasing costs of child care or caring for an elderly family member. What provisions did the opposition put forward for that? There was silence from the opposition because there were.none. Sole parents were also. looked after by us. After the way that the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) denigrated families with one parent, he will be very lucky if a lot of people who are sole. parents, through no fault of their own, do not wreak havoc on him. Fancy denigrating people because they do not have either a father or a mother. It is absolutely outrageous. Then he says, 'Oh, I am not denigrating you, except that all the statistics show that you are bigger criminals and that your propensity to have a good and happy life is down the tube'. If that is not denigrating people I do not know what is. Robert Hudson, the Executive Director of the Victorian Council of Social Service, criticised the opposition's policies and described the consequences as 'horrendous'. In a press release dated 21 November 1991, he stated: The soie· parents affected will be forced into looking for full time work. This will mean that children in this age group will be left alone without a parent before and after school and for at least twelve weeks during school holiday periods ... The honourable member for MCPherson had the hide to say that members opposite were all about parents being with children. What absolute and total hypocrisy. Mr Robert Hudson further stated: The Opposition plan assumes that 12-15 year olds don't need their parents as much as younger childrenThis is the Year of the Familybut any parent of a child knows what an i'!lportant period it is for child development, with peer pressure at a peak and the establishment of life long patterns of educational development being established. It is not as if the Coalition can say that all parents affected will have access to out of school hours child care. Child care for this age group is generally unavailable, and the precious few progmms that exist are very expensive. j,!y Pensioners would have been rorted under the opposition's system of GST; their spending power would have been decimated. The opposition has the gall to suggest that it stands up for them. On the question of disability support, the opposition was planning to make people undergo an annual review in order to maintain their level of benefit. In relation to this, Senator Graham Richardsonnot one of the opposition's biggest fansstated: A 70% impairment level will very often involve paraplegia. One wonders how we are going to wheel paraplegics into have annual medical reviews. I find it extraordinary that anyone would even suggest that a saving would be involved, that suddenly the condition would get better and the lame would walk. I only wish they could. On the question of targeting the unemployed, I am glad that I have time to quote Professor Dick Weatherby ,of Washington University, expert in social security and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University. Profeswhen sor Weatherby warns against further tightenhas ing ,eligibility for welfare payments such as the unemployment benefit. That is exactly what the opposition was going to do with its nine months off the dole scheme. Professor Weatherby said:, In the US, for instance, only one-third of the unemployed can qualify for unemployment benefits, so two-thirds don't get anything at all. You're talking about a lot of desperate, hopeless people. The kind of policies about cutting the dole and limiting it to nine months, cutbacks (in other welfare payments) and talk about decentralising to voluntary agencies, that's in the mould of some of the more regressive US policies and it has left us with a legacy of social division and very serious social problems. We know what the serious social problems are. American cities are in a state of war. They have tanks on the streets busting doors down to get at drug dens. That is the sort of Australia that the opposition was advocating. Before those opposite start rubbishing this government on its record, they should be honest about what that record is. Before they the sole start standing on high moral ground, they should remind themselves exactly what they were standing for on 13 March 1993. They should remind themselves of what Australia would be like today if they had got their way. I would suggest to those opposite that they have nothing to be proud of and that we have everything to be proud of. This country is in a much better state. Thank God for the people of Australia who actually have a bit of intelligence. (Time expired)",63
190,Mrs EASSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) demonstrates that the Department of Social Security is working at a very good level. The regular refinement of provisions of the major act, in pursuit of a more accurate and us-ful piece of national legislation, should be supported by all members of the parliament. The mobility allowance is now to be extended to people with a, disability which impedes their use of public transport. This allowance is paid in relation to their involvean ment in the Jobsearch program. This is an excellent move. The disabled are very upset society assumes that because a person disability X that they are therefore useless. In fact, the existence of a disability very often(promotes a fierce determination on the part of a person to succeed and to rise above the disability. This determination is vital for their psychological well-being. Parliament '. should give the helping hand to these people who are so determined to help themselves.We still have a long way to go in this field of integrating the disabled into the work force, but I think that all members of parliament should encourage the disabled in every electorate to put in the effort to rejoin the work force. Work by itself is a psychological necessity for every human being, including the disabled. The decision to amend the principal act to allow the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to order a stay of a departmental decision, even when the decision has been supported by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, is a welcome extension of flexibility to this very complex field of human activity. Last week, I spoke of the need for government departments to have administrative flexibility. No set of regulations can possibly encompass the full range of problems and situations that human beings can present. The need for a decisive human involvement is vital. If we reject that view the government may as well have computers decide social security decisions on the basis of straightforward applications and endless regulations. As we do not do this and we do involve people, we have to be sensible and allow these people a certain latitude to use their sensitivity and educated intelligence in solving social security problems. The amendment in relation to widow B pensions is a good example. Many widows live to advanced ages and are not always right up to the mark on changes in government regulation. It is a good and decent decision allow departmental officers to supervise these widows pensions and to make the necessary upgradings for them. We all hope for a cooperative Australia. This sort of helping hand for the elderly is a good example to the rest of .bureaucracy of the virtue of being helpful. The needs for confidentiality are well accepted these days and one point that I would bring to the attention of the department is this: all members of parliament have dealings with the Department of Social Security on behalf of their constituents. It would be useful if the department could examine its situation vis-a-vis the privacy of its clients with regard to members of parliament and their staff as authorised agents for the constituents whose problems the members or staff bring before the department. I have encountered difficulties in dealing with the department because it is bound by confidentiality. I have no problem with the general principle, but the particular problem for members of parliament and their staff is one that should be dealt with when next the department looks at this matter. Since the Labor Party came to office in 1983 the government has attempted to target, even more precisely, the usefulness of the social security dollar. Administration costs have been contained and the front desk processes have been greatly improved. The economic difficulties of the 1980s have had a profound effect on Australian society and we owe a great deal to the succession of very competent ministers for social security, including very much the current Minister for Social Security, my electoral neighbour, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin). A key consideration in keeping the Department of Social Security operating properly in the difficult 1980s has been the principle of targeting the social security dollar to where it is actually needed. At this point, I would like to give credit on this matter to the opposition coalition. Generally, the level of cooperation. by opposition members in social security matters has been very high. To their credit, they avoided taking the road of cheap populism and instigating an to undisciplined approach to social security. Whatever difficulties the coalition has encountered in politics since 1983, it is certainly true that all its leadership over those 11 years, including the current one, have actually tried to be responsible and genuinely concerned for those involved, as clients, ""with the Department of Social Security. Government and opposition have, naturally, seen some solutions in different lights. Yet I believe that the opposition has always acted genuinely and out of a real concern for fellow Australians. In this light I support this bill, which prevents some unscrupulous persons from so reorganising their property to present a false image to the department and thus secure benefits to which they are not entitled. The community should realise that both government and opposition are com.mitted to the social security dollar actually gomg to the recipient in need. Phoney accounting will not find any supporters in this House, least of all me. With the rapid ageing of Australia--'a situation that needs urgent and immediate reversal-the clarification of rules concerning retirement villages is most welcome. I urge the department to keep up these market driven retirement arrangements in the years ahead. The new international social security agreement between Australia and Italy is a matter of some controversy amongst some of my constituents affected by the agreement. The implementation of the agreement needs to be done with a maximum of discretion and sensible flexibility. The department should act on the basis that no agreement can possibly cover all human situations. Flexibility and circumspection need to be emphasised when the rules of the agreement are invoked. I am not asking for a special favour; I am asking that the department develop a positive attitude to solving the unavoidable problems that will arise in connection with this agreement. Social security is a rock upon which our civilised society is built. For this system to thrive and do its targeted job, the government must continue to see that the very best of intellectual and administrative talent has been made available for service in this area. We are primarily a society, not an economy. The economy is important because it provides work-which is crucial for human development-and it provides goods and services and profits from which we can construct our high standard of living, which is a necessary ingredient of our higher quality of life. As a society, we need to have a caring regard for our fellow Australians, simply because they are our fellow Australians. I would like to quote the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in yesterday'S Australian: It's not quite set in Australian bones how difficult survival is for Australia; how much everybody else, not consciously but practically, discriminates against Australia and how you rea\1y do have to hang together. These views are a refreshing dash of common sense to balance the often over-heated enthusiasm of other Australians for this or that miracle event which is expected to pave our streets with gold. This call for greater unity, based not on cricket scores but on a cold assessment of the real world, must include our social infrastructure and those Australians who need some help. Our unity is strengthened when all Australians can be confident that Australia will not abandon or neglect them in difficult times. This bill advances this view and helps those Australians who need help. Nobody in this House begrudges this help. I commend the bill to the House.",65
191,Unknown,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.33 to 8.00 p.m.,67
192,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services) (8.00 p.m.)-In summing up, I thank the honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). In particular; I make special mention of my very eloquent and ebullient colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), who in his usual bubbly style gave a very good rendition of the sorts of things that we have done in the Department of Social Security. Mr Ruddock-He wasn't speaking to your script.",67
193,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, he was not speaking to my script; he wrote it all himself. This bill has been called an omnibus bill, but in many respects it is a housekeeping bill. The Social Security Act is a very important and in many ways comprehensive act. I guess that when governments spend the sort of money that we spend on social welfare-something like $30 billion-they have to be careful that they get it right. We have to be careful that the payments are properly targeted and that only those people who deserve and need the payments get them. We cann9t have it both ways. I notice that, as usual, my friend the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the shadow minister for social security, said that this was just another case of our having to fix up legislation that had not b-en d0!le well in the first place. When dealtng wIth such a comprehensive bill, we will never always get it 100 per cent ri-ht. One of the major reasons why we are taking some o- the steps included in this bill is t.hat - artous decisions have made some of the lDtenttons of some of the sections of the bill a bit chancy. All we want to do is make sure that the intention is well known so that in future tribunals will understand the position. I welcome the fact that the opposition will support most aspects of this bill. I will not through the purposes of it because I think they have been carivassed fairly well. Howof ever, I will touch on a 'number of matters which were mentioned by the honourable. member for Berowra. He mentioned the a international agreement with Italy. know. he did not in any way try to demgrate It-I accept that-but he did make reference to the fact that a number of officials had visited Italy and that there had been some expense in the renegotiation of this agreement. J had a fair bit to do with the renegotiation during time that I was the parliamentary secretary the previous Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr honourable Blewett). I went to Rome to start the renegobe tiation proceedings. The document was signed in October, or perhaps even later last year,. the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwm). The renegotiation of that agreement was result of the many representations that. received from the many thousands ofltaltanresponsible., Australians who live in this country and are in receipt of pensions from Italy. Without mentioning any figures, I can say that the amount that this country receives by way foreign exchange from Italy is quite substanhonourable tial arid that the amount of expense that was inc-rred in renegotiating this Vf,ry important only agreement was negligible in that context. The patronati are organisations fun?ed - y the Italian government that help Italtans.lD this country. Mr Speaker, I am sure that, WIth the many people of Italian origin in your electorate, you know exactly what I am talking about. I know that the honourable member for Berowra does as well. Those people lobbied us long and hard to try to fix this agreement, and we did that. I wanted to mention that because it is probably one of the best parts of this bill. The honourable member for Berowra quite correctly says that the confidentiality provisions are a sensitive arell. In the past, unfortunately and regrettably, there have been some breaches in this area. There is no doubt about that. This provision is just another provision trying to ensure that, where possible, we stop these incidences. The winners from this measure are departgo mental clients and the general public, who are being further protected from the improper use information. It is purely a positive measure that will close a loophole that previously allowed certain non-information, such as that person is not a client of the department or ! that that a client has no partner known to the department, to be recorded, disclosed, solicited or offered for use without an offence being committed. Such behaviour is an unsustainable invasion of privacy. Making it an offence cannot be criticised. I understand that both the the Attorney-General's Department and the Prito vacy Commissioner supported the proposal. I can understand the point made by the member for Berowra, but he can assured that we are always looking at the question of privacy. When cases of the privaby cy provisions being violated in any way are brought to our attention, he can rest assureda and this parliament can be certain-that we we will come down very heavily on the people Mention was .also made of another provision in this bill with respect to the value of assets used for the purposes of ascertaining of liabilities used in primary production. The member for Berowra was, concerned about this matter. He said that this was a revenue raising measure. In fact, according to the information that I have received, the proposal has negligible financial impact. We do not expect to be making any money out of this. We are trying to make sure that it is fair so that certain people on large properties are not able.to deduct amo.unts th-t obviously have nothmg to do WIth thetr private residences and the curtilage around them, and that when we value those assets we do so on a fair basis. We are not about allowing deductions for business purposes in so far as they relate to obtaining some sort of pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security. We are very generous in our interpretations of this. In my many and varied travels throughout this cOUl,ltry during my four years as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security I have very often appeared on radio programs. ",67
194,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, I am. I often encourage farmers, in particular, and property owners to test their eligibility in the event that they are entitled to any sort of benefit from the Department of Social Security. In fact, in many instances I go so Jar as to say that farmers who are doing it very tough, and have done it very tough in the past because of droughts and other reasons, should not feel any loss of dignity in approacl}ing the department for help. After all, they are entitled A lot of them, unfortunately, have overinflated ideas of the value of their properties. They do not realise that they can own their own homes and take off liabilities that they might have before their assets are decided. In many instances, they could well have been entitled-and in many instances could still be entitled-to the additional family payment. At the end of the day I usually say to these people, 'Don't worry about any perceived lack of dignity. If you need help, it's there'. I have also advised them-and I do so again here today-that they should ask for a revaluation of their property if they think they may be eligible for some assistance from the Department of Social Security. They might be quite surprised to find that, in these days of falling values and very low values in the country-which hopefully will improve in the future-their property is not worth as much on the open market as they may have thought. This measure is certainly not something which should be opposed in any way. Whilst I appreciatv the opposition's view on it, I think it is a mistaken view. Another issue that was brought up by the honourable member for Berowra was the question of the pensions incomeand assets test review. I want to say a few things about that because it is important. I understand that the honourable member has made it very clear that the opposition will not agree to any legislation that impacts in any way on the pensions income side of the equation. I know that he put out a press release headed 'Government stalling on pensions income and assets test review'. Far from stalling, we are taking a great deal of care to ensure that the selected consultant is best placed to deal with the wide-ranging and complex issues likely to be raised, particularly by the investment industry. A strategy is in place to encourage and facilitate submissions from as many interested parties as possible. The honourable member for Berowra has been advised that the consultant will not be precluded from examining any aspect of the current operation of the income and assets test. These very broad terms of reference mean that taking care of the process to it. at this stage will pay dividends when the review enters its consultative phase later this year. The shadow minister for social security also claims that pensioners with shares and managed investments will continue to be adversely affected. Only two per cent of pensioners are affected by the new rules on shares. The treatment of managed investments has been considerably simplified and encourages the use of superannuation benefits for their intended use in retirement. On 22 December 1993, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) issued a press release whereby he made very clear what was about to take place. He announced that there would be a reference group. It is important to mention the names of some of the people involved and the organisations that they represent. The press release states that the reference group: . .. will provide technical and other specialist advice to the consultant to be engaged to undertake the strategic review of the pensions income and assets tests. The melTIbers of the reference group represent social welfare, pensioner and retiree interest groups as well as industry and have been chosen for their expertise rather than their affiliation to a particular organisation. I want to read this into the Hansard because it is important to see the cross-section of people involved on the reference group. The first member, Mr Christopher Cross, is from the Association of Independent Retirees. I happen to know him quite well. He came and saw me some years ago. He is one of the founders of this expanding organisation. The others are: Ms June Healy, from the Returned Services League of Australia; Mr Laurie Nolan, from the Council on the Ageing; Mr Michael Raper, from the Australian Council of Social Service; Ms Mavis Robertson, from the construction and building industry superannuation scheme; Mr Gerard Thomas, from the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation; Mr John Godfrey, from the Financial Planning Association of Australia; and Mr John Maroney, from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia/Life Insurance Federation of Australia. So the group comprises a very wide cross-section of the industry. These people no doubt have a view about where we ought to go on this. We want to get the process right. We have taken a bit of extra time because we have to get the process right. We have to announce the consultant. I cannot say here and now when the consultant will be announced, but I can certainly assure the shadow minister that he will not have to wait for too much longer. It will be a matter for the minister. I am sure that when the announcement is made the person, whoever he or she may be, will be able to do the job well. I have been encouraging people who have written to meeven members of parliament-on this question of shares and managed investments. I have been making sure that I have been giving them the addressMr Ruddock-Of the department.",69
195,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Of the department, which at the moment is putting all the submissions together. I understand that it is getting mariy submissions. Mr Ruddock-.Unbelievable.",70
196,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, absolutely. The submissions will be looked at not only by the consultant but also, with advice, by the reference group. I also want to mention the question of the penalty interest charge, which has been included in the bill. Basically, there will not be any losers as a result of this measure. I cannot understand why the opposition is opposed to it. The losers will be those persons who either do not repay the debt or do not enter into an agreement to repay the debt to the social security department. Such persons will have the penalty interest imposed. We are unable to quantify the numbers involved, but we can say that such persons will have the penalty imposed. In other words, those who are not prepared, once an overpayment has been raised, to come into some arrangementMr Ruddock-That's not what you are saying.",70
197,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, we are. If they cannot come to some arrangement, we will say, 'You'll have to pay penalty interest'. The winners will be those persons who are unable to pay their debts in full within three months of the debts being raised. Under the current provisions, such persons would have had the administrative charge imposed even if they had agreed to repay the debt in instalments and even if they were making a genuine effort to repay the debt. Taxpayers-that includes the honourable member for Berowra and me-will also be winners because the new scheme should provide an incentive for debtors to either repay their debt or at least enter into an agreement to do so. Compared with the existing system, the new provisions are more equitable. In relative terms, the current system gives favourable treatment to persons with debts in excess of $5,000 because the level of the administrative charge is capped. It also gives favourable treatment to debtors who have the financial resources to repay the debts. Persons who have debts under $5,000 are as relatively disadvantaged as those who, despite being willing to repay their debt, lack the resources to do so within a period of three months and, as a result, have theadministrative charge imposed. The capacity to impose interest in relation to certain debts over $30,000-it is only applicable if a person is prosecuted under section 1350 of the act - d only if the court orders that it is to be imposed-is not used and is, therefore, to be repealed. The honourable member made a point with reSpect to the question of retrospectivity. I understand that that was mentioned by the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills. Mr Ruddock-You'll fix that in the committee stage.",70
198,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes. During the committee stage, I will be moving amendments to fix that up. This bill is simply doing some housekeeping. We are simply making sure that the intentions in the Social Security Act, which may have been misinterpreted or interpreted in a certain way by some of the tribunals, or that may in the future be interpreted not· in accordance with the intent of the government, are being fixed up. As I have often said in this place, there is a responsibility on the government to ensure that we properly target. This bill represents a series of measures changes to the act that we feel are necessary. We have brought· them in under the one act. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra that there is not that much to come forward this year, apart from any budget initiatives and so forth. I cannot tell him they are. We have now come to a situation where we are just about getting it as right as we can. I again thank the honourable members who have spoken in debate. I regret that the opposition will oppose some sections of this bill. I do not think there is any need to oppose them. I hope he will not be calling divisions and everything else, but; knowing the honourable member for Berowra, he probably will. I commend the bill to the House. I guess we will have a bit more to say during the committee stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee Clauses 1 and 2-by leave-taken together.",71
199,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I think this is the best opportunity to raise a general matter relating to the social security legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) has just commented that he does not expect there to be any further amendments during this session. That is a matter which causes me some alarm. Amendments to the social security legislation were dealt with in December and related to the arrangements for payment of a mature age allowance. I understand that amendments to the legislation, which were accepted in this place, were designed to ensure that a person who took up temporary employment for a short period of up to 13 weeks, and who then experienced unemployment again, would be able to go back on to the mature age allowance without necessarily having to satisfy a qualifying period of 12 months on the jobsearch benefit, which is a condition precedent. Because of a view that has been formed as and to the adequacy of the drafting, which the parliament presumably has been involved in, Igather that the intention of the amendment, which was clear and accepted, may not have been fully met and that the department now has a view that it cannot allow recipients of what the mature age allowance to have short periods in the work force and then go back on the mature age allowance without a qualifying period. That is a matter of some concern to me. I have had it ·confirmed that that difficulty has arisen. Obviously, it would require some furt-er amendment. As we are discussing the application and commencement of the legislation and amendments in clauses 1 and 2, I thought that this would be the most appropriate place to raise that matter. I would just like to have the parliamentary secretary's assurance that his view that there will be no further amendments required this session will not preclude the basis for remedying that defect being found.",71
200,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services) (8.22 p.m.)-I have been made aware of that particular problem. When I said that I did not expect there to be further legislation, I did not make it carte blanche. We will not continually be introducing bills and we should try to do everything we can on this bill. My understanding is that the amendment, which I think we accepted, as drafted by the Australian Democrats, did not have the effect that it was supposed to have. We are obviously quite concerned about it. We are looking at ways and means of making sure that somewhere along the line we fix that up. Whether it be in the context of this bill in the Senate or in a subsequent bill not too far down the track is something which I will have to leave in abeyance for the time being. I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) for that observation.",71
201,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I thank the parliamentary secretary for his assurance. I will help the government by ensuring that people who are interested in the matter are aware of the government's intentions. Clauses agreed to. Clause 3.,72

These amendments relate to Administrative Appeals Tribunal stay orders. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 concern the application of part 4 and schedule 1 of the bill. Part 4 of the bill creates a recoverable debt of an amount paid to a social security client. under an AAT stay order. If the AAT ultimately finds against the client, schedule 1 contains consequential amendments. The bill currently provides that these provisions will apply to AAT stay orders made before or after the day of royal assent. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 will ensure that these provisions only apply to debts arising from AAT stay orders made on or after the day of royal assent. These amendments take account of comments made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills about the retrospective nature of part 4 and schedule 1 of the bill.",72
203,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I welcome the government's agreement that these are appropriate amendments. They should be undertaken to ensure that the concern which the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had, that the bill may have retrospective impact in relation to these matters and that that would be undesirable, is met.

I have tabled the explanatory memorandum for the previous amendments. The amendments in part 7 of the bill are extremely complex and difficult to interpret. Amendment No. 3 will ensure the same policy outcome using a simpler legislative approach. Section 1121 of the Social Security Act allows the value of an individual asset to be reduced by the value of any liability secured against that asset for the purpose of the assets test. It also provides for a situation when a liability is secured over a mixed asset. A mixed asset is one that comprises both assessable and exempt components; for example, land being farmed versus the home and curtilage. Importantly, if the liability is related to a mixed asset, then that part of the liability that relates to the exempt asset is calculated and ignored so that it cannot reduce the value of assessable assets. Method statement to in paragraph (l)(b): the result is called the to in paragraph (l)(b) that are exempt assets: the exempt primary production asset value. ""exempt assets"" see subsection (4). referred to in paragraph (1)(b) are exempt assets, the exempt primary production asset value is nil. from the amount obtained in Step 1: the result is primary production asset value. referred to in paragraph (l)(c): the result is called to work out the value of the exempt primary from the amount obtained in Step 4: the result is primary production liability. liability away from the non-exempt primary the value of the person's Jlrimary production asset. (2) the following subsection: x exempt primary production asset value gross primary production asset value '., (3) 'Step 3' and substituting 'Step 7'; assets whose value is to be disregarded under secSection 1121A was inserted in 1991 as a beneficial measure for farmers. It allows primary producers to aggregate their assets and liabilities relating to primary productiori. For example, if a farmer has a harvester worth $80,000 but the liability secured over it is $100,000, then under section 1121 its value would be nil. However, under section 1121A the $20,000 deficit can be offset against the value of other primary production assets. As is the case with section 1121, an intention of section 1121A was that, if primary production liabilities are related to primary production assets that are mixed assets, then that part of the primary production liabilities relating to exempt assets would be calculated' and ignored so that they cannot reduce the value of assessable assets. In a recent Social Security Appeals Tribunal case, section 1121A was interpreted as not achieving that intention. This interpretation would give fanners unintended advantage. It would mean that the value of assessable primary production assets would be reduced by the value of liabilities associated with exempt assets. Also, this would be inconsistent with the way liabilities related to nonprimary production assets ar- treated. Amendment No. 3 gives effect to that original intention, as did the amendments currently in the bill, in a relatively simple way. Amendment No.3 achieves the intention primarily by expanding the method statement in subsection 1121A(2). The method statement sets out how to work out the value of a fanner's assessable primary production assets for assets testing purposes. The expanded method statement makes it clear that both exempt primary production assets-for example, fann, home and curtilage-and related liabilities will not be included in the value of assessable primary production assets.",72
205,Mr RVDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As I understand it, we are seeking, firstly, to address the question of whether clauses 27, 28 and 29, as first proposed, should stand or be omitted. The government will be seeking to have those clauses omitted and it will have our support. The government will then s-ek to substitute a new clause 27, the question being that the part proposed to be substituted be substituted, and it will face our opposition. Let me make clear what we are dealing with. The government seeks to give effect to its intention in relation to assets used for primary production purposes. The government wishes to substitute an amendment designed to give effect to what it says was its original intention; that is, where any part of a liability existing in relation to an asset used for primary production is exempt, against which moneys have been borrowed, an apportionment rule should apply to both the asset and the liability. I am satisfied with what the government says is its stated intention, that the new clause is simpler and perhaps better achieves the government's purpose than the clauses that were' originally drafted. We would not want to hamper the government in any way in proposing the best possible draft to achieve its intention. Our view is that the intention does not deserve support. We think the imposition of the assets test generally on primary productive properties is harsh. I know that does not correspond with the government's view. The government sees its asset test as being generous. I read something to that effect on page 31 of the explanatory memorandum. I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) say again tonight that, when he goes on the air and speaks to people about primary producing properties, he will tell them that they are being looked after. I am not sure that all those people who would be stripped of the opportunity of obtaining a benefit in situations such as drought, pestilence, fire and flood, particularly when they have no income, would regard it as particularly generous to be told, 'We're terribly sorry; your assets are of such a value that you're not able to obtain a benefit. You ought to realise on those assets or come to some other arrangement to borrow against them in that situation of hardship'. Our view has always been that the assets test proposed by the government is harsh and, to that extent, unconscionable. It is our view that it is by no means generous. We did not regard the government's original stated intention' as being generous. We do not regard the variation that the government is proposing now as being generous. For that reason, we will oppose it. We are not alone in our view. The National Fanners Federation does not agree with the government's amendment. It thinks the department has taken a somewhat arbitrary approach on this matter. It believes that the apportionment rules fail the test of equality > and practicability. I made this point this afternoon when I was addressing the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) during the second reading debate. The arbitrary nature of this arises when we' consider that the test as to what we include when we are borrowing money as security is imposed by the lendirig institution. I imagine that there are situations in which primary producers are not seeking to have their home, which is separate from the primary producing property, included in the security. But the parliamentary secretary knows the nature of financial institutions; they are not prepared let any security go. They want to include it for the purposes of securing their liabilities. In my view, apportioning the debt in that way, rather than treating it as a debt relation to the primary income producing asset, is a fair and proper way to deal with The government has told us what its intention was, but obviously the government's tribunal did not understand its intention. It came to another view about the way in which these provisions, as drafted, should be interpreted, and it gave effect to that view. Earlier in the day the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) likened these particular provisions to tax avoidance arrangements-bottom of the harbour arrangementsand suggested that the farming community was involved in some scheme to undermine the fabric of the social security regime. I reject that view in its entirety. This is a situation wherein primary producers are entitled to look at the law and to apply it, as it has been drafted, to their particular circumpeople stances. One should not be drawing inferences about their conduct because the law has been drafted in a particular way. The opposition is prepared to allow the law to remain as it has been interpreted by the government tribunals that deal with these matters. The opposition is prepared to oppose the amendments, both those that were originally put forward and those that were substituted, because it sees the status quo as being a small advance on the present situation. It is the opposition's position that the government's assets test regime, in any of its amended forms, is not the appropriate one to apply to assets involved in earning primary production income. For that reason the. opposition will be opposing this particular measure.",74
206,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services) (8.38 p.m.)-The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) will always want to oppose something, but he is opposing this bill on the wrong premise. Let me make it clear that we do not anticipate any revenue raising from this bill. The honourable member makes it to sound as though this bill is simply a revenue all raising measure and that it will disadvantage some people. It is not the case, however, that it will disadvantage someone, nor will it raised in advantage the government. The honourable member well knows that it. the hardship provisions contained in the act make it very clear that in the case of drought, pestilence, fire or whatever, where a family has no income, that family can go to the Department of Social Security-the mechanism is already in place-and receive something from the department. There were enough examples during the recent bush fires in New South Wales. We are simply trying to tidy up an area where a tribunal has interpreted things against the intention of the act. As I have said before, we are fairly compassionate in such matters. ' We recently eased the assets test withdrawal rate. We recently introduced the seniors health card. Two hundred thousand people will be helped by that measure. In the main, they are who are assets rich and income poorthe sorts of people that the honourable member is talking about. Those opposite do not have a mortgage on shedding tears for people, such as farmers, who have been doing it tough. The government has actually done something about it rather than talk about it. Frankly, I find the reasons given by the honourable member for Berowra for opposing these amendments somewhat strange. We know that the opposition has a philosophical antagonism towards the assets test. We feel that we are being extremely fair. We feel that in cases of genuine hardship people will continue to be looked after as they have been in the past. The government will continue to force the amendment. .r",75
207,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (8.41 p.m.)The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) would have us believe that there are no revenue consequences associated with this amendment. In other words, there will be no savings at all. People will not be denied benefits under these provisions because they will be entitled to them under other provisions. If the parliamentary secretary wants us to believe that, it is nonsense to press the case. I suspect that the parliamentary secretary needs to find an argument to justify the government's position. It may be that this provision provides relief for perhaps one or two dozen people. Maybe, compared with the figures we normally think of, the amounts are not large. But, as far as I am concerned, if applies to one or two dozen, then it is valid and the point I have made is valid. It has to apply to only one person for it to be valid. the parliamentary secretary is right in saying that the amendment has no effect, then, for heavens sake, I would not bother pressing for it and I would not waste the time of the parliament with it. I would not have spent the amount of time that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and its advisers have spent on drafting these provisions if it was to have so little effect.",75
208,Mr CLEELAND,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I fully support the government's proposal in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). I am always amused in this place when members of the opposition stand up and suggest, with a great deal of moral fervour and feigned outrage, that what we do in terms of the social security income and assets test is wrong. One only has to pick up Fightback to find out where the opposition really stands in terms of decency, morality and concern for people. The opposition could not have cut $10 billion from Commonwealth expenditure and expected ordinary pensioners and those recipients of social security to have survived. We from Victoria know full well what the opposition's policies are and what they stand for as we see Jeffrey Kennett and the new right cut a swathe of devastation through Victoria-the people the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) says he represents. Rural Victoria is being devastated by . the opposition's friends and colleagues in the new right-the opposition's policies. Because those opposite have no standing in these debates, I point out to the chamber and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) that, unlike most people here, I know something about social security law. In 1991, 1992 and 1993until 13 March-I sat on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal as a legal member. I am familiar with the Social Security Act 1991, the changes that were wrought from the 1947 act and the enormous number of changes that have been imposed by this government on recipients of benefits and payments under the it act. I cannot say that - am entirely happy with what has occurred. The best thing I have heard in the last few months is that the If government has agreed properly to institute an inquiry into the assets and income test. When constituents ring me or write to me saying that they have $8,444 in Commonwealth Bank shares and that the legislation requires the department to impose",76
209,The CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Order! I remind the honourable member for MCEwen that this is a committee stage debate. We have before us the amendment circulated by the government, the effect of which is to omit part 7. The question before the chair is that the part proposed to be omitted stand. I understand that the honourable member has made some introductory remarks, but I hope that he will now speak to the question before the chair.",76
210,Mr CLEELAND,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I take note of what you have said, Mr Chairman. I point out that we are debating in the committee stage the amendments to the assets-income test and the changes to the joint ownership of rural properties. Joint ownership relates to the effect of assets and the rate of pension applicable. What I am saying relates to part 7. Whilst the government is appropriately acting to ensure that those who have assets utilise them for the benefit of their retirement, there are limits to a nominal shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank being deemed as 50 per cent income. rural That is entirely within the confines of the part 7 amendment. I am pleased that the parliamentary secretary has stressed the government's examination of the adverse impact of legislation enacted by a former government. I draw the attention of the chamber to the enormous long-term problems of ageing which the amendment is aimed at correcting. My ageing father has Alzheimer's disease. My mother, who died very recently, had early senile dementia. So I am very familiar with the problems of pensioners gaining benefits under the act and the problems of hostels and nursing homes. I urge opposition members to get off their high horse, to get off the nonsense they talk about, and support the government's approach to tackling the long-tenn problems of ageing. It is time opposition members came over and agreed with government members who understand these problems. They should understand that, unless this parliament starts legislating to ease the long-tenn problems of the ageing, to ensure that those with assets start utilising Duffy, M. 1. them for their retirement, they will leave a legacy that will be paid for not only by my grandchildren but also by the children and grandchildren of those opposite. I ask opposition members, for once in their political careers, to come over and join us in recognising this problem. Despite the pain that I as a member of parliament sometimes have in considering these matters and the problems we have created in trying to resolve these issues-I personally think we need to go in different ways but we are trying to get there-I urge opposition members to support the government's legislation and to embark on the painful task of recognising income and' assets. As a son of a parent who is going through this problem, I recognise the need to bring in income and assets. Whether I am here or not, and as much as I may not like it, I know that one day a government, Labor or coalition, will say, 'If you have any assets and Walker, F. 1. you are retired, you will use those for your retirement before you get a penny'. For once in the political lives of those opposite, I urge Aldred, K. J. them to get some decency and honesty in their program for the aged. Collectively, let us Atkinson, R. A. try to resolve the problem for aged people, and for children of the aged who do carry some of the financial problems. Amendment negatived.

211,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"Berowra) (9.00 p.m.)The provisions we are now dealing with are in part 8 and part 9 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). They relate to assets and income testing. Part 8 deals with life interests created by a person's deceased partner, which are to be included as an assessable asset. Part 9 deals with modification of the assessable period in relation to investment income. Again, I make it clear that, in relation to each of these matters, the opposition will not agree to any further amendments to social security legislation or veterans affairs tion which seek to amend, enhance, develop or modify in any way whatsoever the income and assets testing regime until the independent inquiry-commissioned, I might say, by this government under duress-has been undertaken, completed and its report presented to parliament. All honourable members would be aware that the government made its announcement in relation to this matter last year. The tenns of reference were settled. It was to take the heat off the government in relation to the unconscionable provisions relating to shares and the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of income testing. It was also arranged to take the heat off the government in relation to the large numbers of people who were receiving modifications to their pension as a result of the provisions dealing with the treatment of managed investments. The government wanted the pensioner community to believe that it was embarking upon a genuine inquiry designed to address all of these matters. Earlier in this debate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) told us that no matter was beyond the purview of this inquiry. So it was very clear that the matters PAIRS that could be looked at would inClude not just assets testing and income testing generally, Hewson, J. R. but also these very specific issues which have hurt many people in the community in ways which I find quite unbelievable. I have had thousands of complaints. My colleagues have had large numbers of complaints. We are all aware of pensioners with very modest investments-very often set aside in order to pay for their funerals, to have the house painted, to carry out some minor plumbing repairs or whatever-which have come back to haunt them and have led to their receiving very substantial reductions in their income. Recently the government has been lauding the huge increases in share prices as a result of the increase in the all ordinaries index. The government has been saying, 'Isn't this great for Australia?'. But I can tell honourable members that if they were pensioners who legislahad some money in shares acquired since August 1992, or if they had a modest amount of money invested in a managed investment where some of those investments might well be shares, when these adjustments were taking place they would have been looking at a downward adjustment of their pensions. People have been left with amounts as small as $90 a fortnight on which to live where previously they were receiving the full pension. This is a situation that needs to be addressed quickly. Instead, we find the government foreshadowing an inquiry to be undertaken by a consultant that it is yet to engage. The consultant is to be assisted by a reference group. The parliamentary secretary tonight introduced us to the reference group. In it were people whom I suggested to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). I have no problem with the fact that there is a reference group. Some of the people involved are admirably equipped to undertake the task. The government has sought to get a group of people with a wide range of backgrounds representing a wide range of organisations. However, we sti11 do not know who wi11 be undertaking the task of conducting the inquiry. I certainly do not know who it is. Mr Sciacca-In due course.",78
212,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"The parliamentary secretary says, 'In due course'. This is the inquiry that is to report tentatively by July and be in a position to give a final report by September this year. It is now February, and a report is to be expected by halfway through the year. I do not believe that any consultant should be expected to reasonably undertake this task in that time frame without enormous difficulty. The government is stalling in this matter. The parliamentary secretary disputed that. He said, 'It is far from stalling. We are open to having all these matters reviewed. Only two per cent of pensioners are affected. So one ought not to be worried about the delays'. That is what he is really telling us. Only two per cent of the people are affected, so do not be worried about the delays. The fact is that there is a large number of people-I think running into hundreds of thousands-who are affected by the provisions relating to managed investments. Mr Gibson-You have plucked that out of the air.",79
213,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"No, I did not pluck that out of the air. I have had the briefings from the department in which we were identifying the numbers of people-the winners and losers-in relation to these provisions. The figure of hundreds of thousands is a genuine and proper figure. In relation to shares, I admit that the figure was first something of the order of 100,000 or so..,.... I think it was 120,000. After the government made its modifications it reduced the figure to a mere 10,000. When we are talking about those sorts of numbers we are talking about hundreds in every electorate around Australia. We are talking about the hundreds of people who have been writing to my colleagues and the thousands of people who have been writing to me on this matter. I am surprised by the honourable members opposite who seem to be able to take this matter in their stride and wh<;> do not seem to be worried about the fact that an inquiry can be announced, but they do nm know where. All they know is that the department that advised the government in relation to introducing these provisions, and the department that has administered these provisions, now has the job of collecting the submissions that people are invited to make. This task is being undertaken, in effect, by the very department whose arrangements are to be the subject of the review. Mr Gibson-You know it is an independent consultant.",79
214,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"Let us know the name of the consultant and where that consultant can be written to for the purposes of sending submissions. Mark my words: I have a mailing list of thousands of people to whom I will send those details when the inquiry has been formally put on foot. But at this stage there is no inquiry; at this stage there is no consultant. We will not agree to amendments that are designed to enhance assets testing, modify assets testing, enhance income testing and modify income testing until this process has . been completed. So the quicker those opposite get on with the job, the quicker the inquiry is undertaken, the quicker they can start looking at modifications in relation to these matters.",79
215,Mr SCIACCA,NOES,Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services) (9.09p.m.)-I wi11 just make a few comments. Mr Ruddock-I didn't think you were going to speak.,79
216,Mr SCIACCA,NOES,"I was not going to speak, but the honourable member for' Berowra goaded me into it. There is no aspect of the current operation of the income and assets test which the consultant will be precluded from examining-and I repeat that. When we do something like we are doing now, a review of the pension income and assets test, we. cannot do it overnight; we have to get it right. We. cannot just pluck people out of the air overnight to form a reference group. We cannot just grab some bloke overnight from anywhere and say, 'You're going to be our independent consultant'. We have to do it properly. We have to put together the objects of the review, the terms of reference of the review. Mr Ruddock-Some of them have already been announced.",79
217,Mr SCIACCA,NOES,"Yes. We showed you, the Democrats and everybody else-exactly. We have gone ahead and got the reference group. I read out to you the members of that reference group some of whom, you yourself say, you suggested.",80
218,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order! The parliamentary secretary should address his remarks through the chair.,80
219,Mr SCIACCA,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would love to know from the honourable member for Berowra which of the ones on that list he does not agree with. Looking at that list, I see that there is substantial collective expertise amongst those people. They are drawn from pensioner groups, the Association of Independent Retirees, the Financial Planning Association and life and superannuation organisations. I cannot think of anyone else that we could have properly put on. All Iask of the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition is for them to be a little more patient on this matter. I can assure them that it will not be long before a consultant will be appointed and, in due course, in the not too distant future, announced by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin).",80
220,Mr FILING,NOES,In the fullness of time.,80
221,Mr SCIACCA,NOES,"It will not be in the fullness of time; it will be shortly. I am very concerned that the honounible member for Berowra and those opposite would take this head in the sand attitude and just blindly oppose everything simply because they have this-I say-feigned indignation at this income and pension review. The government will be proceeding; we will be going ahead with what we are doing here. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra again that, if he is a little more patient, it wiU not be too much longer before he knows the name of the consultant, he or she, and the honourable member can then send in all the submissions. Indeed, if he wants to send the thousands of submissions which he says he has, he can send them to the department now. I will guarantee that they go to the consultant. He need not worry about it. He does not even have to wait for us to name the consultant. He can arrange to send those submissions to us. He can send them to me, if he wants to, and I will make sure that they are referred on. I cannot be any fairer than that. Question put: . That clauses 30 to 36 be agreed to. The committee divided. [9.16 p.m.] (The Chairman- Mr H.A.

222,Mr CONNOLLY,NOES,"Bradfield) (9.23 p.m.)Mr Speaker, the Public Service (parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill. implements the Beale, J. H. recommendations of a committee which was established by your predecessor, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MACLeay), and by the former President of the Senate. Without any further delay to the House, I should say that the opposition does not support this proposal. The implementation of this proposed legislation is but the third attempt made over recent years to reduce the number of parliamentary departments. The record goes back some years. The most recent proposal contained in the majority report of the Advisory Committee on the Proposed Creation of a Department of Parliamentary Infonnation and Reporting Services intends to merge the current Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff into a new department called the Department of Parliamentary Library and Reporting Services; Mr Speaker, the explanatory memorandum claims, as does your second reading speech, that there wiJI be no financial impact as the PAIRS new department's appropriation will be the same as the total of the previous appropriations to the departments to be abolished. It goes further than that. In the discussion and in the report it is claimed that· there will be savings of about $1 million over the period of a full parliament. This was, among other elements of the initial report, contested by the minOrity-which consisted of Senator Baden Teague, Senator Margaret Reid and then Senator Karen Sowada of the Democrats-in its report. The dissenting report gave six reasons for rejecting the majority report's views and opposed any amalgamation of the two departments. Briefly, the reasons for opposition were that the independence of the Parliamentary Library would be compromised; the proposal was opposed by senior parliamentary officers, particularly the Clerk of the Senate and the Deputy Parliamentary Librarian; any possible savings were not guaranteed, although I note - hat the Department of Finance has made some commitmentS in that regard; previous proposals to amalgamate parliamentary departments were s,trongly opposed by senators, and for that reason were not pro"" ceeded with; the proposal is ultimately about control and does not give sufficient importance to efficiency or service to members and senators; and, finally, the conduct of the inquiry was regarded as unsatisfactory in that the adviso,ry committee was not appointed by the parliament but by the Presiding Officers and, consequently, its proceedings were not open to the public, nor was evidence taken in the normal manner. These reasons stand and they are, basically, the reasons why the opposition has decided not to support this proposal. Perhaps the most important consideration the question of the independence of the Parliamentary Library. The view put forward by my colleagues in the Senate is that the proposal will compromise the independence observation of the library and prevent the. library from fulfilling its objectives and responsibilities the parliament. This is certainly a view the majority of senators appear to have conrected sistently held on every other attempt that been made to change the structure of the parliamentary departments over recent years. The majority report devotes a considerable amount of its findings and recommendations to an attempt to answer this concern regarding the independence and integrity of the Parliaministrative mentary Library service and address .the change substantial expressions of concern which the ly stands. committee obviously received. Notwithstanding those attempts to answer the concerns, the majority report, in the view of the minority report, still fails to ensure a solution. The. recommended amendments to the proposal and additional safeguards suggested in the majority report were not seen as providing a solution to the fundamental compromise inherent in the amendment. Consequently, the only adequate solution which is put forward is to retain the Parliamentary Library as currently constituted-in other words, .as one of the five separate departments of the parliament. Much emphasis was placed in the report on overall efficiency. It was made quite clear, for example, in the' identification of services. Page 3 of the report states: Identifying those services' and functions will involve a significant coordination task in reaching an agreed strategic vision. The implementation of that strategic vision will require technical agreement and co-operation to determine deliverables and then, in conjunction with the Presiding Officers, Senators and Members and the Chamber departments, setting priorities as to the order in which services should be provided. In other words, the point which the minority report makes, and which is certainly supported by the opposition, is that even if the effort were made to incorporate the two departments, there would be really no guarantee that the necessary degree of coordination would follow. Similarly, it is put forward that more is adequate coordination could also be achieved without necessarily having to change the fundamental structure of the departments. I was particularly intrigued to note one in the report to the effect. that it is necessary to have a totally separate adminto istrative machine for every departtnent.It is which my understanding-and I stand to be corif I am wrong-that there are a number has of cases where departments have been establishedin the past where the administrative services were provided by a different department. There is the whole issue as to whether or not administrative savings can be achieved by the combination of, effectively, two adunits into one without having to the fundamental structure as it currentIt was also pointed out that there are savings to be made. That is an interesting observation because .the report does not really guarantee those savings. In recent days I have had reason to make some observations about the fact that the Parliamentary Library is about to have a. significant facelift. Essentially, the facelift will involve changes to the lobby of the library which Will cost in excess of $500,000. So, half a million dollars-about the basic saving anticipated from these proposals-will be gobbled up almost immediately because we are to have a remodelled entrance to the library. It is claimed that this remodelling was recommended by the Auditor-General. It is true that the Auditor-General conducted a project audit on aspects of the Parliamentary Library. Recommendation No. 21 of his audit report No.6 of 1991-92 states: The ANAO recommends that as part of the structural review the Department of the Parliamentary Library considerand I draw the attention of the House to the word 'consider'the following additional measures to enhance client orientation . . . He mentions the introduction of a common inquiry point. At the end of that paragraph, he states: This recommendation was suggested to the ANAO by the DPL reflecting work currently underway within the Department to improve the ease of use by clients and the efficient use of staff resources. It is abundantly clear to anyone who sees the entrance to the library that the expenditure of $500,000 at this stage on that particular proposal is very hard to justify. The point has been made by various sources, including in a response to a question which I put on notice, that the Parliamentary Library Committee was reported to have supported these changes. I draw further attention to the fact that the Parliamentary Library Committee does not have any executive power; it merely has the power to advise. It is true that the committee noted in its minutes at meetings in May 1992, August 1992, September 1993 and, recently, on 15 December 1993 that this proposal was going forward, but it has never had the authority to actually influence the final events. It has also been claimed that this proposal flows from the recommendations of the Auditor-General. As I have just pointed out, I think the Auditor-General was really drawing attention to the recommendation which had been given to him in the process of his efficiency audit by sections within the library. It is quite clear that the library as a whole is somewhat divided on this subject. In these straitened times, one would have to seriously ask whether half a million dollars could not be spent more effectively than in the way proposed. I do not wish to hold up the House unduly on this matter, but it is a sensitive issue and one which essentially has to be determined by both houses of parliament and by all members in it. The services of the five parliamentary departments, particularly the library, probably have more bearing on the capacity of members to carry out their responsibilities than any other service, apart from that provided by the management of the two chambers. Consequently, if there is a significant degree of . concern in the parliament about these proposals-regrettably, that appears to be the case-I strongly suggest that they not be proceeded with, as was the decision taken on the other occasions when reforms of this nature were put forward. Consequently, the opposition has decided not to support this legislation.  very pleased to speak in support of the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill. Mr Robert Brown-And we are pleased to have you speak, too.  ber for CharIton for his kind remarks. Mr Speaker, you personally introduced this legislation into the chamber. I must say that I am somewhat shocked to learn from the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), that the opposition will not be supporting these measures. Mr Leo MCLeay-He is not the shadow; he is the shadow of the shadow.  er, no. Mr Leo MCLeay-He is the shadow who just got in by the skin of Bronwyn's teeth.  shadow. But this is a serious matter, and I do not want to. traverse matters raised earlier in the statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the long overdue reforms to procedures-reforms which I particularly welcome. I also feel that this legislation is an important part of that reform process. Mr Speaker, if my memory serves me correctly, it was one of your predecessors, Joan Child, and the then Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), who first mooted these reforms. Discussion continued under the reign of the honourable member for Watson as Speaker. I want to say that I very much share with the honourable member for Watson his keen interest in and concern for the function and form of the parliament,as well as his belief in its need to be reformed and updated. In an era in management where we are getting flatter organisations and more accountable executives with greater responsibilities, I am absolutely staggered that a Liberal Party spokesman is arguing that this parliament, in its new environs, needs five permanent heads to report to the Presiding Officers. I have never heard anything run counter to modem management practice more than that which was uttered from the lips of the honourable member for Bradfield. In fact, I am shocked and surprised that he should be advocating such a thing at all. It would be absurd if we could not amalgamate two of the departments. One of those two departments, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, has under its purview the Hansard Divisionwhich deals with the actual transcribing of speeches-the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, and the Sound and Vision Office. Those services are all within one department-an administrative reform again prompted by the honourable member for Watson. I do not know why that department cannot amalgamate with the Parliamentary Library. All these sections deal with either information systems, or computer systems. I do not know why they cannot come under the umbrella of one department. Mr Speaker, if there is a criticism to be made it is that I think you have gone overboard in trying to protect the right of the chief librarian and the Chief Hansard Reporter to go to you directly, thereby bypassing the statutory office-holder. I also note that you have provided the opportunity to have a library report. However, while everyone in this House would share the view that the library must be free and independent and able to provide worthwhile advice to members of parliament, that does not obviate the necessity for good management and the provision of client services on time and in the manner and form that members ,of parliament require. I can report that members of my staff have had some very good service from the library but, frankly, my experience of it has been more than disappointing. To give a recent example, because of my interest in the child support scheme I was desperate for what I thought would be independent, impartial advice about a certain matter relating to that scheme. I was advised that I would be contacted by the head of a particular research unit in the library. I am still waiting for the call,. Whilst 'I am grateful for the library and admire it, and I would be the first to defend its independence, I do not want us to go around believing that there is nothing new under the sun, and that nothing can be changed or made more efficient. We live in an era where every dollar has to give us more bang. The days of being able just to front-end load services are over. When I look at the industrial landscape of Australia and see the changes that have been made towards flatter, more responsible organisations, and fewer departments, I cannot understand the opposition arguing that this parliament, in its new environs, needs to be exempt. Every member of parliament would dearly love to have a position on their staff to allow a person to be trained or be able to hire an additional research officer. Frankly, governments of the, day-whether Labor or Liberal - I suspect are always going to be coy about it. Members of parliament and their staff have got to provide more services with the same amount of resources and we will have to ensure that we take advantage of every technological innovation that will improve our, productivity and extend our reach to our constituents. We ought to be proud of some aspects of our parliamentary democracy with itsdistinctive features. I can well remember that when I wanted to see my local federal member or local state member I had to go into the Commonwealth Centre in Phillips Street or to Macquarie Street. Electorate offices were not known then. There was a revolution of change which established .local offices in each electorate. Then there was the saga of increasing the staff. But those staff increases have been in response to increasing needs of constituents. So the more facilities we have and the more productive we are, the better we are able to respond to our constituents. When we put party politics aside, that is the essence of being a member of parliament. In this new department there is the wherewithal for that extra productivity. When I first came into this House computers were unheard of. The most fancy bit of equipment was an electric typewriter. Then the Department of the Senate-there used to be almost open warfare between the Department of the Senate and the Department of the House of Representatives-,Mr Leo MCLeay-There still is.  improvement. The Department of the Senate forced the issue with computers for senators. I am grateful that it did because it ushered in a whole new change in the way we operated and communicated with our constituents. We have gone a long way from the time when we were given a computer in Parliament House but were not going to get. one in our electorate office. I remember that I had an Apple lIE . computer at home. I brought it into the electorate office and stitched it up with an appropriate interface to the electric typewriter. 1 thought how brilliant I was being able to chum out 300 letters in about three days. Now we can produce letters at the rate of eight a minute and we are looking at being provided with better quality printers which print about 12 or 16 a minute. PISO has a fundamental role to play there. We can access the records of Hansard either from our Parliament House offices or our electorate offices. That is unheard of. It is a pity that we cannot access some of the information in the library, which the opposition is concerned to preserve in its old-fashioned way, from either our electorate offices or our Parliament House offices. All members of parliament have now been given the opportunity to have a mobile phone. I predict that over the next few yea·rs honourable members will require laptops and will want to be able to interact both with Parliament House computer based systems and their electorate offices from wherever they are in Australia, provided the mobile phone has the reach. That is again going to increase our strike-power and our accessibility and will probably put even more demands upon members of parliament. The point I am trying to make is that, whilst some institutions have served us well in the past with their current structures, from time to time we have to move forward. This is a logical move forward and it is consistent with what is done in outside enterprises and other institutions. The opposition is saying that the integrity of the library is under threat, notwithstanding the safeguards built into the legislation. Those opposite are saying that we cannot have micro-economic reform in Parliament House. They are also saying that we cannot reduce the number of departments; for integrity's sake we must have five departments reporting to the Presiding. Officers. I find that incredible. I find it beyond belief that the opposition is adopting that view. I am frankly surprised by the stance taken by the opposition with regard to the changes to the standing orders. I thought those changes.' were at least worth a triaL At best, it would substantially and radically reform the way the parliament operates, but, more importantly, change the way it is perceived to operate by the public. I do not know how the honourable member for Bradfield expects me to say to my constituents· in Chifiey, 'You might have been retrenched; the work force might have been reduced at your place of employment; you might have seen some top level managers moved out and amalgamations effected, but Parliament House is different. We have to preserve the library. We cannot have these sorts of modem changes and management practices interfering with the processes of parliament. You out there live by a different standard and you cannot expect us to live by the same standard', I think that is absolutely ridiculous, Mr Speaker, I noticed in your second reading speech that you indicated that there are going to be some savings which you hope will benefit members and senators. I strongly support that measure. It concerns me that we do not have an unequivocal undertaking from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that those savings can be directly applied. I hope that the often stated and many times demonstrated concerns that the Minister for Finance, as Leader of the House, has for the operations of the House may overtake any reservations he may have as Minister for Finance. There is a good principle that ought to be drawn to the minister's attention. Where organisations try to overcome years of ossification in the interests of more effective and efficient services, and there are consequent savings as a result of these changes, those proceeds should be spent; there should be some rewards in the system and an opportunity to redirect those savings. Mr Speaker, I assure you that I strongly support the legislation. In the past, I have been pleased to be chairman of the Presiding Officers Information Technology Advisory Group and I am particularly pleased that you have seen fit to ask me to continue in that role. Honourable members are becoming more and more aware of the opportunity that technological change provides for them in enhancing the services that they and their staff provide to constituents. Just as we can introduce an exciting technological change, we sometimes have to bite the bullet of administrative reform and make some administrative changes. Mr Speaker, you, together with your predecessors, are doing that. I can only hope on this occasion that, having passed this House, as I am sure it will, this legislaavailable. tion does not die in the Senate. I commend the legislation to the House.",81
223,Mr NUGENT,NOES," Mr Speaker, as you would be well aware, the Parliamentary Library produces a little document for every piece of legislation that goes through this place known as the Bills Digest. When I got the Bills Digest for the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill I found that it had adopted the practice of describing the report upon which the legislation is based as the Nugent committee report. Quite clearly, I should say up-front that I have a particular interest in this legislation, having been the· chairman of the committee that brought down the report on which the legislation is based. I have to say to the House that we took a great degree of care and attention in collecting evidence. We sifted it over a fairly substantial time. We worked very hard on those recommendations, which were brought down by the majority of the committee, including myself. Certainly there was a dissenting report from three of the members, but six of the members most definitely supported all the other recommendations. We held this inquiry at the end of 1992. We brought down the report at the beginning of this parliament in 1993. Some time went by before the legislation was introduced. Certainly there is no question in my mind that the legislation faithfully reflects all the recommendations that were in the report. We are now in 1994 with the intention of passing this legislation. So quite a considerable time is involved. As the committee chairman, I record my thanks to all those who were involved in the report-those who submitted evidence, the staff who worked on it and the others who gave assistance-for the very fine work that was done and the contributions that were made by all concerned. I believe that there is a clear case for change-that is what the report says-and I certainly do not resile from that position. I want to comment on some particular aspects of the report. Much has been made about the amount of savings that will be Those savings were veryspecifically identified with particular posts to be abolished. I believe they are very readily achievable. We tried very hard to be conservative in not overestimating the size of those savings just so we could make sure that they would not be held up as some quite ridiculous figure. Given the length of time since the inquiry to the present date, which I have already talked about, there is no doubt in my mind that, on today's figures, those savings will be very much more, substantial than the ones quoted in the report. Having questioned a number of witnesses very carefully, there is no doubt in my mind that a lot of extrasavings are to be garnered. lt seems to me that one of the most important things about the savings, whatever their size may be, is that we have received and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has ISsued-I have seen the letter-a categorical assurance that those savings can beheld within the parliament and can be used for providing the extra services that I believe in many ways are necessary for senators and members. So there is a direct benefit to the end users-that is, us, the senators and members in this parliament. I. disagree with the people who have questioned the solidity of those figures. . Comments have also been made about the roles of the two departments and whether they have any degree of compatibility or duplication, and so on and so forth. The report has quite clearly said that, in essence, their funcgreater tional roles will remain quite distinct and quite separate because they have separate roles functionally in many ways. But the report says that it wants to cut the cost of administrative tail. Quite clearly, the adminisate trative sections of the departments have to comply with administration required by legislation and there is clear duplication. We should be trying to ensure that we make efficiencies in that area. Perhaps one of the mistakes of the report was that we said, 'We. want to make sure that we look after the people. We do not want to just chop everybody off at the knees, so we should have natural attrition'. So, of course, some of those savings will come slowly, and appropriately so; nevertheless, they are real for all of that. . It alsoseems that the library has a fundamental problem in its structure in the sense that, from a salary point of view, it is top heavy with highly paid staff. I am not saying that they should not be highly paid but there are a lot of high quality people particularly in the research area and they are, therefore, relatively. expensive resources. Given the way that financeS are run in government areas these days, they will find it increasingly difficult to meet their budgets. By having the advantage of the flexibility of taking up savings that might be made elsewhere in an enlarged department, the library could well benefit. Therefore, it will actually do a disservice to the library if it were not to be amalgamated. Increasingly, as I questioned witnesses and as I toured the facilities within the building, there was no doubt in my mind that there were a number of areas where duplication could be cut by such a merger. At the moment there are just too many fiefdoms that, frankly, cause too many duplications. It is also important to recognise that these departments function within a changing environment within the parliament in what we require of those departments. Our role has changed from what it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, I understand, for those who were here. But I was not here then. I certainly understand that the deman,ds on members now are dramatically than they used to be and, therefore, we need significantly better support. The nature of the technology and the tools available for both departments have changed considerably. the It seems to me that a change is veryapproprito meet those changing circumstances.. The report also dealt with some of the past problems. I do not think we should gloss over the fact that the pro-lems that occurred over several years were very real-they concerned not only money but also management practices. The reality is that those problems. developed under the existing permanent structure and they were not fixed until we had the present temporary arrangements put· in place, which in some form reflect what is proposed in this legislation. So I think the new management has gone some way to fixing a lot of those problems. To go ahead with that, it would be appropriate to make sure that we continue to allow that sort of management' structure to stay in place. I do not believe that it will necessarily be a tool of the government of the day, and I would hope in the library, that it would not be. lt is also important to remember that many of the witnesses said to us during the taking of evidence-this has also been said at witness questioning-that the most outstanding librarian that most people remembered in history was the only one that was not a professionallibrarian by training; He was, in fact, a managerial type person. It is that managerial type approach that is resented, I think, by a number of the opponents of this proposal. There were many claims about the loss of independence of the library under the proposed arrangements. We spent a great deal time and effort looking at them and, frankly, those claims, in my view, were simply not supported by evidence. However, given that the claims were obviously widespread and the very genuine, the committee bent over backwards to try to build into its recommendations measures that. would ensure that those conon cerns were met. Briefly, there has been comment about hearings being held in private-the implicanolly) tion being that something secret and underhand went on. This was an advisory commithear tee-it was not a full committee of the parliaday ment. All members of the committee were aware from its early meetings that, because was an advisory committee and not a formal committee of the parliament, its proceedings were not protected by privilege. A number the witnesses expressed a desire to have their evidence' treated confidentially. It was in interests of the witnesses that all members the committee agreed up front that the hearwhile, ings had to be held in private. preferred public hearings but it was not practical or realistic, and ids mischievous put any other implication on that. I want to close; I am not going on forever. I could go on through the recommendations but I think they are well documented and obviously honourable members have had long time to read the report since it was tabled nearly a year ago. Finally, I believe that the recommendations in this report are valid today as they were when the report brought down. I think the legislation reflects this. I regret that I have been unable to persuade my colleagues in the coalition to that view and obviously I have to their rights to a contrary view. The clear view amongst my colleagues is that they do not believe that these measures are appropriate. think that is particularly so with many senators, but certainly that view is not exclusive to the Senate. I regret that I have not been able to persuade them from that, and that the views which have prevailed are those that have largely been put by the honourable member for Bradfield(Mr Connolly), who was the previous speaker on this side. So the coalition will oppose this legislation. of I assume it will go through this chamber. If it goes through the other chamber with the support of the minor parties, then it will be interesting to see just who is right in terms of real impact of this particular legislation.",86
224,Mr LEO MCLEAY,NOES," I am rather saddened by the debate tonight the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill. I think that the the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Conin his contribution has shown what one could only call infinite flexibility of mind. We him and his colleagues in here day after singing their mantra about micro-economic reform-that the government has not it moved fast enough in these areas and that we have to speed up micro-economic reform-but when the parliament itself is asked to consider of a piece of micro-economic reform, what happens is that the tail wags the dog. I would the have thought that the honourable member for of Bradfield, who has been here for some little would' have been sensible enough to We would have wake up to that. . What the honourable member for Aston (Mr to Nugent) has put to' the House in the last 10 minutes reconfirms all the reasons that I had in my mind when I sought to appoint him as chairman of the committee that looked at this matter. He went to the committee and looked a at the matter impartially. The committee considered the issues and it brought forward a report. At the time, the then President of the as Senate and I said that we would be bound by was whatever decision the committee came forward with. We appointed a member of the opposition as chairman of it to show good faith on our part and to try to make the point that respect there was no hidden agenda. However, a small clique of people in two of the other parliamentary departments-not, II am pleased to say, the Department of the House of Representatives-have decided that what they really want is for the cosy, sheltered workshop they have worked in all their lives to prevail and, while the rest of the world, the Public Service and industry, can change, the parliamentary departments will be the same as they were in 1901 when they started and in 1927 when they moved here. That is absolutely ridiculous. At the time, to try to make the point, the then President of the Senate and I had the Auditor-General conduct an inquiry into both Hansard and the library. Honourable members who have participated in this debate should have read those reports. The Auditor-General was pretty scathing in his response. He looked at making recommendations which would make this place a little more efficient, and to blow some of the winds of change that had occurred in the rest of the public sector into this awful little sheltered workshop here. Bu.t the vested interests were not going to be in that. A very self-serving 'piece of evidence was given to the committee by Mr Brudenall, who was at one stage the acting librarian and is now the deputy librarian. Mr Brudenall puts the argument for all his colleagues up there in the library-'For goodness sake, don't change'-because it is very comfortable where they are. Library staff are getting very high salaries. They appointed people to positions that did not exist. The assistant secretary in corporate services was being paid an SES salary for it position that was supposed to be for the head of the research service. Other people were filling positions which were not really in the establishment. But this was justified because the library had its captive little group of . members and, in particular, senators to whom it provided special services. Whenever any attack was made on the efficiency of this organisation, people came out of the woodwork and said, 'We have to support the independence of the library'. No-one was attacking the independence of the library. We were saying, 'For goodness sake, let's have the same sort of working conditions in the library that the public might have had maybe in the 1980s or the 1970s'. We were not even suggesting that the library should have the same sort of approach of the 1990s; maybe it could progress from 1927 to 1977. But that did not suit the people in the Senate. The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has been a lot more progressive. The former President and myself instigated an inquiry into that department. Some dramatic changes were made and we got very real efficiencies. Savings of $3 to $4 million a year were made in Hansard-a Hansard department which actually works, where people enjoy their life, where people put in a good job and which actually gets us the Hansard on time. The honourable member for Bradfield will remember, like I do, that when we first came here some 14 or 15 years ago try a little note went around every second day saying that the Hansard would be delayed until some time later that day. That does not happen now. Now we get the Hansard the next day. In fact, we will have the Hansard electronically available on the same day. Those changes are sensible. That department has moved with the times. But people say, 'Goodne-s me, let us not do this in the library', as though the library is some sort of icon that we should not touch. When one talks to people in the library, one would think that the library is an old local municipal library, a book library. Some people obviously thought that. When the former President and I went on a tour through the library, we found that the library was filling up very expensive shelf space with a regular supply, for the interests of members and senators, of the Hansard of the Republic of South Africa. I am sure that hundreds of members and senators were going in each day to look at the airmailed versions of the Hansard of the Republic of South Africa! I do not think even my friend the honourable mef11ber for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who was a great supporter of the Republic of South Africa, looked at one of them once. But that was the sort of mind-set that people in the library were in. When we asked them why they got that publication they sector said, 'Well, we got it once, didn't we? We never stopped it, so we keep getting it and we keep filling up shelf space with it; it is there'. When someone says, 'Maybe we ought to change this a bit; maybe we ought to get a bit of modem management into this place', the people in the library say, 'Goodness, no. Don't do that. That would be awful because you would be interfering with the independence of the library'. No-one wants to interfere with the independence of the library. Those of us on this side and on the other side;-at least those of us who think about it-realise that the cycle in this place changes. It is inevitable that at some time or other one party will be in government and then it will go out of government. When we go out of government, we need the resources of the library to help us do our job as members. So no-one is going to try to do anything about that. But, for goodness sake, let us make the library work better. This report and the proposed legislation are only trying to make things work better. Members and senators will benefit from that. The savings that have been identified are very real. Because of an arrangement that the presiding officers negotiated with the then Minister for Finance, the savings will go ,jtraight back to providing services for members and senators. We cannot have micro-economic reform here. We must have five little departments with a couple of hundred people in each of them and we must have people who caIl themselves secretaries to departments. But when presiding officers go along to the Remuneration Tribunal, as the previous presiding officers did and as the current officers have, and say, 'Just recognise these people as genuine secretaries to departments', the Remuneration Tribunal says, 'Don't be stupid'. It recognises them as just minor agencies. We will get some decent movement in this place if we can lead by example. The point that the presiding officers were trying to make, with the amalgamation of the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, was that these two departments have a lot in common. The library is not a book library and Hansard does not produce paper copy any more. That is not the future of either of those departments; they. are about the dissemination of information.: No two elements in this building or other parts of the government show a synergy that these two departments show. There are dramatic advantages for both of them in the processing of information for members and senators. That is what they both do and they do it weIl if they apply their minds to it. To have them providing their services as two separate entities, pulling away from each other, is just damned stupid. When the honourable member for Bradfield thinks about this he will agree with it. Unfortunately, he, like the honourable member for Aston, is being dragged along by these people who do not want to see the wood for the trees. At the time, the previous presiding officers were willing to give, as the current presiding officers are willing to give, any number of undertakings that there is no plot in this. It is not an amalgamation of the three departments any more. It will not have any effect on the Senate, the House of Representatives or anything else. The only people who will benefit from this amalgamation are members and senators. That is why these two service departments are there. They are not there for self-serving reasons of the people who head them. They are there to provide a service to us as members and senators which is efficient and which should have some of the characteristics of modern management practices. There is nothing of the sort in the Department of the presiding Parliamentary Library. The interim arrangement, where we have the same person as head of the two departments, has at least tried to bring about some of those amalgams of interest that should be there. The type of advicethitt we got from the Clerk of the Senate and some other people who made submissions to the committee reaIly makes us wonder where they are coming from. From reading some of the things that were said, one would think that the perfect model for some people would be to have seven or eight parliamentary departments, to have anarchy and to have little topheavy organisations that do not do anything efficiently. The honourable member for Bradfield is probably right when he says that he does not think this bill will pass the Senate. The sorrow of this proposal is that no-one is wiIling to look at the benefits and the advanThey, tages in the way that the honourable member for Aston and his committee did. In the time that I have been here, the only time the government of the day has ever had an opposition member chair a committee that provided legislation to the parliament was when the then honourable member for North Sydney, Mr Spender, who was at the time the chairman of the Standing Committee on Privileges, produced a report which brought forward our current legislation on privilege. The Labor government of the day was saying that what he was doing was of some value and that it would have a look at the outcome. The report of the honourable member for Aston is of some value. The legislation that has flowed from it should be supported. The outcomes from that legislation would be of benefit to honourable members and honourable senators. I cannot see how anyone can say that, in any way, shape or form the independence of the library will be compromised. There will still be a library committee which, if it wanted-I have no doubt of it, if that was a price for getting this idea passedment could have more say. The,honourable member for Bradfield says, 'The library committee is not an executive committee, so the fact that it said so was all right is rubbish'. I do not know what more is wanted. The parliament on both sides-the Senate and the House of Representatives, government and opposition-elects people to the library committee. It represents all the views in the place. Mr Connolly-Why didn't that committee do this report?",88
225,Mr LEO MCLEAY,NOES,"The library committee has had a look at it, but the honourable member for Bradfield says, 'The fact that it has had a look at it but does not have executive authority, means it does not matter'. That is a nonsense. The honourable member for Bradfield says that the fact that the gent committee was not an official committee of the parliament means it has no merit. That is a nonsense and a stupidity, and a disgraceful attack on the work the honourable member did. I would not even say that of the three people who signed the dissenting report. probably for reasons known to themselves-I hope in good faith-not being convinced byparIiamentaty secretaries with secretaries of parliamentary departments who had an agenda of their own, would have come to the report with good faith. To attack the honourable member for Aston in the way that the member for Bradfield did is unfair and indecent. I will finish by saying that this legislation should pass. It will pass through this House, and it is a shame that it will not pass the other house. We hear members of the opposition telling us how the government is not interested in micro-economic reform. It will be interesting to see what they do about this piece of legislation, because if they cannot do something about the business they work in, if they ever become the government, they are not likely to be able to do anything about that. Those opposite have buckled under to vested interests in their opposition to this legislation. If they ever become the governof Australia, I will feel sorry for the people because of the way those opposite have buckled under to the vested interests which pushed them along. By their opposition to this legislation they are showing that they have absolutely no commitment to any sort of economic reform in this country. If they will not reform the parliament, they will not be willing to do anything. When the honourable member for Bradfield talks in the future about how the government has to do something about the Public Service, I am going to be here every time to remind him about the selfserving, stupid speech he made here tonight when he had a chance to do something about micro-economic reform. I am sure that everyone in the Public Service will remember his words here tonight. He and his colleagues, as the old Indians Nu- might have said, spoke with forked tongues on this issue. The House should pass the bill; the Senate should pass the bill. We should do something that is decent, rather than buckle under to vested interests.",91
226,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"As a member of the advisory committee, and as a signatory to the majority report, I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to make some comments on the ·legislation which flows from the report. It is· true that the advisory committee was different from other parliamentary committees of inquiry, but that ing Staff. did not mean that it did not faithfully examine the evidence puLbefore it and diligently come to conclusions on the basis of the facts as the committee saw them. We spent considerable time receiving and reviewing evidence, looking at the criticisms which were presented in relation to the proposals and then making recommendations. It is unusual for an opposition member be chairman of a committee. I am not quite sure whether the previous Speaker and the former President of the Senate knew that was an impossible issue and therefore decided that the easiest way to get out of trouble was to put an opposition member in the chair. I hope, rather, that it was a genuine attempt reach some kind of bipartisan position on issue. I do not think there is much doubt that the history of bitter argument over this quessatisfactory tion certainly flowed through into the condepartments siderations of the committee and the evidence that was presented to it. Going right back to 1901, there have been five parliamentary departments. There have been several attempts over the years to gamate various departments and, on occasion, there has even been the view that there should be only a single department. I would always reject that view because .J think impinge upon the independence of the Senate and the House of Representatives as separate chambers with particular functions. There would always need to be a service departindeed ment. That does not mean we should always resist every change and every proposed efficiency in the management and operation of the departments. In 1988 the then Speaker, Mrs Child; able introduced a bill to amalgamate three dlYpartments-Joint House, the Parliamentary Licient brary and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. No doubt that proposal also had some merit, but it was opposed at the t!me and not pursued. In 1992 Mr Templeton, the Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and Acting Parliamentary Librarian, made a submission to the presiding officers arguing for the amalgamation of the current Depaitment of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Rep()rtOver the years there have been management problems iIi both departments. There have been unfavourable audit reports which have dealt very critically with the operations of both of these significant parliamentary departments. In 1989 there was criticism of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff that led to some considerable reforms. to Audit Report (No.6) of 1990-91 into the Department of the Parliamentary Library also contained much criticism and, particularly, this concerns about the lack of leadership and poor management within that department. It is often said that if one cannot manage to the parliament, how can one manage the this country? It really reflects poorly on the parliament as a whole to have regularly unaudit reports being made into the which support this House and its operations. We have a clear responsibility to demonstrate to the Australian people that we can run our parliament efficiently and well. We must do that if we expect to earn the right amalto govern this country. We must earn the respect of the people for being able to manage our affairs. wisely and. weIl, and be entrusted with the responsibility of influencing their that would lives and their activities. We have an obligation to ensure that this parliament tuns efficiently, and also that where there are savings to be made they are made. In this particular instance, the committee was able to establish-and, I believe, demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt - that savings of the order of at least $340,000 and probably $500,000 were achievas a result of this measure. Much of that will be achieved as a result of a more effiand leaner corporate staff, which would be reduced from some 67 people to 54. Of course, these are June 1991 figures. That represents a considerable saving. As the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) rightly pointed out, a large number of people, particularly staff of the ParliamenObviously, tary Library, are attached in this corporate services area. Ironically, even though the number of staff in the library time of the inquiry it had 37 corporate staff, or 19 per cent of its total staffing number. The Department qf the Parliamentary Reportpresiding ing Staff, a much larger organisation, with 354 staff, had only 30 corporate staff, or eight per cent. This new proposal would result in an organisation of 534 staff with 10 per cent involved in corporate services. With this move there is an obvious potential for savings-savings that will increase years go by and as the benefits accrue. It would also mean additional resources being available to fund the other activities that so essential to the library's day-today operto ations. It has been clearly established that potential benefit of perhaps half a million dollars a year would flow from these propoment. sals. However, a number of people have said that the price is too high to pay; that we need to pay extra amounts of money to achieve various objectives for the library. The concern raised most often was the independence of the library. Independence something that is prized by all members parliament. I think we would regard that as fundamental feature of any library attempting to effectively service the members of this House. But I do not accept that the proposal before the House in any way interferes with the independence of the library. As mentioned by previous speakers, a number of amendments have been proposedsources. changes to the original proposal put forward by Mr Templeton-to guarantee that itidelibrary pendence. The office of librarian will be retained. The Parliamentary Library Commitwould tee will be retained in its current role, with library. the librarian acting as secretary to that particular committee. I have served on the library committee and I have never found it to be a particularly effective organisation. It was rarely consulted on matters of importance. In fact, while I on the committee, the librarian of the day was moved aside and the committee was not even . told about it. So basic issues such as that were not even referred to the committee. it was perceived by the library staff as an important element of their security, total so it has been preserved in these proposed is 192, at the new arrangements. The opportunity for the librarian to report and make representations directly to the officers hils been maintained. That also guarantees that no new bureaucratic head can get in the way of their direct access to the houses of this parliament. They are also going to have the opportunity to present independent sections in the departmental report to this House. All of those things guarantee indeas the pendence for the library. Is there anything incongruous about amalgamation with the reporting service? Surely it are also has an obligation to be independent and treat all sides of the House equally and a fairly. They both have that obligation so I see no problem in them sharing joint manageThere was also concern amongst library staff that this amalgamation would result in resources being transferred from the library and into the Hansard section. Frankly, I think the reverse is more likely. It is a fact that is both departments have lumpy workloads. of Their responsibilities change according to a whether the parliament is or is not sitting. There is a long period before and after elections when there is often limited call on their services. In those circumstances, this proposal would provide greater flexibility for staff to be moved from one section to· the other and guarantee better utilisation of their reThe technology in Hansard is likely to free up people, providing extra help in the section. I suspect that the transfer of staff following a merger of the departments benefit rather than disadvantage the There was also concern that the library is smaller than Hansard and that therefore it would be out-voted or out-muscled on issues. Again, I think that is highly unlikely. In any event, it would be a single merged department was working cooperatively together. It would not be a them and us situation but an example of benefit to all. The library has such particular day-today contact with members of parliament that I think their position would always be strong in any argument that might happen to develop between them and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. Finally, from time to time it was suggested-I found this point particularly difficult comprehend-that somehow or other this proposal interfered with the independence of the Senate. Some senators argued that they use the library more than members of the House of Representatives-I do not know whether that is true-and that therefore this proposal adversely affected the Senate. I would have to say that I regard all of the objections as having little merit and that the genuine points of concern that were raised in evidence before the committee were adequately addressed during the development of this particular proposal. NA",92
227,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 obstacles p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",94
228,Mr WALKER,ADJOURNMENT,I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. PUBLIC SERVICE (PARLIAMENTARY is faithfully DEPARTMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL before Second· Reading Debate resumed.,94
229,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT," would There was clearly some orchestration in the campaign by library staff and others to oppose this particular proposal. We even had reprearea sentations from the various state parliamentary librarians indicating how this proposal would just about bring an end to the universe. But, with a bit of investigati-n, we found. that many of the state parliamentary libraries themselves are not separate departments. So much of their comment seemed to be a little bit hollow. Certainly, many senators feel very strongly about this proposal. The minority report was presented by a couple of senators. As previous speakers have indicated, it may well be that this proposal will fail because of its inability to be carried in the Senate. There are some genuine criticisms of the way in which the library is performing. I share some of those with previous members who have spoken. There are occasions when to service is poor and when money is wasted on books and other library resources of low priority. It is inevitable that that is likely to occur. I have been concerned about recent reports that library research staff have been required to advise sections of the government on particular research requests that have been made. I cannot think of any valid reason why that should happen, and that sort of thing needs to be corrected. Those kinds of problems with the way in which the library is being operated need to be corrected. They can be corrected whether or not there is one department or two. I certainly reject the idea that these proposals will in any way eliminate reform in the library, or present to achieving a balanced and better library service. I sat through three days of evidence with this advisory committee. I listened to a whole range of problems being raised by various witnesses. I believe that those matters of concern were resolved one by one. The report represented by the legislation us today, and I believe that the propo1994 sal is fundamentally sound. There has been some criticism over recent days about a half million dollar project to alter the design of the entry to the library. I say that the design of the library leaves a lot to be desired and that there is room for considerable improvement in the reception and the way in which the whole layout of the library is presented. For the life of me, I cannot understand how it could possibly cost half a million dollars to shift.furniture, it painting, or other things of that nature around, and that needs to be examined. I accept the need for changes in the design of the library, but surely half a million dollars seems to be an extraordinary cost. But, we cannot stand up and criticise a half million dollar one-off capital cost and then tum a blind eye to half a million dollars being unnecessarily spent every year because of improvements to efficiency and reductions in staff numbers which could be achieved without any loss to the efficiency and standard.of service provided by the library. I do not believe that this proposal will of itself give us a particularly better library, the measure will save around half a million dollars a year-and that is half a million dollars that can be directed to providing better services or reducing the costs of running this parliament. Both of those objectives should be grasped. When this parliament has an opportunity to make a saving, it must accept that opportunity. We bear a lot of pain for small savings that are made from 'year to year to our national budget. Here is an opportunity for the parliament to make a saving that I believe will create no pain but will give an opportunity to provide better services to all members.",94
230,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Before I put the question that this bill be now read a second time, I would like to take the opportunity to make one or two comments on it. I do so full well in the knowledge that some comments made as late as this afternoon about the independence and the impartiality of the position which I hold may subsequently be brought into question. But I do so also from the position of having been responsible for bringing forward to this parliament the proposition that is now presently under debate. In listening to the contributions from both sides, I could not help but· reflect upon the everyday debate that happens in this chamber on a number of specific issues, and I think the honourable memiJer for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) in· particular targeted one of those. He categorised it as. micro-economic reform; I talk about it in terms of smaller government, whiCh I also hear bandied around here from time to time. Importantly, some of this debate tonight has lost sight of the aims of this proposition and the reason for this legislation because all contributors tonight spent a great deal of their time talking about the Parliamentary Library. The library is only one component of what is being proposed. As was so eloquently pointed out by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and, indeed, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in their contributions, together with those of the honourable member for Chifley (MrPrice) and the honourable member for Watson, what is being propo!!ed is a department which reflects information serbut vices. It is to complement, as was said in the second reading speech, a physical services department. It has been pointed out that savings were identified. As the honourable member for Aston rightly pointed out, it was some time ago that this report was presented and the savings that would come from this proposal would probably be greater. There was a comment made-the honourable member for Chifiey first raised it; but others commented on it-about those savings and what would happen to the money. In my second reading speech I indicated that the Department of Finance had given a guarantee-the best one can get from the Department of Finance-that the savings would go to and remain with the new department to enhance services for members· and senators. I will go one better because the former Minister for Finance, now Treasurer (Mr Willis), in a letter to me of 21 December, confirmed in correspondence: On the basis, that the financial arrangements and procedures for the new Department will be within the auspices of the running costs system, I can assure you that the level of resources provided to the new Department upon its creation will be the sum of the budgets of the current two Departments. I tllble that letter for the benefit of honourable members, who perhaps may like to discuss this a little further, particularly those who have the opportunity to talk about it with senators as the legislation is to go there. I also' want to pick up one or two other points that were raised by honourable members. The honourable member for Wide Bay a is of the view that single department running the parliament Was feasible and rejected that as a concept. I too reject that as a concept. In my second reading speech when I introduced this legislation I said on behalf of . the then President and me: ' We do not believe that any further reduction in the number of parliamentary service departments is warranted and we do not intend to propose that there be any further changes. That is important because the honourable member for Watson referred to concerns about the attitudes being displayed by senior parliamentary officers within this building about the reasons for this legislation coming forward. I must say that I share those conto cerns. As a Presiding Officer, I find it disturbfor ing when I learn of very strongly held views of senior officers within this place where those views are sought to be imposed on some members and senators for other reasons. In that respect I am reminded of a comment made by a senior officer of the parliament the former President immediately prior to his departure. He said, 'You will never get this proposal up because Ido not support it'. think it is fair to say that that particular person is doing whatever he can to ensure that that happens. I was going to quote from document in which he actually view that the library is a now threatened institution of the parliament, but perhaps will leave that to another time. I turn to the contribution made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Conopment nolly). I am charitable enough to say to honourable member for Bradfield that I of understand his position as the shadow here. minister for privatisation and administrative services and, from time to time, we all do not like the position that we are in. I might express some sympathy for the honourable member for Aston as the chairman of the committee and his colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay who find that, when they bring forward a report which is adopted by the parliament and subsequently further action is proposed to be put in place, they suddenly left deserted. A comment about· similar exercise which I had something to with was made this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when comPresiding menting about parliamentary procedure. So we are soul mates in that respect. The able member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made one or two comments upon which I valid think I should respond. Ashe pointed out, the minority report was really done by three senators. The majority report was done by senators and members of the House of Representatives from both sides. I do not believe for a minute-otherwise I, along with the President, would not have decided to push on with this particular piece of legislation-that the six or so reasons that the honourable member for Bradfield referred in that minority report hold. I could sit here the next two hours arguing and putting forward valid reasons why those reasons do not hold, but I think the other people who have contributed tonight have done just that. The question of the independence of the library is one that really amuses me. I do not to think that anybody in this place has defended the independence of the library as vigorously as the person who is the Acting Parliamentary I Librarian. Yet I know and members in this place would know that they received some information towards the end of last year about a that particular position-perhaps even that spells out his person, as I recall. . I place on record today that the Secretary to I the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting St;tff who is also the Acting Parliamentary Librarian has done nothing but defend the independence of the library during the develof this piece of legislation. He has the ensured fahhfully that the recommendations the majority report have been encapsulated I conclude by saying one or two things to also the honourable member for Bradfield about the comments that were made regarding the proposal for refitting the library, which was also referred to ·by the honourable member for Wide Bay. The first thing that I need to saythe honourable member for Bradfield referred to this-is that that particular matter has gone are to the Parliamentary Library Committee on a quite a number of occasions. There were do plans and a model was considered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly by the Officers. On a couple of occasions we actually sent it back for further assessment honourbefore we made a final decision. The honourable member for Watson had a point when he talked about the role that the library committee plays. Yes, the library committee is advisory, but that is the role of a number of other committees of this parliament. As the Presiding Officer to whom that committee reports, along with the President of the Senate, I take very seriously the advice I get from the committee. I hope members of the committee believe that when they deliberate on issues, vote on particular issues and give advice to us they are making a contribution to the running of this place. I say to them that I certainly value that advice. As for the cost factor, it may well be that the amount of money talked about for the redevelopment of the library foyer-which, incidentally, did come largely as a result of the audit office recommendations-to improve the circulation in that section of the library, in my view, possibly could be looked at again. We are talking of ballpark figures and it may well be that there are ways in which we can get around that. But I say to the honourable member for Bradfield, as I am sure he would know, that any funding that would come for a project such as that would come from capital works, which would be a separate vote, and would not therefore come from the savings which would be occasioned by streamlining the administration in both the parliamentary reporting and the library departments. Notwithstanding the role the honourable member for Bradfield has been compelled to play this evening, I hope people seriously have another look at this proposal. At the end of the day, I think it makes a lot of sense if people would only read the second reading speech and the advisory committee report again, they would see that the proposal that has come forward is factual and is based on a realistic assessment of the needs of this parliament. I conclude by simply saying, as I did previously, that all of those people who participated in the discussions on this issue and those people who served on the committee served their parliament well and they served their colleagues well with the recommendations they brought down. I hoped and I thought that the President of the Senate and I served them well by implementing in this legislation all of their recommendations. Question resolved in the affirmative.

NA Motion (by Mr Walker) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Archer, Former Senator Brian",95
231,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words about Brian Archer, who retired from the Senate on 31 January. Brian was elected to the Senate from Tasmania in 1975 and had over 18 years of tireless and loyal service to the Liberal Party, the Australian Senate and to Tasmania. The continuity of his service made him one of the longest serving senators when he retired last week. Tasmania was Brian's birthplace, his home and his passion. He was a dedicated advocate, facilitator and promoter of the welfare and development of his island state and its natural and human resources. He had a particular interest in all Tasmanian resource industries-Iwrticulture, agriculture, mining, forestry, pulp and paper, inland fisheries and sea fisheries. There was many a Tasmanian and, farmer, trawlerman or small business person who was grateful for Brian's patient and painstaking assistance for the troubling problem. The extent of his interests ran far beyond regular constituency matters and limits. On many occasions his unflagging enthusiasm for responsible development projects and innovative value added technology sustained particular projects when difficulties were encountered. His network of contacts throughout the state was extensive and he was channing, cheerful and steadfast in pursuing inquiries and mustering assistance for any project or job creating investor in whom he believed. Belief was an important strand in Brian's character. The fundamental fairness, decency and straightness with which he .treated all persons, irrespective of politics or background, marked him as a man of natural quality and dignity. Brian was a quiet, dedicated worker in Senate, on coalition committees in this parliament and in Tasmania. His modest selfeffacement was encapsulated in his selfdescription as a nuts-and-bolts man. However, this masked the impact and· value of his efforts. Brian served as opposition shadow special mini·ster of state and shadow minister for science. He was on numerous Senate and joint committees, including the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania, of which he was chairman. The breadth and depth of Brian's knowledge about his state, its industries and the people who work in them were remarkable. His interests frequently drove his expertise beyond Tasmania. In surface and deep sea fishing, in timber and in dairying, for example, his national knowledge was extensive and generously available to those who sought it. Brian came from a broad industry background, and his tireless work on the Senate industry committee is widely acknowledged. Brian was also a man of wide interests outside parliament. He played and contributed to the administration of many sports, ran his farm at Boat Harbour and bred quality Limousin cattle. ' Brian's enthusiasm, balance and integrity were assets to the parliament. His belief In the potential of Australia and his global perspective, coupled with local knowledge and understanding, were a constant inspiration. He possessed a sound, natural wisdom and was a valued member of the coalition team. He will be missed on all sides of politics. I pay tribute to him and his record in public life. will be missed in this place by his many friends. A former Minister for Science and Technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), is in the House at. the moment. He may wish to add to what I have said. I wish Brian and his wife, Dorothy, every happiness and contentment in retirement at Riverside, near Launceston, and I wish him many happy years to come Kiama Quarries",97
232,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of the House some information which refers to actions taken by Premier Fahey and his New South Wales government. One of the industries which has been an integral part of my home town of Kiama is the basalt, or bluestone, quarries. They have been a hallmark of the area for well over 100 years. Kiama was an Irish town-a town that was brought up on the backs of the working class people Of that area. Some 50 families have had long-term involvement in those quarries. In fact, I know of one family in which members of the family from the grandfather through to the grandson worked together on the one shift. It is in the light of the long history of that quarry that we look at the actions of the state Liberal government. The State Rail Authority asked the people in these quarries to turn around and do something about their performance at work. They entered into agreements and did everything that they possibly could to increase the productivity of those quarries on the basis of an understanding that if they lifted the productivity of that particular quarry then their jobs w-)Uld be safe. That is not what has happened. Basically, as I understand it-from my friends, whom I have known nearly all my life and who work on those quarries-what they got out of all their hard pain and readjustments was a kick in the guts. I have figures from. Coopers and Lybrand, consultants, who have done a very close analysis of the financial position of three of the hard rock quarries owned by the State Rail Authority-at Bombo, which is in my electorate of Gilmore, at Martins Creek and He at Ardglen. I would like to find out whose federal seats those other two quarries are in, because I think they would be interested in the figures. The results show that the percentage return on the funds· invested· in Bombo quarry is 31 per cent; in Martins Creek:, 93 per cent; and in Ardglen, 648 per cent. One would imagine that, with the Olympic Games coming to Sydney, the ownership of a hard rock quarry would be a goldmine. That is in fact the case. The point that I am really uptight about is that it was brought to my attention by one of the employees-and they are employees of the State Rail Authority; I obviously cannot indicate the name of that individual because that person will then be intimidated and treated like less than dirt-that one of the former Greiner appointees to the State Rail Authority board now happens to be a member of the board of Boral quarries. It just happens to be that Boral is in the adjacent quarry. Mr Baird, having received appeals from the unions and the people of Kiama saying, 'Leave this quarry alone; leave these people in employment in our town', has sent a message back saying that it will be sold, irrespective of what these people's dedication has achieved. I suggest that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Something smells of fish when we find that an executive of the State Rail Authority is now in a quarrying company, and it looks as though Mr Baird is hell bent on selling these quarries which have a good return. Bombo has a 31 per cent return on funds invested; Martins Creek, 93 per cent; and Ardglen, 648 per cent. I suggest that a deal of corruption is perhaps going on here. I would really like to see someone get to the core of this issue. I would like the state government to give the reason why it would sell profitable outlets like this when, in fact, its cost of supplying hard rock for its state rail quarries will go up from $4.20 to $8.50 a tonne. Something smells. (TIme expired) Question resolved in the affinnative: House adjourned at 10.57 p.m. NA NA Works in Parliamentary Library",98
233,Mr CONNOLLY,INFORMATION,"Mr Speaker, upon notice, on 13 December 1993: Is it proposed to construct a new entry and common user point for the Parliamentary Library on the, second floor; if so, (a) what works are proposed, (b) why are they proposed, (c) what will they cost and (d) will it be necessary to move the artwork in the existing foyer; if so, what will it cost.",99
234,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The nature and function of the works proposed were noted by the Library Committee at meetings in May 1992, August 1992, September 1993 and, most recently, on 15 December 1993. (a) Work will include demolition of partitions and ceilings, removal of some cafPet, building work and reorganisation of services and the construction of a Central Enquiry Point desk, work areas, reference areas for Members and Senators and possible future staff accommodation. The physical Central Enquiry Point will replace three existing service points: the Circulation Desk to the right of the entrance, the Information Services reference desk also located to the right of the entrance and the MICAH reference desk located to the left of the entrance. (b) The proposal flows from recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office's Report No. 61991-92-Department of the Parliamentary Library: Review of Management. A major concern raised by the ANAO was the need to improve access by Members and Senators to all the services offered by the Library. A Central Enquiry Point was seen by the ANAO as an effective way of achieving better and quicker access. The benefits include: elimination of multiple service points with consequent greater efficiency in staff time use and service delivery; immediate responses to a wide range of 'quick fact' questions; quicker referral of more complex information or research requests to subject experts in Information Services or the Parliamentary Research Service; and easier access for Members, Senators and their staff to all services of the Library, its collections, publications, electronic media replay, etc. (c) The estimated cost is $424 800 for the capital works and $53 145 for the design costs. (d) Yes. The estimated cost is $15 500. NA The following notices were given: Mr Sciacca to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Ministers of State Act 1952. Mr Bruce Scott to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Telecommunications Act 1991. Mr Hollis to move That this House: (1) expresses its concern at the recent prices negotiated between Australian coal producers and Japanese buyers; (2) recognises the importance of coal exports to the Australian economy; and (3) calls on the Government to establish a National Coal Marketing Authority. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 8 February 1994: Defence Act-Determination under section 58B 1994 No.2. Public Service Act-Determination 1994 No. LES 1.",99
