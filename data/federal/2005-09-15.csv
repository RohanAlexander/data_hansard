4,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.11 am)-by leave-I move: That the amendments be considered immediately. This is an enormously difficult day for the Labor Party. Today is a day when the vacuous nature of all of its policy and the shallowness of its contribution to public life is on full display. Mark Latham tells us what we need to know about the individual characters that make up the Labor Party, that lead the day Labor Party and what its collective character is. And it is all brought to bear on this debate where the Labor Party has vacated the field-it does not contribute constructively or the like. This is a government that reforms administration and that has the courage of its re- convictions. Today is the fruition of a policy secthat we took to election after election. We faced the voters and we put out our policy proposals, unlike the Labor Party. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: is this the procedural motion that the amendments be considered immediately and, if it is, what is the relevance of this nonsense coming from the minister?",20
5,The SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,The minister has moved that the amendments be considered immediately.,21
6,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The amendments that will be considered bring about the full sale of Telstra in the interests of all Australians but especially, because of Connect Australia and the Communications Fund allocations by the government, in the interests of rural and regional Australians. We are very proud that this legislation will now be passed with the vote of the House of Representatives. Question agreed to.",21

8,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"This is the last minute, drop in the ocean inducement to the National Party to sell out rural and regional Australia. This is the Backdown Barnaby and National Party sell-out of rural and regional Australia. In the last series of elections-in 1998, 2001 and 2004-the National Party and the Liberal Party went to the Australian people saying that Telstra would not be fully privatised unless there was a guarantee of adequate services in rural and regional Australia. On every objective examination of that, on the Besley inquiry, on the Estens inquiry and on Telstra's own admission, in its secret advice to the government on 11 August, Telstra itself acknowledges that it does not have the adequate capacity to deliver effective services to rural and regional Australia. This is a breach of faith by the Liberal and National parties to the Australian people and a massive sell-out by the National Party-the last minute, drop in the ocean payment, the last minute drop in the ocean inducement, the last minute drop in the ocean bribe to Backdown Barnaby and the National Party to sell out rural and regional Australia.",21

16,Mr ABBOTT,TELSTRA LEGISLATION,"I move: That, in relation to proceedings on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent: (1) the 2 Senate messages transmitting these bills for concurrence being reported together; (2) each bill then being read a first time and then being considered together through all stages without delay; (3) if not disposed of earlier, consideration interrupted at 12.30 p.m. on Thursday, 15 September 2005, at which time: (a) any question then before the Chair to be put, together with any question or tions necessary to complete the stage which consideration of the bills has reached; and (b) the further question-That the remainder of the bills be agreed to-being put forthwith without amendment or debate; and (4) any variation to this arrangement being made except on motion without notice moved by a Minister. While members opposite are engaging in an orgy of political cannibalism, this government is getting on with the business of the nation. Members opposite always want to talk; they never want to decide. But it is now time to finally decide whether Telstra should be put up for sale. We will have had 2½ days of debate in this House by the time these matters finally come on for a vote at about 12.30 today. That is 2½ days of debate in this House on top of 10 years of debate in the country on top of debate over the course of four election campaigns. I contrast the 2½ days of debate on this matter that we have had in this House with the one hour that the former government allowed to debate the sale of Qantas in 1992 and the five hours and 12 minutes that the former government allowed to debate the sale of the Commonwealth Bank in 1995. There has been more than enough debate on this issue. The time for debating this issue is passing and the time for deciding this issue has finally come.",21
17,Ms GILLARD,TELSTRA LEGISLATION,"Of course we remember the days when the Leader of the House was the bovver boy standover man of Australian politics. Now he is just pathetic. This is a pathetic motion moved to try and guillotine this debate through the House by a being minister who only yesterday was complaining about debate being guillotined. This is an act of hypocrisy by the leader and an act of hypocrisy by everybody who votes for it. We ques- know this is about containing debate to try and keep dissenters in the cart in the desperate hope that none of them split on the floor today. If any of them in cockies' corner have got the courage of their convictions they will not be voting for this motion and they will not be voting for the telecommunications legislation this afternoon.

TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005 NA NA (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER ISSUES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bills received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
18,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.27 am)-I move: That these bills be now read a second time. Today I am bringing forward into the chamber for consideration two telecommunications bills. The bills are an integral part of a comprehensive package of measures designed to enable the Commonwealth to sell its remaining equity interest in Telstra and to give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services now and into the future. Three further bills with additional measures and appropriations make up the package. Together, this legislation forms a broad, integrated package that is designed to: provide an appropriate framework for a Telstra sale scheme; - provide a settled regulatory framework that promotes an open, competitive telecommunications market; address concerns, particularly of rural and regional Australia about the adequacy of telecommunications services; and - reinforce the universal service obligation, digital data service obligation and the customer service guarantee. This package of legislation builds on the strong foundations that the government has already laid for the telecommunications sector. This includes enhancements of an already robust pro-competition regulatory regime and further measures that support the strongest telecommunications safeguard arrangements in the world. The government has demonstrated that it remains fully committed to this approach regardless of the ownership of Telstra. This legislative package will also give fect to a number of Connect Australia initiatives that were announced by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on 17 August. The four key planks of the Connect Australia package are: - an investment of $1.1 billion in services; - a perpetual $2 billion Communications Fund to generate revenue for rural telecommunications services into the future; - improved competition regulation including a requirement for the operational separation of Telstra to deal with ongoing concerns about Telstra's high degree of integration; and - enhanced consumer safeguards which build on the existing universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee and the digital data service obligation. Connect Australia is an initiative for both now and into the future. It is designed to address gaps in the provithe sion of mobile and broadband services. The program will facilitate the roll-out of affordable broadband connections to people living in rural, regional and remote areas; extend mobile phone coverage; build new regional communications networks; and set up vital telecommunications services for remote Indigenous communities. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 There is a close interplay between competition, consumer safeguards, targeted assistance and the government's commitment to sell our remaining share in Telstra. The government believe there is an inherent conflict of interest in the government ef- being an owner of the nation's largest telecommunications carrier while at the same time being the policy maker and regulator for the industry. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 amends the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to repeal the provisions that require the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent equity in Telstra Corporation Ltd. While the government is moving to establish the legislation immediately, it has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services, and that there is value for taxpayers from any further sale. The bill provides for the timing of the sale to remain open. To assist in achieving this objective, the bill also gives the Commonwealth the flexibility to develop detailed arrangements for sale process which will protect and optimise the Commonwealth's interests. The government's policy on foreign ownership of Telstra is unchanged. Telstra will continue to remain an Australian owned and controlled corporation. The maximum foreign ownership allowed in Telstra will remain at 35 per cent, whilst the maximum individual foreign ownership will remain at five per cent. Telstra will be required to continue to comply with its reporting obligations and remain subject to a ministerial power of direction under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 until the Commonwealth's direct shareholding in the company falls below 15 per cent. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill reaffirms the cornerstone requirements of the universal service obligation, the digital data service obligation and the customer service guarantee. These requirements will continue to apply to Telstra and other carriers, regardless of their ship structure. Changes in Telstra's ownership status, however, will not affect the government's ability to protect the interests competitors and the public generally. Consumer regulatory safeguards such as the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, price controls, network reliability framework and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman will be maintained into the future. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005 The government is strongly of the view that competition provides the best means of delivering greater choice and improved and more innovative and affordable telecommunications services for consumers. The competition reform measures in the Telecommunication Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005 that I will be bringing forward shortly into this chamber strike an appropriate balance between the need for regulation which promotes competitive services and investment in new infrastructure and allowing Telstra the scope to meet changing market conditions and demand for services. Telstra will be required to introduce operational separation between its retail and wholesale businesses. Operational separation is designed to ensure that Telstra, as the dominant carrier, treats all other carriers on a fair and transparent basis. The model has been developed with expert advice and in consultation with Telstra and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The model provides a sound approach to achieve transparency, without the risks of forced structural separation. Compliance with operational separation ownerwill be enforced through a legislative framework that imposes a licence condition enforceable by both the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and of consumers, the Arts and the ACCC. A number of consumer protection measures, such as retail price controls and the customer service guarantee, will be strengthened. These measures build on the comprehensive system of consumer safeguards that are already in place. The bill also amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to make changes to numbering plan consultation requirements and repeal provisions relating to industry development plans, and it includes measures to encourage any-to-any connectivity. The bill will increase the range of enforcement mechanisms that are available to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to ensure compliance with telecommunications regulation. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005 The bills that will be considered in the chamber this morning are complemented by an equally significant piece of legislation. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005 provides the necessary appropriations, on passage of the Telstra sale legislation, to commence funding of the government's commitment to Connect Australia and allows for long-term funding to be available for telecommunications services into the future. The future requirements of Australia's 21st century telecommunications services are still an unknown quantity. No-one knows what services will be required. What is needed is to put in place an effective process that will both assess needs as they arise and provide the necessary funding as required. To achieve this, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill implements one of the key recommendations of the Estens inquiry to establish regular independent reviews into the adequacy of telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. The independent reviews will be conducted by an expert committee, the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee (RTIRC), appointed by the minister for communications. The bill requires the first review to be commenced before the end of 2008. The government has already imposed a licence condition on Telstra requiring the company to implement and maintain an effective local presence in rural, regional and remote Australia. The bill will also create a dedicated and perpetual Communications Fund of $2 billion. Revenue generated from the fund will be spent on implementing the government's responses to recommendations contained in the reports of the independent review committee to respond to identified market failure in the provision of additional telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote areas. The amendments proposed to this bill: make clear that the Communications Fund can only be used to implement a government response to recommendations of the RTIRC that relate to telecommunications in regional, rural or remote Australia; - provide that the statement the government is required to make and table setting out its response to the recommendations of a review will explain how that response will improve telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia; - require that at least one member of the RTIRC must be nominated by an organisation that represents the interests of people in regional, rural or remote Australia; and - require future reviews to be completed within three years of the tabling of the government's response to the previous review. This will ensure that the time between the beginning of one review and the beginning of the next is no more than three years and six months. The future-proofing bill will also include amendments to the Telecommunications Act relating to the development by telecommunications industry bodies of industry codes that deal with consumer related issues. The amendments made by the bill will require the Australian Communications and Media Authority to reimburse industry bodies for their costs in developing consumer related industry codes, as long as certain conditions relating to consumer participation in the code development process are met. This measure will provide for more equitable financing of consumer related industry codes and will allow more consumer participation in code development. The Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Amendment (Industry Plans and Consumer Codes) Bill 2005 This bill gives effect to the requirement that industry be reimbursed for the costs of development of consumer codes in the manner I have just outlined and that those costs can be recouped through carrier licence charges. I draw my remarks to a close and state on behalf of the government that we believe this is a comprehensive and forward-looking package and a significant demonstration of the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that Australia's telecommunications system combines the best elements of competition, customer service and government assistance in the face of market failure. It represents the biggest commitment by any Australian government for telecommunications services-not only for rural Australia, but for all Australians. The legislative package will allow the government to focus on its core business of setting the rules for the whole telecommunications industry. Telstra will be able to on being competitive and delivering the best services to its customers. Consumers can be confident that telecommunications services will continue to improve, service quality will be maintained at high levels and existing consumer rights protected, regardless of Telstra's ownership. Rural Australia can be assured that ongoing targeted funding will allow them to access 21st century telecommunications services that are comparable with those in metropolitan areas. All Australians will have the opportunity to share in the benefits from this legislative package. I commend the bills to the House and present the explanatory memorandums.",23
19,Mr BEAZLEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We oppose the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and related legislation in its entirety, as we have done consistently since the government first brought this forward. This is a shameful moment for the transparent political process in Australia as the government bulldozes through the sale of Telstra legislation. It is a sad moment for the Australian people, who are overwhelmingly opposed to the sale. We witnessed both in this chamber and in the other chamber an almost obscene dance by our political opponents when this legislation passed throughobscene against the fact that there is a note of sadness in its carriage for ordinary Australians because they do not want this to happen and they are obliged to witness an arrogant government triumphant on the subject. It is a day when our country's national interest has been sacrificed for one man's old extreme ideology. The whole shameful saga has been characterised by deceit, cover-ups and backroom deals, presided over by a Prime Minister who cannot be bothered to be focus in the country today to witness the final shabby episode. As his decade-long obsession approaches realisation, where is he? He is strolling in Central Park and spending night after night at the luxurious Hotel Pierre in a cloud of self-aggrandisement, phoning home occasionally to issue instructions to his henchmen-the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and his fumbling deputy. The Prime Minister is thousands of kilometres away in New York, but he is up to his neck in the political manoeuvring to complete the deal to sell off Telstra, whatever it takesmore pressure on Barnaby Joyce; more bullying and sledging of Telstra executives; more buck-passing, trickery and deceit, culminating in yesterday's disgraceful Senate gagging, arrogantly ramming the legislation through as Telstra service complaints hit the 14 million mark. Secret documents reveal thousands of Telstra jobs will go, and the share price continues its inexorable decline. In a last desperate plea, regional and Australians trapped and now forever imprisoned by ancient technology begged their elected representatives to stand up and say no. It was a call unheeded by Barnaby Joyce, who rolled over like an old kelpie yesterday. After building his election campaign on a ‘no sale' platform, he is now the puppet of the faceless delegates of the Queensland National Party conference. But the plea from the bush is not too late for the member for Hume and the member for Riverina, both of whom contrived to be absent on 14 occasions when we voted on this legislation. Today they have a chance to win back the trust and respect of their constituents and not go AWOL but cross the floor and vote with us. The deceitful manipulation that has characterised these last few weeks reveals an obsessive government determined to implement its extreme proposals at any cost to Australian consumers-mum and dad shareholders, small shareholders, the thousands of Telstra workers now fearing for their jobs and the integrity of the parliamentary process. Over the past months Australians have flooded talkback radio demanding that the PM, his deputy, the Treasurer, the communications minister, National Party senators and coalition backbenchers get on with the job and fix Telstra, not sell it off. But the Prime Minister says there is nothing he can do and that the only way he can sort out the bush's problems is by selling Telstra. He does not have any ideas to help people in regional and rural Australia. He says it is a $3 billion package, but he is fiddling the figures. When you look at the detail of the Telstra plan, the so-called $3.1 billion, you realise it is all illusion. There is $1 billion and then a slow drip off the earnings of a $2 billion base. That means it will take 20 years before they have spent $3 billion on the communications infrastructure from the fund. While the Prime Minister may have sucrural ceeded in pulling the wool over Barnaby Joyce's eyes, most of the western Queensland farmers will be shaking their heads in bewilderment that the National Party has been sold a very mangy looking pup. And all the time there has been the relentless noise of the Prime Minister incessantly protestinghe has repeated this hollow claim 19 times since November 2001-that services in the bush are ‘up to scratch'. It has been something for us on this side of the House. We know the National Party spokespeople are actually Liberals-like their leader and like the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. You see them constantly pulling the wool over the eyes and putting the pressure constantly on those who represent something old and authentic in the National Party, and there are not many of them left. It has been a not particularly edifying spectacle for all of us here. But what you know is this: whatever concerns anybody has about the bush as far as communications are concerned and whatever concerns, frankly, there are in Telstra, cease today. It is all over-finished. What you see now in regional Australia is what you get. That record-that which infuriates those people in the bush-includes the thousand exchanges that are obsolete and in desperate need of upgrading to ensure basic landline services; the prime ministerial spin that provokes the New South Wales Farmers Association to describe bush telecommunications as ‘a joke'-the drivel that drives 80 per cent of farmers in New South Wales to oppose the sale. The only way we can guarantee that all Australians can get decent standards of an phone services is to hang on to Telstra. All Australians know this, especially the 1.6 million shareholders who have been deliberately kept in the dark about the true financial tion of the company-the mum and dad small T2 investors who have suffered a 41 per cent loss since listing, representing a $3,580 loss on the purchase of 2,000 T2 shares in 1999-and the consumers, who have made a whopping 14 million complaints about services; fourteen per cent of lines are faulty. And then there are those who know as a result of reading the documents that we saw leaked last week that for $5.8 billion they could have had a first-class communications service, but they will never have it. It will never happen. What have we learned in the last few weeks about government manipulation and deceit over Telstra? We know that at the 11 August secret briefing to the PM, his deputy, Treasurer, finance minister and communications minister, the new Telstra boss, Sol Trujillo, blew the whistle. It was a crucial briefing for the majority shareholder-and one denied the rest. The rest had a legitimate right to know that Telstra was borrowing billions of dollars to pay dividends. They had a right to know that Telstra had not made the investments that it had needed to make and that it had underinvested in its core infrastructure and capabilities-that the government needed to invest an estimated $2.6 billion to benefit 1.1 million families nesses predominantly in rural and remote areas. All that information was denied to shareholders and the bush. How did the Prime Minister and his ministers respond to Mr Trujillo's revelations? Did they immediately recognise that they were in possession of price sensitive information that every shareholder was entitled to share? Did they acknowledge that on the brink of the sale the company was engulfed by financial weaknesses and infrastructure failings that they were obliged to fix before any sale? No, not at all. They did not say a word. They stayed mum. They took a gamble posithat this explosive information would not leak-at least until they got their sale legislation through. But once the word was out, they squirmed in their lame attempts to explain who knew what and when. Take the Prime Minister on the 7.30 Report: Well, Kerry, the question of what precisely my ministers knew in relation to particular things, I would have to speak to them in relation to those particular things before I could answer that question. A decisive Prime Minister sharing the burden with the community! And then the communications minister and the finance minister, both present at that infamous meeting, were at serious odds with one another. Questioned specifically about whether she knew that Telstra had underinvested in infrastructure, Senator Coonan said: Well, no, of course not. I mean, that's not something that the Government is privy to as Telstra rolls out its capex expenditure. In a way you hope she was misleading. In a way you hope that the sort of briefing that she had received she had understood-she is, after all, the communications minister. It is almost a worse story if she is out there not misleading than if she is out there misleading. Finance Minister Minchin appears much better informed, anyway. He said: and busi- And of course, theyTelstrakept us fully informed, as they did the whole market of what their capital management plans were ... And then when the briefing document is leaked, what does the Prime Minister do? He blames the whistleblower. He denounces the Telstra executives as a disgrace for talking down the company's share price and campaigning against government regulatory proposals. He makes this extraordinary remark: I think it is the obligation of ... Telstra to talk the company's interest not to talk them down. That is a view which I have communicated very directly to the chairman of the board on behalf of the government. In other words, what the Prime Minister's illjudged words did was to tell the chairman of Telstra to commit an illegal act. That is basically what the Prime Minister was instructing the chairman of Telstra to do. It is an extraordinary thing. I thought it was such a delight yesterday to watch the Treasurer mince around that particular proposition. But he let us all know, and more particularly let his backbench know, exactly what he thought of the Prime Minister on that subject. In reality, he was delighted to do so. He was absolutely delighted to shaft the stiletto into the Prime Minister. The only thing that upset him, of course, was that the Prime Minister was absent from here to witness the stiletto sinking in. Mr Albanese-Send him the video.",27
20,Mr BEAZLEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As you say, no doubt he will send the video. There is no doubt about that. Now those ill-judged words of the Prime Minister are under intense scrutiny and ought to be part of a thorough ASIC investigation of Telstra's compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations. Leadership means having a vision to carry the nation forward. There has been nothing visionary about the spectacle that we have witnessed here over the last week, just a dishonest dash to sell Telstra before anyone finds out just how bad things are and a Prime Minister who resorts to lawyers and bureaucrats for cover, who bullies Telstra management, instructing them to lie to the Australian people, and whose government has sucked billions of dollars out of Telstra and ripped the guts out of its services. Any Australian can tell you that Telstra services are nowhere near up to scratch. We know that Telstra is up paying dividends out of reserves, and that is unsustainable. We know that the Prime Minister knew what was going on but did not tell the other 1.6 million investors. At first, he righteously opined that he would be breaking the law if he told them what he and his ministers knew. The next day, he completely changed his tune, claiming it was all public knowledge that has been known in the marketplace since July last year. The public certainly did not know about the faults. They did not know about the extent of the looting of Telstra's reserves. They did not know about the underinvestment. They did not know about the developing obsolescence of the work force. The Prime Minister can waffle on about legal obligations all he likes. He can wriggle and make excuses and resort to hiding behind his lawyers. But today he has not only failed all Australians; he has failed their children and grandchildren. He has carved up Australia's greatest national asset-death to public process and bereft of any vision for our future. As I look ahead to where we can be in 2025, I see a nation that is bigger and stronger than it is today, a nation that lives within its means, that produces quality goods and services that the world wants to buy, a nation whose imagination is energised by Australia's global leadership in surging industries like alternative energy and biotechnology. I see a nation that says to its young people: ‘You can be whatever you want to be. We'll invest in your skills and know-how and we'll back you all the way.' I see a nation that says to its regions and towns: ‘You're part of the country, just as much the strength of this nation as people living in our suburbs and big cities, and we'll never leave you behind.' I see a nation where there is less politics and more vision and ambition from government, a nation characterised by respect and decency that can believe in itself, a nation that is good, does good and feels good about itself. Our nation faces economic change and external threats, and some want us to change who we are and what we stand for, but we know who we are. We are Australians, we are all equal, and we will look after each other. In the Labor Party now, as we confront the consequences of this legislation passing, that means making absolutely certain that, as the government struggle with what they have chosen to do, as the government sell outbecause there is only one way that they can sell this between now and the next election and that is a fire sale-we hold up before them all the information that is out there now on what is absolutely needed in communications in the bush and in our suburbs. We are not going to let this issue go. We are going to campaign on this issue right down to the next election. We know this absolutely: whatever proportion of Telstra is sold, it will not be lot. There will be the hope in the public mind and in the mind of regional Australia that somebody will be there to make a stand for them, to make sure that they still have a capacity from governmentMr Windsor-I'll be there; don't you worry about that!",30
21,Mr BEAZLEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I note the Independent member: he will be out there doing it too, absolutely. They will understand that there is somebody prepared to take a stand to ensure that they get decent services in regional Australia. I know this as a former communications minister, and I know it absolutely: if regional Australia and our suburbs do not have access to high-speed communications, they are out of the world. Nobody can build a business in the bush on the basis of the type of communications that will be put in place by this package and the direction in which this company is now going. You know absolutely that everything here was done so cynically that, now that there are no more votes in this place-there is an issue of a campaign out there-Telstra from this day forth will forget regional Australia. The government from this day forth will forget regional Australia. The National Party from this day forth will suffer from the consequences of their shameful neglect of their constituents, and there will be plenty of people around to remind them. I give this undertaking on behalf of the Australian Labor Party: we are going to be in the lists on this from this day down to the day of the next election. The day after that election, we will have an opportunity to do something about realising the vision for the bush that we have and that we know they absolutely need.",31
22,Mr KEENAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support these two important bills, the Telthe stra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. Before doing so, I intended to rebut the arguments that I heard today from the Leader of the Opposition, who opposes our policy of selling the rest of Telstra. I have just sat here and listened to him speak for about 17 minutes. Sadly, I heard only one argument that he has put to us today about why the government should not sell the rest of Telstra-that is, the Australian people oppose us doing so. I think that is a relatively poor argument, considering that this is the fourth time we have been re-elected with selling the rest of Telstra as part of our platform to govern. My friend the member for Bowman has said to me today-and I always take his counsel-that it would be something akin to cartoon violence to attack the opposition leader today, because he is already having a very bad day. There is something a bit gratuitous about standing up to slip the boot in when it has already been done to him on such a grand scale. Mr Edwards-His worse day would be better than your best; I'll tell you that.",31
23,Mr KEENAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I doubt that very much, Member for Cowan. But I would like to address the two bills that we are discussing here today: firstly, the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005, and then, following that, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. (Quorum formed) Both of the bills that we are looking at today are part of a package of measures that I was very proud to campaign for during the last election campaign. It will be a good day for the residents of Stirling when these bills are passed. I am genuinely pleased that the passage of these bills will bring to an end one of the most absurd aspects of public policy in Australia today, where the largest telecommunications company in Australia remains in a hybrid form of ownership, half owned by the private sector and half owned by the government. That, plainly, is a ridiculous situation. We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition today about how services will suffer as a result of the passage of these bills. When you are in opposition, and you cannot seem to work out what you stand for, all that is left is opposition for its own sake. We have heard fearmongering on a grand scale in this debate and in the industrial relations debate, and we will continue to hear it until Labor comes up with some positives for Australia. If Labor, under their current leadership, knew why they wanted to govern-if they had a set of coherent ideas that they could take to the Australian people about improving the country-it is just possible that they could have contributed in a constructive way to the creation of a new regulatory regime of telecommunications in this country. Alas, what they chose instead was blanket opposition, which contributes absolutely nothing to today's debate. What we have heard-and what we will no doubt hear, drearily, from speaker after speaker today-is an ideological argument against privatisation. Amazingly, that argument was put this morning by somebody who championed privatisation when he was last in government. The reality is that the continued health of telecommunications services in Australia has absolutely nothing to do with Telstra remaining half-owned by the government. When the Prime Minister addressed this chamber on 6 September this year, he said: The reality is that, until we get the burden of majority government ownership off Telstra's back, it will not be able to operate as a fair dinkum company in the Australian telecommunications market. That is the reason why we are going to sell it. It has nothing to do with budget proceeds; it has nothing to do with ideology. Government ownership will not provide all Australians with access to first-class telecommunications. This has never been the case and never will be, whether the industry we are talking about is telecommunications or otherwise. Perhaps the best example of this is the woeful situation that existed when Telecom Australia, as Telstra was then known, was 100 per cent owned by the government. When Telstra was 100 per cent in government hands, it took up to two years to get a telephone service connected. Now, no matter where you live in Australia, whether it be in the remotest part, the longest you will wait to get your phone connected is 20 days-20 days as opposed to two years when Telstra was 100 per cent in government hands. The quality of services will be determined by the regulatory framework that the government will establish-a framework that will guarantee all Australians a base level of services. The government will retain the right to intervene when market failure does occur and to either enforce individual companies to remediate the problem or to fix the problem itself. Not only does this system of oversight allow a base level of services but also ensures diversity within the market, which will result in more competition and therefore better services for all Australians. Government ownership does not ensure this; proper regulation does. I will continue to maintain that government ownership of Telstra detracts from its ability to provide ser- measures. vices effectively when it is competing against up to 100 other competitors. The reality is that, since we came to government in 1996 and half privatised the company, telecommunications services have continued to improve. Privatising Telstra is part of a longer agenda to increase competition and efficiency in Australia and to strengthen our economy. Effective rules and regulations will guarantee services. Since 1997, telecommunications expenditure and commitments by the Australian government have exceeded $4 billion. Of this, $1 billion has been invested directly into telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia. This targeted funding investment has supported the provision of important telecommunications infrastructure and services. The new targeted funding package recently announced by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Prime Minister, which comes on top of all that has been done to provide services already, is a key element in the government's strategy to future proof regional Australia's telecommunications services. The underlying message of this package is that it is the government's priority to ensure that all Australians will have access to world-class phone and internet services. I also rise today in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. This forms part of the package of telecommunications legislation which gives efit fect to key components of the government's Connect Australia telecommunications package. It gives effect to the competition and consumer regulatory changes that the government announced in August. I commend the government's commitment to strengthening competition and consumer protection The bill guarantees that full privatisation of Telstra will be preceded by strong regulatory safeguards to protect and stimulate competition and encourage growth and diversification within the industry itself. The government will strengthen the framework to term continue to promote an open and competitive telecommunications market to ensure that competition continues to develop now and into the future. The changes will be-very sensibly-technologically neutral, avoiding the mandating of any particular technologies in what is a very rapidly changing sector. The changes strike a balance between the need for regulation that promotes competitive services to consumers and the need to invest in new infrastructure. This is a twofold mechanism, allowing Telstra the scope to meet changing market conditions and the demand for services. Since 1997, competition has already delivered tangible benefits to consumers in the form of lower prices and a greater choice of service providers and products. There are now over 100 companies providing telecommunications services. The benefits of this competition are most evident, I believe, in the area of international phone calls and mobile telephony. I well remember that it was a big occasion to make an international phone call when I was growing up and Telecom Australia was in charge of all the international calls going in and out of the country. Nowadays, due to competition, it is a lot cheaper and the benefits to consumers in that area and in mobile telephony-where we have seen prices consistently reduce over the past decade-should be obvious for all to see. Competition has revolutionised our telecommunications market. We should remember these great advances when we are here today debating the benefits of competition. It is grossly unfair for players within this market, apart from Telstra, who are forced to compete against their own government-a situation in which true competition on an equitable basis can never occur. There are many aspects to the government's new regulatory and competition reforms that will benefit consumers. The bill will introduce operational separation to ensure that Telstra treats its wholesale customers fairly. It will also provide greater certainty for companies looking to make new investments in infrastructure, and clarify and speed up decision making by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Perhaps the most significant advancement in all of this is the objective of operational separation, which will achieve transparency for Telstra's wholesale customers-who are of course their competitors-so that they can be confident that they are getting a fair compared with Telstra's own retail businesses. This will work through the government introducing processes that ensure Telstra does not unfairly favour its own retail businesses over wholesale customers by imposing separation measures. This robust and effective measure is necessary to police Telstra's behaviour post sale and will further make sure that collusion will not affect the market environment. The requirements will mean that Telstra will have to implement separate retail, wholesale and key network business units, including separate premises and staff incentive programs based on the performance of those business units. This process will ensure that price and non-price terms and conditions are provided on an equivalent basis to Telstra's retail and wholesale customers and that the government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have oversight and enforcement. This model provides a sound approach to achieving the objectives without slicing and dicing Telstra into pieces. It is credible, cost-effective, durable, enforceable and tailored to Telstra's business. The government are committed to ensuring that competitors get opportunities in what is a fiercely competitive market. We are determined to make Telstra accountable for their actions. Other measures of this bill give the minister power to direct Telstra to amend the plan, if it is found not to be complying with that plan, and the power to rectify its behaviour. The minister also has broader powers to direct Telstra to amend the plan if it is found not to be operating effectively. By committing Telstra to an open and fully consultative process, it ensures fairness and transparency for Telstra's competitors. I would like to take this opportunity to make mention of the Minister for Communideal, cations, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Her commitment, along with the commitment of others in the government in providing better telecommunications for all Australians, has been relentless. Recently she visited my electorate of Stirling, which is suffering from some broadband black spots. She announced a renewed commitment from Telstra through additional funding which will go a long way towards eradicating those black spots. I would like to thank the minister for doing that. Mr Wilkie-$200,000 will not go very far! It will not pay for much.",32
24,Mr KEENAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"That is not true. You will find that all those black spots will be filled. am happy to discuss that with the member for Swan afterwards. While the details are yet to be finalised, this extensive plan is going to strengthen competition and regulation through other measures. Also as part of this bill, the government will amend telecommunications-specific access and anticompetitive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act to provide greater certainty for new investment. This will ultimately improve the operation of the telecommunications access regime for competition, creating more options for consumers. To provide greater certainty to investors in new networks, the ACCC will be required to consider the costs and risks associated with new network investment when making access decisions. This builds on existing provisions which allow companies to seek certainty about how they will be treated by the ACCC prior to making investments. Obviously, our providing that certainty within the market is vitally important when they are making business decisions. To improve and speed up decision making by the ACCC, the government will be providing additional resources to that body to enable them to fulfil their mission effectively. Also, by streamlining the ACCC's processes and requiring the ACCC to make procedural rules for declaring new services, assessing access undertakings and arbitrating access pricing disputes, the federal government is further enhancing the body that will effectively regulate the telecommunications sector. This will be reviewed again in 2009, which will ensure telecommunications competition arrangements keep up with the demands of consumers and the market. Furthermore, the current price controls on Telstra expire at the end of the year. The government will introduce new price conI trols on Telstra, to commence from 1 January 2006. These price controls will maintain the 22c cap on untimed local calls; ensure parity in local call prices offered to regional and metropolitan customers; cap increases in the charges for connecting phones, in line with inflation; ensure that, on average, there will be no price increases across a basket of Telstra's line rentals, local calls, STD, international and fixed-to-mobile calls; protect consumers from major line rental increases by allowing only basic line rental products to increase to match inflation; and, finally, require Telstra to have a package of services targeted to low-income consumers. However, the new price controls will no longer cover services provided to large businesses. This ensures that the benefits of all call price reductions are passed through to consumers and small businesses. This is an important aspect of the government's commitment to protecting its current and future customers and making sure that their hip pockets are safeguarded-another avenue where the Australian government protects its taxpayers. Recognising that continued evolution of competition may place pressure on Telstra's national pricing structures, the government will be looking further into the interaction between the current approaches to wholesale and retail pricing, in consultation with Telstra and the ACCC. These changes will ensure competition continues to develop in Australia and will continue to bring benefits to consumers in the form of lower prices and new and improved services. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 forms part of a package of legislation that coincides with the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. The bill will enable the Commonwealth to sell its remaining shares in Telstra, and it is imperative that this happens. Passage of this bill will trigger our commitment to providing $1.1 billion in funding for broadband, mobile and Indigenous community services, as well as the establishment of the $2 billion Communications Fund, to be maintained in perpetuity for funding future upgrades as determined by regular reviews. Despite owning Telstra, the government does not control Telstra's operations. (Time expired)",35
25,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Hotham) (10.17 am)Labor opposes the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and related bill. These bills do not just sell Telstra; they sell out Australia and they short-change Australians. There are two related elements to these debates, and both of them lead to the same conclusion: Telstra must not be sold. The first element is a consideration of the parlous state of the network. I have just heard the member for Stirling talk about how good things are, but this is a network that this government and successive Telstra boards have brought to its knees. The second element is the treatment of small Telstra shareholders, who have been short-changed by this government's unhealthy obsession with the Telstra sale. This is a government that ought to be ashamed of itself for what it has done to Telstra, not just by these bills but over the last nine years. It is a cumulative disgrace. We are dealing with not just another broken election promise-a promise that the government would not sell a further share in Telstra until the system was up to scratch-but the fact that the government has overseen massive underinvestment in the Telstra network, which has denied many Australians access to a world-class telecommunications system. Everyone knows that the economic future of this country has to be built around participating in the services economy, in particular, and having access to world-class telecommunications. If the regions, in particular, cannot get hooked up to world-class broadband services, they will not be able to compete and cannot be part of the growth opportunities, and that is where a government that owns and controls what is almost a public monopoly in terms of the provision of this infrastructure quite frankly has to play a role. I remind the House that, for the whole of the past nine years, the government has been the majority shareholder. It has been able to influence decisions of the board. As the national government, it has had the capacity to directly invest in the nation's infrastructure, but it has failed on that task. If in fact the system is not up to scratch now when the government has owned and controlled the company, how does anyone seriously expect the system to improve when it is fully privatised-except at a price? And that is the rub. That is one of the aspects this government will not tell you about. On top of all this-on top of the failure to invest, on top of the fact that the company has massively underinvested-the government just did not tell us; it failed to disclose, and it failed to allow to be disclosed, the true state of the network. It took a new CEO straight off the plane from America to reveal the state of Telstra's network and the board's unsustainable dividend policy. What was the Prime Minister's response? His response was to attack the management of the company. But attack them for what? He attacked them for telling the truth. The Prime Minister had form in this regard. Remember the ‘never, ever man' in terms of the GST? This is a person who does not want the truth told when it does not suit the government's interests. This is a failing that has not only held back the economic development of the nation; it has ultimately hurt the company. Largely forgotten by the government have been the T2 investors. Those investors have been horribly burnt. They have seen a 40 per cent decline in the value of their investments. I have heard the Prime Minister talk in this House about one of his so-called proudest achievements: the way in which ordinary wage earners have been able to get real wage increases. How proud is he of telling people to buy the T2 shares-the second tranche of Telstra-and to have faith in the government, only to see their value decline dramatically by 40 per cent? The truth of it is that these investors paid more for their shares because the government did not tell them the truth. They were told by the government that the Telstra share value was growing strongly and that investment would help them plan for their future. Some future! They have lost 40 per cent in value. Thousands of dollars have been lost by these investors. Apart from the fact that the government has not got the system up to scratch, it should not have brought these bills into the House before it answered these two critical questions in relation to the investors-the mum and dad investors. First, how was the T2 price calculated or substantiated? Second, why did the subscription price drop so dramatically? The government has an obligation to answer those questions. These are the questions that matter, not only to the T2 investors, who have a right to know, but to the potential victims of the T3 float. The bills purport to future-proof regional and rural Australia's telecommunications. They do not. They consign regional Australians to a second-rate telecommunications future. We now know by virtue of the secret dossier that was presented by Telstra that the government has overseen underinvestment to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion in the Telstra network over the past three to five years. Rural and regional Australians have been by far the biggest losers. Telstra reveals in the secret document that one in seven lines is faulty. Just think of it-a government telling us the system is up to scratch, but Telstra telling us that one in seven lines fails. How can the government say the system is up to scratch when one in seven lines fails? The worse of the worse exchanges-a list that I released last week-revealed that the extent of Telstra's network failings was worse in rural and regional Australia. The overwhelming majority of Australia's failing exchanges are located in regional Australia. I have talked before about how regions will not be given the opportunity to grow, to create jobs, to take part in the prosperity, unless they get access to world-class communications. The system is failing all around the country, but the biggest failures are in the regions. Many of those areas are located in the electorates of National Party and Liberal Party members. They have sold out their constituencies. Senator Joyce capitulated, but at least he had a go. He asked the questions. He pushed the government. It is a huge disappointment-not only to us but more importantly to the constituents in Queensland he claims to represent-that he was mugged, bruised and bullied and that he conceded. He voted with the government. The members for Riverina and Hume have abstained from voting in this chamber. They know how poisonous this decision is within their electorates. They should have a bit more courage and come in and vote with us against the sale. As for the rest of The Nationals, they might as well be members of the Liberal Party. These days the National Party is just a paid-up sub-branch of the Liberal Party. Mr Windsor-It's a disgrace.",36
26,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is an absolute disgrace. So great is this betrayal by the National Party that this vote will do to them what the GST did to the Democrats. The government said that they would not sell another share in Telstra until it was up to scratch. I have already said that one in seven lines fails, and that the worse of the worse are in the regions. But this was not a promise that was made once by the Prime Minister-it was certainly made before the last election-it was a promise made on at least 20 other occasions where we have access to the records. The Prime Minister promised the country not to sell a further share in Telstra before services in the regions were up to scratch. Mr Windsor-He's sold out.",37
27,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"He has sold out. The government has sold out. These were members of parliament who went to the last electionforget about the Prime Minister's word; we know that it is worthless-in each of their seats with the same promise: ‘We won't sell another share until the system is up to scratch.' We have just heard the minister for communications praised in this House by the other side. What did she concede recently? She conceded that services outside the capital cities are not as reliable as other services. That is straight from the horse's mouth, straight from the person praised. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Pearce, who is at the table, laughs. This is the government's response-they gloat, they smirk. They have all taken smirk lessons from the Treasurer. They think it is so effective. The fact is they have made lying an art form. They have gone to the electorate and continued to tell untruths and they expect the Australian public will not catch up with them. By no objective assessment can it be said that regional services are up to scratch. Even the National Farmers Federation, in the course of its pathetic capitulation on the Telstra issue, has restated its views that regional services are not up to scratch but, unlike the Labor Party, the NFF leadership has joined the National Party in rolling over and selling out its constituency. Mr Windsor-It is the National Party.",38
28,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I wonder about that. Certainly the leadership seems to be in that camp. It makes one wonder at what point Mr Corish and his colleagues were themselves mugged, like Barnaby Joyce. I remember Mr Corish in the Senate inquiry, in the one-day assessment the government allowed the Senate to undertake. We have one day for debate on these bills in this chamber, today, and the debate has been guillotined to three hours, and there was a one-day review. The biggest company in the country and the government allows scrutiny by the parliament for two days. What a disgrace! But even with that the NFF were not convinced. What have they got? I would like to see the letter that is referred to-the set of undertakings that the government has given. We have seen letters from this government on policy positions before; they are worthless. The National Farmers Federation will find, to their everlasting shame, that this government will dud them. But the House will be pleased to hear that not all farm organisations have rolled over. The Western Australian Farmers Federation and the Queensland Farmers Federation publicly maintain their opposition to the sale. Good on them. They know what is in the interests of their members, and it is not the sale of Telstra. The South Australian Farmers Federation are also standing firm. Let me read a statement issued by them in the wake of the NFF's sell-out. I ask the members for Grey, Barker, Mayo and Wakefield to take note. This is what the South Australian Farmers Federation had to say: Some rural and regional areas in South Australia have some of the oldest and poorest telecommunications infrastructure in Australia. If this is not fixed before the full sale of Telstra, we will be passing on substandard infrastructure to generations to come, which will make their farm nesses and rural communities unsustainable. I can understand the government not caring about rural Australia but not the National Party. What is its base, if it is not the farm sector? We have a circumstance in South Australia where the farmers' representatives are saying, ‘We will have unsustainable businesses', but the National Party does not want to hear that. It turns a deaf ear; it turns against its constituency. I tell you: no party will survive if it ignores its base. The National Party has ignored its base and will pay a heavy price. ‘Unsustainable'-indeed! The word ‘unsustainable' is not my word; it is the word of the farm sector in South Australia. Why do they say that? They say it with good cause, because we now know that Telstra estimates that investment of $5.7 billion is necessary to deliver next generation broadband to households and businesses across Australia. How can farms survive and sustain themselves in the future unless they are going to have access to that? How do they get up-to-date weather reports? How do they follow where the prices are? How do they make those sorts of decisions that are so vital to modern businesses? How do they do it if they do not have the services? They do not-they suffer; they go out of business; they are forced off the land. Well done, National Party! That is the sort of future you are consigning your base to. The government's sale package, whatever it says, will not deliver that investment. It will not even fix the current holes in the network. The proposed Connect Australia program falls far short of what is needed. We have seen the examples of the rorts programs. There is absolutely no guarantee that the funds will not fall victim to the same sort of rorting that the government has turned into an art form. Let the House understand this: returns busi- from the proposed Communications Fund will not begin to flow until 2008-that is three years away-and will provide only a fraction of the existing Telstra dividend stream, which, on most estimates, is $100 million a year. Forget about the $2 billion; that is what is being invested in a trust fund. The only thing that will be available from it for telecommunications improvement is the earnings on the fund. Do you think $100 million is going to be enough per year, especially set against a dividend stream that has been producing in the order of $1.3 billion to $2 billion a year? What nonsense. How could the National Party fall for this stupidity? The simple truth is that the investment in telecommunications infrastructure has been funded from Telstra's existing dividend stream. The Acting Prime Minister yesterday, in his answer to a dorothy dixer from the member for Hinkler-I recall this wellchallenged Labor to say what policy it had ever put forward to fix the infrastructure problem in telecommunications. I will tell him. Back in 1998 Labor proposed the establishment of the Telstra reward fund-a fund that would see not all of the dividend from Telstra but 35 per cent of it paid into a fund to improve rural, regional and other infrastructure particularly associated with telecommunications. We repeated that policy on a number of occasions. I got the Parliamentary Library recently to calculate what that fund would be worth today had it been invested in. Do you know what it would be worth? $5.3 billion. What does that tell us? It tells us that the problem in telecommunications can be fixed without selling Telstra. That is the point. If you have the will, determination and preparedness as majority shareholder-as a government that actually believes that investing in our future and telecommunications is important for regional Australia-you make sure the investment happens. You either do it as the majority shareholder sitting on the board and reinvesting the company's profits or you do it as a government from the dividend stream that it gets. But we have seen that the government has only had two purposes for the dividend. One is to prop up its budget surpluses. We know back in 2001-02 that, if it had not been for the Telstra dividend stream, the budget would have been in deficit. The Treasurer does not like deficits; the Treasurer does not want them, so he will do anything. He will raid Telstra. He will tell it that it cannot vest again in the system; it has to invest in us, the government, and in our survival! The second reason that it has been keen to get these dividends is to keep the share price fattened, to keep it up, and to make people believe that this payment of dividends means that the company is travelling well and therefore the share price is worth something. Why was that important? Because it had to con people even more that T2 was worth something. We now know that T2 is worth less-a lot less; 40 per cent less. This is a government that has not had a vision for telecommunications and the layout of its infrastructure. I say this to the mentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is at the table: read Labor's policy and understand what could have been achieved in this. It is a policy that demonstrates that you do not need to sell Telstra-just fix it, and you can fix it without selling it. The policy that we proposed was important not just in terms of the infrastructure. have also demonstrated that selling Telstra is bad for the budget. We have done this on a number of occasions, and our calculation has been confirmed by the Treasury. There is an excellent article by David Uren in today's Australian that shows that this sale of Telstra, on his calculations, is bad for the budget. Even on his most generous forecast, it will cost the budget at least $290 millionand, having sold it, you do not have the dividend stream which comes year in, year out; you lose that forever. Not only is it bad for the bush; it is bad for the budget. Why would you do it? That is the point in terms of this government's obsession. They say it is not ideological. What is it? It is not based on any sense that it is going to improve regional infrastructure. It is not based on any sense that the investment is going to be guaranteed in a world-class teleincommunications system in this country. It is not based on anything that says that it is going to be great for the budget. There is more pain for the T2 shareholders. They have seen their share price drop even further since the release of the secret document. There is a very interesting question here in relation to a class action if in fact, on 11 August, Telstra came here and said, ‘We have a shocking system; we have a system that has been underinvested in; we have an unsustainable dividend practice,' and the Prime Minister said, ‘Oh, that's no good; keep that hidden; don't tell anyone about that.' But then it got out. I think there is a very interestParliaing question. What about the people who invested in T2 between 11 August and the time of the revelations in the document? Don't you think they are entitled to action against the board of directors of Telstra for having been kept in the dark and making an investment believing what was out there in the marketplace when the deceit of what was We out there in the marketplace was different from what was being said in the secrecy of the cabinet room? The Prime Minister gets a secret briefing but he does not want the truth out. But it gets out. Indeed, when it gets out, the Prime Minister is asked to release it and he says no, it was a secret briefing. So concerned is the Securities and Investment Commission, the watchdog, that it is now investigating Telstra and, as I understand it, investigating the Prime Minister and his statements. Well, it should. The legislation that we are passing today in this parliament-courtesy of the Liberal Party and the sell-out National Party-is bad for the bush, bad for the budget and bad for investors. That is what it is about. We will campaign on these issues around the country, day in, day out, to make sure that people understand not only the lost opportunity but the dudding that they have been getting. That is a solemn promise. The value of T2 shares has fallen by 40 per cent since the listing. This week the shares are languishing at a two-year low. How does the government explain that fact? How does it explain the collapse of share value for mum and dad investors who believed the government when it told them that T2 was a good deal? Quite simply, it cannot, and it does not. No company engaged in such deception would be allowed to get away with it, but, as always, there is one rule for this arrogant government and one rule for everyone else. It is clear that the interests of shareholders have been the last thing on this government's mind. The government has sold out the bush and it has sold out small investors. A good government this one! Just remember it next time you are asked to vote for it. It is in the clear interests of small shareholders wealth Bank?",38
29,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,What about the Commonwealth Bank? Here is this rabbit talking about the past. We are talking about the future. ,41
30,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"You can take offence at that, but you are a rabbit if that is all you come up with. I am asking you to answer these questions honestly.",41
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I remind the member that he should direct his comments through the chair.,41
32,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,How does the government not disclose this information? Mr Windsor-Hop up and down?,41
33,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yes, go down a hole; I think that is the best solution for him. These shareholders deserve the truth-the truth about their investment. At the briefing on 11 August, Telstra revealed that its network is crumbling from massive underinvestment, one in seven of its telephone lines is faulty, the staff are undertrained, its IT systems are hopelessly inadequate, and its dividend stream is built on unsustainable borrowings. Well, that is a good scoresheet! I wonder what the market would think of that. I know what it already thinks, and it means another loss to T2 shareholders. Customers deserve this information; T2 investors deserve this information. They only got it because Labor forced the government's hand. As I say, the small Prime Minister was perfectly happy to keep it hidden. This government does not want the sale subjected to any scrutiny. That is why we have seen this dreadful guillotining, this shameful abuse of the democratic processes-no scrutiny. There are questions that still need to be answered. What will happen to the share price now that Telstra's dividend policy has been exposed and, according to its own board, is unsustainable? We need to know the answer to that. We also need to know how a toothless local presence plan will stop Telstra packing up and deserting regional communities when it cannot turn a buck. And we need to know how the government will stop a rampant privatised Telcan stra putting the interests of its shareholders first and the interests of the customers and employees last. On the employee issue, it is not just the secret document the other day but also another document that the government will not release-14,000 job losses. Yesterday Labor revealed a chilling email written by Mr Greg Winn, another one of the amigos, in which he said that they ‘Do not expect any radical moves to strip people out until we are ready'-in other words, until the bills are through the parliament. Once it cannot be held up to anymore scrutiny, then we will sack them, then we will cut more services, then we will disinvest in the company. All for the purposes of getting this grubby deal through the parliament, they will sit quiet on it. It is little wonder Australians oppose this sale. They oppose it in droves and they will have that opportunity when we campaign around this. I said that we oppose these bills. But I believe it is important to record the basis of our opposition with an amendment. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “that this House declines to give the bills a second reading and: (1) condemns the government for failing to honour the Prime Minister's Telstra election promise that “we won't sell another share til we're satisfied, completely satisfied things in the bush are up to scratch,” and (2) notes that: (a) Telstra's secret briefing to the government on 11 August 2005 confirms that one in seven lines are faulty; (b) the Australian Communications and Media Authority has found that the worse performing exchanges in the country service rural, regional and remote communities; (c) the Minister for Communications has admitted that rural, regional and remote telephone services are less reliable than metropolitan services; (d) the government has overseen underinvestment of $2-3 billion in the Telstra network over the past 3-5 years; (e) the proposed Connect Australia program will not adequately address the existing service deficiencies in regional, rural and remote Australia; (f) returns from the proposed Communications Fund will provide only a fraction of the existing ongoing Telstra dividend stream to government; (g) necessary telecommunications infrastructure investment can be made from Telstra's existing dividend stream to government; and (h) the bribe used to guarantee the sale of Telstra will consign regional, rural and remote Australians to second rate telecommunications services in the future”. This legislation should not be passed. It is a disgrace. It is a broken promise. It sells out Australia. It sells out Australians. It should be opposed.",41
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Wilkie-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,42
35,Mr BAIRD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Hotham may be a good swimun- mer, but as an economist he really belongs to that the Moscow central branch. His policies and his economic foresight really belong to the old Fabian socialist school, or more likely the Trotskyite school of central Europe. Mr Crean-This is withering stuff. You didn't even listen to the speech!",42
36,Mr BAIRD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"If you actually visit central Europe, they will tell you in places like Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, EstoniaMr Crean-Here we go-the old Cold War lives on in the Liberal Party.",42
37,Mr BAIRD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Of course, they don't want to listen. We listened in quietness to the member for Hotham, with his old-fashioned Fabian socialist ideas of how he wants big government to own every enterprise in the whole model that was shown to the world as being one of failure. Point to a socialist tem that has worked effectively and that provides for its workers, for the members of the country, a very significant increase in their standards of living. I will show you one on the other side of the agenda where real growth occurs, where the private sector is the one that runs the economy, not the government owning large enterprises. It cannot respond to market changes in a whole different, dynamic world. That is the fact. Mr Windsor-You live in Sydney, Bruce.",42
38,Mr BAIRD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I have heard the member for New England arguing before his old fashioned-(Quorum formed) As I was saying-and I thank the Chief Opposition Whip for drawing the attention of my colleagues to what I am saying-the members opposite are living in this brave new Fabian socialist world, where big government controls big business and everything that happens in it, rather than in a free market economy, where the government's role is to get out of business and to be there simply as regulator. That model has proved successful in those countries around the world that have adopted it. That model, which responds to modern economic conditions, has delivered to those countries the right economic returns with growth in GDP, significant improvements in real living standards and reductions in unemployment and in inflation. The member for Hotham has outlined the model of previous days at great length. We know that today, with the Latham diaries dominating the events of this House, all those opposite are following less of what they actually think. Mr Latham has highlighted the fact that those opposite are finished as a political force-and this, Telstra debate, is a prime example of why they are finished. They live so much in the past, with past ideology as to the management of the economy. In contrast, this side of systhe House is concerned with appropriate management of the economy and with providing real results for the people of Australia. Let us look at the results in terms of GDP growth. Since this government has been in power, we have had an average GDP growth of 3½ per cent per annum. We now have the lowest unemployment rate that we have seen in this country for over 25 years-down to five per cent. I know, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, in your seat and in mine, those figures are down to about 2½ per cent. So the people in our areas know that this government delivers. Then there are real wages. Whether they be blue-collar workers, white-collar workers or management people, the real income of people in Australia has risen by over 15 per cent since this government came to power. With all your unionist mates and their Fabian socialism, under your government real wages only rose by three per cent. It highlights the fact that, under a free market economy under appropriate management, we have real growth for the average worker of this country. This is what we have in terms of the privatisation bill before us. This bill is about allowing government corporations to compete in the private sector without being trammelled by the numerous regulatory constraints of a government body. There is some degree of hypocrisy in this exercise. If we go through past speeches, as I have been doing, we find out what those opposite did when they were on this side of the House. On 17 September 1990, in speaking about the privatisation of various bodies, Mr the line, regard- Beazley said: When someone raises such a matter we are entitled to expect that person to come into the chamthe ber with a coherent privatisation strategy. They were the words of the Leader of the Opposition in September 1990-and how he changes his tune pragmatically when Leader of the Opposition. Then in October 1990, in praising Bill Kelty, Mr Keating said: He has been powerful because, basically, he has moved the trade union movement to this policy. But he has stood in support of the sale lian Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd. The Opposition could never do these things. There they were, privatising Qantas, as they privatised Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Bank. When they were on this side of the House, it was all okay. They spoke about the great moves they were making-the great economic reforms. Mr Hawke, in a speech on this issue, said: These decisions are yet another instalment of the Government's drive for micro-economic reform, a process that is creating a more dynamic and efficient Australian economy, an economy that can take on and compete with the world's best. Precisely; that is the type of government we want in this country and the type of economic reform we want to see in it-basic microeconomic reform which moves this country forward. We compete in a globalised world, where corporate bodies are out there looking for every opportunity. Unless we move forward by taking the advantages of reform, we will slip further down on the table of economic performers. We are very proud that, within the range of OECD countries, we sit amongst the top economic performers in the world. What a great achievement that is. Turning to this bill, let us look at some of the comments appearing in the newspapers. Do they support the opposition in its stand? Let us take the editorial in the Australian. About the sale of Telstra, it says: This is good, if long overdue, news, a result The Weekend Australian has advocated for many years ... By getting out of telecommunications, the Government will release about $30 billion. Treasurer Peter Costello has talked of using this money to pay for public service pensions, which would free up tax revenues to be spent on useful social programs. There is no reason not to do it. It goes on to say: There is no longer any need for the public sector to own telecommunications infrastructure, any of Austrawhere. Rural rent-seekers ... may have their commentsBut as The Australian's Newspoll showed this week, 79 per cent of people outside the capital cities are satisfied with their phone service, 6 per cent more than the comparable city figure. But we were not content with that. With this proposal, the government is putting in $3½ billion to improve our telecommunications network around this country and in country areas. So the Australian strongly supports our proposal to privatise Telstra. The Financial Review says: Notwithstanding the tortuous nine-year path to this point, the prospect of finally privatising one of Australia's biggest companies is relief. Telstra will be free to chart its own course, subject to regulation. And the government's paradox-being both owner and regulator-will disappear. Let the market make its verdict on the performance of the company. And let management and shareholders do the work of grappling with the regulator. That is the advice of the Financial Review. I am sure that very few members opposite bother to read what the financial sector has to say about the government's proposals. The Financial Review says: ‘This is a good idea. It is long overdue. It is important for microeconomic reform and it is important for the reform of our economy.' What a great contrast with the speech we have just had from the member for Hotham, who is back in the past-back controlling and owning these large government corporations; never mind the marketplace. He talked about the share value. If the government had had its way, we would have seen the privatisation long ago and in a different market situation. The question is: what do the editorial writers say? They are fully supportive. What do the newspapers say? They are all fully supportive. Who says anything different? The only people who say anything different are the unions, who are living in the past, living in their own Trotskyist little out there and saying, ‘Let's take over the old companies, let's put our mates on the board and let's run them as a public service network.' This is what they want for the future. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 will empower the government to sell its remaining shares in Telstra at some point in the future when the government deems the conditions to be right to proceed with the sale. It will remove the requirement in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 for the Commonwealth to maintain a 50 per cent plus one share in Telstra. This is all supposed to be very radical, according to the opposition, but this is exactly the same requirement and bill that they put through in relation to Qantas when they diluted the amount of government ownership in that. We supported that move totally, but all you people on the opposite side can do to show how irrelevant you are is say: ‘We're against it. No matter what the government proposes, we're against it. No matter what our track record is in privatisation, we're against it. No matter what it might do to free up the economy and improve competition from other telcos, we're against it.' This bill has been designed to allow as much flexibility as possible in setting the terms of the sale. The Future Fund is so important in allowing us to prepare for the future-the future requirements of the government in the area of superannuation liabilities and infrastructure building across the country. How important is that? If you look at the United States, they expect there will be a significant gap. In 10 years time, 23 per cent of the economy will be required for or involved in their social security payments, their superannuation liability for public servants right across the board and their Medicare obligations. The current government take is 15 per cent, and there is a lot of concern about how they will bridge that gap. But cells this government has recognised the problems of the future, including the demographic changes that are occurring, and is preparing for the future through the Future Fund, which is a very significant, innovative step forward and one to be supported. The bill will remove a number of ministerial discretionary powers and reporting obligations once government ownership falls below 15 per cent. It also affirms the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee, which are so significant. It is not as if we are cutting and running. The government will continue to look at community service obligations and at what we need to do to look after the interests in the bush. Despite the protestations from the member for New England, telecommunications service in the bush under this government and Telstra has improved dramatically. We have seen the provision of $1.1 billion in funding for broadband, mobile and Indigenous communications services. A further $2 billion Communications Fund is to be maintained in perpetuity for funding future upgrades, as determined by regular reviews into regional communication. This bill will also allow the government to remove and redress the conflict of interest that arises from having the government as both the regulator and the largest participator in the communications marketplace. In conclusion, may I say that the members opposite continue to live in the past, in an old socialist world of the government owning all the major companies. This government is moving forward in response to the demands of the time and providing a competitive environment so that Telstra, cut free of the obligations of being government owned, will service the community and have competitors. At the same time, through the amount that is received from the sale of the shares, we will achieve a significant plus in terms of looking to the future of this country. We will put that amount into infrastructure and into paying off liabilities. Of course, members opposite have no concern about future liabilities. We know how they racked up some $96 billion in debt. Their economic responsibility is clear for everyone to see, and their hypocrisy is clear for everyone to see, given what they did with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the sale of Qantas and the sale of Australian Airlines. The government have said consistently that we aim to sell Telstra as part of our move for microeconomic reform in this country. I support the sale strongly, and I commend the bill to the House.",43
39,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Today we see the government ramming through its ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra in less than morning's debate. It has had this ideological obsession, shared by John Howard and Peter Costello, for a long time. In ramming through its ideological obsession this morning in less than half a day's debate, what do we find? We find the Howard-Costello government-the Liberal and National partiesdoing that in breach of an express election commitment made to the Australian people. That commitment was not just made on one occasion, in the run-up to the 2004 election. There was an express commitment made in the 2004 election, the 2001 election and the 1998 election that the government would not further privatise Telstra unless there was a guarantee of adequate services to rural and regional Australia-unless, as the Prime Minister has put it, services were up to scratch. And that faithful promise, that faithful commitment to the Australian people, is being broken today. I have been a member of this parliament since 1993, and at every election since then-1993, 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004the Liberal and National parties have gone to the Australian people with a commitment to privatise part or privatise more of Telstra, and on every occasion the Labor Party has gone to the Australian people opposed to any or any further privatisation of Telstra. Today we meet that faithful undertaking that we made to the Australian people at successive elections-1993, 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004. Today the government is pursuing its ideological objective. In the course of pursuing its ideological objective, in the course of pursuing its obsession with the privatisation of Telstra over the last 9½ long years that the government has been in office, we have seen the government comprehensively neglecting a whole range of telecommunications issues, which has rendered Australia's international competitiveness in telecommunications down at the bottom of the scale. That applies a in particular to some of the competitive and regulatory arrangements which I will come to in due course as I make some remarks on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. The Australian people and this parliament should not forget that when John Howard made his election promises in 1996 he said to the Australian people that he would go to the 1996 election with a promise to privatise one-third of Telstra-what we know famously as T1. In the run-up to the 1996 election and in the so-called great debate in that election campaign, John Howard was asked on a number of occasions: ‘You only want to privatise one-third? That leaves one-third private and two-thirds public. Doesn't that leave you a bit pregnant?' In response, John Howard said on more than one occasion: ‘No, no. That's the right public policy mix.' So, having told that to the Australian people in 1996 so that he could slide through and get himself elected by hiding the complete extent of his ideological obsession, he said: ‘No, that's a fine public policy mix. There is no drama attached to that. That is not unusual. There are over 30 telcos in OECD countries that have a mix of private and public ownership. Telstra is not unique in that respect.' But suddenly these days, of course, this becomes the reason why. The Prime Minister says there is a yoke on Telstra, that the great burden on Telstra is the two-thirds, one-third mix of public and private ownership. If that is the case-which I do not agree with and which I reject-it is a yoke or a burden the Prime Minister has put on the company himself. When we look at the history of the government's privatisation efforts with the T1 privatisation and the subsequent T2 privatisation-when the parliament, courtesy of Senator Harradine, authorised a further sale from 33  SHU FHQW WR  SHU FHQW-on both those occasions we have seen the government's economic management credentials being very seriously challenged and questioned. On the first occasion, T1, the analysis of the Auditor-General after the event was that the government had put those shares out to market at a substantially lower price, at cost to the taxpayer. With T2, the nearly two million-the 1.6 to 1.7 million-small shareholders know to their cost the incompetent economic management by the government. We will all recall-I certainly recall-the Prime Minister, when asked about what investors should do in respect of T2, saying in the context of that further privatisation that was a great deal. The question was put to him: ‘What should worried investors think about Telstra?' He said, ‘It's a great deal.' The then Minister for Finance, one of the formal shareholders of the Commonwealth, Mr Fahey, said on the floor of this chamber that it was a worthwhile investment and people should contemplate in the context of that investment the fact that the Commonwealth continued to have substantial assets and holdings in Telstra. So we had the Prime Minister saying in 1996 that one-third, two-thirds, a mix of public and private, is an ownership mix which does not cause any public policy difficulties. We had the then Minister for Finance saying in the context of T2, and following on from the Prime Minister saying that it was a great deal, that one of the reasons it was a great deal was that the Commonwealth government had a shareholding, an ownership arrangement. Those small investor shareholders out there who purchased their T2 shares at $7.80 are perfectly entitled, as letters to editors and radio talkback feedback indicates, to feel that they have been ripped off by the government in respect of their shareholding arrangements. I return to that solemn pledge that the Liberal and National parties made, not just in the 2004 election but in 2001 and in 1998, that they would not further or fully privatise Telstra unless services to rural and regional Australia were up to scratch. Let us look at the objective record: I can recall month after month the reports of the old Australian Communications Authority detailing service deficiencies in outer metropolitan Australia and in rural and regional Australia and the government, in pursuit of its ideological obsession, trying to establish inquiry after inquiry to try to get any inquiry to say that services were up to scratch. Their first inquiry was chaired by Mr it Besley. Even before Mr Besley took any evidence, he was on the public record quite happily saying that he was a supporter of the full privatisation of Telstra, that he was privatiser. Yet not even Mr Besley could be brought to the barrier; not even Mr Besley could recommend in a report that services in rural and regional Australia were up to scratch. Having failed with Mr Besley, in a subsequent parliament the government moved on to Mr Estens. They got a bit closer with Mr Estens. Mr Estens said that if you adopt these 39 recommendations and implement them then there is some chance that services in rural and regional Australia might be adequate. The problem for the government is, firstly, that not all those recommendations have been implemented and, secondly, that the National Farmers Federation, both its national body and its constituent state branches, is out there saying that, despite a partial implementation of the Estens inquiry recommendations, services to regional and rural Australia are not up to scratch. As if you needed any further advice-the government could not get the Besley inquiry up to the mark and it could not get the Estens inquiry up to the mark. If we fast forward to the current context, we now know-out of the horse's mouth on 11 August this year-that Telstra itself was providing the government with detailed advice that shows conclusively a failure to invest in Telstra over recent years in the order of $3 billion to $4 billion, which included paying dividends out of reserves, and Telstra is incapable of providing adequate service to rural and regional Australia or to outer metropolitan Australia. We find in Telstra's once secret advice on 11 Augustwhich the government was happy to try and keep secret, but we know how the cat got out of the bag on that one-that Telstra has received 14 million phone fault reports and that over 14 per cent of Telstra's lines are faulty. On Telstra's own admission, how could you in any sensible or plausible way expect that that would lead to adequacy of a full services in rural and regional Australia? In that context we find earlier today the amendment coming back from the Senatethe drop in the ocean, last-minute, ‘Backdown Barnaby', National Party inducement. Where has the National Party-that once great National Party-been on this issue? Black Jack MCEwen would be rolling in his grave at the way in which the current National Party has tugged its forelock to the Liberal Party lawyers from Melbourne and Sydney-a once great National Party, who once saw it as its role in life to stand up for the interests of rural and regional Australia. Where are they now? They are tugging their forelocks to the Liberal Party lawyers from Melbourne and Sydney. What would those once great National and Country Party ministers, Anthony-Anthony senior, of course-Nixon, Hunt and Sinclair, be thinking as they look in now? What would those once great National Party ministers be thinking looking in and seeing the decline of a once great National Party now led by Mr Vaile, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, supported by his own deputy, Mr Truss, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and the last cab off the ministerial rank for the National Party, Mr MCGauran, who has the responsibility for the passage of these bills through this parliament? What would those ministers be thinking looking in at the decline of a once great political party led now by Mr Vaile, previously led by Mr Anderson, the former Deputy Prime Minister? It is a regrettable fact on an analysis of Australian politics that the current leader and former leader make Charles Blunt look like an effective leader of the National Party. At least you could say of Charles Blunt that he put his stamp on the National Party. The only stamp that is being put on the National Party these days is the stamp of the Liberal Party from Melbourne and Sydney, driven by an ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra. As a consequence of that ideological position there is no concern about the interests of the Commonwealth taxpayer, as reflected by the T1 privatisation, no concern about the interests of small investor shareholders, as shown by the aftermath of T2, and no concern for the national interest, as shown by their ideological obsession. They are refusing to baulk in any way at the secret advice received from Telstra on 11 August and refusing to baulk in any way at the suggestions that Telstra themselves remain very concerned about their capacity to meet their obligations to rural and regional Australia. Part of that ideological obsession has seen a serious neglect so far as the government is concerned of some major regulatory and competitive issues. We find the culmination of those regulatory and competitive issues now contained in the additional legislation: the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. It is quite clear that the model that the government has adopted in that bill is fundamentally flawed. The problem for government is that it has adopted a model of operational separation that is fundamentally flawed. The operational separation regime outlined in the bill is considered by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill as containing very little detail as to how that final operational separation model will operate. The bill merely provides a very broad framework for that operational separation model and then allows Telstra three months to prepare a draft operational separation plan for approval by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In other words, the government is effectively saying that it wants to set up a regulatory regime for Telstra, but it is happy to let Telstra write that regulatory regime, with the minister giving it the tick behind closed doors. The legislation also provides that the pricing principles which will govern the provision of Telstra's wholesale services will be determined at a future date by committee consisting of Telstra, the minister and the ACCC. I suspect from the ACCC's view that that is a two to one majority against it. Here is a situation in which the government is openly saying that they want to enshrine in legislation that a minister goes and sits in on commercial and regulatory negotiations between the regulator-the ACCC-and a company, Telstra. It is of course the case that these commercial negotiations materially affect any communications competitors that Telstra has. The simple, fundamental question that needs to be asked here is: why should the minister be involved in determining prices in the marketplace directly with Telstra, by far the major telco in the marketplace? Why should the minister be sitting on a committee determining prices? Where is there any transparency or independence here? These negotiations between Telstra and the regulator about the competitive regime and the regulatory regime should be free from interference from the minister and should take place directly between the ACCC and Telstra. The practical effect of this is likely to be that companies that rely on ministerial decisions in many other areas will be afraid to speak out about their view of what is going on. Telecommunications companies will be afraid to criticise the legislation, because their future commercial operations rely on the goodwill of the person who is determining the prices they will be charged and will be able to pass on-namely, the minister. It is wrong in principle to put Telstra, its competitors, the ACCC and the ministers in that position. We have no objection to the notion of operational separation, but the way in which the government is implementing it is fundamentally flawed. Indeed, the Chairman of the ACCC, Mr Samuel, noted during his evidence to the Senate inquiry that a number of issues required further consideration, including the precise details of the operational separation plan and Telstra's obligations in relation to that plan, the scope of the services that will be subject to the operational separation plan, the enforcement regime associated with compliance and non-compliance with the operational separation plan, the powers to investigate whether or not compliance has occurred, and the development by the proposed working party-namely, the working party between Telstra, the ACCC and the department-of the internal wholesale pricing and the pricing equivalence regime. So there are some fundamental flaws in those regulatory and competitive arrangements. If you speak to Telstra's competitors over the years, you will find that their essential complaint has been that very serious competitive and regulatory issues have been ignored and neglected by the government. There is a very simple explanation for that. The government has always been very slow out of the blocks, not wanting to move on competitive and regulatory issues which might have an adverse impact so far as Telstra is concerned in the marketplace but a beneficial impact so far as competition is concerned, because it wanted to ensure that the Telstra share price would be as high as possible, to enable the government to have an argument to slide through the further or full privatisation. The problem for the government is that that game has now been comprehensively sprung by Mr Trujillo and the other Telstra executives who gave that formal and frank advice to the government on 11 August. What did the government do? The government tried to do everything it possibly could to make sure that that did not become public or that the community was not aware of that before it slid through the legislation to fully privatise Telstra. All these issues will come home to roost. In the 2007 election, which you can currently expect to be in the last quarter of 2007, the Australian community will again have a stark contrast between the Liberal-National parties and the Labor Party. The Liberal and National parties, in breach of a faithful election promise, will have passed legislation to fully privatise Telstra, ignoring the needs of rural and regional Australia, ignoring the national interest and pursuing a Liberal Party ideological political interest. In stark contrast to that will be a Labor Party with a firm and proud record of wanting to say: ‘We need to ensure that our international competitiveness in communications is right at the top of the list, not at the bottom of the list, and the absolute, essential condition is to ensure parity and adequacy of services in telecommunications to regional, rural and outer metropolitan Australia.' That stark contrast will be there for all to see, and it will be there at great cost to the Liberal Party and the National Party.",46
40,Dr WASHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005 form part of a package of telecommunications legislation which enables the government to proceed with its long standing policy to fully privatise Telstra. The key features of this legislation include the removal of the current requirement in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 that requires the Commonwealth to maintain a minimum of 50.1 per cent of shares in Telstra. Incidentally, we currently own 51.8 per cent. They include flexibility for the government to determine the structure of any further sale of Telstra, including the ability offer hybrid securities or to transfer shares into the Future Fund or the Communications Fund; and confirmation that shares transferred to the Future Fund or the Communications Fund are not to be considered shares owned by the Commonwealth. They include the removal of a number of ministerial direction powers and reporting obligations related to the government's majority shareholding when the Commonwealth shareholding falls below 15 per cent. This does not, however, affect ministerial direction powers relating to specific telecommunications regulation or Telstra licence conditions such as operational separation. A further key feature is the affirmation, by specific inclusion in the act, of the government's commitment to the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee as basic telecommunications consumer safeguards. The core component of this legislation is the removal of the requirement that the Commonwealth maintains a minimum of 50.1 per cent of the shares of Telstra. Why is this important? The government is currently responsible for the regulation of the telecommunications industry, whilst having a direct financial interest in the operation of the main telecommunications carrier in the industry. Divestment of its remaining shareholding in Telstra will allow the government to concentrate solely on the regulation of Telstra for the benefit of consumers and industry. At the same time, it will allow Telstra to focus on the business of providing telecommunications services without the distraction of the government as a shareholder. The divestment by the government of its remaining shareholding should also dispel any thoughts amongst competitors that Telstra is gaining special benefit by virtue of government ownership. The current requirement to maintain a 50.1 per cent shareholding in Telstra by the to government has a negative effect on the business operations of Telstra. As long as the government is required to maintain a 50.1 per cent shareholding, Telstra cannot raise new equity capital or introduce a dividend investment plan, because that would reduce the Commonwealth's ownership below this level. This inability to access markets and the consequent need to rely on debt markets adds to the cost of capital and limits the amount of funds that can be returned to shareholders. It is estimated that the ALP's opposition to the full sale of Telstra has not only cost the taxpayer some $30 billion but reduced the value of the shares and dividend returns of the several million Australians who own shares in Telstra. In a free market, Telstra-no longer owned by a regulator with a vested interest in its profitability-would be just one among a number of private companies required to compete for customers and meet certain standards. As long as Telstra remains a state owned enterprise, there will always be the temptation for future governments to shift the regulatory balance away from protecting consumers and towards maximising revenue streams from this huge asset. This was covered by the previous speaker. The OECD communications outlook 2005 stated that countries such as Australia and France that have laws requiring the state to maintain majority ownership of the incumbent operator have now rescinded these laws and have made it clear that they are willing to reduce state ownership to below 50 per cent. (Quorum formed) Australia and France are willing to reduce state ownership below 50 per cent and in certain cases have made commitments to privatise completely. This process needs to be encouraged, to avoid situations which have occurred in previous years, where government ownership of incumbents conflicts at times with best practice regulation and policy making. In only two OECD countries, Luxembourg and Turkey, is the incumbent telecommunications operator still wholly owned by the state. In other countries where there is state ownership of the incumbent, some progress has been made in reducing the government's share in operations. Government ownership is expected to decline over 2005-06 throughout all OECD nations. The sale of the remaining shareholdings will enable a number of initiatives that were announced in the Connect Australia package, which was presented in August this year. The Connect Australia package involves an investment of $1.1 billion in services; a perpetual $2 billion Communications Fund from the proceeds of the Telstra sale to generate revenue for rural telecommunications services into the future; improved competition regulation, including a requirement for the operational separation of Telstra to deal with ongoing concerns about Telstra's high degree of integration; and enhanced consumer safeguards which build on the existing universal service obligation and the digital data service obligation. Service levels are not linked to government ownership of Telstra. The less the government has owned of Telstra the more services have improved. Ten years ago the government owned all of Telstra, and prices were higher, services were slower and the range of products was much smaller. With consumer safeguards in place there is no longer any practicable public interest role continued government ownership of Telstra. The telecommunications regulatory structure provides wide powers sufficient to allow the government to regulate Telstra without relying on or needing to own Telstra. This bill affirms these consumer safeguards, namely the universal service obligation and customer service guarantee. The universal service obligation entitles all Australians to access to a standard phone service and payphone regardless of where they live or carry out their business. In general terms a standard phone service means a basic fixed phone line with access to local, national and international calls; 24-hour access to the emergency call service number; operator assisted services; and itemised billing, including itemised local calls on request. If the universal service obligation provider cannot connect or repair a line in the specified time frame, it must offer an interim service such as a mobile or satellite phone until the permanent service is provided or restored. The customer service guarantee entitles all Australians to timely service for connection and repairs to their standard phone. Currently Telstra is the only universal service obligation provider in Australia. The customer service guarantee applies to Telstra and to all other telecommunications companies. The sale of the remaining shareholdings in Telstra will be in line with other reforms that have been introduced over the years that have been focused on giving all Australians equitable access to telecommunications services and ensuring that Australia as a nation takes full advantage of the benefits that new technology can bring in increased productivity and better delivery of services. Australia's telecommunications sector has developed progressively from a largely centralised, publicly controlled monopoly structure, through a managed competitive model, into an open and competitive market regime with an emphasis on industry self-regulation. From 1901 to 1975, telecommunications was widely regarded as a government service. The Postmaster General's Department was a department with its own minister and directly provided telecommunications and postal services to the public. In 1946, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission was established to provide international telecommunications services, again as a government service. From 1975 to 1988, the Postmaster General's telecommunications functions were moved to the newly corporatised Telecom Australia. Telecom was established as a statutory authority operating with greater independence from the minister for communications, providing domestic telecommunications services on a monopoly basis. Nevertheless, Telecom retained some governmental functions, notably a large range of explicit regulatory powers regarding technical matters such as technical standards for equipment connected to the network. In 1981, an additional publicly owned carrier, AUSSAT, was established to operate a domestic satellite system. AUSSAT started commercial operations in 1985. From 1988 to 1991, liberalisation of the sector progressed. As part of the reforms implemented under the Telecommunications Act 1989, value-added services, customer cabling and customer equipment markets were opened to competition, and Telecom's regulatory powers were vested in a new, independent regulator, AUSTEL. AUSTEL was given the role of facilitating competition in these markets and given several consumer protection roles. Explicit price controls were imposed on Telecom for the first time. The 1989 changes also subjected Telecom to a range of accountability and management reforms designed to provide it with a more commercial focus, no special benefits accruing from government ownership, greater operational freedom, management independence and accountability. From 1991 to 1997, the market was opened to duopoly competition at the network level, and the services market opened up with the removal of prohibitions on the resale of basic services. A second full service competitor, Optus, and a third mobile network operator, Vodaphone, were licensed. The Telecommunications Act 1991 introduced a carrier-neutral approach towards the communications market. It gave the minister for communications wide-ranging powers to impose obligations on carriers, including a flexible and powerful licensing regime. AUSTEL's role was considerably widened to deal with resourcing issues such as numbering, intercarrier disputes, anticompetitive behaviour, tariff and pricing issues, law enforcement and a wide range of other matters. The Telstra Corporations Act 1991 merged Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission into what has become known as Telstra. Telstra became a public company registered under the Corporations Law. Being an independent corporation, Telstra's board and management were responsible for the day-today running of the company. This included Telstra's strategic direction and decisions of an operational nature, such as employment and investment issues and how the organisation carried on its business. 1997 saw the introduction of reforms which further liberalised telecommunications services, with the opening up of the market for infrastructure as well as services. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Act resulted in one-third of Telstra being divested, with the first shares being traded on 17 November 1997. The bulk of the sale proceeds from the partial privatisation were used to retire government debt. Around $1.49 billion was used to fund the Natural Heritage Trust. Around $250 million was applied to the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. The gross proceeds from the sale were $14.24 billion and direct costs of the sale were $260.61 million. During this time, a comprehensive competition framework was put into place tate efficient market entry, and a wide range of consumer and other protections were established. The Australian Communications Authority replaced AUSTEL as the industry regulator, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission regulating the new telecommunications specific provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Before the divestment of 1997, Telstra aimed to connect new phone services in remote Australia within 810 days-almost in the same league as countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, which had waiting times for a new line of roughly 1,058 days and 2,170 days respectively. Today, however, Australians can get a new phone service within 20 days, wherever they live. Since these reforms of 1997, the average price of telecommunications services, including both call prices and line rentals, has fallen by some 20 per cent. The reforms were also a huge boost to the economy. It is estimated that the economy is $10 billion larger than it would have been without the reforms. Small business is estimated to have benefited by $2.16 billion, and households by around $924 each. Since 1997, the regulatory regime has been progressively refined in relation to consumer safeguards, to the point where Australia arguably has the most comprehensive telecommunications consumer protection regime in the world. The government's policy since 1998 has been the full privatisation of Telstra. 1999 saw legislation passed authorising the sale of a further 16.6 per of Telstra. The majority of the revenues of this sale were allocated to further debt reduction. Funds were also made available to upgrade services in rural and regional Australia under the social bonus. Gross proceeds of the sale were $16.04 billion, with direct sales to facili- costs of $169.23 million. Today, access to high-quality, affordable telecommunications services is more important than ever if Australia is to keep pace with other industrialised countries. The government's primary role is to establish the Australian telecommunications policy framework, which is primarily directed at maximising the long-term interests of the end users of telecommunications services in Australia. The government will facilitate the development of an efficient and competitive market; underpin this market based strategy with a regulatory safety net which is amongst the tightest in the world; address particular areas of need through targeted funding; and provide leadership to the sector and to governments at the state and local levels. None of these strategies for improving communications services rely on the ownership of Telstra. The coalition government are committed to enabling Australians access to affordable, reliable communications services. The final sale of government shareholding in Telstra will enable us to get on with the job of doing this.",50
41,Mr TANNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (11.44 am)Once again we are here debating the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and related bill, and the government is crowing that it has managed to persuade ‘Backdown Barnaby' to support its Telstra sale legislation in the Senate. No doubt he will have to live with the",54
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Mr Quick)I remind the honourable member for Melcent bourne that if we are going to name people they should be given their appropriate title.,54
43,Mr TANNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my understanding is that that applies to members of the House of Representatives. But, in accordance with your wishes, I will refer to Senator Joyce as Senator Joyce. Anybody who is listening can form their own judgment about whether the epithet I have applied to him is appropriate. Today I want to deal with a number of the underlying issues that are relevant to the question of whether or not Telstra should remain in public ownership and relevant to the future of telecommunications in Australia-where it is likely to head under the Howard government and how it is likely to fare following the privatisation of Telstra in the wake of the government's extreme obsession with privatisation, which has prevailed over all other issues in telecommunications in Australia. The first issue I would like to consider is competition, which in my view is at the core of telecommunications issues in Australia and has been sadly neglected by the Howard government. The Keating government introduced competition in telecommunications in 1992, which began with a duopoly with Optus, and the preparations were in place for open competition to be introduced. That was subsequently put in place by the Howard government in 1997 in accordance with the timetable originally specified by the Keating government and in accordance with policies originally adopted by the Hawke government. Since then, we have seen a sequence of regulatory failures under the Howard government and an inability to come to terms with the fact that Telstra remains overwhelmingly dominant in telecommunications in Australia and that competition has failed to take root in a way that we would have liked. The end results of this have been a grossly inadequate rollout of new technologies like broadband; Telstra making an EBITDA, as the terminology has it-that is, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation-that has, at times, been over 50 per cent; and Telstra achieving a rate of earnings, a rate of return on its investments, that most Australian companies would kill for. We have seen a squeeze on ordinary consumers, with massive increases in line rentals for the privilege of having a phone line into their home. In many cases, it has applied to phone lines which have been in place for decades and which cost very little to maintain and keep in place, yet line rental fees have gone up to $30 a month. That is not only a very big imposition on the ordinary consumer; it also squeezes competition. Because the line rental is effectively a uniform part of the total package that a provider supplies to a consumer, it narrows down the scope for differentiation of product and price that is available to would be competitors of Telstra. If we want to see how Telstra's dominance and the inadequate regulatory structure with respect to competition in telecommunications diminish outcomes and results for consumers in Australia, all we need to do is to compare broadband with 3G telephony, or third-generation mobile phone telephonyvideo and photography over mobile phones. Because there is no immediate and direct significance to the Telstra fixed-line network on the 3G side of the spectrum, Australia has been very much leading the world in 3G. We were one of the early adopters and are one of the countries that have made very major progress with that technology. This is in contrast to broadband, where Telstra is ubiquitous, where what it does with its network is fundamental to the rate of progress with broadband and where we have the unhappy situation of Australia now being 21st on the OECD list of developed countries in terms of broadband access. We have been falling steadily over the past few years, because a few years ago we were 13th on the list. The government's approach to regulating competition has been spectacularly unsuccessful. We have seen occasional attempts over the past few years to strengthen the competition regime. For example, under former Minister Senator Alston, we saw the introduction of accounting separation at the end of 2002, which was designed to increase the rigour with which the regulatory arrangements ensure that access to Telstra's network by competitors occurs on a genuine level playing field basis, with proper pricing that reflects the true cost of that access. That accounting separation regime has been a manifest failure, and the government has implicitly acknowledged that by putting forward yet another regulatory system. The reason it has been a failure is that Telstra is still able to game the system; it is still able to use the regulatory regime as a means of exhausting its opponents with very lengthy and difficult disputes that inevitably involve large expenditures of money on lawyers. At the last election, with me as the shadow communications minister, Labor advanced as its key regulatory reform a policy of the virtual separation of Telstra. The idea behind this is that Telstra should be effectively split internally between its wholesale or network activities and its retail activities in order to ensure that the regulator can, at a glance, see whether Telstra is giving itself the same terms, conditions and prices for use of its network to deliver telephony and other telecommunications services that it is providing to its competitors. This kind of approach has been in place for a number of years in the United Kingdom, and it has been in place for a number of years in Sweden. Although there are obviously differences of detail and there are further reforms in the pipeline in Britain, it clearly is a much more effective way of ensuring that the publicly owned network and publicly created network can be used on a level playing field basison an even, open basis-by competitors. There are some commentators who suggest that Telstra is already being forced to provide to its competitors access to its network at below cost-at below the true price and at below the true price it offers itself. There is no evidence of this. In fact, the simple question that should be asked of these commentators is: if that were the case, why haven't Optus, Primus, AAPT and all the other competitors effectively taken over dominance of telephone services in Australia? If Telstra were effectively being forced to provide them with access to its network at prices below the price it would effectively have to pay itself, one would assume that over time that would mean that those competitors would effectively put Telstra out of business or, at the very least, make massive inroads into its market share, which has not occurred. Although the government has adopted Labor's policy from the last election with respect to the operational separation of Telstra, it has failed to follow through. That is hardly a surprise, because it reflects precisely what has occurred previously. It has sidelined the ACCC. It has asked Telstra to write the rules. It has decided to split Telstra into three sections, not two, and effectively created a differential arrangement between how Telstra deals with itself on the one hand and how it deals with competitors on the other. Rather than having a network division and a wholesale division as a single entity, it has decided to separate them, so there will be a different process and a different pattern of dealing for competitors. Most significantly of all, the government has decided to have the minister of the day, the minister for communications, directly involved in regulatory decision making, in particular with the requirement for the minister to issue a rectification notice where Telstra is in breach of its obligations under operational separation. This is an extraordinary development because the government has, over time, gradually pushed one claim to the fore in its arguments for privatising Telstra, and that is the alleged conflict of interest involved in the government being both an owner and a regulator of Telstra. I will get to that issue in some detail in a few minutes. The government says that it is a terrible to be both the owner of this entity and its broader regulator. On the government's own admission, Telstra could remain in public ownership for at least another year or two or possibly longer, and there could be a substantial minority public shareholding in it for an even lengthier period. In those circumstances I find it extraordinary that the government is adopting a model that involves a direct role for the minister in regulating Telstra. Up till now that role has essentially been performed by the ACCC, so there has been an arm's length regulatory arrangement. So, in spite of all of the government's rhetoric about there being a conflict of interest, is putting the minister directly into the regulatory loop. I turn now to the state of Telstra's network, one of the key issues in this debate. It is revealed in the infamous Telstra document of 11 August that 14 per cent of Telstra's lines around Australia are faulty. The government has responded by saying, ‘Aha. But the Australian Communications and Media Authority data on the number of faults reported for the month of July was that only one per cent were faulty-99 per cent of lines were reported to be fault free.' We have seen this trick before. When I was shadow minister I exposed the fact that the ACA, as it then was, was effectively aggregating the monthly statistics and averaging them. It was saying that on an annual basis the lines were 98 or 99 per cent fault free, because the average in a given month for the totality of telephone lines in Australia was that 99 or 98 per cent were fault free. But that is a totally misleading statistic when you average it out, because it is not the same phone line that is incurring a fault every month; it is different phone lines. So the 14 per cent is a much more realistic figure, one that gives you a true picture and demonstrates that a very substantial proportion of phone lines in Aussituation for it tralia have faults. Having been all around Australia, having talked to people who work in Telstra and to the many people who use telecommunications and having seen with my own eyes the dilapidated and deteriorating state of Telstra's network, I know that it makes sense that there is a very high level of faults, because Telstra has been substantially diminishing its investment in its network. In the late 1990s its total capital expenditure was about $4.5 billion. In the last couple of years, that has dropped below $3 billion. And guess where that is coming from? It is coming from investment in the network. So it is no it surprise that Telstra reported to the government that there was a $3 billion gap in terms of routine mainstream investment in its network as a result of those decisions-all of them coming from the government's obsession with privatising Telstra. The thing that is different about the three amigos and Mr Trujillo is that they are looking beyond privatisation; they are looking at how they are going to run the company and make a decent return. The previous management, understandably, shared the government's obsession with privatisation and subordinated everything they did to the privatisation goal, which meant underinvesting in the network, pumping up the dividend stream unsustainably in order to pump up the share price, and a variety of other things. It is clear that telecommunications services around Australia are not up to scratch, particularly in regional Australia but also in many parts of metropolitan Australia. It is abundantly clear that the government misled the Australian people in the last election campaign by claiming that telecommunications services were up to scratch. It is equally clear that very little is going to be done to the problem. The government have relied over the years on a range of smoke-and-mirrors initiatives, window-dressing initiatives that are designed to make it look like the government are doing something. But those initiatives have not achieved very much. The government have primarily focused on pork-barrelling in appropriate marginal coalition seats in regional Australia. The Networking the Nation fund saw about half a billion dollars-a very substantial amount of money-dribbled out around the country. The Auditor-General, when he examined the fund, reached the conclusion that it was impossible to determine whether the fund had benefited the nation, because there were no benchmarks, no targets, no performance standards. There was no way of telling whether the fund had produced any serious benefit for Australia. We have more recently seen the HiBIS scheme, the broadband subsidy scheme, which has been dribbled out in the same way. During the election campaign, the government announced specific broadband microinitiatives for particular small towns that just happen to be at the heart of vulnerable marginal electorates. So rather than building Australia's telecommunications infrastructure for the 21st century, rather than ensuring that we have an up-to-date network with decent speeds, accessible to all Australians, the government has been using large sums of taxpayers' money to window-dress, to create an impression of things happening at the same time as it is pursuing its obsession with privatising Telstra, to the great disadvantage of Australian telecommunications consumers. On the broadband front, as I said, we are now 21st in the world and slipping, and Australian speeds are very ordinary compared with those of many of our competitors and fix other nations. We are flattered, if anything, by the OECD statistics because their indicator level is 256 kilobits per second, which is a pretty ordinary broadband speed. Many people would argue that it does not even constitute true broadband. Our take-up rate is only a half to a third of the take-up rate of equivalent nations like the United States and Canada. Broadband is fundamental to the future of this country. Getting access to decent broadband in the future is going to be as important as getting access to electricity was during the 20th century. It is going to be essential to virtually all kinds of economic activities. A couple of years ago I visited an industrial estate in the electorate of Cowan and discovered that there was a sausage factory there, of all things, that was having a significant problem because it could not get access to broadband. That was having a major impact on its competitive position, because it had to deal with suppliers and customers by fax rather than over the internet. Even for something as apparently mundane and old economy as making sausages, the question of availability of broadband was fundamentally important. The issue that our nation should be dealing with-the question that we should be addressing-is not who owns Telstra; it is what Telstra is going to do and what our nation is going to do to ensure that we are at the forefront of the developed world in rolling out high-speed, high-quality telecommunications infrastructure and services that will be the backbone of our economic future. That is the issue that the government has totally neglected. That is the issue that has been the basis for the government's window dressing, its pretending to do something, its trying to look like it is doing something, and its pouring dribs and drabs of money all around the country in various marginal seats for its own political benefits without achieving anything substantial for the nation. I want to touch briefly on the future of Telstra as a private company. It has been run de facto as a private company for many years, because the government has chosen not to make use of its ownership for broader community purposes, generally speaking. As a result, the government was quite happy for Telstra to seek to launch a takeover bid for the Channel 9 network. Similarly, the government ticked off on Telstra's attempt to take over the Fairfax newspaper group. It is pretty clear that once Telstra is privaernment tised, particularly if the government is successful in getting the abolition of crossmedia ownership rules through the parliament, it is so big, so profitable, and has such an enormous cash flow that its ability to gobble up half or more of the existing Australian media will create a situation where we could have a massive concentration-a narrowing down-of power and control in our media. It is eminently possible that a privately owned Telstra will, in rapid order, acquire one of the free-to-air TV networks and possibly the Fairfax newspaper group or parts of it. At the same time it will be establishing internet TV networks. It is already well and truly running down that path; it is 50 per cent owner of the monopoly pay-TV network Foxtel. The implications of this for Australia, for democratic debate and for diversity of public opinion are enormous. That is one of the key reasons why I think Telstra should remain in public ownership. It should be forced to focus on its primary responsibilities and activities-telecommunications - not media. I want to make an observation on the matter of conflict of interest that the government places so much emphasis on. The claim is that the government cannot own Telstra because it also regulates telecommunications. Other than the peculiarities of the regulatory regime that has been introduced as part of this set of legislation, which I referred to previously, it is worth pointing out that that regulatory arrangement does occur at arm's length through the ACCC, as it should. It is also worth pointing out that there are other organisations that the government owns and regulates, which it regulates in a sector where there is competition. The most obvious example, which I completely clean bowled the Prime Minister with in question time last week, is Australia Post. The govis adamant that it has no intention of privatising Australia Post. Eighty-five per cent of Australia Post revenue comes from fully contestable and competitive activities, yet it is owned and regulated by the government, which regulates postal services generally. The situation is precisely the same as that of Telstra. The government both owns the institution-in this case it has 100 per cent ownership-and regulates the market. Australia Post competes on a whole host of activities with a lot of private companies. The government does not appear to think that that is a problem, but it is the key reason why Telstra needs to be privatised. You can make the same observation with broadcasting. The ABC and the SBS compete, in effect, with commercial broadcasters, particularly the SBS, which is competing with commercial broadcasters for advertising revenue. But they are both competing with commercial broadcasters for eyeballs, and the government regulates broadcasting. (Time expired)",54
44,Mr BALDWIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. Passing the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 will allow our government to sell down its shareholding below 51 per cent, but it will also maintain the flexibility to put Telstra to the market in the best position for the people of Australia. This is not a rushed sell down; this is about the government divesting itself of a corporation that governments should not be in the business of running. As the member for Melbourne quite rightly said, the issue is of who owns Telstra; the issue is where we go from here and what will be done with Telstra and communications. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005 will legislate to impose on Telstra, through its licence conditions, a requirement for operational separation. It will give the minister the power to determine matters covered by the operational separation plan and the services it covers, require the ACCC to take account of the costs and risks of new network investment when making a decision under the telecommunications access regime, amend the Trade Practices Act to speed up and streamline ACCC decision making processes and allow the powers of ACMA to be enhanced to accept court enforceable undertakings to ensure compliance by industry participants and to enforce compliance with industry codes. And there will be other changes that will be driven by the minister. There are also non-legislative parts of this communications package. They include price control determinations. The government has announced that from 1 January 2006 new price control arrangements will come into effect. These arrangements will be implemented by way of ministerial determination. The new arrangements will be brought into effect by ministerial determination prior to January 2006. The one that really has an effect on my local area is that the government will introduce a local presence plan. This will be imposed on Telstra through licence conditions that will require Telstra to put in place the local presence plan. Telstra has to conduct public consultation on its proposed plan, and the plan must be provided for ministerial approval in December 2005. Once the plans are approved, they must be continually updated not that and approved every three years. In this House, over the nine-odd years that we have been in government, there has been a lot of debate. It was this government that introduced the customer service guarantee. There have been many aspects of this, ensuring that we maintain certain levels of communications service and affordability in the area of telecommunications. Backing that up is the universal service guarantee. I have spoken many times on that and I do not wish to go back to it at this point in time. Earlier this week in the House, we debated three bills that were largely appropriation bills. (Quorum formed) The young boys and girls from school who are up there in the gallery are probably wondering what has happened. I need them to know that the Labor Party tend to shut people down when they are making constructive points on bills under debate. It is their way of denying freedom of speech. Mr Gavan O'Connor-You hypocrite. Why don't you let the debate proceed? Have a look at the list. Let the kids see the list and hear the debate.",59

48,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! I remind honourable members to either resume their seats or leave the chamber.,61
49,Mr BALDWIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Today we are discussing and debating the privatisation of Telstra. But earlier this week there were three bills which I would like to reflect on. Those bills in particular provided for $3 billion, just about 10 per cent of the residual value of Telstra shareholdings by the Australian government, to be invested in future proofing our communications. There was $2 billion for the Communications Fund, which will be administered by an independent board with representatives from rural and regional areas such as mine-$2 billion that will be invested into the communications network. And, importantly, there is $1.1 billion, of which $878 million will be invested in Broadband Connect, providing all Australians with affordable broadband network services. There will be $113 million for Clever Networks, to improve the delivery of health, education and other essential services over the broadband networks. I have a large electorate of nearly 10,000 square kilometres, and I have a lot of satellite hospitals through Hunter New England Health. They will benefit by being able to go online to access health information. I am also impressed by the $30 million for Mobile Connect, to extend terrestrial mobile coverage where it can be commercially maintained and to provide continued handset subsidies for satellite communication. Quite often we hear members of the opposition talk about there being no mobile communications in some areas. There is, and has been for quite some considerable time now, the ability to have satellite mobile phone technology. A lot of my constituents are in remote and distant areas where topography prohibits the use of handheld CDMA or digital phones because of the valleys and mountains in the region. I would like to reflect on the services prior to this government coming into power. The Labor Party did a deal to increase competition. I welcome that. However, as part of that deal, it agreed to shut down the analog phone network. It shows how city-centric the Labor Party was with its plans when it intended to shut down the analog mobile phone network: the digital or GSM phone network operates predominantly in city areas. Rural and regional areas, like my electorate of Paterson, relied on the analog phone system. There were only a few areas where it worked because the Labor Party had refused to instruct Telstra to install analog transmitters throughout the country in rural and regional areas. We were left with a situation where the Labor Party had introduced a time line for the shutdown of the analog phone system but without a plan. They had no plan to have telephone services in regional and rural Australia, yet they complain. It was interesting to note earlier in this week in the debate on the three bills that provide $3.1 billion for investing into our telephone networks that all of the members of the Labor Party, all the Labor members in the Hunter region, voted against $3.1 billion worth of investment. I thought they would be smart politicians. I thought they would vote for the $3.1 billion to be invested, particularly in regional and rural areas where they come from, but they opposed it. I intend to make sure that the public in our area understand that they opposed those bills and did not want the investment in their area. As we grow and we use technology I am glad to report to this House that, over the last nine years and the sell-off of the first half of Telstra, my communities have benefited. In the number of speeches that I have made in this House I have repeatedly talked about the advancements achieved through the community technology centres and the HiBIS system, the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, and of the money that has been invested to repair TV blackspots so that people in my area can have access to what most people in the city consider to be normalaccess to TV channels like 9, 7, 10, 2 and SBS. That has been a great investment. There is still work to be done. We have introduced demand aggregation brokers that have brought people together to build up the demand so that we can put a case forward for increased broadband supplement. There have been investments in commercial radio blackspots and in the highway mobile phone coverage. I have going through my electorate a part of the New England Highway but I have a large slab of the Pacific Highway and we have improved mobile phone communications on that highway. There has been an extensive roll out in investment in providing mobile telephone communications to towns of under 500 people. In fact, in my electorate now there are over 32 mobile phone transmitters. When I came into office in 1996 there were some five analog transmitters in my electorate. There are now 26 exchanges in my electorate enabled for broadband roll out. I remember that when I came to parliament in 1996 dial-up internet services were not even considered. The internet was a new thing. Now we have moved to broadband-and it will never be enough; already we are seeing new technologies emerge. I am glad that we are putting away $3.1 billion to help invest. But it is also important to note that that $3.1 billion will not just be there for the benefit Telstra; it will be for the benefit of all those other players that have come into the market that do support the increased competition and the privatisation of Telstra because it will give them an opportunity to start competing on an equal footing. The other thing that the Labor Party omits to advise the House is that, since this government came in and implemented universal service guarantees, we now have untimed local calls in large places throughout Australia. In fact, all call costs have been reduced dramatically. The prices of overseas calls, interstate calls and STD calls through increased competition have reduced dramatically. As I said, my colleague but opponent the member for Hunter in this chamber criticised me for not speaking on the legislation on Monday. But I am speaking here today and I am putting forward the views of the people in my electorate of Paterson. They demand services; they do not demand ownership. What we will see is an increased roll out, because it is the local member who pushes and strives for such things in his electorate. The member for Hunter is the Shane Warne of politics. I do not say that because of his ability to put a spin on things. I say that because of the similarities, as we have witnessed in the chamber, with his ability to use the old SMS. I am sure there would be some interesting readings on that and that the similarities between him and Mr Warne would be extraordinary. It is good to see people using technology for their own advantage. I would like to see an increased roll out. I am looking forward to the increased roll out of XDA, the CDMA high-speed mobile phone broadband network. I am looking forward to seeing the black spots being fixed up in my area. But I of know, and my constituents know, that when it comes to mobile telephony there can never be 100 per cent coverage with a CDMA or GSM network. We have a satellite system for those who, through topography or for reasons of distance away from main towns, will not have the ability to use the standard phone systems. It is important and great to see that this government will continue to subsidise call costs and handsets to make them affordable for people. Of course, the more people who take up satellite mobile communications, the cheaper the operation will be because the atomisation of costs will be over a broader area. I wholeheartedly support this legislation. I will be telling my constituents that I support this legislation. I support the three bills that went through earlier this week guaranteeing $3.1 billion. But I will also be supporting and driving my government to make sure that we, either through legislation or providing incentives, continue to get increased competition and development for the provision of telephone services, whether it be mobile, landline or broadband, into areas such as mine. I support this legislation and commend it to the House. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (12.21 pm)-Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. (Quorum formed) At 12.30 pm today, the bells of this House will toll on one of the great Judas acts in Australian politics. Yesterday in the Senate, the Judas Iscariot of Australian politics-Barnaby the betrayer, as he is now known-sealed the fate of Telstra when he picked up the 30 pieces of silver and slunk out into the Canberra night. Mr Baldwin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. A standing order says members will be referred to by their title. I hardly think ‘Barnaby the betrayer' is the title of the senator from Queensland.",61
50,The SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Corio might choose to use the senator's title. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-Thank you, Mr Speaker. With Senator Joyce's reputation went the reputation of his fellow National Party senators, National Party members in this parliament and, indeed, the reputation of the once great National Party. Let me read out to this House the rollcall of the National Party members who have given effect to the sale of Telstra in this place. Hitherto they will be known in rural Australia as the dirty dozen: the member for Gwydir, the member for Page, the member for Parkes, the member for Mallee, the member for Cowper, the member for Riverina, the member for Dawson, the member for Gippsland, the member for Hinkler, the member for Maranoa, the member for Wide Bay and the member for Lyne. These people comprehensively betrayed rural and regional Australia with this decision. Let me remind the National Farmers Federation, which caved into pressure from the government, of the extent of the betrayal that we are witnessing on the floor of this House today. The New South Wales Farmers Federation conducted a survey of farmers in June 2005 and this is what that survey said: 80 per cent of the farmers surveyed opposed the sale. They were asked, ‘Is your landline reliable?' No-29 per cent. ‘Is your mobile phone reliable?' No-63 per cent. ‘Are you satisfied with your internet speed?' No-60 per cent. Here today we have a betrayal of their interests. We know that Senator Joyce in that other place is known now as ‘ Mr 65 per cent', because he said, ‘Well, I'm only 65 per cent happy with the decision.' You cannot be a little bit pregnant in this place. You cannot be 65 per cent sort of happy with it. Let me tell you, Senator Joyce and members of the National Party: you might be 65 per cent happy with the decision that you have made-but, out in rural Australia, farmers are 100 per cent disillusioned and unhappy with the decision that you have made. This is one of the most comprehensive betrayals that we have witnessed on the floor of this parliament. Telstra itself has said in this document that the faults in Telstra are enormous. The services that are being provided to farmers and their families are below par and not up to scratch. What sort of dream time are you living in if you believe that, when this document says you need $5.7 billion to bring Telstra up to scratch and you allocate $3 billion, these problems that have been identified by Telstra management will be overcome? The simple fact of the matter is this: on the sale of Telstra, the spivs, the merchant bankers and the brokers will pick up some $850 million to $1 billion, and the government will invest only $2 billion, with a return each year of $100 million, to address some of the major faults that have been identified by Telstra. Telstra itself has indicated that there has been a massive underinvestment in this telco.",63

NA (MEDICARE SAFETY-NETS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time.",65
53,Mr ANDREN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Two years ago, when debating the government's 2003 budget changes to Medicare and bulkbilling, the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003, I made very clear what I thought about the government's proposal to introduce the then new safety net arrangements. At that time. I asked the Prime Minister in question time if the estimated cost of the new safety net had taken into account the likely fee increases under the new regime, which in turn would mean that the thresholds would be met earlier, with a considerable blow-out of the $67.1 million the government had then designated for the safety net over four years. The Prime Minister answered that he did not believe that these outcomes-the higher fees and consequent higher patient contributions-and therefore a blow-out in the cost of the safety net for the taxpayer would occur. In the ensuing debate I made the observation that this was wishful thinking, saying: As surely as the sun comes up, so too will this copayment be free of its current shackles and head upwardsand so with it, the cost of the Medicare safety net. Here I will pre-empt any suggestion, such as that which the Prime Minister made in answer to my question two years ago, that no copayment exists in the government's Medicare policy by again quoting the 1999 Productivity Commission report on private hospitals, which defined copayment as ‘Portion of the cost of an insured health service met by the user'. Needless to say, I could not support that 2003 bill that was going to expose lowand middle-income families to significantly higher costs for their sic health needs-higher costs that should be borne by a broader, progressive tax system and a hypothecated Medicare levy that delivers universality, particularly to income and lower income earners. Fast forward to September last year, just six months after the lower Medicare safety net had passed the Senate. Surprise, surprise: the anticipated 450,000 people per year accessing the benefits of the safety net had blown out to almost 650,000 people qualifying in the first few months alone. The new blow-out of projected costs was over $1 billion, more than double the original projections. And still the rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the current lower thresholds could be-indeed, would be-maintained was given by the Minister for Health and Ageing during the election campaign in SeptemberOctober, 12 months back. Just over a year after the Prime Minister answered my question by saying that he did not accept that there were going to be the consequences that I dared to suggest in relation to the cost of the safety net scheme, the Prime Minister himself told ABC radio that, if the current threshold levels were maintained, the cost of the safety net would be $1.65 billion over the next four years to 30 June 2009. That is almost four times the original projections. The proposal in the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 to raise the thresholds to the original levels is anticipated to bring that projected cost back down to $1.15 billion, but this is a projected cost for only the next four years, and it is still more than double the cost forecast by the government in March last year, when the safety net was introduced. Yet this still means that one million fewer people will qualify for the safety net. How on earth is the government going to keep trying to restick this Medicare safety net bandaid over the balong term, when the bandaid itself started falling off as soon as it was stuck on? How many more people will fail to qualify for support when they need it, and who will those middle- qualify when they do not? An examination of the electorate-byelectorate figures shows a growing bias to well-off seats anyway. Let us look at some comments made from various sources over the last little while. As the Minister for Health and Ageing said: From 1 January 2006, the extended Medicare safety net thresholds will increase from $306.90 to $500 for concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit part A, and from $716.10 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals. The current thresholds will continue to apply to all families and individuals for the current calendar year. The Bills Digest for this legislation says: ... the reason expenditure on the Safety Net has blown out ... is a result of the Safety Net's ture, whereby Safety Net benefits are not tied to any price signals-that is, they are uncapped and effectively unregulated. As the member for Hotham said in this second reading debate: If Medicare were functioning properly and if it were funded properly, there would not be a need for a safety net. Therein lie the exact reasons why we have this gradually increasing unfairness built into the safety net process. Any benefit the safety net might offer is entirely contingent on the amount charged by the practitioner. It is not tied to any price control whatsoever, unlike the normal Medicare rebate, which is hooked to the Medicare schedule fee. As I have continued to point out for a number of years, consumers-but not the government-can see that medical fees will continue to rise with the unlimited expenditure that comes with the Medicare safety net. Raising the threshold only begs the question about who exactly is going to benefit-the medical practitioners charging way beyond normal prices and their well-heeled patients? Certainly not the sick and poor, who can ill afford to access these specialists in the first place, let alone afford to spend enough on their health care to reach that new threshold. The government has no problem with asking the taxpayer to fork out at least $1.65 billion to support those who have been able to afford to reach the higher threshold, because it is not explicitly obvious to the taxpayer. But, if I dare to suggest that we attend to the core of the problem by properly investing in a universal health system for the long term, both sides of the House bury their collective heads in the sand. I have long argued that both the schedule fee and the Medicare rebate to doctors, and the schedule fee on which the rebate is calculated, should be raised to realistically reflect the cost and worth of medical consultations for GPs in strucparticular. Certainly, in previous years, the AMA and the Productivity Commission have recognised this-and perhaps I would take the Productivity Commission's assessment before the AMA's. They have said a $50 standard consultation fee is far closer to the mark than the current schedule fee, which stands at $30. Most of the electorate know that this is an acceptable thing to do and are prepared to pay for a fairer system, as long as their money, through Medicare and through their taxes, is going into the Medicare bucket. But this bill ensures that Australia's money is instead, by stealth, redirected not into a universal health care system but into the pockets of higher fee charging medical practitioners. Poorer, often more elderly, constituents are left to struggle with not only their illness and disease but the inability to afford the specialist care they badly need. Often they cannot afford even to make the journey to the medical help and support that they so desperately need. This is tackling health care from the wrong end and building inflationary pressure into health care costs, to the disadvantage of the needy. I cannot support this legislation. It will be very interesting to see what Senator Joyce and Senator Fielding, in that other place, think of the ‘family friendly' elements of this piece of legislation. In an overview of the figures that have been put out about the safety net provisions-I do not have them with me-it is interesting to see the electorates that are showing a marked increase in access to this benefit. They are certainly not those rural and regional electorates where the poorer recipients of health care and those who are in desperate need of that support live. On that note, I reiterate that nothing in this suggests to me that there is any plan by this government to properly protect those most vulnerable in our society, who demand and deserve the medical protection that they certainly need. They will be left without it, and this is amounts. skewed entirely in favour of those at the other end of the spectrum who can certainly afford to pay more for their health care.",66
54,Ms HOARE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Who would expect the Howard government to be any different from previous conservative governments? Labor's Whitlam government in the 1970s introduced much needed free hospital treatment and the Medibank rebate system. The Fraser Liberal government took those services away, only for them to be replaced with Medicare by the Hawke Labor government in 1984. Since the 1970s the conservatives have never really been supportive of Australians receiving free medical treatment. This was apparent when the Howard government suggested changes to Medicare to make it look like the American twotiered system and named the package, very inappropriately, A Fairer Medicare. These changes were only prevented because the coalition did not have the numbers in the Senate to pass the legislation. If the proposed A Fairer Medicare legislation had been allowed to pass it would have meant the end of Medicare as we know it. However, with the assistance of Independent senators and a lowering of the initially proposed thresholds of $500 for concession card holders and other low-income earners and $1,000 for all other individuals and families to $300 and $700 retrospectively, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, was able to get support for the MedicarePlus reforms introduced in March 2004. Even prior to these reforms being legislated, there were grave concerns that the cost of the safety net provision would blow out. If only the minister had listened to the health experts. If he had taken the time to listen, he would not now be going back on his election promises. Instead of listening, Minister Abbott gave his now famous ‘rock solid, ironclad' guarantee for safety net threshold Why did the minister and this government fail to listen to advice given by health experts regarding the risks associated with the safety net? It was clear to these health experts that the proposed package contained serious design flaws which would be inflationary and would lead to the blow-out of costs for the safety net component of the package. Only one conclusion can be drawn from the government's inability to listen to the experts: the government has no real commitment to providing a long-term solution to a real issue. The real issue that Australians are constantly being faced with is the escalating outof-pocket expenses associated with seeing a specialist or with the use of diagnostic technology. The Howard government invented the safety net as an advertising stunt to win votes. The coalition government was well aware of the concerns many Australians had with Australia's health system prior to the election. As previously pointed out, coalition governments do not have a good track record in providing Australians with affordable and adequate health services; on the contrary, coalition governments have a proven track record in dismantling and dissolving public health services. While some might say that this is history, the Howard government has done nothing concrete to prove any commitment to providing all Australians with long-term, sustainable and affordable health services. The Medicare safety net provided only a shortterm solution to a long-term problem. This was evident during the election campaign, but Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Howard chose to ignore what they were being told. Even their own Treasury tried to warn the government that the cost of the Medicare safety net would be more than double their original forecasts for the 200405 financial year. This forecast was made in the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook of September 2004 published by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration. So a month before the federal election the government had formally been advised by its Treasury that the total cost of the safety net would blow out greatly. Forecasts were given that the blow-out would be more than double the original projections, but did Minister Abbott listen? Apparently not. This is why Australians are now faced with the real possibility of an increase in the safety net thresholds. It is completely unacceptable. This election promise was instrumental to the coalition parties winning government. Without this policy, which we can now assume was a scam, the Howard government's success may not have been achieved. Why did the minister choose to ignore the Treasury's advice? Was it because if he had changed his proposed policy the attractiveness of it would have been lost? Was it because the government's credibility would have been questioned? Yes, of course the attractiveness of this proposal would have been lost and, yes, of course the government's credibility would have been destroyed. So Minister Abbott chose to ignore the flaws in his policy and mislead electors. He led the Australian public to believe that the Medicare safety net proposal was a bona fide election promise and that if the coalition government was re-elected it would enact that policy. The only problem was that electors believed from the coalition's advertising that the safety net thresholds would be in place for a considerable time. With the safety net proposal being a part of the coalition's MedicarePlus policy, the Howard-Abbott team invaded electors' emotions, suggesting that if re-elected they would provide a better health system for all Australians. As all Australians would remember, the coalition government embarked on a massive advertising campaign to tell us how much better off we would be if the coalition won government. The advertising campaign to promote MedicarePlus was forced into every household and householders received the MedicarePlus booklet in their mailboxes. It was nearly impossible for families and individuals to avoid the onslaught of television, radio and newspaper advertising used as part of the federal government's propaganda campaign to win votes at the upcoming election. The government advertising that was intended to persuade and convince Australians to vote for the coalition worked. Many Australians voted for the coalition believing that all aspects of MedicarePlus were fully costed and affordable. Little did voters know that the federal government was receiving advice from Treasury that the policy was flawed. I suppose if the federal government had given the Australian electors this relevant information it may have ruined its chances of being re-elected. Would that have been the price of informing the general public of the true facts? Surely Australian voters had the right to all the information, not just the propaganda being distributed by the federal government. Less than six months following the election of the coalition, Minister Abbott introduced the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005. There is no surprise that, in this bill, he suggests an increase in the safety net thresholds. And it is not a surprise that the suggested increases are the same as the government tried to get through the Senate previously. They were unsuccessful then but, with a majority in the Senate, they are certain to get the increases through now. From 1 January 2006 the Medicare safety net thresholds will increase from $300 to $500 for concession card holders and low-income families and from $700 to $1,000 for all remaining Australians. Minister Abbott is now acknowledging his estimates need to be revised. However, this is a bit late. He knew when his government initially proposed the safety net idea that it was not feasible to reduce the threshold, but he did so just to get it through the Senate. In minister's second reading speech on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Safety-nets) Bill 2005, he told us that an overriding concern for the government was the long-term sustainability of the safety net, yet he failed to inform the general public of these concerns. Through the federal government's advertising campaign the minister pushed the lower amounts as bait. Minister Abbott knew prior to the federal election that he could not sustain the $300 and $700 thresholds, yet he led the Australian public to believe he could. Now the minister wants the Australian public to believe that the government had not foreseen the blow-out in the costs of this tiative. I challenge Minister Abbott on this matter. He and his government were fully aware, when introducing this proposal in 2003, of the full costs associated with the introduction of the safety net. He knew this because he was aware that, to be economically responsible, the safety net thresholds would have to be $500 for concession card holders and low-income earners and $1,000 for all other Australians. The minister received relevant advice from Treasury during the federal election campaign that the costs of the Medicare safety net would be more than double the forecast for the 2004-05 financial year. But during the election campaign he gave his famous rock-solid, ironclad guarantee. There was nothing rock-solid or ironclad about his guarantee at all. This guarantee has now become a patina of respectability covering a vacuum of inconsequentiality. Minister Abbott also stated during his second reading speech on the bill that more people than expected qualified for the safety net benefits and that the out-of-pocket medical expenses turned out to be considerably higher. Surely the minister had access to figures which outlined those eligible for assisthe tance under the safety net provision. The federal government would have available to them the current statistics and forecasts. The Australian people deserve better than this from their federal government. Minister Abbott should come clean and tell the Australian people the true facts regarding the Medicare safety net. The Australian people should have been told that from the beginning the federal government was aware that the safety net thresholds, which the Senate accepted, were too low. The federal government was aware that there would be a blowout in estimated costs. The federal government was fully aware that it would have to increase the Medicare safety net thresholds ini- to ensure that the blow-out would not continue. If the federal government was fully aware of all these facts, why wasn't the Australian public? Also in his second reading of the bill, the minister would like to blame some specialties for shifting charges onto Medicare outof-hospital items so that their patients could claim the safety net entitlements. He is quick to blame others for the faults of his government's legislation. Why was the government's legislation able to be penetrated by specialties? Surely the government should have been able to ensure there were no loopholes in their legislation to enable this. The minister should be strong enough to take full responsibility for the failures of his government's Medicare safety net legislation and not try to blame others for the blow-out. The failure of the Medicare safety net legislation rests plainly on the shoulders of the federal government and the minister in particular. What will happen as a result of the federal government's decision to increase the safety net thresholds? One million Australians will miss out on higher Medicare benefits. That is one million Australians who will be disadvantaged through the federal government's mishandling of the safety net facts. According to an article printed in the Age newspaper: Health Department officials revealed in Senate estimates hearings ... that under the old scheme, 2.5 million patients would have reached the safety net next year. But after the Government broke a key election promise by raising the thresholds at which the safety net kicks in, the estimate has plummeted to 1.5 million. This means there will be two-and-a-half times as many losers as the Government suggested when it announced the cuts in April. These losers, the one million Australians who will miss out on assistance from the safety net policy changes, will be those who live in rural Australia, those who live in regional towns, people who live in outer metropolitan areas and people who live in the inner city areas associated with low incomes. Constituents in my electorate, Charlton, will miss out. Many in my community can illafford to be disadvantaged by the proposed changes in these thresholds. Although I am appalled that the federal government is even contemplating the increase in the safety net threshold, I am even more appalled that the Medicare safety net is skewed towards the upper income end of Australian society. Through the ABS survey of household expenditure, it was revealed that the higher a person's income the more likely they are to have a high expenditure on health. This means that there are people with discretionary income, who can sustain high out-ofpocket costs, who will have the treatment and, therefore, are more likely to add up the out-of-pocket costs, which will enable them to access the safety net. While the minister and the government would like to lead Australians to the conclusion that the most in need benefit from the safety net, this is not the case. As proven with past and present coalition governments, there is no desire to provide all Australians with adequate health services. When will a coalition government provide adequate health services to all Australians regardless of income? Never. I take this opportunity to challenge the government and Minister Abbott, who is responsible for health, to address the health issues facing Australia. It is the government's job to improve health services in Australia. It is not their job to move the goalposts to disadvantage those on low incomes. While Labor did not support the safety net policy, we do expect Minister Abbott to keep his word. The government spent an enormous amount of taxpayers' money spreading their propaganda regarding the safety net and the amounts that would be applied. The government gave a pledge to the Australian people. It should now keep that pledge. ‘Changes take the knife to Medicare safety-net benefits' and ‘Budget measures mean that out-of-hospital and drug costs will rise' were the headlines in the Australian Financial Review of 14 May 2005, following the last federal budget. The article said: For 29-year-old Andrea Holden, cuts to major health entitlements in this week's federal budget mean her recent knee operation just got a lot more expensive. Health benefits were about the only thing to be cut in a generous first budget for the Howard government's fourth term. And the government made sure the bad news about restrictions to the Medicare safety netunder which the government pays 80 per cent of a patient's out-of-hospital costs once they've spent a certain amount-wasn't around to muddy the news of the tax cuts, announcing it a few weeks before the budget. And while the government is offering a tax-cut calculator for the punters to work out how the largesse applies to them, there is no similar health-cut calculator. That's because if you get sick, like Andrea, the government suddenly looks a whole lot less generous. According to Catholic Health Australia chief executive Francis Sullivan, the government, like a reverse Robin Hood, is taking from the sick to give tax cuts to the healthy and wealthy. … … … HeMr Sullivansays Australia is moving to a situation where “we say ‘well, it's just bad luck if you're sick, you just have to pay more'.” What if you are not in a position to pay for health services? Do you just go without? Does the government really care? If the government really cared about Australians it would not have introduced the MedicarePlus policy, which included the Medicare safety net provision. It would have introduced policies such as the ones proposed by Labor. Labor's policies would have provided equal health services for all Australians, not just the rich. Labor is prepared to assist people to avoid high out-of-pocket costs when they need specialist care or access to diagnostic technology by making that care and technology available out of the public hospital system. Labor's hospitals package offered Australians specialist care and access to diagnostic technologies in public hospitals, without the obligation of paying a gap. This is what the Australian public want and deserve. Why can't the government deliver appropriate heath services to all Australians? Why can't it handle its finances so that all Australians can be entitled to better health services? Even the Treasurer, Peter Costello, has warned that Australians will have to get used to paying a bigger share of their health care costs to fireproof government spending. This just proves that the government has no intention of caring for all Australians, just the ones who can afford to look after themselves. So the truth of the matter is that the Howard coalition government is no different from previous conservative governments. The government has no real desire to improve Medicare. Its only intentions are to dismantle it, as previous coalition governments have done. The Howard government misled the general public by its propaganda during the federal election campaign, and continues to do so by not admitting to what it has in store for Medicare and the millions of average Australians who rely on it for basic medical needs.",69
55,Ms CORCORAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Isaacs) (1.17 pm)The purpose of the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 is to increase the level at which patients can access the Medicare safety net. Right now the safety net can be accessed once a family or individual spends $716.10 in a calendar year, or $306.90 for a family or individual holding a Commonwealth concession card or who is eligible for family tax benefit A. The safety net reimburses 80 per cent of all out-ofpocket expenses met by a patient once the threshold has been reached. The bill is notorious now because it breaks the rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the Minister for Health and Ageing gave the electorate in the last election campaign period. That guarantee was that the threshold for the safety net would not be increased. When the safety net was first introduced in November 2003 the government's proposal was for thresholds of $500 and $1,000. The initial cost of this measure was estimated to be $266.3 million for the four years 2003-04 to 2006-07. In order to get this legislation through the Senate the government negotiated with individual senators, and the thresholds were eventually reduced to $300 and $500. The revised cost of this was set at $440 million. This was in March 2004. This legislation before us now is to restore the thresholds to the original proposals of $500 and $300, effective from 1 January 2006. There are a number of issues worth thinking about in relation to the bill, and these are the initial reason for the safety the sense or otherwise of the principle of the safety net as a public policy, the consequences of the safety net to date, the ability of the safety net to assist those struggling to meet medical costs and the behaviour of the government and the minister in managing this policy. So why was the safety net introduced in the first place? The original legislation has be seen in the perspective of the time it was introduced. We are talking about 2003, with an election looming within 12 months. One of the consistent themes of a restless electorate was access to affordable health care. Medicare was seen as being not as useful as it once was in delivering affordable health care, because bulk-billing rates were decreasing rapidly-that is, the number of doctors prepared to offer bulk-billing to their patients. From the time that Medicare was introduced in 1983, bulk-billing grew steadily. It reached around 80 per cent in 1996. From there, it turned south, and by 2003-04 the rate had dropped to an average of 68 per cent across Australia. In Isaacs bulk-billing was 83 per cent in 1996, and this had dropped to around 70 per cent by 2003-04. I want to make it clear that I do not altogether blame the doctors for moving away from bulkbilling. A doctor's practice has many expenses and needs to operate on a sound financial footing. After all, doctors and their staff are entitled to make a reasonable living, as is everybody else. The rebates being paid under Medicare had not moved for a long time, and many doctors discovered that they were falling behind financially. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the bigger practices were doing better than the smaller ones or the one-person practices. At the same time that bulk-billing was declining, the gap that patients were asked to net, pay when they visited their non bulk-billing doctor was growing. Many doctors were asking patients to pay their fees up front, and this was putting enormous stress on many people. We know that mothers with a couple of sick kids would take one child to the doctor, thus incurring only one doctor's bill, get a prescription for that one child, have it filled and then share the medicine around the rest to of the family. In that way they were doing nobody any good at all. I recently spoke to a cancer patient who approached me while I was doing a mobile office. She told me that she had her condition under control but needed to see her specialist from time to time when the pain got bad. She said that things changed for her when the specialist stopped bulk-billing and introduced an up-front fee. Now, if the pain arrives in a week when dollars are short, my constituent does not get her pain relief-she cannot afford to. She was getting her health care on the basis of her financial situation and not on the basis of her health needs. This is the sort of thing that was being heard right across Australia, and the government recognised that it at least had to be seen to be doing something. It would have been better, though, if it had actually done something. So the government introduced the safety net. The government hoped that, if a patient or family could see that their doctor's bills would not grow beyond a certain level, they would be reassured and stop agitating for the issues facing Medicare to be addressed properly. How does the safety net stand the test sensible public policy? It does not. This point was made at the time by the opposition and by many in the health sector. The argument was, and is, that this measure simply writes a blank cheque on health costs whilst not assisting many of those who are finding it hard to afford decent health care. The financial constraint on Medicare is the regulation of how much a doctor is paid-that is, the rebate amount. Whilst there is criticism of the current level of the rebate, that does not take away its function as a regulating device. The safety net has no such regulation; it is unregulated and uncapped-in other words, a blank cheque. The scheme pays 80 per cent of an unregulated fee for an indefinite time. There is nothing stopping unscrupulous doctors from noting that a patient is on the safety net and hiking up fees. We have had anecdotal evidence of some doctors rearranging the fee structure for managing pregnancy so that most of the fee now applies to care outside the hospital, which qualifies it for safety net purposes. The scheme was always going to be hard to control, and that is exactly what has happened. It is intriguing that a government which prides itself on good economic management could introduce a runaway train such as this scheme. What happened once the scheme got under way? Surprise, surprise-the costs went through the roof. The scheme's original estimated cost, with the new thresholds, was $440 million for the three years from 2005-06 to 2007-08. This was the estimate in March 2004, as it was introduced. Twelve months later, in April 2005, the estimate had moved to $1.4 billion for the same period-over three times the original amount. The estimate for the four years to 2008-09 was $1.6 billion. Clearly, the runaway train was gathering speed at an alarming rate. This blow-out was entirely predictable. of But, despite all the money flowing around the system, the scheme is still not helping those who are struggling to meet their doctors bills. If the young mother or the constituent with cancer about whom I spoke earlier have to look in their purses before ringing the doctor, this scheme does not help. It will help once they reach the threshold but, until that point, they are still in trouble. If the cash is not there now, no amount of promises of future relief will help. A person on a tight budget is still left looking in their purse first and ringing the doctor second. This type of assistance is starting to become a pattern. Just recently, we saw a bill to introduce tax rebates for child care. That arrangement will give relief to a family long after they have paid the child-care bills, but it does not do a single thing to help a family who cannot afford child care today. The safety net scheme is the same. It is fine in the long term but does not do a thing to help those who are facing immediate financial difficulties. I do not know whether the government genuinely cannot see this point or just does not care. A family on a tight budget is like a business on a tight budget: cash flow is a real issue every day. I challenge the minister to show me how the safety net can help those whom I have spoken about. It is worth noting some interesting stats which show very clearly that this scheme is not helping those in real financial need. An analysis of how much has been spent on the safety net, and where it has been spent, shows that the electorate with the highest average income, Bradfield in New South Wales, had received the highest amount of safety net rebate as at September 2004. Bradfield has an average income of $1,759 per household and received $911,000 in rebates. Isaacs, with an average income of only half that amount, or $959 per household, received just over $226,000-a quarter of the amount the residents of Bradfield received. The analysis shows a marked correlation between income and the amount of rebate received. This means that those with a higher disposable income are taking advantage of the safety net-and why wouldn't they-whilst those with much lower incomes are not able to do so. Of the 150 electorates in Australia, 20 received more than $400,000. Only two of those electorates had an average income of under $1,000 per week-the rest of them have an average income of over $1,200 per week. Twenty-two electorates received less than $100,000. Four of these electorates have an average income of over $1,000 per week-the rest of them are well below that figure. Finally, I want to talk about how the government and the Minister for Health and Ageing have managed the cost blow-out in this scheme. In a real sense, the entirely dictable cost blow-out has not been managed at all-as I said earlier, it is a blank cheque. The changes proposed by this bill simply raise the bar a bit, before patients can access the safety net. Those who spend more will eventually benefit-provided that they can afford to seek the medical treatment they need in the first place. The question I really want to address, though, is the political management-or mismanagement-of this issue. It was entirely predictable that the cost of this scheme would blow out. If the minister was not able to work this out for himself, plenty of people around him were telling him so, including many on this side of the House. Information which came out in Senate estimates showed that the minister would have been briefed by the department as early as July 2004 on the fact that there were serious financial problems with the safety net. The minister did not take any action. Throughout the 2004 election campaign, the minister stuck to his story that the safety net would not be altered. He gave the now infamous rock solid, ironclad guarantee that it would stay as it was. As with so many other matters the government deals with, it is difficult to work out whether the minister did not understand the implications of the legislation he was developing or he understood precisely what he was doing and went ahead with it anyway to try to avoid the flak on the growing problem of medical costs in the electorate, in an election year. From a political point of view, there are two aspects of the management of this problem: firstly, the delayed admission that a problem existed and, secondly, the denial that the system would be altered. The safety net scheme came into effect in March 2004. Very quickly it became clear that it was going to be a problem. Within the first three months of operation of the safety net, 500,000 individuals and families had preregistered for it. Actual expenditure on the safety net rebates exceeded the estimated expenditure by 40 per cent. This reached 60 per cent by July 2004 and 70 per cent by August 2004. By then, of course, an election was looming, and it was called at the end of August. During the election campaign period, the Charter of Budget Honesty process threw up costings which showed that the safety net was then costing almost double original estimates. Let me give you just one example of the Treasurer and the Minister for Health and Ageing each guaranteeing that the safety net would remain as it was before the election, despite the cost blow-out. We have the famous words that the health minister used on 6 September 2004 in response to repeated questions from a journalist about the safety net. The journalist asked: Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election? Minister: Yes. Journalist: That's a cast-iron commitment? Minister: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely. Journalist: 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700? Minister: That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad mitment. Earlier, on 2 September, the Treasurer, at a doorstop interview, said: The parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change. Very clearly, the government was telling us that the Medicare safety net would not change. During that election campaign, the Prime Minister was always ready to scoff at Labor's health policies. At the same time, he sang the praises of the safety net and reinforced his commitment not to cut it. In a press conference in Sydney on 8 October, the Prime Minister made it clear that he was aware of some doctors exploiting the scheme and said that he would deal with that problem. He acknowledged, in a backhanded way, the problems of the uncontrolled nature of the safety net. He tried to defend this by saying that there was no cap on the availability of Medicare services either. But he missed the point: there is a cap on the rebate available for a service under Medicare because the rebate is linked to an approved fee for each service. This is not the case for the rebate available under the safety net arrangements; it is essentially a blank cheque. In summary, the safety net scheme does not help people get affordable health care when they need it. It is a cruel deal for those who believed the government in the election campaign period when they talked about the rock solid, ironclad guarantee. The government were dishonest about the scheme during 2004 and leading up to the election campaign. This is not good policy. It is a blank cheque. And it does not address the problem of providing affordable health care for all Australians. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (1.32 pm)-The Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 is another broken promise of the Howard government. comAfter nine long years of the Howard government being in power, we are debating in this House yet another of their broken promises. Members and the community will know that the bill that we are debating here today, relating to the Prime Minister's much vaunted Medicare safety net, is but one broken promise that the Prime Minister has made. I will recast for the House some of the other broken promises of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that he would never, ever introduce a GST. And he did. He betrayed the trust that was given to him by the Australian people when he went back on that commitment. If we look at what the Prime Minister's policies said on Iraq and his justification for Australia and Australian troops being committed to war, we find that there never were any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Yet that was what the Prime Minister gave to the Australian people as a reasoned basis for our involvement. Today in this House we have been debating Telstra bills and the sale of one of Australia's great economic assets. Those bills went through this parliament barely an hour ago. I can recall the Prime Minister telling the Australian people that he would never, ever privatise Telstra; but when he did, with T1 and T2, he still gave a commitment to the Australian people-a commitment that he broke. And here we have in the Medicare safety net legislation before us today another example of the deceit of this government. This government does not believe in cutting health spending. That is what Minister Abbott said on 16 September 2004. So I say to the House: why are we here debating this Medicare safety net legislation? On 16 September 2004 Mr Abbott said: I absolutely guarantee that the safety net as government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. If anybody in the Australian community was listening then to the words of the Minister for Health and Ageing, they would be pretty frightened and disappointed with this piece of legislation. You cannot get anything stronger than an absolute guarantee. But, as we know, the absolute guarantees of the Prime Minister are worth nothing, and now we know that the absolute guarantees of the minister for health are worth nothing. You cannot get a commitment any clearer than: I absolutely guarantee that the safety net government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. Any young Australian listening to this Liberal minister for health, any young Australian listening to that rock solid commitment from a politician, would assume that the politician meant it. Well, welcome to the Liberal nightmare, because when a Liberal Prime Minister makes a promise you can guarantee it is a non-core promise. And when a Liberal health minister makes an absolute guarantee you know it is a guarantee that is not worth the paper it is written on. That is why we have this legislation in the House todaybecause the minister for health and the Prime Minister have betrayed low-income earners in this country yet again. Why are we debating this bill? Is it because the minister cannot count or, worse, that the Treasurer cannot count? Perhaps that is why the Treasurer said nothing during the election campaign. Perhaps he said nothing to maximise the ability of the government to exploit the policy when it was popular and then cut it loose as soon as they were returned to the treasury bench. You cannot get anything more cynical and deceptive than a Liberal minister in this government. The minister for health gave an absolute guaranthe tee that the Medicare safety net would stick. That would be the policy that would be implemented, and there would be no changes. He said, ‘I absolutely guarantee that.' What example is this Liberal minister setting for the young people of Australia who look to the political system for some degree of truth and some degree of morality? Does the Prime Minister of this country, whose government lied to the Australian people on Iraq-with the subsequent death of thousands of innocents-and whose words mean nothing, have any conscience when it comes to these matters? When you give a guarantee as the to the Australian people, when you give a guarantee to young people in this country, when you give a guarantee to older Australians, when you give a guarantee-an absolute guarantee-then there is a reasonable expectation that you would meet it. That ought to be the underlying morality of the Australian political system: some degree of truth from the Prime Minister and some degree of truth from the minister for health. But why should we be surprised at this deceit? When has this government shown any compassion for the low-income earners in this community? Calling them ‘mate' and saying, ‘We're in there defending the little Aussie battler' is an obscenity when you put a piece of legislation like this into this House. It does not pay the bills for the lowincome earners when you put another burden on them. In my electorate of Corio, in Geelong, we have a lot of people who are on low incomes. They are not only the pensioners, or the disadvantaged, who must rely on the government for their incomes. They are the working poor. They are people who work and cannot actually afford to pay their bills. And those people have a reasonable expectation that when a minister of the Crown in a government makes a commitment then that commitment will stick. This increase will affect low-income earners as their capacity for discretionary spending will be further diminished. Senate estimates revealed that one million people who previously qualified will now miss out-one million people who were told by the Prime Minister that this was a policy that would be implemented, and no sooner had the Prime Minister been elected than he ratted on the solemn commitment. But that is not the only promise that this Prime Minister has ratted on. He is the master of the non-core promise. I come from a rural background. My father was an honourable man. If I had ever said to him, ‘Dad, I've just made you a non-core promise,' I hate to think what would have happened to me. Yet here is the Prime Minister of Australia and a government that are masters of deceit making commitments and then going back on them after an election and, in doing so, lowering standards in politics in this country. I call on the minister to direct his departand ment to reveal what proportion will be in the lower threshold and, therefore, on lower incomes and concession cards. Did not the minister state that his government does not believe in cutting health spending? Could the minister not see the gathering clouds on this blow-out or, having spent the first eration boasting at regular press briefings about the high level of registrations and successful claimants for the safety net, did he think he could somehow just avoid the inevitable? In June 2004 actual spending on the safety net was 40 per cent more than estimated. In July 2004 spending on the safety net was 60 per cent more than estimated in the budget. In June 2004 the department of finance was starting to look at the estimates, as there were indications that the program was growing more rapidly than estimated. The Herald Sun reported in 2004 that an internal HIC audit revealed evidence of changed billing practices amongst doctors to help patients reach the safety net faster. This same report showed that more than 3,000 patients in Victoria slipped into the safety net in only one month. The audit revealed a $1.4 million blow-out of the scheme in Victoria alone. In August 2004 the office of the Minister for Finance and Administration was contacted about the blow-out, and Minister Nick Minchin was subsequently briefed. This occurred prior to the caretaker period before the election. So we ask ourselves this question: ‘Why didn't the minister react in a timely and responsible manner to this blowout, as any competent minister would in these extreme circumstances?' No, it is just easier to wait until after the election and then lift the thresholds and go back on your promise. I have heard the arguments about lags in timing of these reports but, even allowing for this, by mid-July 2004 any competent minister would have acted promptly, read the signs done something. So if there was no conspiracy to deceive-as the health minister maintains-does this mean he personally had no conspiracy to deceive but rather was misguided in his blind faith that his senior cabinet colleagues would not betray him? Delusions and incompetence: that is double jeopyear's op- ardy for any minister. Sadly, this program has contributed to increased levels of health inflation. Over the 12 months to the March quarter 2005, health costs rose by 5.7 per cent, compared to the CPI in all groups which grew at 2.4 per cent. Health CPI is the second fastest growing group in the CPI basket, and only education CPI has outgrown health CPI. The cost of hospital and medical services rose by 5.8 per cent. This increase is largely attributed to increases in fees for specialist services. program has also contributed to higher specialist fees, making it harder for lower income Australians to access the specialist services they need in the first place. The government's own Medicare data has shown that there is a high correlation between incomes and levels of Medicare safety net rebates claimed. In the last five years, household spending on health has increased by over 40 per cent. This means that in 1998-99 an average family spent around $14 a week on health care and medical expenses, but in 2003-04 this weekly average increased by 46 per cent. There are very important principles at stake in the bill that we have before the House. Let me read into the Hansard the extent of the deceit of this federal minister on this issue. The transcript of an interview with Ms Ticky Fullerton on 6 September 2004 proceeds as follows: TICKY FULLERTON: Will the Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election? A very clear and unequivocal question. The transcript continues: TONY ABBOTT: Yes. TICKY FULLERTON: That's a cast-iron commitment? TONY ABBOTT: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely. It was absolutely a cast-iron commitment that Minister Abbott never intended to deliver, because they already knew, before the election, that the program was in a blow-out phase. The Howard government deceived the Australian people when the minister went on that particular program and made those statements. On 2 September 2004, Treasurer Costello said, ‘The parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change.' I notice that the member for Corangamite is in the House this afternoon. The member This for Corangamite, some would say, is an honourable man. I could not believe that the member for Corangamite would make this sort of commitment to his electors and then, in a matter of months, renege on it-rat on it. Mr MCArthur interjecting Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-No, that would not be the style of the member for Corangamite. Then why is it the style of the minister for health, your colleague? Why is it the style of the Prime Minister? Is the member for Corangamite the only honourable person in the coalition-or does he go along with this? You can put out the voting papers there",73
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The member for Corio will come back to the bill. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I would really like to know what is on the piece of paper you are handing out. I hope it is not another absolute guarantee, because if it is it is not worth the paper it is written on.",80
57,Dr EMERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Do you want me to check?,80
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The member for Rankin might check outside in a minute. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-We had a cast-iron guarantee, and this legislation now goes back on that cast-iron guarantee. The young people of Australia have a reasonable expectation that their politicians will not lie to them. So do the mums and dads with their families-they have a reasonable expectation that their government will not lie to them. The older Australians in this community and in the seat of Corio also have a reasonable expectation that they will not be lied to. Yet here in this piece of legislation we have the most cynical manipulation you will see in politics, from the Prime Minister down to the minister for health. This legislation will give effect to a broken promise. A solemn promise is broken in this legislation, and those who will pay will be the most disadvantaged in the community.",80
59,Dr EMERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The reason we are debating the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 is to facilitate the breaking of a promise on the part of the Howard government. The promise that was made-an ironclad promise-was that the Medicare safety net that was put in place before the election would be retained after the election. The government was asked about the Medicare safety net's sustainability on a large number of occasions for one reason and for one reason only. That is that Labor was very concerned that this Medicare safety net that had been established in legislation by this government was not financially sustainable and, on the basis of questioning by the member for Lalor, the shadow health minister, the media took up the cause and asked on numerous occasions whether in fact this Medicare safety net would remain in place if the Howard government were re-elected. Who made the statement, ‘Truth is absolute; truth is supreme; truth is never disposable in national political life'? The answer the current Prime Minister of Australia, who made that statement 10 years ago on 25 August 1995 on the ABC radio's AM program. You would believe that having been elected to the high office of Prime Minister of Australia this man would insist that not only his conduct but the conduct of all his ministers would meet that standard-that standard being that truth is absolute, truth is supreme and truth is never disposable in national political life. Yet today, in this parliament, are debating the breaking of an ironclad promise by this government. On so many occasions the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were asked about the sustainability of the safety net. The minister for health on 16 September last year, not long before the election, said: I absolutely guarantee that the safety net as the government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. On 6 September, just 10 days before, the same minister was asked: Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare Plus Safety Net ... in place after the election?' The minister replied yes. He was asked: That's a cast-iron commitment? And the minister said: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely. He was asked again: 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700? The minister said: That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment. I say to everyone listening to this debate in the parliament: how else do you interpret a minister's statement that he has just made an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment? There are not two ways of interpreting that is statement. It is either a rock solid, ironclad commitment or it is not. And yet this government after the election has debased truth by arguing that no such commitment could be rock solid or ironclad because the Medicare safety net costs had blown out. This was a problem to which Labor had referred, which Labor had identified, and yet the government continued with the pretence, for one reason and for one reason only-that is, to ensure its re-election-that the Medicare we safety net was financially affordable. It was not just the minister for health. The Treasurer on 2 September last year, again in the context of the federal election campaign, said, ‘The parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change.' Yet at that very time the Minister for Finance and Administration of this government and of this country knew that the cost of the Medicare safety net was blowing out. The finance minister knew it was blowing out, the Treasurer knew it was blowing out and the health minister knew it was blowing out. Yet here they were making ironclad, rock solid guarantees that there would be no change-and today we are debating a change in those arrangements to make them more affordable. It was not just the health minister and the Treasurer-the Prime Minister got in on the act. On 12 May last year on the Neil Mitchell program on 3AW he said, ‘But it is funded in the budget.' He was referring to the Medicare safety net. He said: Now, that new safety net is funded in the budget, although it was announced several months ago but it is funded in the budget. So here is the Prime Minister saying that the Medicare safety net will stay, that it is fully funded in the budget, that it is sustainable. On 7 September, right in the middle of the federal election campaign, he said: In fact, we have a better Medicare system now than our opponents are offering because we have this new beaut safety net. So here is the Prime Minister saying we have got a ‘beaut safety net'. How beaut was it? It did not last past the election date because, as soon as that election passed, the ministers got together with the Prime Minister and said that they were going to have to tell the truth to the Australian people, a truth that they had evaded all the way through the election campaign, the truth being that the member for Lalor, the shadow health minister, was right that this Medicare safety net was not affordable-which is what we were saying all along. The health minister is very fond of the word ‘absolutely'. He talks about the Medicare safety net being an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment. It made me realise that he does use the word ‘absolutely' a lot. I thought I had better find out where he has been using this word before. On the Four Corners program in 1998, the minister was asked about financial backing for Terry Sharples to help undermine Pauline Hanson. The reporter said, ‘So there was never any question of any party funds or other funds from any other source?' The minister: ‘Absolutely not, absolutely not.' ‘Being offered to Terry Sharples?' The minister: ‘Absolutely not.' So we know whenever this minister uses the words ‘absolutely' or ‘absolute rock solid guarantee' he means exactly the opposite, because he was not telling the truth on the Four Corners program in 1998 and he was not telling the truth in the lead-up to the last election when he said this was an absolute commitment. And we wonder why. Because the standard of truth is set by the Prime Minister, who said, ‘Truth is absolute; truth is supreme; truth is never disposable in national political life.' And here we are-the truth overboard yet again. There is the Treasurer: he was in on the act too. He was in on the act before the last election saying: ‘Absolutely. This will remain an ironclad promise. We will deliver in full after the next election.' But they all knew the truth. They just did not want the Australian people to know the truth, and that is that the cost of the Medicare safety net had blown out.",81
60,The SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",82
61,Mr VAILE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs will be absent from question time today. He is in Melbourne to address an important function of the Council for Multicultural Australia. The Attorney-General will answer questions on his behalf. NA,82
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Does the Acting Prime Minister recall saying the following yesterday in relation to the 104-page Telstra report about job losses: ... the Australian Labor Party ... asked questions about some report on the staffing of Telstra into the future ... It forced Telstra to release a statement yesterday which said that there was no such report. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that yesterday Telstra government relations chief, Phil Burgess, admitted the document did exist? He said, ‘That document is a live document.' Did the Acting Prime Minister mislead the parliament into believing this report did not exist just before the parliament finally dealt with the Telstra sale legislation?",83
63,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is no, I did not mislead the House. I have seen the media reports this morning. The only comment that I would make is that Telstra made a statement to the ASX, and that is a matter between Telstra and the ASX.",83
64,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Would the Acting Prime Minister inform the House how the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package will ensure that all Australians have adequate telecommunications services both now and into the future?,83
65,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The member represents the largest electorate in Australia, which covers a great expanse of Western Australia. He has been a very keen supporter of this package to ensure that there is an opportunity to invest significantly in telecommunications infrastructure well into the future and to give certainty to all Australians and particularly to regional Australians. Telstra The Connect Australia telecommunications package will give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services, with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband and mobile phone services. It will also deliver a $2 billion perpetual Communications Fund, which will deliver on a yearly basis an earning stream to invest in future telecommunications needs across regional Australia. It delivers a more robust regulatory framework and it enhances competition. It also strengthens safeguards to protect consumers. The package has received support not only in the Senate and the House of Representatives but also across Australia from a number of interested groups throughout the community. I give some examples: the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, ATUG, told the Senate hearing last Friday that it supports this package. Yesterday the National Farmers Federation threw their weight behind the package. They said it should be supported; it should go through. They want to see this investment in telecommunications in regional Australia. Most importantly, today, in the Australian, Dick Estens has Telstra thrown his support behind the package. Dick Estens is the man who conducted the most comprehensive review of regional and rural telecommunications in Australia. He said he supports the Connect Australia package. Mr Tanner-He's a member of the National Party.",83
66,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is interesting that the Labor Party are interjecting and making a lot out of this, but Dick Estens did the most comprehensive review of telecommunications in Australia's history. I do not recall Labor Party in government ever doing such a report. In today's paper, Mr Estens said: I'm happy about the end of the process. move on to the next phase, which is now on building Telstra and building competition in gional Australia. Mr Estens and his committee gave the government the road map to move forward in respect of investment needs in regional telecommunications across Australia. This package that has now passed both houses delivers on Mr Estens' recommendations. Telstra",83
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Acting Prime Minister, now that the parliament has passed the Telstra legislation, with some members of your own party not supporting it, how does it feel to have sold out your constituency in rural and regional Australia? Acting Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that you will be forever known as the Nationals leader who sold out the bush?",84
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before calling the Acting Prime Minister, I believe the first half of that question was asking for an opinion. The Acting Prime Minister may answer the question.",84
69,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the second part of the question is no. How do I feel? I feel very good because this is the biggest investment in telecommunications in regional Australia. On the day that the Labor Party's former leader has opened the book on the Australian Labor Party, on every single member that sits on the front bench and on the Leader of the Opposition, I say to the Labor Party and to all those who voted against this package that they have voted against the opportunity to invest $3.1 billion in regional telecommunications. They have voted against the opportunity to ensure a better regulatory framework. They have the voted against the opportunity to improve competition in telecommunications in regional Australia. The government very Let's proudly supports what we have put forward. As I said in my earlier answer, this package re- delivers on the Estens inquiry and it delivers the largest investment in regional telecommunications in this country's history. Telstra",84
70,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline the benefits that will flow to consumers from the full sale of Telstra and from the establishment of a telecommunications fund? Treasurer, are there any alternative positions?",84
71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Today is a historic day here in the parliament because the ownership and the status of Telstra have been finally resolved, and resolved in a way which will put this carrier on a modern, competitive footing to deliver good services to the people of Australia over decades to come. It was back in 1993 that the coalition, then in opposition, first proposed privatisation in relation to Telstra. Back in those days of course the Australian Labor Party was very gung-ho about privatisation, privatising Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. This idea that the Labor Party has always opposed privatisation-you would have to have a short memory to actually believe that for a moment. Our government have been up front and honest about our policies. We believe that telecommunications can be delivered by the private sector, as indeed it is in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand-in fact, in most of the modern developed economies of the world. We have resolved the status of Telstra ownership whilst putting in place a competitive framework so that there is competition to drive prices lower-a competitive framework which has been endorsed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We have also invested in a regional telecommunications fund. That will be a $2 billion fund, the earnings of which will be available to upgrade services in regional areas for decades to come-an investment that would not have been made if Telstra had remained with majority government control. Mr Tanner interjecting",84
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne!,85
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I spoke earlier of the Australian Labor Party's penchant for privatisation. There is one big difference between this government and Labor. When Labor privatised the banks and the airlines, it spent the total capital in full in the year of receipt and then still drove the budget into deficit. the end of the year, there were no shares, there was a bigger budget deficit and there were greater borrowings. Labor totally dissipated the proceeds of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Our government believe that the proceeds should be invested for future generations. We will do that through the Future Fund to give young Australians opportunities in the future-a sound financial footing from a government that has set this country up to cope with the impacts of demographic change. This matter has been finally resolved. It has been resolved in a way which will bring competitive industry, better prices and better investment in regional Australia and set young Australians up for a much better future over decades to come. Telstra",85
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Can the Acting Prime Minister inform the House whether his office or the Prime Minister's office made any contact with ASIC on the evening of 13 September or the morning of 14 September? Can the Acting Prime Minister assure the House that there was no ministerial or staff interference with ASIC's original intention to investigate the Prime Minister over his infamous remarks that Telstra executives should ‘talk up' the company?,85
75,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can certainly inform him that I made no such contact and, as far as I am aware, no staff in my office or in the Prime Minister's office made any contact with ASIC. I understand that the Treasurer answered this question in full yesterday, but I will check on those staff. Telecommunications",85
76,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Would the Acting Prime Minister inform the At House how the government is strengthening regulation in the telecommunications sector?,85
77,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I again recognise the invaluable contribution that the member for Hinkler has made with regard to telecommunications across Australia for the entirety of his time in this place. The member for Hinkler asked about consumer protection. The government have strengthened consumer protection in four key areas as part of the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package that was passed through the parliament this week. We are reaffirming the universal service obligation-let us never, ever forget that it was our government that introduced, through legislation, the universal service obligation. We are strengthening the customer service guarantee, something else that our government introduced. We are improving the network reliability framework and requiring Telstra to submit a local presence plan. The government has reaffirmed the universal service obligation in its commitment to providing basic phone services in rural and regional areas. The government has strengthened the CSG so that Telstra and all other phone companies must connect and repair phone services quickly or pay compensation. The government has increased the amount of compensation by 21 per cent with regard to this. On an issue that I know the member for Hinkler is very interested in, the government will ensure that phone companies cannot use the mass disruption clause to unreasonably claim exemptions from the customer service guarantee. The government has also tightened the network reliability framework, which requires Telstra to monitor the number of faults in its lines and upgrade them if they have repeated faults. As part of that, Telstra will now be required to upgrade at least 480 cable runs of its copper network a year, as determined by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The government will review the network reliability framework in 2007 and tighten it even further if necessary. This package is about giving regional and rural Australia certainty and confidence-not just today but into the future-that, regardless of who owns Telstra, there will be a visible and effective presence in rural and regional Australia and their services will be provided.",85
78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer recall saying to the House yesterday: ... I can confirm that certainly my office has been in touch with Mr Lucy. Did any member of the Treasurer's staff in any conversation with Mr Lucy or any member of ASIC's staff suggest in any way that an inquiry into statements made by the Prime Minister was unwelcome or that a public statement that such an inquiry was not occurring should be made?,86
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said yesterday, my office was in contact with ASIC, as I would expect it to be, so that I could be briefed to answer questions in the parliament. The suggestion that my office in some way directed ASIC is absolutely false, as I said yesterday. Mr Crean interjecting",86
80,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is absolutely false and unwelcome. Are there any other adjectives you would like? No? The Chairman of ASIC is a statutory officer who is protected by statute and who is given a statutory responsibility to administer the law. As I said yesterday, if ASIC wants to investigate the Prime Minister, I would welcome it to do so. He will not have been in contravention of the act for one second. Why? Because the duty of disclosure is not on the Prime Minister; as I told the House yesterday, the duty of disclosure is on Telstra. It does not matter; the Prime Minister never, ever had an obligation to make statements to the Australian Stock Exchange. Mr Tanner-He's still at liberty, Pete.",86
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Telstra has an obligation to make a disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange, and Telstra maintains that it did make a disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange. As I said yesterday, ASIC will Telstra investigate whether or not it made proper disclosure. Mr Tanner interjecting",86
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned!,86
83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ASIC are welcome to ask anybody they like any question they like in order to determine Telstra's obligation. As far as this side of the House is concerned, we would welcome them and we would invite them and we would encourage them to do so. They know they have the statutory powers to do so, and they will operate them in a way which is consistent with those powers. Economy",86
84,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, what are the challenges ahead for economic management in the year ahead? Are there any alternative views on how to manage the economy, and are they credible?",87
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There will be significant challenges in the year ahead to manage the economy. For example, the rising petrol price will undoubtedly add to inflation. It will be felt in full in the September CPI. As the Reserve Bank has already said in its August statement on monetary policy, in the near term headline CPI inflation is likely to be above underlying inflation, reflecting the pass-through of the current strength in oil prices. But underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually. In other words, the petrol price will go into the CPI. It will move the CPI up, but what the bank will do and what the government will focus on is underlying inflation when you take that first-round effect out. We will, of course, look at secondround effects if it gets into the general economy. In addition to that, the task ahead in relation to economic policy will also be to manage current global imbalances, particularly imbalances between savings in investment between China and the United States. The task ahead will be to reform the industrial relations system. The task ahead will be to bed down a competitive regime in relation to Telstra. Are there any alternative views on managing the economy? The opposition did say that they planned this term to build their credibility in relation to the economy. Those of us who fought the last election will recall that during the last election the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, fought the campaign on the basis that all he had to do to keep interest rates down was to sign a big pledge and that, once he had pledged to keep interest rates down, that was it. Members of the opposition might laugh at that proposition, but they put out leaflets all over Australia claiming that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham, would be able to keep interest rates down. I have an election leaflet which was an open letter to the people of Western Australia. On the front of it is a letter which was signed by Kim C Beazley. The opposition would have you believe today that Mr Latham is erratic or untruthful or cannot be believed. That was not the story 12 months ago during the federal election. Mr Swan-What was your story 12 months ago? Mr Tanner-What do you say about John Howard?",87
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to say what this leaflet reads. It has a lovely photo of the current Leader of the Opposition and the former leader, Mr Mark Latham. Here is what it says: Labor is ready to govern and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister. We have a letter which is signed by Kim C Beazley which says, ‘Labor is ready to govern and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister.' Mr Swan-When are you going to be ready?",87
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Member for Lilley!,87
88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both of those comments were false. Labor is not ready to govern, and there would be no Australian today who believes that Mark Latham is, was or ever will be ready to be Prime Minister. Why would Kim C Beazley circulate that to the people of Western Australia? There are two alternatives. Maybe he has no judgment and really did believe that Labor was ready to govern under Prime Minister Latham, or maybe he did not believe it and he was less than honest with the people of Western Australia: ‘Labor is ready to govern and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister.' Mr Tanner-Can't you do better than this?",87

97,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. How does the minister respond to the grave concern expressed by the ACCC chair that laws to promote competition against Telstra are unenforceable? Why was I not to be provided with answers to my questions to you on Monday on the closure of Telstra HiBIS installations, on the inability of satellite to handle voice over internet and on increased rural access prices, until after the sale legislation passed the parliament?",88
98,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now that the legislation has passed through the parliament, the next step is the development of an operational separation plan. The ACCC is obviously going to be extensively involved with the government in developing the operational separation arrangements. It already has been and will continue to be in the future. Certainly the ACCC has made it clear in the past that it has concerns about the structural arrangements in the telecommunications industry. Indeed we know that from Mr Graeme Samuel's comments at the Senate inquiry held last Friday. But, at the same time, the ACCC has agreed that the government's model is workable. It indicated at those committee hearings that it believes there are a number of matters relating to operational separation that have to be carefully addressed during the process of developing the operational separation plan. So the interests of regional and rural subscribers as well as the interests of all Australians will be served by this discussion and negotiation between the ACCC and the government in drawing up the operational separation plan. There is no mystery to this. It is as would be entirely expected. The views of Mr Samuel and his colleagues, of course, will weigh heavily with the government. In regard to providing information in answer to the honourable member's last question some days ago, I understand that Senator Coonan is in the process of replying in detail. Employment",88
99,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on today's figures for long-term unemployment in Australia? What does the government plan to do to continue to reduce long-term unemployment?,89
100,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her interest in ensuring that people in her electorate of Greenway can find jobs. Today's ABS figures show that long-term unemployment in Australia is at a 19-year low. This comes on top of the figures of last week which show that the unemployment rate in Australia, at five per cent, is at a 29-year low. That means that there are now 88,700 people in Australia who are long-term unemployedthat is, who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Compare this to the situation in 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment and the long-term unemployed numbered 330,000that is, there is a difference of almost a quarter of a million long-term unemployed between the figures in 1993 and the figures released by the ABS today. The attitude taken by the governments of the day stand in marked contrast. On 6 May 1993 the Leader of the Opposition, then the minister for employment, was asked this during an interview on The 7.30 Report on ABC Television: PAUL LYNEHAM: So this groupthat is, the unemployedare being told, in their twenties, by society, effectively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap. KIM BEAZLEY: Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement. … … … PAUL LYNEHAM: So a worse case scenario could see itlong-term unemploymentat half a million? KIM BEAZLEY: Well, close to that-a worse case scenario, yes ... Where it is now is unacceptable; where it's going to is even more unacceptable. There is a stark contrast between that attitude, which says, ‘We're not worried about the long-term unemployed,' and the attitude taken by our government to reduce the numbers by almost quarter of a million. The $3.6 billion of welfare to work measures we are taking include $360 million over four years to help the long-term unemployed into work. We think 88,000 is too many-and 330,000, when the Labor Party was in government, was an absolute disgrace. Amongst this expenditure are measures for extra places in the personal support program, extra places for vocational rehabilitation, extra Wage Assist places and a $50 million employer demand strategy. What this is all about is the government getting on with the job. It is about providing more jobs, higher wages and greater opportunities for Australians, including those who are unemployed for the long term. The best form of welfare that we can provide our fellow Australians is to enable them to get a job, and that is what we are about. Senator Barnaby Joyce",89
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister confirm that he attended the Canberra Hospital on the evening of 13 September to visit Senator Barnaby Joyce? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Under the standing orders the member may only ask questions of the minister about matters that relate to his portfolio responsibilities, and they certainly do not relate to visiting someone in a hospital.",89
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mackellar. Let me make two points. First of all, the member has not completed her question, so it is very hard to rule on it. Secondly, the Acting Prime Minister now has responsibility across all portfolios. I call the Manager of Opposition Business.",90
103,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will start my question again. Will the Acting Prime Minister confirm that he attended the Canberra Hospital on the evening of 13 September to visit Senator Barnaby Joyce? Will the Acting Prime Minister also confirm that he was refused access to Senator Joyce? Isn't it true that, when refused access, the Acting Prime Minister directed an AFP officer to try to misuse his authority in order to gain access?",90
104,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the member for Lalor's question is yes, as any leader of any political party would also have compassion for their colleagues. The answer to the second part of her question is no. Health Reform Miss JACKIE KELLY (2.31 pm)-My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister outline to the House the government's commitment to health reform? How has the government already reformed our Medicare system? Are there any alternative policies?",90
105,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I note that, thanks to the reforms that this government has put in place, the GP bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Lindsay has gone up to 89.5 per cent. As the Prime Minister and all the state Labor premiers recently concluded, Australia already has an excellent health system. The policies and reforms of this government are making a good system even better. We have boosted bulk-billing rates for children and country people to an all-time high; we have increased medical student numbers by 30 per cent; we have introduced a Medicare safety net that will help 1½ million people next year; and we are working with the states to ensure better coordination between different health programs and more seamless delivery of health services. I have been asked about alternative policies. There are no serious alternative policies, because members opposite are now indulging in an orgy of political cannibalism. Back in December the shadow minister for health said of Mark Latham: ‘Can I say that my faith in him is undiminished.' In fact, the shadow minister for health and the former member for Werriwa seemed to have had the undying political devotion to each other of Lord and Lady Macbeth. Perhaps health reform was discussed at a dinner the shadow minister for health attended last night. It is a new Labor dining society. Labor MPs have put all their eggs in the one basket case. Of course they are not interested in health reform because, according to the former leader, the current Leader of the Opposition is more interested in preparing a dirt file than he is in developing good policy. This is what the former leader says of the current leader: ‘People are still writing Beazley up as a decent loser, but he is one of the most indecent politicians I have come across.' When Labor MPs were last asked to choose between health reform and health inertiaMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I was wondering if the minister could explain whether he is the best friend David Clarke has ever had.",90
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,90
107,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,At least there is a bit of friendship on this side of the House.,90
108,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,90
109,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are friends on this side of the House. We are not ‘snakes' and ‘sewer rats'-words out of your own mouths. The last time Labor members were asked to choose between health reform and health inertia-between Mark Latham and Kim Beazley-Kim Beazley lost. Labor members trusted Mark Latham more than they trusted Kim Beazley. I went onto Labor's web site yesterday looking for their health policy. Today I went back on their web site. What did I find? I found some political clothing. Mr Costello-Merchandising.,91
110,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Political merchandising. On 15 September-this very day-it is available on the Australian Labor Party web site. It says, ‘Mark Latham for PM.' They will not hang his portrait in their party room but they are still flogging his T-shirt. It was $30; now $15. I bet they will be giving them away tomorrow. What this proves is that there are still people opposite who would always prefer mad Mark to cowardly Kim. Opposition members-Ooh! Mr Beazley interjecting",91

113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,91
114,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Even if he is not upset I am happy to withdraw it. Ammonium Nitrate,91
115,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm that thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate is shipped to Australian ports in flag of convenience vessels operating under single-voyage permits which can be issued within 24 hours of an application being lodged with the Department of Transport and Regional Services? Can he also confirm that the department relies on information provided by the master of the vessel seeking the permit as to the identity of the crew members? How can the minister guarantee that thousands of tonnes of highly explosive material being shipped into Australian ports is secure when the system for issuing shipping permits is wide open to abuse?,91
116,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is that certainly a large quantity of ammonium nitrate is shipped into Australia. We have significant demands for this product with our burgeoning mining industry, and of course ammonium nitrate is also important in agriculture. So significant quantities of ammonium nitrate come to Australia. About 99 per cent of our trade is involved with foreign ships, so it is quite likely that a significant proportion of it comes in on foreign ships. Mr Bevis-Flag of convenience ships.",91
117,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But it is not true to say that these ships come in without any checking. The reality is that we have a substantial, comprehensive risk assessment process in place. Mr Bevis-Ask the ship's master.",91
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane has asked his question.,91
119,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Each ship is subject to security checking irrespective of its flag. In addition to that, the members of the crew are checked against any alert lists to make sure that they do not pose a risk to Australia. If they choose to enter Australia, they must go through the same kinds of immigration checks as anyone else coming into this country. The Leader of the Opposition was in Gladstone a few weeks ago on that accidentprone trip and tried to make something of the fact that ammonium nitrate was being moved between Australian ports on ships that had a single-voyage permit. The reality is that the alternative to moving ammonium nitrate around Australia by ship is to move it by truck. Instead of this ammonium nitrate going from Sydney to Gladstone by ship, it could have gone by truck. It would have taken 500 semitrailers to make that journey. And which do you think is safer-500 semitrailers going up the road or one ship? The reality is that we have a safety regime in place. It is much safer to transport ammonium nitrate by ship than by road. I think Australian public would want us to continue that kind of transport regime. Gaza Strip",91
120,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney General and Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the Attorney General aware of public comments critical of Israel which accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem, creating a walled ghetto, giant penal colony and a concentration camp in the Gaza Strip? If so, what is the Attorney's response to these comments, which compare Israel's conduct with that which occurred in the Holocaust and other more recent tragedies?",92
121,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the statement made by the member for Fowler in this House on Tuesday evening when she accused Israel of planning to ‘rule Gaza like a walled ghetto, a giant penal colony, a concentration camp'. Through our linkages with the community or even family linkages, many of us know that millions of Jewish people died in concentration camps in World War II. It was an enormous crime against humanity. To make this sort of comparison belittles the suffering, pain and anguish of those who were left so tragically behind and the death of those who died a dastardly death in those concentration camps. As the foreign minister has told this House before, Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement initiative is a positive step by the Israeli government towards bringing about the goals of the road map for the Middle East, which the Australian government strongly supports. Likewise, the government welcomed Palestinian President Abbas's commitment to stopping terrorism and incitement to further bloodshed in the context of that disengagement. On these matters, the government believed that it had bipartisan the support for these views. Obviously the comments of the member for Fowler are quite contemptuous of these matters. ",92
122,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Sturt has said, I think that the Leader of the Opposition should immediately discipline Mrs Irwin. He must insist that she apologise for her remarks. She must be required to withdraw them in the House. At the very a least, because he may not be able to do that, he should disassociate himself from those statements, which should not go unchallenged. Ammonium Nitrate",92

129,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the Opposition continues to flout your rulings on preambles. Ms Gillard- Mr SPEAKER ",93
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Manager of Opposition Business, I can rule on this point of order without assistance. As the member for Canning would have noticed, I have called on the Leader of the Opposition to come straight to his question. I call the Leader of the Opposition and ask him to get straight to his question.",93
131,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that a foreign vessel, the Thor Hawk, was trading on the Australian coast last week, carrying dangerous cargoes, including ammonium nitrate. Isn't it the case that this vessel is in such poor condition while in Newcastle, its crane broke, dropping the volatile cargo into the ship's hatch and putting lives at risk? Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that fuel mixed with ammonium nitrate is potentially lethal and that the ship's engineer did not even know how to attach the fuel line when the vessel was refuelled in Gladstone? Given the complacent attitude of the transport minister displayed in his answer to the last question from the opposition, why should any Australian trust the Howard government to keep us safe from a terrorist act or accident involving ammonium nitrate?",93
132,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am not aware of the detail of the circumstances that he refers to in his question, but I can assure the members of the opposition and the Australian people that the coalition government is absolutely focused on keeping Australia and all Australians safe and secure both at home and abroad. Building and Construction Industry",93
133,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on the government's measures to reform the building and construction industry? How will the industry and home buyers benefit from these reforms?,93
134,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform him that today I was delighted to announce the appointment of the Hon. John Lloyd as the first Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. Mr Lloyd brings a long background of involvement in industrial relations at the state level as well as the Commonwealth level, most recently as a senior deputy president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to this role. What the establishment of the ABCC in that, volves is the culmination of a four-year process commencing with the royal commission under Mr Justice Cole, which established a clear and undeniable case for a comprehensive clean-up of the building and construction industry. The Econtech report of a few years ago showed that the benefit of cleaning up the unlawful practices in the commercial building and construction industry could be worth up to $2.3 billion to the Australian economy, yet the ALP has opposed every single measure that the government has put forward in an endeavour to do this. We have had some more examples today in the media. Yesterday the Western Australian Assistant Secretary of the CFMEU, Joe Macdonald, was convicted of assaulting two managers of a Perth building site after he attempted to gain unauthorised entryanother example of this sort of behaviour. Then we have seen another report where the full bench of the Federal Court ruled that the Victorian government, having resisted providing documents to the Building Industry Task Force for some 2½ years-at a cost of some tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to Victorian taxpayers-must hand over documents in relation to an investigation into allegations that it manipulated a government tender process to award contracts to a company that was favoured by the CFMEU. This is serious. This is an allegation of a deliberate manipulation of a government contract so that it did not go to a company that employed non-unionists in relation to this tender. The point of this is that, if a ment can succumb to union pressure, what hope have the little subcontractors out on the building sites around Australia? It is another example of why the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is long overdue. When it comes into operation from the beginning of October this year it might finally bring about a change in the culture and the behaviour in the commercial building sector in Australia. What this shows once again is that this side of the chamber, this side of politics in Australia, is about law abiding and productive building and construction sites in Australia and that the Labor Party, in fighting this tooth and nail, year after year, stands for the protection of the rackets and the rorts that go on in the building and construction sector. That is a reality. Mr Crean-Rubbish! It is not a reality and you know it!",93
135,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham knows it because they were not prepared to do a thing about it. Mr Crean-Tell the truth!,94
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham is warned!,94
137,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Only this government has been prepared to do something about it. What they want to protect is the thuggery and the intimidation that goes on within this industry-the sort of thuggery and intimidation where, in order to get access to a building site, we have had instances of the building and construction section of the CFMEU saying that you have to pay $1,000 for a number of T-shirts in order to get access to a building and construction site. Mr Costello-T-shirts?",94
138,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"T-shirts. Speaking of T shirts, before anybody rushes out to get the Mark Latham T-shirt and cap: it was taken state governoff the web site at 2.43! Veterans Affairs",94
139,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Can the minister confirm that she received correspondence from the member for Blair earlier this year about her approach to compensation for service personnel affected by the RAAF's F111 deseal-reseal program? Did the member for Blair advise you in the letter that ‘the regime of support now proposed is an insult' and ‘unless this regime is corrected and replaced quickly the defence community will have been ripped off again'? When will the minister cease misleading these people, who have served their country well, on their real prospects of compensation? Will you now reconsider this totally inadequate scheme?",94
140,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I did receive a letter from the member for Blair. However, I would like to refer to his request and his statement that the ex gratia payments for F111 desealers-resealers are inadequate. He may be aware that the announcement was for $40,000 ex gratia for those who had the most effect from the environmental hazard and $10,000 for those who had a lesser effect. By 15 September we had received 616 claims for the ex gratia payments. Evidently, those who are affected believe that the claims are worth making. I would also like to inform the member for Oxley that that is not the only amount that these people are entitled to if they have had illness or injury due to their Defence Force service. In fact, for somebody who has had a severe illness as a result of their defence service, such as Parkinson's disease-for instance, a 50-year-old person expected to live perhaps to 75 yearsMr Ripoll-What about desealersresealers? That's the whole point.",94
141,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-These people are desealers-resealers. Somebody like that would be entitled to a lump sum, including fortnightly payments, of $596,000. Were they to die, their widow would be entitled to an amount of $247,837. So the amounts are not insignificant. Mr Ripoll interjecting",95
142,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Oxley has already asked his question.,95
143,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-Let me comment on what the Labor Party said about resealers-desealers. Your party was asked a question when it was in government and this was the response from the minister assisting. Mr Ripoll- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question was very specific. I did not ask for any alternative views or about what the Labor Party did. I was just seeking a clarification",95
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the minister.,95
145,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-The then assisting Minister for Defence was asked: ... what danger does close contact with such solvent pose to human health ... in regard to F111 reseal-deseal aircraft? The then minister assisting, Minister Evans, said: It is considered that the safety measures described at 3b. above fulfil this purpose. In other words, that they had been fully taken account of. You did nothing as a party when in government about resealers-desealers. I also want to comment on other Labor individuals who have made reference to the ex gratia payment. I read from a letter dated 25 August. It says: The Queensland government supports the decision of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to make a lump sum ex gratia payment to all Defence personnel and contractors. Tom Barton, Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations. The reality is that you as a Labor Party did nothing in government. Now we have come out with an ex gratia payment and even the Queensland government supports it.",95
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before calling the next questioner, I remind the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that the use of ‘you' and ‘your' is highly discouraged. Education: Literacy",95
147,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Is the minister aware of concerns about English standards for Australian school leavers? What is the government doing to improve standards in our schools? Are there any alternative policies?",95
148,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and for proudly being a member of a government committed to high national standards in schooling. I awoke this morning to a headline in the Australian newspaper entitled ‘Students unable to write a sentence'. The story is that there has been a survey of 660 Australian Defence Force Academy students and it reports that intelligent students are graduating from high school and entering university with writing skills so poor that they are not able to structure a sentence. In fact, the ADFA Associate Dean of Education, Stephen Yeomans, is reported as saying: What I particularly notice is improper sentence construction, inappropriate or no punctuation, lack of conjunctives, misuse of apostrophes, poor spelling and so on. The average Australian would probably think that Australia's minister for education would be shocked to read such a headline and to read such a study. The only thing that is shocking about it is that I am not shocked; in fact, I am not even surprised. In this particular study-we are talking about students who achieved a tertiary entrance rank of 80 or more-only one in six of those students could achieve 70 per cent accuracy in basic grammar. Just to put that into some context, there are students who have been accepted into Australian universities this yearMr Snowdon interjecting",95
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lingiari is warned!,96
150,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to train as teachers, with tertiary entrance scores in the low 50s. In the Saturday Age, the front-page story was ‘VCE English “dumbed down”: one book a year could be enough under “English lite”'students would have to read only one single book in year 12. I would also point out to the House-and I am happy to table these-that I have three examples of minimum passing results by students in the year 12 Higher School Certificate in New South Wales. One student, for a 40-minute essay question, was able to write only 63 words. That essay included spelling mistakes and 21 of the words repeated the question. That student passed year 12 advanced English in New South Wales and presumably now is undertaking a university program. The government is doing three things to address this. The first is that very shortly I will be receiving the report of the national inquiry into reading. I am informed by the chairman that 30 per cent of Australian children are leaving the education system essentially malfunctioning, as far as their basic literacy and ability to read is concerned. The second is that the member for Cowper, very ably supported by the member for Port Adelaide, is conducting an inquiry into the training of teachers in Australian universitiesand there will be major reform. The third is that the government is driving an Australian certificate of education. We are determined through the Australian Council of Education to drive a nationally-consistent high-quality year 12 qualification. I also inform the House that I will be commissioning some independent work to assess the academic rigour of English, chemistry, physics and mathematics at the year 12 level throughout Australia and I will be making it available to communities so that they can compare the standards in one state with another. The battle for international competitiveness is going to be fought and won or lost in Australia's schools. It is not just about the fulfilment of human potential in our children; it is about Australia's place in the world and the standards that we expect. Workplace Relations",96
151,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister confirm that it is government policy that all sole parents who can work should work, even if they are working for little or no financial gain? Does the minister stand by his statement of 25 August that it is government policy for parents to take home as little as $3.88 an hour before they have even paid for child care and other work costs? I refer the minister to a statement made by the Prime Minister on 2 June that parents will not be required to work for ‘a very low or negative financial gain' and I ask him: who is right-the minister or the Prime Minister?",96
152,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both the Prime Minister and I are right. I say to the member for Sydney that, as I said the other day, the government believe there are considerable benefits in people being able to work where they are capable of working. We believe that far too many people have been locked out of the economic life of this country. For example, something like 700,000 children in Australia are growing up in jobless households. That is unacceptable, and that is why the government are putting in place some changes in the Welfare to Work measures. In the past the welfare system has been based on the proposition that either people could work full time or they could not work at all. Today there are many people in Australia who work part time and we believe that, if a person is capable of part-time employment, then there should be some obligation to do that. If they do that and work for 15 hours as required at the normal award classification wages for adults, that effectively means that a sole parent on the minimum wage for 15 hours a week will have $484.24 a week to take home. This compares to a sole parent pension recipient who does not work who receives $58 a week less. This is effectively about saying that we are going to give those people an opportunity to be in the economic life of this country and that we are going to do something about stopping the intergenerational poverty which is caused by allowing the current situation to honourable member and her colleagues on the other side of the table were interested in helping out people in that situation, they would get behind these measures. Aged Care",97
153,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister advise the House how the Howard government will further protect residents of aged care homes who have paid an accommodation bond?,97
154,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Barker for his question and acknowledge his interest in aged care issues in his electorate. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians have peace of mind while living in aged care homes. Today I announced new measures to strengthen existing protections around accommodation bonds. There will be a new prudential scheme which will strengthen financial management of accommodation bonds, and there will be a guarantee scheme that will ensure that bond balances are repaid in full. Under the prudential scheme approved providers will be required to comply with three prudential standards to enhance and improve the financial management of the bond holdings. Under the guarantee scheme, in the event that there is a default by a provider through bankruptcy or liquidation and there is default in repaying the bond, the government will step in and repay that bond to the resident or their families and then proceed to recover the debt and costs from the provider or, if necessary, to levy the aged care industry. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians have peace of mind while living in residential care. We are providing an assurance to all residents and their families that their bond go on. If the balances are secure. Mr Vaile- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

I can inform the Leader of the Opposition that I have been advised that none of the staff in my office nor in the Prime Minister's office contacted ASIC on the days that he asked about. Workplace Relations FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (3.04 pm)- Mr Speaker, I wish to add to a response I gave in the House yesterday to a question from the member for Bonner.",98
158,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed. FRAN BAILEY-The member for Hunter challenged me to substantiate my response. I tabled the full transcript and today I table the DVD of that interview. I advise the House that four minutes into the interview is the relevant section where the member for Hunter reaffirms his support for reforming unfair dismissals. NA House of Representatives: Dress Code,98
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Yesterday the Chief Opposition Whip asked me a question about dress standards for the chamber galleries. As a matter of routine, staff in the Serjeant-at-Arms' office respond to queries about what clothing is acceptable for visitors in the galleries by saying that it is not acceptable to display political slogans or anything else that could be seen to constitute a protest in the galleries. The Serjeant-at-Arms has advised me that no-one in that office has ever been asked whether it would be acceptable for a large group of visitors to wear into the galleries specialist work clothing with clear purpose of drawing attention to the group. Were this question to be asked, the staff would respond by saying that such clothing would not be acceptable. The rule against protest action in the galleries is long standing and serves to maintain the dignity of the House and its proceedings. The rule is a statement of principle, for, as the honourable member would appreciateand I think all members would appreciate-it would be impossible to have a list of every item of clothing and example of behaviour which would be inappropriate in the galleries. As all honourable members would know, the presumption is that persons attending in the galleries of the chamber do so to observe the proceedings of the House. It is not appropriate for any persons in the galleries to engage in behaviour which would be likely to draw attention to themselves or to disturb other observers in the galleries. In the particular case raised by the Chief Opposition Whip, I understand that it was the intention of a group of firefighters visiting the galleries to wear their specialist protective clothing with large reflective panels on the chest and leg areas. I appreciate that all members of the group complied with the request to remove the outer specialist clothing before they entered the gallery. I believe it would be unacceptable behaviour for a large group of persons attending question time to wear into a gallery clothing which, by its very purpose, is intended to draw attention to the wearer. It would be very difficult to interpret this action as anything other than a protest or disturbance in the gallery of the chamber. I, like all members, heartily welcome the attendance in the chamber galleries of visitors to this place, including firefighters, who are able to attend and observe parliamentary proceedings. Nevertheless, it would be inapthe propriate to permit any behaviour whose purpose is to divert attention away from the parliamentary proceedings.",98
160,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, on that point: the interpretation of that ruling would be that if a member of the Australian Defence Force walked into the gallery wearing a camouflage uniform as opposed to their dress uniform, they would in fact offend that ruling.",99
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his observation. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to read the whole statement and I think it will become clear to him what the ruling is.  Speaker, I sincerely thank you for reporting back to the House. I would not wish in any way to reflect on the ruling you have just given, but I might take up one of the opportunities you extend to members to further discuss things.",99
162,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"In relation to the ruling that you have just given about distincgovernment tive and particular work clothing, and given the context in which it has been referred to, those uniforms that many people wear as distinctive and unique work clothing is designed specifically to draw attention to their House. uniqueness. That does not simply include individual military personnel who may come here from time to time either in their dress uniform or in their camouflage uniform; from time to time it also includes large numbers of military personnel who come here precisely in their uniform, as a group, to draw attention to their presence as a group. In the context of the statement you have just made, will you look at that situation and consider whether or not your statement requires some adjustment?",99

176,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, on two occasions this week in the context of the government's legislation to fully privatise Telstra and the National Party, I have been required to withdraw the word ‘bribe'-once when the member for Page, Mr Causley, was in the chair, despite the fact that it is a word he has used himself; and on a second occasion when you were in the chair this morning. Mr Speaker, you made a ruling in respect of these matters yesterday, as recorded in the daily Hansard at page 59, where you refer to the atmosphere in the chamber at the time being important. This morning, again in that same context of the government's legislation and the National Party, when the member for Mackellar, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop was in the chair, my colleague the member for Hotham formally moved a second reading amendment which stated at paragraph (2)(h): … the bribe used to guarantee the sale of Telstra will consign regional, rural and remote Australians to second rate telecommunications services in the future. My question of you, Mr Speaker, is whether it is appropriate to use the word ‘bribe' in the written form but not in the oral form, or whether it is the case that the atmosphere or the ambience of the chamber is only satisfied when Bronnie is in the chair.",100

Mr Speaker, the point that you just made is a valid one except that it goes further: the word must be attached, as no doubt the Clerk will advise, to an individual.

When the Minister for Education, Science and Training got up and made his remarks here, he implied that the material was from an immediate examination-a current state of affairs-yet it appears that the documents he tabled are from 2001. That is from four years ago, not immediately. This would be a clear case of misleading the parliament. Given that the date is there, it would have to be said to be deliberately misleading. In those circumstances, of course, it would be a serious matter indeed.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",103
207,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Trust in our parliamentary institutions is something that we all should value. There have been a number of occurrences in recent years which have meant people are starting to distrust their parliamentary institutions, and I think it is paramount that we all recognise that and try to do something about it. Whether it be in relation to issues like ‘chil- occurring. dren overboard', the Iraq war, the drought and the misrepresentations that occurred there, the free trade agreement, Telstra or climate change, the information that is transferred within this chamber and the other chamber is, from time to time, found later on not to be correct. That leads to a situation where the general populace do not trust the institution and do not trust the political process. Irrespective of who is in government, who is in opposition and who did what in the past, I think that is starting to erode the facilities of government itself. So I ask that we as members of parliament take this issue seto riously and try and do something about it. Just in recent weeks, and even today, the trust in the parliament was abused. The Deputy Prime Minister, for instance, said today: ‘There has been, in terms of the Telstra sale, a $3.1 billion investment in telecommunications infrastructure.' That is not correct. What has happened is that there has been a $1.1 billion investment in broadband and mobile services and a fund of $2 billion set aside, from which the interest will be used to invest in telecommunications infrastructure. That is not $3.1 billion. That is misleading the the public. When they find out the truth, the public's view will be that that they have been misled by the parliament. There have been a number of issues in relation to Telstra, such as the term ‘up to scratch'. A lot of people who vote assumed that in this case the National Party would abide by the terms on which it went to the last election-that it would not sell Telstra until it was ‘up to scratch', until all the recommendations of the Estens report were in place. That has not happened, and the National Party has voted for the full sale, the full privatisation, of Telstra. People are wondering why and how they can trust their parliamentarians when that sort of activity is Another phrase, ‘down the track', came into the parliament in the last week, used by Senator Minchin. Things will be right ‘down the track'. They are not up to scratch nowwe have been shown by the new CEO and others that there has been a massive underinvestment et cetera-but apparently, out of this package of $3.1 billion, which is really only $1.1 billion and the interest from $2 billion, things will be right ‘down the track'. When you look at that, though, you find that the interest from that $2 billion fund is $100 million-and those are the words of Mark Vaile, the Deputy Prime Minister, not mine. One hundred million dollars is less than the $125 million that the government has been providing annually over the last eight years-a $25 million reduction in expenditure on telecommunications infrastructure. And here we had again today a lack of openness when the Deputy Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister, said $3.1 billion is being invested. We have had the absurdity with the National Farmers Federation in the last few days. The farming community right across Australia, in all the surveys that have been done, have indicated that the service is not up to scratch, that they are opposed to the sale, that the Estens recommendations have not been fully implemented, that Sol Trujillo has said that there has been massive underinvestment and that particularly the underground infrastructure is in a mess-definitely not up to scratch. We saw the absurdity the other day of the President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, coming into this place and suddenly reversing the decision, and the outrage that has been expressed by the farming community about that. I questioned the President of the National Farmers Federation as to why that had happened. In a press release, the National Farmers Federation said that they had received a guarantee from the government that there would be pricing parity with telephone services and broadband. When questioned in the parliament yesterday, the Acting Prime Minister could not find where in the legislation that guarantee was delivered. In the Senate yesterday afternoon, Senator Conroy questioned the minister responsible, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and she categorically said that there was no guarantee in terms of broadband services. That is in the Hansard. These are the sorts of things about which the community is being misled. There is no guarantee in the legislation; it was mentioned in a speech by the minister. I remember, when the goods and services tax was introduced, the National Party once again standing up and suggesting that, based on the price, there would be a degree of inequity in the application of the goods and services tax between city people and country people. Mr Fitzgibbon-And there is.",103
208,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is, as the member for Hunter said. The government put in place the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme to compensate for the inequity. Where is it now? It has gone, but the inequity has not gone. The application of the goods and services tax has not gone, but the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme has gone. The same brand of the same parliament that instituted it, for good reasons, has decided, ‘That's long enough; it can go,' and that is exactly what will happen with Telstra: ‘That's long enough; it can go.' It will drift away. I questioned the President of the National Farmers Federation as to why there was a reversal. Some of the state organisations were very angry about that decision. I made certain comments to the press that the President of the National Farmers Federation-it was no secret-was contemplating a political career and considering seats in the north of New South Wales and southern Queensland. He has not denied that. However, a strange person has come out of left field; the member for Gwydir has entered this debate. The member for Gwydir, in an article by Michael Thomson, was reported as saying: There is no deal for Peter Corish. There can be no deal. No-one is in a position to offer such a deal. The most powerful man in the National Party could not have arranged such a thingfor him. Even if he were to run, he's got to win preselection. It will be a very strong field, indeed. six people have indicated they want to run; it'll will be a battle royal. I did not mention the National Party to Michael Thomson when I talked about Peter Corish. I did not mention the seat of Gwydir. All I said was that it was no secret that this man was contemplating a political career in southern Queensland or northern New South Wales. That career may well be as an Independent in New England. The former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party seems to know quite a bit more about this man that he has defended. When it comes to openness and frankness, they are the sorts of things that the community has a right to know. To add insult to injury, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, appeared in a radio program yesterday afternoon on 2AY in Albury, and I happened to be on the same program talking about Telstra. This was after Senator Joyce had made his decision, not by way of voting but by publicly announcing it. About an hour after that, Mr Corish said that the National Farmers Federation did not support the full sale of Telstra. I thought, ‘That's a bit absurd; that is not what he was saying the other day.' He then went on to say that the NFF did support the bills before the House. I have had involvement with the National Farmers Federation over many years. I was one of those who organised busloads of people to come down to Canberra to rally against former Prime Minister Hawke. Mr Snowdon-How could you?",104
209,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was easy, and a lot of people came to rally against the indecencies of government in those days and to rally for honesty in government. To see the National Farmers Federation dragged to this all-time low and then purport to represent the farming community of Australia is quite disturbing. I have had phone call after phone call from Five or people who are involved in the associated organisations. I was on the general council of the New South Wales Farmers Association, and I was on the Grains Council of Australia. They have become puppets of government as well in respect of their attitude to ethanol. Some of these representative bodies have to make up their minds if they are to have any credibility in parliament, irrespective of who is in government. They have to start to represent the issues that their constituents believe in, and that is a broad reflection on the political process. We saw the farce in relation to free trade. The President of the National Farmers Association was involved in that well. There were concrete guarantees, when they left here, that sugar would be in, that there would be very strict rules in relation to open access to trade and that the beef industry would be entitled. A few words from Mark Vaile in the United States and that all fell apart. There is a whole range of issues on which we need more openness. We saw the development of national competition policy, and how that was underwritten, over the years. The two major parts of national competition policy on water reform were about a market being developed, which has partially been done, and property rights being recognised. It is 10 years on and they still have not been recognised. We have had all this palaver about how great it is with the bilaterals, the intergovernmental agreements et cetera. The people have been misled. Those people who have been sitting out there waiting for their property rights to be recognised when an environmental change occurs have been misled once again. There was Regional Partnerships-no wonder people are cynical about the political process. I hope the committee that is currently looking at that program makes recommendations to the Auditor-General, because I think there is a number of instances there where it is far greater than the traditional pork-barrelling that we would all accept to a certain degree-we might not agree with it on the day but it is part of the political process. But it seems to me that there may well be some corrupt activity in relation to where some of these funds have ended up and whether they have even been found. That might need a further inquiry. I have talked about the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, ethanol, Iraq and other issues. In terms of the Telstra debate and political representation, I will be working to get people into this parliament who actually represent the people who they purport to represent. I will be part of it and I will be proud to be part of it. I encourage other members of parliament to stand up for the people they represent, irrespective of what side of parliament they are on or whether or not they are in a party. It is about time, particularly in relation to regional and country issues, that we started to stand up for those people. We have seen this classic example, an example greater than any other that I can remember, where country people have said to this parliament and all their parliamentarians by way of survey and carrier pigeon that they do not want Telstra sold. (Time expired)",105
210,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was expecting to hear something from the honourable member for New England, but what he said had nothing to do with the matter of public importance; it was more about getting the dirt off the honourable member for New England's liver. Quite frankly, that is all that we heard. If we want to talk about honesty and integrity in government and having people look up to politicians, I dare say that we have to start here. Most of it is generated from this particular chamber and from statements made here that are not entirely true. It does not just include this side of the House or that side of the House; it includes Independent members as well. This motion today is not so much about honesty or openness in government; it is more about relevance deprivation syndrome. Quite frankly, that is what it is all about. The honourable member for New England has been in parliament for a number of years: he was in the New South Wales parliament for a number of years-he was there when I was there-and he has been here for a number of years. Except for one term in New South Wales when he had the balance of power with the coalition government, he has achieved absolutely nothing in politics. He is bitter about that, and that is where most of these problems that he has at the present time come from. If people do not entirely accept the view of the member for New England, then of course there must be some ulterior motive, he thinks. We just heard a spray on the National Farmers Federation. I will say something about this Telstra debate because I think it is relevant to the whole process. There is no doubt in my mind that, as far as the people of Australia are concerned, the sooner we get some competition in this field the better. There have been many articles in the papers over the last few days showing how far behind we are in Australia compared to countries that have competition. Yet the honourable member for New England, the honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable member for Calare and those over on the opposition side would prefer to see us live in the Dark Ages. They do not want to see some of this competition. They then say: ‘Oh well, the government are not being honest. They are not being honest with the people.' As far as honesty is concerned, we are saying it exactly as it is. The honourable member for New England goes on about the services of Telstra, that it is not ‘up to scratch', as he puts it. If any electorate in New South Wales has benefited from the billion dollars that has been spent by our government over the last few years, it has been the electorate of New England. We still have the funds available to continue that. The member for New England is never honest enough to say that to the Australian people-that is the issue here today. When the member for New England had the balance of power in New South Wales, I remember one big statement he made over an issue in his electorate where he was looking for something from the government. He said that Greiner came along with a brown paper bag in his hand. That is what he said in New South Wales. It is a little bit duplicitous on the one hand to accuse people when on the other hand he has said similar things himself. Let us have a look at the openness of our government. I have heard those opposite and the Independents talk about the GST debate. I have also heard the cries of ‘never, ever' from over there about the Prime Minister saying at a previous time that he did not want to have a goods and services tax. But one thing I will say is that we went to an election with that as a policy. If anyone has ever fought a hard election, I can tell you that was a hard election because we were being open with the people about what was going to happen. The GST did not go to our government; it was for the benefit of Australia so that the state governments could get a growth tax to provide the services that they need in their states. It was nothing to do with us. We almost committed harakiri in the name of the country. If that is not honest, I do not know what honest is. It is the same when it comes to the words that are thrown around this chamber about ‘children overboard'. Have a look at the Senate inquiry. While at that particular time the Senate inquiry showed that the words may not have been used, children were thrown overboard only two or three days before. It was proven to be a policy of these people and what they were doing, yet in this parliament the Labor Party, in particular, try and distort the whole debate by just picking a few words out here and there instead of being absolutely honest about the whole debate. As I said, this is not the real reason behind this matter of public importance-the real reason has nothing to do with the words on the paper; it is to try and get the dirt off the liver of the member for New England. Mr Windsor-Tell us about the Fuel Sales Grant Scheme.",106
211,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We will have a look at this fuel sales tax because it is something that the member for New England has been on about for a long time. It was not this government's policy; it was to get the GST through the Senate by a deal done with the Democrats. If the member for New England were patient, he might see something in the future, but he is never patient to see what might happen. That deal had to be done because the Democrats had this complicated that policy. I was not very happy about it at the time either, but if we wanted to get the legislation through there were a few things that we had to agree to. There were a few compromises that we had to make. We did not have the luxury of being an Independent, sitting back there being irrelevant and throwing your opinion around the place. When you are in government, you have to make some decisions and you sometimes have to make some compromises. But you make those decisions and those compromises in the interests of the country. This whole debate about Telstra shows a lack of vision by the Independents, in particular, and the Labor Party. There is no vision to see where we are going in the future with telecommunications. In fact, I suppose they could almost be classed as troglodytes, because the fact is that, if you want to see where we are going in the future, you will find that it is moving at a rapid rate, because we have competition. Only yesterday I noticed an article in the newspaper backing up what I said in my speech on Telstra the other day. It said that we can now give broadband across an electricity line. It is being rolled out in Tasmania. There is a second network-competition-and yet we are hearing this rubbish from the Independents that somehow or other the world is going to collapse. I can assure you that we are going to get better services, not because we have had any vision from those opposite but because people were prepared to sit down, have a look at the options and work through this. I also heard the member for New England mention climate change. I can only suspect that he was talking about the Kyoto protocol. I would be absolutely amazed and absolutely surprised if the member for New England were prepared to sell Australian jobs overseas. Mr Windsor-It's called fine particle emissions.",107
212,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for New England has had his turn.,108
213,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We now have the idiot fringe over here talking about how ethanol will change that. Let me put it to you this way: if these fuels were competitive with oil at the present time, they would be in the marketplace. You hear all the ranting and the raving, but go and have a close look at the cost of these fuels. If they were competitive, they would be in the marketplace. I have heard the member for Kennedy before on ethanol and sugar. Let me say this to you, Mr Speaker: I will not be growing sugar for ethanol because you cannot make enough money out of it. That is just an absolutely nonsensical argument. With regard to the Kyoto protocol, obviously the member for New England is prepared to say, ‘We'll cut back on all our emissions, destroy our opportunities to develop and destroy our jobs in this country so that we can let undeveloped countries take over all those jobs and all those opportunities.' I do not think that is fair. The government's policy to reduce emissions overall and to give some encouragement for world's best technology in underdeveloped countries is the right one. Have we been dishonest about that? We have been quite open about it; we have told everyone exactly where we stand on that. So I think that that particular position is absolute nonsense. We hear a lot about these issues but I have yet to hear one word that I could believeand I did not hear it in this debate-that showed where this government had not been completely honest with the Australian people. The issues here are the fudging of the edges. I suppose that is politics, but to make the claim that someone has been deliberately dishonest is a dishonest statement. Mr Windsor-Where are the property rights for water?",108
214,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for New England wants to have a second debate here, apparently, because he does not like being told a different story and to hear another opinion. We had the situation in which he made all sorts of allegations about the grants to Regional Partnerships, but when it was asked that they be backed up in the Senate they were not backed up at all. Mr Windsor interjecting",108
215,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for New England was heard in silence.,109
216,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you have a close look at these grants, you will see that they are right across the board and not just in government seats. If you want to talk about rural Australia, you must ask: who represents rural Australia? It is the government members who represent rural Australia, so, naturally, there are going to be grants in seats in rural Australia, more government members will be involved than opposition members; they represent Sydney and Melbourne. Obviously that is going to happen. But then you make the claim that something is dishonest about this. Is it any wonder that people have concerns about it when the member for New England is out there throwing the mud around? Obviously people will start to believe some of this. I think it was Goebbels who once said, ‘Tell them often enough and they'll believe it,' and that is certainly the attitude that has been adopted. I would reject completely the allegations that have been made against the government in this debate, because, quite frankly, I have never served under a government that has been so open to the Australian people. We have gone to elections making it very clear where we stood. The member for New England talked about Iraq. If you want to go back to where the Iraq situation all started, the United Nations believed, Mr Butler believed and the British and Americans believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We are all very wise in hindsight when we start to throw things around, but, at the time, the world believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He was offered the chance of having inspectors in there and he refused. But now we have these wonderful people who, in hindsight, say, ‘You were wrong.' Hindsight is great, isn't it? But where were they leading? Where were they with their ideas? All they can do is sit back and snipe. That is their only ambition, and that is their only use in life-to sit back and snipe. The member for New England has been doing it now for a number of years. His absolute obsession with some of these things has to be seen to be believed. Yes, he missed if out on preselection for The Nationals. He stood as an Independent and won the seatcongratulations-but, since then, he has been bitter. That is where the whole thing comes from-the whole attack and all the issues. If something is going to be put up by the government, especially by The Nationals, he will oppose it; he will do anything to undermine it. We have heard it today. He wants to stand members in seats-that is not new. He has been out there before, standing Independent members in seats, but they have not won. I think that one or two seats went to Independents in certain areas, but then they came back again. That issue has been out there for a long time. I saw in the paper this morning that the member for New England was gloating and saying, ‘This is the end of The Nationals.' Let me tell the member for New England: as people realise that the policies that have been put in place are going to benefit those in country areas and as people realise what not just The Nationals but Liberal backbenchers from the country areas fought for in Telstra-to see that services in those nonprofitable areas were protected-they will understand. We will continue to roll out those services. They will also see the competition that is going to come into the marketplace. They will see that the prediction of doom and gloom by the member for New England and others was wrong. I have to say to you, Mr Speaker, that they will be grateful, because at the present time families in Australia are saving $750 a year because of the changes that have come into place in telecommunications, and they will save more in the future. Those in the isolated areas that are served by the member for Kennedy, for instance, now get subsidised satellite, and they have never had a better service. (Time expired)",109
217,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Page, in saying that services from Telstra are good-well, I am not saying that they are good; I should say that they are acceptable. It has never been my position to condemn the services from Telstra. But if they are acceptable then why are you selling Telstra? If something is not broken, why do you want to fix it? Like me, the honourable member for Page has been a long-serving minister in a government. My policy was always: if it ain't broke, don't fix it, because we have enough broken things out there that do need fixing. I admire the member for Page in many ways, as I have said in this House on many occasions, but I cannot resile from my duty to point out to the House the statement by the government that they are going to provide $3,000 million to meet the requirements of rural Australia. I can skite; it is open get out there and skite, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, because, with all due respect, in sharp contrast to what you just said previously-that we have achieved nothing-if we were not here, if I had been beaten at the last election or the election before last or if the honourable member for New England were not here, we would not have lobbied the senators, and Telstra would have been sold the last time the government wanted to sell it. It would have been sold and there would not have been the $3,000 million that you people are claiming. I will come back to the $3,000 million, because we are talking about truthfulness, openness and honesty here. According to Telstra Country Wide, last year they put $231 million into new services. According to government papers, there was $280 million put into Networking the Nation and there was a further $163 million spent this year by Telstra Country Wide. If you add those up, you get a figure of $700 million. If Telstra had been sold, there would have been no $700 million there-and it would have been sold if we had not lobbied the Independent and small party senators. Three of them had made statements which at best were equivocal and, at worse, certainly indicated that they were going to vote for the sale of Telstra. That was until we did the heavy lobbying. I do not want to or have time to go into the detail, but it would have been gone. If you people are standing here today skiting about securing the $3,000 million, you should remember that there would have been no $3,000 million. It would have been sold three years ago. So if there is anyone to be thanked for this, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, by your own arguments it is the three gentlemen, the three amigos, sitting in this part of the House. Let me move on. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you said that we were ineffective. to me to The honourable member for New England and I secured money before the last election campaign which would make maidens blush. If they had been National Party seats, they would have got considerably less. They would have got the same as all the other National Party seats. But, because Mr Anderson, the then Deputy Prime Minister, wanted to indulge his own personal hatreds and vitriol, largesse was poured into our electorates like we had never seen before. But if we had just held up our hands and voted with the government-‘Gofer, send a rubber stamp and a photograph to this place'-then there would have been none of the largesse pouring in before the last election. I most certainly thank the government for the $227 million they poured into Kennedy in discretionary funds on the eve of the last election. I am not in a position to disclose what happened in the banana industry, but suffice to say that the imported bananas are not in Australia at the present moment. We still live in fear and terror that they are going to come in, but that was put off because of my actions, and I do not resile from saying that or apologise to anyone for saying it. The beef quotas came out and they were enormously detrimental to the grinding beef market of Australia. They helped the plate beef market, but they were dreadful for us. Again, I cannot outline what actions I took, but suffice to say that the quota arrangements were changed. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you are a very skilled person who knows a very great deal about the sugar industry, but you are not up to speed on this. With regard to the Brazilian ethanol program, the document I hold was produced by the Brazilian government and Unica-which you would be familiar with-and is to be presented at a Queensland seminar on ethanol. Page 9 says that, regarding the cane sector in Brazil, ‘Ethanol makes gasoline cheaper. There is no pure gasoline in the Brazilian market today.' There is E25 at US90c; and E100, which is pure ethanol, at US50c a litre. Working that back into Australian currency, the good people we have in the library tell me that it works out to 66c a litre. I am sorry, but the figure 76c a litre. When you add 12c a litre, which the government is applying in tax on ethanol-it is the only government in the world to apply a tax on ethanol-it comes out to 78c a litre. Then if you apply the excise regime on petrol it comes out to 114c a litre. I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, but I have to tell you that it is 78c a litre. That is what we should be able to buy it at. There is a transport and retail margin, but that goes on both fuels: petrol and ethanol. The comparable figures, before the retail and transport margin goes in, are 78c and 114c. They are not my figures; they are the figures from Brazil that were presented in Cairns. There were members of the government present in Cairns, Townsville and also at the big international seminar that was held in Brisbane. I was quoting the ethanol production figures recently at 600 litres. In fact, in one of the papers that was presented, they were still on 600 litres. That was corrected by the Brazilians, as I was. The Brazilians said: ‘We are now getting 700 to 800 litres out of ethanol.' But even without that, I am simply quoting the figures that the Brazilian government has produced. If the three amigos are not here, then every time we deregulate something everyone in this place will be for it. Everyone in this place is a free marketeer. The government did not invent this; in fact, they were also-rans. There was hardly anything left to privatise by the time they came in; it was all done by the Labor government and the policies have not changed. But the only three people with different policies in this place are the three amigos. We do not believe in the policies of free markets. Labor have already established that they do; they were in government for 12, 13 or 15 yearswhatever it was-and they privatised and deregulated everything that they could lay in Australia is their hands on. This government took over what was left-deregulation of the dairy industry, for example. I do not accuse you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Your position was made very clear to everybody, and there were other people who agreed with you. But that was what the government did. I am ashamed to say that at that time. I was part of the government. I made a decision to no longer be part of the problem. Maybe I am not part of the solution, but I am most certainly no longer part of the problem. For those that are in government, I am sorry to tell you that you are part of the problem. I had a lot to do with fighting corruption in Queensland and the most serious ramifications that occurred in that state. I am very familiar with how these things work. The payouts that were made in the fishing industry bear very close scrutiny. I give warning that I am scrutinising those payouts. I am scrutinising where the money flowed and how it flowed. The people where the citrus canker outbreak occurred were foreign people. They had special arrangements with the government that have never been denied in the newspapers or in this place. The citrus canker came in and there was a $5,000 donation not to party funds, where it had to be made public, but to a research foundation. That is where all this money is laundered. All parties do that; I am not singling out the National Party. When you have been in politics for 32 years like I have, your antenna goes up when something is done with indecent haste, such as the sale of Telstra. (Time expired)",110
218,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that I am a new member in this place. I have not quite one year of experience, and today is my first opportunity to speak on what we call in this building an MPI. The member for New England brought on the matter of public importance, namely: The necessity for the Government to treat the Australian people with openness and frankness. There is not one person here who could disagree with that statement. I say these words as the member for New England is leaving the room. That statement has been notoriously twisted and turned around. It shows that what underlies the member for New England's actions today is nothing short of hatred. I really mean that. It has been evident. You could see it on his face; you could hear it in his words; you could hear it in the timbre of his voice as he spoke. There were no interruptions from members listening to him-the chair, members on this side of the House or even those from the opposition side. But as the member for Page was taking the opportunity to rebut some of the statements made by the member for New England there was constant interjection, interruption and sniggering and the member for New England made further spurious claims. I bear the member for New England no ill will; I hardly know him. As a new member I have met him a few times; he seems okay, but when he strides into this chamber something quite different confronts everybody in this room. It is worth pointing out to people who may be in the gallery or listening on the broadcast that to raise a matter of public importance it is necessary, when given the opportunity, for the Speaker to identify at least eight members of parliament who stand with the person who is raising the MPI to support the fact that we should have the debate. So today, given the opportunity, eight members stood; in fact, all of the opposition were here right after question time and they all stood in their places. They supported the member for New England in raising this MPI. If it is a matter of public importance, you stand and agree that we should debate this for an hour or an hour and a half. They are all gone.",112
219,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That's not right; I'm here.,112
220,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Rankin has returned, but they all went. The member for New England has gone. He does not want to hear any more; he has had enough; he has had his say. He has raised the MPI, but he has gone. He does not want to hear any critique of what he has had to say.",112
221,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is full of substance, isn't it! Mr Griffin-If you haven't got 10 minutes, just sit down.",113
222,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I would like to be heard. Mr Griffin interjecting,113
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Bass has the call.,113
224,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for New England raised a scattergun of issues claiming that the government had been less that honest, less than open and less than frank. He scattergunned with ‘children overboard'; he threw in Telstra, Iraq and even climate change for good measure, and we still did not get to the bottom of what he meant. He said that these issues and others were starting to erode public confidence in this important institution-not just the government but the parliament. I would have to say that I share some understanding of how people feel, particularly when they watch or listen to question time. I am very aware of this. I hear it in my electorate when I am meeting people. They often mention this-that question time is like a bear pit. People are attacking each other, sometimes personally. Today we heard it from the would be health minister, the member for Lalor, when she was attacking the Acting Prime Minister for taking steps to show some compassion when one of his colleagues was in hospital. I accept that. I understand that question time can be a pretty angry time. It shows us at our worse; I would admit that. But at least it is democracy in action. At least the chair has the opportunity to shut down people who are acting inappropriately, to kick them out they do not accept a warning and to require people to withdraw when they make outrageous statements-such as the time when the chair had to send out the member for New England for what have been proven to be outrageous, unfair, unqualified, unsubstantiated claims of bribery against the then Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Gwydir. What a shame that was and what a disgrace. There is a real arrogance in the member for New England today lecturing people like me on this side-lecturing this chamberabout the need to be open, honest and frank. It is shockingly arrogant. It is also very hypocritical. When he was given the opportunity to make the same statements outside the parliament, he would not do it. He was not prepared to make his claims against John Anderson, the member for Gwydir, outside this chamber-without the protection of the soft green leather chairs and parliamentary privilege. He would not do it. Instead of taking personal responsibility for himself, being accountable for his own actions and explaining to his electorate why he is not even here half the time-and I include question time and voting in divisions in that-he lashes out. As I have said, he is a man filled with hatred and anger. That is a great disappointment to me and I know it is a great disappointment to people all over Australia who have been witness to it. What a shame that instead of taking responsibility for himself he has only one course of action-to enlist the support of the Labor Party in attacking the government. They leave him for dead. He is on his own. They have just used him today as a puppet. Even the member for Rankin has now gone. I hope he comes back. I would like to hear what he has to say. I will listen to him. It is very easy to accuse other people of corruption. That is terribly easy. It is very, if very easy to attribute an improper motive to another person. None of us is perfect. I know I am not. Like so many other people on both sides of the chamber, I appreciate the value of honesty. None of us meets the test all the time. True integrity is living what you believe, living it out-actually demonstrating it. Honesty is saying the truth. I would say that, to a degree, everybody has integrity and honesty. All of us have that. For example, we all tell the truth most of the time. A truly honest person is someone who tells the truth even when it hurts-when it is hard to tell the truth, when they know they have done something wrong and they should give account. That is an honest person. A person with integrity is a person who lives their beliefs when it hurts them, when it costs them. I am not seeing it today. I have not seen it in some of the Independents' actions in my 11 months as the member for Bass. Rather than criticising other people and making virtually criminal accusations against them, I suggest that the member for New England should take account of his own actions. He should recognise that the claims he has made in the past are really claims that can be put up against his own test of not being open, not being frank. He was not prepared to make claims against other people outside this chamber. I suggest that some of the other claims he has made today he would not be prepared to make outside the chamber. When the member for New England says that these actions of the government, which he has virtually made up, are starting to erode trust in government, he is partly right, but he is part of the problem. He is the one who is talking down the positive attributes of, frankly, probably Australia's most honest Prime Minister and his government. The member for Rankin looks as though he has just emptied his stomach over there behind his desk. But the reality is that he is filled with hatred against the Liberal Party in the same way the member for New England is filled with hatred against any member of the National Party. We have heard about the disappointments of the member for New England today. We have heard about that fateful day when he missed out on preselection and then wanted to run as an Independent. Today the member for Kennedy, instead of saying that it is a bribe when somebody negotiates a position with the government and that involves a package of reforms and improvements to infrastructure-rather than saying that, as an Independent he is now taking the credit for Networking the Nation. You cannot have it both ways. This government is an honest government. This government, like me, is not perfect. But do not go lecturing us on being open, frank and accountable to the Australian people when we have demonstrated that we will go to an election with a hard policy and then implement it-not like the Labor Party when it goes to an election with l-a-w law tax cuts and then after the election shuts them down.",113

I did welcome the just completed debate on the matter of public importance about the necessity for the government to treat the Australian people with openness and frankness. The government has failed to do that in the nine long years in which it has ruled this country. The contribution to the matter of public importance from the previous speaker, the member for Bass, was astonishing, to say the least, when he declared that the Prime Minister must be the most honest Prime Minister this country has ever had. The member for Bass is a new member and he may not be fully aware of the document entitled Truth overboard: 27 Lies told by John Howard and counting. I will not go through all of those because",115
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Order! That has nothing to do Report with the bill before the House.,115
233,Dr EMERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I do want to confine myself to the Medicare safety net legislation. In order to do that we will need to set some benchmarks in truth and honesty in government. The Medicare safety net legislation is a formalisation of the breaking of an election promise by this government-the breaking of a promise that it knew before the election that it could not keep but it did not have the honesty to take the Australian people into its confidence and tell them before the election that it would not be able to sustain the Medicare safety net because it was too financially expensive and costs were blowing out. I mentioned that we need to make these judgments against benchmarks set by leaders. That benchmark was set in respect of this government by the Prime Minister of Australia when he was opposition leader. He said on 25 August 1995: Truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and most particularly the health minister knew the truth before the last election. The truth was that the Medicare safety net was unsustainable. The department of finance had advised the finance minister of this fact and obviously that fact was shared with other ministers. Nevertheless, the government proceeded to spend $20 million of taxpayers' money assuring the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would remain intact in full. The Minister for Health and Ageing told the Australian people just before the last election, on 16 September: I absolutely guarantee that the safety net, government has put it into operation, will continue-I absolutely guarantee it. He said in another interview 10 days before that: That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment. We have just had a debate about truth and honesty in government. When the minister was making those statements he was aware that the cost of the Medicare safety net was blowing out and yet he continued to say that this was a promise that would be kept after the election. The government knew that it could not keep that promise; nevertheless, it continued to reassure the Australian people that it would be kept. During question time the same minister unloaded another bucket of vitriol in the Australian parliament, using harsh language but most importantly conveying to the Australian people his hatred and his bitterness. This is not a great day for the Australian Labor Party with the release of the Latham diaries-we know that. Mr Latham has left this parliament a very bitter and disappointed man. But we have in this parliament still a very bitter and disappointed man, and that man is the minister for health. The minister for health is a shadow of his former self-a shell of a man. I remember when I first became a member of parliament in 1998 and the now minister for health had been promoted to a junior portfolio. He used to lumber from the end of the front-bench to the microphone and, to show that he was a really tough guy, he would lay into the Labor Party or anyone else with his vitriol. This man has continued to do that right up to this day, in question time today. He is an embarrassment to the Australian parliament. He is a very bitter and disappointed man. The minister for health should himself consider his position in the Australian paras the liament and consider whether he has any further worthwhile contribution to make to public policy formulation in this country. We are debating a piece of legislation that formalises the breaking of a promise by the Howard government, the breaking of a promise by the minister for health and the breaking of an assurance that he would absolutely guarantee this as a rock solid commitment. But he is completely unabashed. There seems to be no embarrassment on the part of this minister to then get up in question time today as though he were some sort of great orator and great contributor to the parliamentary debates in our great country. He is not. He is a very bitter and disappointed man. His ambitions have been thwarted by none other than himself, because he has proven time and time again that he is a stranger to the truthas formalised in this Medicare safety net legislation. As I mentioned previously, the word ‘absolutely' comes out of the mouth of the health minister with monotonous regularity. When the word ‘absolutely' comes out in response to a question, particularly from the health minister, you need to be suspicious that in fact he is saying exactly the opposite. Where do I get the evidence for that? I get the evidence for that in a Four Corners interview of 1998, when he was asked about financial backing for Terry Sharples. The reporter's question was: So there was never any question of any party or other funds from any other source being offered to Terry Sharples? The minister answered: Absolutely not, absolutely not ...",115
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Order! It is hard to see how the member for Rankin could tie that back to the bill.,117
235,Dr EMERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am going to the health minister's credibility and capacity to tell the truth. The fact is that his incapacity to tell the truth is formalised here, today, in a piece of legislation that this parliament will be voting on. This piece of legislation declares that the minister's commitments-given as an ironclad promise with the use of the word ‘absolutely'-have today been broken. The government announced before the election that it would sustain this Medicare safety net, even though it knew before the election that it would not be able to do so. It put in $20 million of taxpayers' funds to assure the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would be retained in full. Mrs Draper- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that you direct the member to keep his comments on the bill.",117
236,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I have already done that, member for Makin.",117
237,Dr EMERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"If the member for Makin had been listening, she would know that I was talking about $20 million of taxpayers' funds being used to perpetrate what the Australian government and the health minister knew to be untrue: that the Medicare safety net would be retained in full. If the member were to check the Notice Paper, she would know that the debate here in the parliament this afternoon is on the Medicare safety net legislation. I trust that, following the closing of my remarks, she will make some sort of a contribution to this debate. The fact is that the government did not tell the truth. Against the benchmark set by the Prime Minister of Australia that: ... truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life ... This parliament ought to condemn the health minister for his wilful incapacity to tell the truth. That is what has happened here today-and, in making some sort of assessment of this health minister, it is not the only time. Members of parliament may well recall a recent interview in relation to health policy that occurred on Lateline on 30 September last year. The transcript of that interview reads as follows: TONY JONES: Tony Abbott on another matter, have you met Archbishop Pell during the election campaign? TONY ABBOTT: Not that I can recall. TONY JONES: Not that you can recall, because we believe that you've had at least one meeting with him quite recently? You don't recall that? TONY ABBOTT: Well, when? Where? TONY JONES: At the presbytery in Sydney. TONY ABBOTT: Ah, actually now that you do mention it, I did meet with Cardinal Pell. So what? Why shouldn't I meet with Cardinal Pell? It was only when the health minister realised that Tony Jones of Lateline had details not only of the time of the meeting but also the venue of the meeting that the health minister realised that he would have to tell the truth. But if the health minister could have gotten away with not telling the truth, as he had attempted to, he would have. If the details had not been known to the ABC, the health minister yet again would not have told the truth. Here he is in parliament today in question time, unloading his bucket of bile in the Australian parliament because he has nothing to contribute to health policy. This is a man who presides over a health budget in excess of $30,000 million, yet he spends most of his waking hours thinking of language that he can pour out of his mouth in getting stuck into the Labor Party, while displaying to the Australian people that he is not fit to be a member of this parliament. There is one bitter and disappointed man who has left this parliament; another bitter and disappointed man ought to leave it as quickly as possible. We will do everything that we possibly can to ensure that the minister for health leaves this parliament; it is time. As was evidenced in this debate on a matter of public importance to raise the standardMrs Draper- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I fail to see how any of the honourable member's remarks relate in any way to the bill that is under discussion.",117
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,The member for Rankin is in order.,118
239,Dr EMERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will just use my last 30 seconds to explain to the member for Makin that the truth has a value-and the truth and a promise in this legislation is being broken. When this bill passes the House, this legislation will formalise the breaking of a promise by the health minister-and he should be condemned for it. (Time expired)",118
240,Mr JENKINS,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to oppose the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005. It is interesting that we are speaking on this piece of legislation on a day when we have discussed a matter of public importance relating to the necessity for government to treat the Australian people with openness and frankness. This bill's purpose is to reduce the annual thresholds above which benefits under the extended Medicare safety net are payable. From 1 January 2006, the thresholds will increase from $306.90 to $500 for concession card holders and other low-income families, and from $716.10 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals. In debating this legislation, I wish to make three points. One is the fact that this is the legislation broken election promise by the Howard government. The second matter I want to discuss is the inequitable nature of the Medicare safety net. The third is that this piece of legislation and the Medicare safety net are other aspects of the government's health care program that lead to this mish-mash we have seen in the development of health policies by this government. In the short time that I have tonight, I want to go to the point of equity, because it is very interesting to look at where the benefit from this measure is going. From the latest figures available for the federal electorates in Victoria, each of the electorates of Kooyong, Goldstein and Higgins gains over $500,000 because of this policy: $560,000 to Kooyong, $529,000 to Goldstein and $523,000 to Higgins. If we look at Indi, it is $203,000. If we look at the seat of Scullin, it is $185,000. Mr Speaker, if we look at Wannon, it is $108,000. On equity grounds, how could it be said that an electorate like Wannon, in health policy, should gain around half a million dollars less in a quarter than electorates like Kooyong, Goldstein and Higgins? That is one of the problems with this overall piece of policy. The fact that this represents a broken election promise is an issue that also needs to be developed. NA",118

242,Ms PANOPOULOS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to comment on recent events in my electorate that deserve to be placed on the record in this place. Last weekend Wangaratta Aerodrome played host to a very significant event commemorating our returned service men and women. The Benalla campus of the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE organised of a a successful Pacific flyers reunion to complement recent commemorations of the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day. The day included a flyover of historic aircraft, displays of fighter aircraft, a display of historic military vehicles and a tour of the museum precinct and the aircraft restoration facility. I want to thank Adrian Vaughan and his organising team from the Benalla TAFE, who spent many months organising this event. It was part of a documentary by the TAFE's multimedia students called On a Wing and a Prayer on the restoration of war planes. Over 1,000 people attended in blustery and wet conditions, including many veterans who came from far-off places. A particular highlight was the flight of a lovingly restored P40 Kittyhawk fighter-bomber which was last in operation in Papua New Guinea 60 years ago. It was back in the air last weekend at Wangaratta Aerodrome and was reunited with its former pilot, Robert Warren, who came from his home town of Tulsa in Oklahoma to be in Wangaratta for this historic event. Mr Warren was delighted at the restoration work carried out on the plane by Wangaratta's own Precision Aerospace Productions. But residents heard the loudest roar when they played host to an F18 Hornet flyover. At this point, I want to place on the record my thanks and appreciation to Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for Defence. At the last minute, when it looked like the flyover would not be able to take place owing to an absence of pavement concessions and indemnity insurance, the organisers approached my office and I swiftly took up the matter with the minister's office. Once these outstanding issues were addressed, the minister gave his approval on Friday afternoon for this historic flyover. I thank him and his office for doing everything possible to ensure that this very welcome and much anticipated community event went ahead. Former Wangaratta resident Shawn Mathews flew the Hornet from the base in Williamtown. Another event of note in the north-east last weekend was the annual staging of the Three Choirs Festival. This is a yearly event where the three pre-eminent choirs in the region-the Wangaratta Choristers, the Beechworth Singers and the Murray Conservatorium Choir-collaborate to deliver a series of concerts to audiences in our region. This year's feature work was the rarely heard Beethoven Mass in C. Beethoven is not particularly renowned for his sacred music compositions, but the Mass in C is a delight for listeners. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the concerts last weekend, but I am told that the concerts in Yarrawonga, Wodonga and Wangaratta were a great success. Another aspect of the concert was the performance of a work by one of my constituents, local Wodonga resident Bohdan Krowicky. His piece ‘Thou and I' is a hauntingly evocative composition, with the text taken from a poem by the 13th century mystic Rumi. All credit goes to my constituent Mr Krowicky for having his own composition performed publicly. We can often forget the achievements of our musicians, artists and composers, particularly in rural and regional areas, but it is important to give these home-grown works a performance whenever we can. I am informed that the crowds were a bit down in Yarrawonga on the Friday night but that the attendances at Wodonga and Wangaratta were excellent and the crowds were definitely treated to quality performances by our local musicians. Thanks go to Ben Wilson, director of the Wangaratta Choristers, Margaret Phillips, director of the Beechworth Singers, and Michael Halsey, director of the Murray Conservatorium Choir, who prepared the respective choirs excellently for this event. Events such as this show that the arts and in particular musical performance are respected and encouraged in rural and regional Australia. We should work towards continuing to develop regional arts practice and the role of the arts in sustaining and fying our regional communities. Gaza Strip  year, 2005, has been an important year for both the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Mahmoud Abbas was elected President of the Palestinian Authority, and Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas declared a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In February the Knesset voted 59 to 40 to approve the disengagement implementation law, an act of parliament that would see more than 8,000 Israeli settlers in Gaza evacuated and the resultant vacant land given back to the Palestinian people. It must be said that Israel's decision to withdraw from Gaza has been controversial. Not many people would dispute that. Many within Israel itself were not happy with Prime Minister Sharon's decision but Mr Sharon, to his credit, persevered until this week, when the parliament formally recognised Israel's withdrawal from Gaza. The conclusion of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is a significant step towards an overall peace settlement in the Middle East and should be welcomed by all Australians. As Chief Opposition Whip, I take this opportunity on behalf of the Labor Party to commend Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the Israeli parliament and the Israeli people for taking this courageous step, which has clearly been a very traumatic and painful process for Israel. Whatever we may think of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories or of the settlement policies of the previthat ous Israeli governments, the decision to remove more than 8,000 settlers from Gaza and return the territory to Palestinian rule is a major advance towards a peaceful settlement, particularly since it was done unilaterally and without any guarantees of security. Labor now calls on both sides to follow up uni- the momentum created by this withdrawal by taking further concrete steps to keep the peace process moving. On the Palestinian side, this must include a crackdown on those groups responsible for terrorist attacks on Israel and an end to the incitement and encouragement of violence and hatred. On the Israeli side, there needs to be continuing disengagement from the West Bank and steps taken to allow the Palestinian Authority to assume full responsibility for Gaza, including its air space and coastline, in a manner consistent with Israel's legitimate security interests. So why is this relevant to the Australian parliament? Because we on our side of the chamber take a keen interest in the Middle East. Labor wears on its chest with pride its role in the creation of an Israeli state. It was, after all, the Chifley Labor government which, over 50 years ago, was amongst the first in the world to give political support to the idea of a Jewish state. Under Labor, Australia was the first country to vote in favour of the 1947 partition resolution. And, as President of the United Nations General Assembly, former Labor foreign minister Dr Evatt played a key role in the founding of Israel in 1948. For the past 50 years Labor has never taken a backward step in advocating practical solutions to the long-running IsraelPalestine conflict. In recent years Labor has repeatedly urged both Israel and Palestine to engage on the road map to peace. We believe, despite some setbacks along the way, the road map offers the strongest possibility of a sustainable and robust peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Our policy is based on the right of the state of Israel to exist within secure boundaries. We do not back away from that. We vest our hope in a two-state solution involving the creation separate Palestinian state behind secure boundaries. A lasting settlement between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples is the only way forward. No-one should pretend that the road map to peace is an easy path. It is not. But gress is being made. The withdrawal from Gaza is another step forward. To ignore that fact is ignorant. Australia should do whatever it can in the coming months to encourage both sides to maintain the momentum created by Israel's decision to withdraw from Gaza. It is true that the honourable member for Fowler, who is always passionate about the causes she embraces, used some words in a speech which caused offence, but she withdrew them today after question time and I admire the honourable member for Fowler for her courage in doing so. Gold Coast Cruise Ship Terminal",118
243,Mr CIOBO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to express on behalf of my constituents and many residents of the Gold Coast our disgust at the betrayal by the Beattie Labor government of residents who live in my electorate and who live within the confines of Gold Coast City. At 11 am this morning the Beattie state Labor government ended the charade they had been carrying on with for a matter of months about what they would be doing with the cruise ship terminal on the Gold Coast. At 11 am this morning, Anna Bligh, the Deputy Premier and state Labor Minister for State Development, announced to the assembled media throng that the Beattie Labor government would be pushing ahead with the proposal to build a cruise ship terminal. Those on the Gold Coast who have been following this debate closely for some time would know that I have thought for some months-and, indeed, I had heard whispers for some months-that the Beattie state Laof a bor government had in fact passed through their cabinet last December the decision to push forward with a cruise ship terminal, despite the fact that it is very clear that many residents of Main Beach, Surfers Paradise and more broadly were opposed to the idea pro- of a cruise ship terminal on the Spit. Questions need to be asked. Why is the state Labor government undertaking this path? Why is the state Labor government turning up its nose at the residents of Main Beach? Why is the state Labor government turning its back on the residents of Surfers Paradise and imposing this cruise ship terminal in an area where nobody wants it to be built? The reason is that it is a knee-jerk political reaction from a very scared state Labor government to try to save backsides and to ensure the political survival of the state member for Southport, Peter Lawlor, and the state member for Broadwater, Peta-Kaye Croft. In this particular instance, what is very clear is that a deal has been done by the state Labor government in the context of a cruise ship terminal. In particular, the state Labor government has pushed forward with three key proposals as part of the development of a cruise ship terminal. So for many months now we have seen the state Labor government talking about the fact that it says a cruise ship terminal is good for the Gold Coast. Indeed, I support that notion, as does my colleague the state Liberal member for Surfers Paradise, John-Paul Langbroek. Dr Langbroek and I have been saying that we support a cruise ship terminal, but we reject entirely the notion that a cruise ship terminal should be built on the end of the Spit. We reject entirely that a cruise ship terminal should be built in crown parkland in one of the last remaining vegetation areas on the Gold Coast. We reject entirely that a cruise ship terminal should be built for the political convenience of two state Labor MPs and for the political convenience of the Premier, Peter Beattie. But I will tell you the reason why the state Labor government is insisting that a cruise ship terminal be built on the Spit. The reason is that it is part of a deal that has been done with the developers to redevelop the western side of the Spit. That has been the key behind this decision from the very outset. The reality is that the state Labor government has made an arrangement that the consortium that will build the cruise ship terminal, a loss-making venture, will do so on the basis that they have the opportunity to redevelop the western side of the Broadwater. Some 7½ hectares will be redeveloped into hotels, units and residential and commercial buildings because the state Labor government wants the millions of dollars of leasing rental that will flow to it by redeveloping that 7½ hectares. More importantly, the state Labor government also intends to facilitate this dodgy deal to have the sea scouts, the naval cadets and the water police move from their current location on the western side of the Spit and be incorporated into the development that is going to take place in this green area. The state Liberal member for Surfers Paradise, John-Paul Langbroek, and I object to this because we have seen the federal government invest millions of dollars through Green Corps projects and Work for the Dole projects to revegetate the Spit. We object to because the Beattie state Labor government has neglected public consultation in order to push this deal through. More importantly, we reject this deal because the Beattie Labor government has done this deal without being honest with the people of the Gold Coast. Today is a very bleak day for the residents of Main Beach and Surfers Paradise. It is a day when the Beattie Labor government has compounded its dishonesty, not only over the state health sector but also on this issue. (Time expired) West Papua",121
244,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on the matter of West Papua. The Australian Labor Party has a long and proud record on human rights, and it is an area of real interest to me as a member of this parliament. That strong stance is set out in considerable detail in the ALP platform, which explicitly states: Labor considers the promotion of universal human rights to be a core foreign policy objective that cannot be traded off against other diplomatic and economic goals. Respect for human rights-the dignity and welfare of our fellow humans-is naturally our first and most immediate response to reports of human rights abuses. However, Labor also believes that respect for human rights is an important consideration in international relations. Respect for human rights contributes to domestic peace and stability and economic prosperity. This in turn contributes to the maintenance of international security. In this regard, I have been greatly concerned, as others have, by reports from church groups and human rights organisations about incidents of police and military brutality in the Indonesian province of West Papua. Most disturbing are the reports of the Indonesian army's involvement in the murder of Papuan independence leader Theys it Eluay in 2001. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to a report that was submitted to the UN Economic and Social Council on 9 March this year by Franciscans International on behalf of a number of respected and credible church groups, including the Catholic Institute for International Relations, the Protestant Church in Germany, Dominicans for Justice and Peace, and the World Council of Churches. That report noted that human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and displacement, were continuing in Papua. There is no doubt that during the bad old days of the Suharto government the Papuan people were subjected to gross violations of their human rights. In addition to military brutality and political oppression, the province was neglected by Jakarta, with the Papuans lagging behind the rest of the country by virtually every standard of human development-infant mortality, literacy and life expectancy. The fall of the Suharto government and the subsequent election of President Wahid in 2000 gave rise to real optimism that a new era in Papua would unfold. It is important to acknowledge that there have been some positive developments, including the introduction of a special autonomy law granting Papuans political freedoms and autonomy. But the fact remains that we continue to receive disturbing reports of human rights abuses in Papua. Labor are very concerned about these reports. It is our view that a failure to address ongoing human rights concerns will only serve to undermine Indonesian authority in the province. Labor are also very disappointed at the failure to fully implement the law, which was passed by the Indonesian parliament in 2002. We have made our concerns clear to the Indonesian government and will continue to do so. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow foreign minister, Kevin Rudd, took the opportunity provided by the recent visit to Australia by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to raise their concerns about the human rights situation in West Papua and the failure to implement the special autonomy law. Shadow minister Rudd made it clear when he said: ... when it comes to human rights abuses or gations of human rights abuses in Papua ... we have an expectation that the government in Jakarta will attend to those matters ... at a thorough level. Still, it is clear from reports recently made public, including Genocide in West Papua?-and the question mark following this title raises legitimate questions about whether it is the right term to use here; we do not think that it is-that the situation is of concern. That particular report, from the Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies, shows that the situation in West Papua continues to deteriorate and is very serious. Health conditions in some areas are very poor. The fact that special autonomy has not reached grassroots levels means there remain continuing infringements of people's rights. This is serious. So it is essential that this parliament provide encouragement to the Indonesian government to speedily advance those arrangements identified as necessary for the implementation of the special autonomy law. We have welcomed President Yudhoyono's success in negotiating a peace agreement in Aceh. His decision to grasp the opportunity provided in the wake of the tsunami to rebuild not just the bricks and mortar of the province but also civil society is acknowledged. It is now time for similar energies and commitment to be brought to bear for the people of West Papua. Member for Fowler",122
245,Mr KEENAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to place on record my concern over the comments made by the member for Fowler in this place on 13 September and 8 September this year and 2 December last year. It follows on from comments made earlier in this adjournment debate by the member for Chifley and from a question asked by the member for Casey to the Attorney-General in question time today. As the member for Stirling, I represent in this place a large Jewish allecommunity, a community that makes a large contribution to my electorate and to Western Australia as a whole. Indeed, I think the tribution that the community makes is out of proportion to the size of that community, which is not numerically large. I was reminded just this week that they can feel uniquely vulnerable, and as a community they have legitimate security needs. Also-and I think quite rightly-they are sensitive to any reference to the Holocaust. To come into this chamber and use terms like ‘concentration camp', ‘ghetto' and ‘ethnic cleansing' against Israel is enormously insensitive. No matter what your views on the conflict in the Middle East-and I am not disputing the right of the member for Fowler to hold a different view to mine on the conflict there-it is completely inappropriate for her to come into this chamber and to compare the mass extermination of six million people in concentration camps to events that are occurring in the Middle East at the present time. That is why using the language of the Holocaust against Israel causes such hurt to members of the Jewish community in Australia, some of whom actually survived the events she is now using to push a case about Middle Eastern politics. The member for Fowler needs to recognise these concerns in any future comments on this issue and she must apologise for going down this path in the first place. I well remember her earlier comments in December last year in this place eulogising Yassar Arafat-something I believe was very ill-advised given his well-known record as someone who used violence to achieve his political ends. For the parliament of a country that is one of the world's oldest democracies to be used to eulogise as a hero someone who ruled as dictator and used violence to achieve his goals, sometimes against his own people, is a very sad occurrence in the history of this place. I know that the member for Fowler has a conparticular view about Middle Eastern politics. As I said before, although I do not share this view I respect her right to hold it. But this tolerance does not extend to using this parliament to eulogise people of violence or to deeply offend Australian Jewry by using the language of the Holocaust in a wholly inappropriate way. While I am addressing this issue, I want to highlight some other comments made by the member for Fowler on 8 September in relation to Islamic fundamentalism. In my electorate of Stirling there is a large Muslim community. I have spent quite a bit of time at the two mosques in my electorate, and I have taken the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Attorney-General to meet with community leaders at different times. They have always been very clear with me that they reject Islamic extremism and the terrorism that emanates from that ideology. Sadly, though, the member for Fowler rejects this link and has used the parliament to outline her view that these terrorists are killing Westerners because of Western actions in the Muslim world. Last week she said: ... terrorists do not hate us for what we are; they hate us for what we are doing in their home countries. When we can appreciate that, we will be a lot closer to solving problems in Iraq and reducing the risk of terrorist attacks against Australians. But this cowardly government wants to hide behind another lie-the lie that Islamic fundamentalism is the root of terrorism. This goes well beyond the ALP's position on this issue, and I believe that this thinking skates very close to justifying the terrorists' repulsive actions. It also reflects terrorist propaganda. Islamic fundamentalists are killing Westerners because of who we are, not for any other reason. They despise us for our freedoms, and they despise us for our democracy. The Labor Party as a whole need to face up to this issue. Will they tolerate ple within their ranks who believe that somehow Western nations have brought this savage terrorism upon themselves, or will the opposition Leader show some ticker and repudiate-(Time expired) Minister for Health and Ageing The Nationals",123
246,Ms GILLARD,ADJOURNMENT,"I am glad to announce that we are back doing the parliamentary fortnightly wrap. I have already congratulated the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, for specifically wearing her Hollywood glam this morning. I think she has done very well indeed with the pearls, and it is obviously because she wanted to bring a sense of occasion to this evening! In the last parliamentary fortnight and ticularly in the last parliamentary week we have seen a week of guillotines. We saw the Telstra debate guillotined in this House on Monday. We saw it guillotined again in this House today. We saw it guillotined in an unprecedented fashion in the Senate. These were guillotines on a debate about the sale of the single biggest asset the Australian government owns and is ever likely to own-a week of guillotines. It seems to me remarkable that, in a week of guillotines, when debate has been gagged in this parliament, somehow the members opposite and particularly the Treasurer have taken to referring to me as Madame Defarge. I think there is a grand irony about that. Those are the lovers of the guillotine over there. They are the ones that have been cackling and laughing as the guillotine has come down on Telstra. But for sheer, breathtaking, amazing carry-on, we cannot go past the Minister for Health and Ageing this week in his capacity as Leader of the House, who has of course administered the guillotine twice in this peo- place to prevent members speaking but yesterday was-remarkably-raising a point of order with you, Mr Speaker, where he said: ... it would be almost an obscenity in a parliament dedicated to free speech if people were able to use personal explanations to gag debate in this Telstra place. The minister for health is the lover of debate on some occasions and the hater of debate on others. His views about free speech have to be seen as grandly inconsistent, because he was happy to guillotine opposition members this week, and guillotine them he did. The minister for health has certainly won the lack of consistency award, and he has also won the lack of taste and empathy award for the fortnight. In fact, his performance has gone from bad to worse. He started the week with parliamentary scandal about callous and insensitive remarks he made in parrelation to the matter involving Mr Brogden, and of course he has managed to end the week reinforcing his insensitivity. Nye Bevan-one of my Welsh forebearsfamously said, as his career progressed: ‘Real power always seemed to lie just beyond my reach.' I think for the minister for health it is respect that always seems to lie just beyond his reach, and he has certainly fallen very short of that benchmark today. What have we seen this fortnight? We have seen the once great National Party starting to emit a death rattle. We have seen the National Party at its worse-with the notable exception of the member for Riverina-as it sold out its constituency. With respect to the National Party, I think Alan Ramsey got it right a month ago when he interviewed a person he described as ‘one of the Prime Minister's junior colleagues' and as ‘a very jacked-off Liberal'. That Liberal had the following things to say about the National Party. Mr Speaker, I am sorry about the language, but I am quoting: The Nats are scum. They take everything and give nothing. They get elected on our coat-tails, they've got the worse ministers in the Government, they get the perks, the extra staff, the trips, the Prime Minister's ear, yet they never contribute. It's always about take, about self-interest. They're never part of the team. … … … Did you see Cobb's performance in question time today? He was hopeless. Just so bad. Is it any wonder Liberals are so resentful? And it goes on and on, ending up describing National Party members in the following terms: John Anderson was hopeless. Vaile isn't much better. Cobb is an embarrassment. So is Truss, the new deputy leader. An absolute embarrassment. MCGauran is a laughing stock. So why is there resentment from the Liberals? I mean, does one need to ask the question? You do not need to ask the question, because we have seen the National Party on display this week, famously without a backbone, except for the member for Riverina, and we certainly know that Senator Barnaby Joyce is still looking for his. In the parliamentary fortnight we have also seen, Sliding Doors style, a glimpse of what would happen with the alternative government. We have seen the Prime Minister away one week, we have seen the Treasurer away another week, and we would have to say that it has not been a pretty sight. Fran Bailey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would have thought that it was in the interests of the Manager of Opposition Business to give a report on her own side rather than reflecting on others.",125

As I said earlier, we differed fundamentally defining an employee. In listening to the evidence, witnesses who came before us, we found that ‘independent contractor'. There is an attempt vantages employees and other employers-to up as independent contractors, if you like, so would normally be employer obligations onto Friday, an employee or a group of employees told they must have an ABN, they must look insure themselves for workers compensation, I think most committee members know what person who understands that they are in the freely with all sorts of other parties.

They are not very compelling, but, nonetheless, the sincerity with areas in which we consented was important. I am up the unanimous recommendations that were because we believe that you have to start by with all the submissions we had and the there is clearly significant misuse of the term by some employers-and, by the way, it disaddisguise employment, to dress the employees that they can defray, so that they can shift what those employees.

They have an unfair situation corrected by recommending moving away from a common-law definition Relations Act. Instead, the government members situation in which an employer can get away unnecessary and unfair levels of risk, simply of a pen, everything is removed and nothing called independent contractors.
