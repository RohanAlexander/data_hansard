0,NA,Unknown,"House of Representatives. Thursday, 6 October, 1949. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr J. J. Clark) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. ATOMIC ENEEGY.",10
1,Mrs BLACKBUBN,Unknown,"In the absence of the Minister for Defence, I ask the Minister for External Affairs a question which relates to reports that have appeared in several daily newspapers recently. On Tuesday, the 4th October, the Melbourne Argus discussedthe need for reaching an atomic peace with the Soviet, or joining in the most expensive and perilous armaments race in history (a race in which Australia; along with other democracies, would be an enforced runner). A few days previous to that report both the Melbourne Argus and the Melbourne Herald drew attention, to the making of atom bombs by Great Britain and stated that those bombs would probably be tested in Australia. Will the Minister say whether there is any truth in those reports? Are atom bombs likely to be tested in Australia ? I remind the Minister of the assurance given in this House by the Minister for Defence on the 22nd November, 1946 when he saidReports that huge areas in central Australia will be blasted by explosives are highlycoloured figments of the imagination. Were we not also told at that time that, although guided missiles were to he tested in Central Australia, .they would carry no warheads? In any event, would the people of Australia be consulted before any such action was taken t",10
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"^I shall deal with the last of the honourable member's questions first. I confirm the answer that was given on an earlier occasion by .the Minister for Defence. The guided missiles project is quite distinct from any project involving the use of the atom bomb, and therefore, the previous answer still stands. The most important of the honourable member's questions relates to the general attitude to be adopted in relation to what the Argus report referred to as "" atomic peace "". The position of Australia has remained unchanged since 1946, when the Atomic Energy Commission commenced its work. It is an essential condition of atomic energy control, in relation to armaments, that there should be international inspection and control, [f there were no international inspection iind control, there would be no certainty that one nation would not make preparations to employ atomic weapons of great power and magnitude, without being observed by other nations. That is the view to which the Australian Government has consistently adhered. The honourable member referred to two articles, one of which appeared in the Melbourne A.rgm and the other in the Melbourne Herald. Both articles are in accordance with the policy of Australia in relation to atomic energy in that Australia considers there should be further exploration of the possibility of reaching an agreement between the nations, not merely to avoid the use of atomic weapons in war because of their dreadful consequences to humankind, but also to avoid war altogether, if possible, in accordance with purposes and principles of the United Nations. Those are the principles which we have followed in common with most of the countries concerned, particularly the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and to those principles we adhere. Wc shall take our part in any such endeavour. ARMED FORCES. AUSTRALIANS IN JAPAN.",11
3,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I direct a question to the Minister for the Army. Representations have been made to me that Australian troops in Japan, which, r understand, is now a dollar area, are a! a great disadvantage as the result of loss of purchasing power due to the devaluation of sterling. Would it be possible to make some adjustment of their rates of pay in order to remove, in part, at any rate, this disability ?",11
4,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"I shall have the honourable member's question examined., and shall furnish him with an answer at. the earliest possible moment. SEARCH FOR OIL.",11
5,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister give to the House any further information with regard to the discovery or otherwise of oil in Australia or Australia n territories ?,11
6,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am not able to give the honourable member any conclusive evidence of the discovery of oil in Australia or in New Guinea. Very extensive exploration has been carried out in the search for oil. The Government has made available an allocation of dollars to companies that are interested in this work which have spent a great deal of money in Papua and New Guinea. Extensive exploratory work has also been undertaken in Queensland and in other areas in north Australia. I am not able to say that there is any clear evidence of the possible existence of gushers in any of those areas. The most I can say is that those interested have strong hopes of such a discovery being made. FLOOD RELIEF. Mr ANTHONY"" - As the Minister for the the Army is aware, the northern rivers districts of New South Wales are periodically swept by devastating floods. For example, in two years out of four, the Richmond River has had a tremendous deluge. I have received a letter from the Mayor of Lismore in which he has asked me to make representations to the honourable gentleman that army ducks be stationed at Lismore as army personnel are at present located in that area, so that they may be used not only in the Lismore area, but also in the areas drained hy the adjoining rivers which are subject to similar flooding. Will the Minister consider this request ?",11
7,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"Undoubtedly army ducks did a great deal of valuable work, not only during .the recent floods, but also in earlier floods. I understand that as the result of their use the lives approximately 6,000 persons were saved. The unfortunate occurrence of the floods also gave the army personnel an opportunity to carry out valuable training cises. These vehicles must be kept in the rivers adjacent to the training depots and it is necessary to have specially trained personnel to control them. I shall have the proposal examined because it has been proved very definitely that army ducks can play a very important part in the saving of the lives of flood victims. If army ducks can be assigned to areas where dangerous flooding occurs, I shall ascertain whether some of the craft can be sent to the districts to which the honourable member has referred. NAURU. Mr CONELAN"" - Can the Minister for External Territories inform me whether the term of the appointment of Mr Mark Ridgway as Administrator of Nauru has expired? If it has expired what steps is the Government taking to appoint a successor ?",11
8,Mr WARD,Unknown,"Mr Ridgway's term expired on the 29th August last, and he did not seek an extension of it. The vernment invited applications to fill the post, and 243 replies were received. These applications are now under consideration. Mr Ridgeway returned to the island with the military forces after the capitulation of Japan, and has been Administrator of NTauru since that time. Prior to the Japanese occupation, he was the accountant and collector of customs there. The previous Administrator, Lieutenant-Colonel J. R. Chalmers, and four others lost their lives during the Japanese occupation. As honourable members are aware, the island was completely devastated, and Mr Ridgway had a most difficult time in carrying out the work of rehabilitation. I take this opportunity to place on record the Government's appreciation of his very valuable work. CURRENCY.",12
9,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to important statement by the Finance Minister of the Indian Government, Dr John Matthai, when he opened a of debate on devaluation in the Indian Parliament this week ? Dr Matthai complained that decisions made by British representatives at the Washington finanexer- cial talks exceeded the brief which the finance ministers of the British Commonwealth had given to Sir Stafford Cripps.",12
10,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,I rise to order. I should like to know whether the honourable member for Warringah is in order in reading an extract from a newspaper when he is asking a question.,12
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honor able members must ask their questions in their own language, and they are not entitled to read extracts from newspapers. Mr .SPENDER - As a preliminary to asking two questions, I am simply inquiring from the Prime Minister whether he has observed the report. If I do not ask the right honourable gentleman whether he has read the report, I cannot ask those questions. Will the Prime Minister say whether the finance ministers of the British Commonwealth, including the Australian representative, passed a resolution in which they expressed the views of their respective governments, and Go- whether Sir Stafford Cripps exceeded the terms of that resolution ? Was any secret meeting held beforehand at which the extent and effects of devaluation were discussed? If so, what was the resolution that was passed at that meeting?",12
12,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I desire to make it clear at once that it wa3 not intended that the finance ministers of the British Commonwealth, who met in London, should discuss devaluation. The mere suggestion of a general discussion on devaluation at that time would have been the height of folly, because the slightest leakage of such news could have enabled speculators to make great fortunes. The resolutions which were carried by the finance ministers after the discussions in London related to an endeavour to bridge the dollar gap. There was a general agreement that the delegates at that conference should recommend to their respective governments a 25 per cent, reducan tion of imports from the dollar area. That is the only effective and practical way of reducing dollar expenditure. Devaluation was not discussed.. No secret meetings were held about devaluation when I was in London, or when the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction subsequently attended the London conference. The subject was not even discussed informally. The conference of finance ministers did not give to Sir Stafford Cripps a. brief in respect of matters that he might discuss at the Washington conference. Sir Stafford Cripps, when he attended that conference, discussed the general position as it affected the sterling area, and particularly the United Kingdom. If he had a brief, he took it from the Government to the United, Kingdom. On the subject of devaluation, every country made its own decision. The Dominions could have appreciated their currency in relation to sterling if they had wished to do so. They acted on their own volition. NA MOSCOW.",12
13,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"During the last sessional period, the Minister for External Affairs was good enough to make a statement, in answer to a question, in which he set forth the extensive restrictions placed on the movement of Australian diplomatic representatives in the Soviet Union. Very few districts could be visited, and even then permits were required. Have representations ever been made to the Soviet Government that it should accord to our diplomatic representatives the same freedom of movement as we accord to their represtntatives in Australia ?",13
14,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,".Partl y as a result of the question asked by the honourable member, inquiries on this subject have been made. The restrictions imposed by Russia on Australia's diplomatic representatives apply uniformly to the accredited representatives of all nations. However, the matter has been taken up with the Soviet Government, and I shall inform the honourable member of the result of our representations. COTTON.",13
15,Mr DAVIDSON,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Has the Prime attends Minister received a further urgent request from the Queensland Cotton Marketbut ing Board that he should announce an interim price of 9^d. per lb. for seed cotton harvested in 1950, pending the receipt of the Tariff Board's delayed report? As the normal planting season is now in progress, will he make an immediate announcement to this effect, in order to save the industry from extinction ?",13
16,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I understand that a. telegram has been received, although I have not seen it. It is at present being considered by the Minister for Trade and Customs. I shall let the honourable member have some information about the report as 30on as possible. SNOWY MOUNTAINS SCHEME.",13
17,Mr FRASER,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I ask the Minister for Works and Housing whether he can state what arrangements are being made for' the ceremony on Monday, the 17th October, to mark the commencement of the actual construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Will he consult with his colleague, the Minister for the Cnterior, to see whether this great occasion in the history of our country can be suitably marked in the schools under the control of the Commonwealth in this area? The most attractive way would be the granting of a half-holiday. Will the Minister also make suitable representations to the education authorities in New South Wales with a view to securing their co-operation?",13
18,Mr LEMMON,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I shall discuss with my colleague, the Minister for the In terior, and the Minister for Education in New South Wales a suitable commemoration by school children of the great occasion. The Government has sent about 1,000 invitations to distinguished people, not only in New South Wales, but throughout Australia, to attend the official ceremony that will take place at Adaminaby on the 17th October. We believe that representatives of all State governments will attend the function. At the same time, the Government extends a general invitation to all people who desire to be present. Every one who the ceremony, whether he be an officially invited citizen or an interested not officially invited citizen, will receive the same consideration and privileges. Every one who attends the ceremony will meet at Adarninaby on a common level. WHEAT.",13
19,Mr HOWSE,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say when the No. 11 wheat pool will be wound up and what the final payment will be?  11A wheat pools will be wound up at very early date. I cannot give the specihave fic date. I cannot state from memory what the final payments will be, but shall be glad to give the honourable gentleThe man that information within a few hours. NEW GUINEA TIMBE R LEASE.",14
20,Mr LANG,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Has ' the Attorneythey General yet completed an examination the recommendation by Mr Justice Ligertwood that the swindler, Edward Farrell, should be prosecuted for his part in the Bulolo timber lease scandal? Can the Attorney-General inform the House whether a prosecution will be launched?",14
21,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Mr Justice Ligertwood recommended that the matter be looked into. That was done immediately by Crown Law officers of the CommonAustralia Airlines? wealth. Their view of ' the matter was forwarded to the Government of New South Wales. The only authorities that can launch a prosecution are the Crown Law authorities of New South to Wales, because the alleged offence is against the law of New South Wales. craft in Australia? I am not yet in possession of their decision. As soon as I receive it, I shall let the honourable gentleman know what it is. We have intimated to the State Crown Law authorities that if a proseand cution is launched the services of the counsel who assisted the royal commisbourne sioner will be available to them. There are legal complexities in the matter, legal advice has been forwarded to the appropriate authorities, which are the State Crown Law authorities. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY Limited",14
22,Mr FADDEN,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that, as a result of devaluation, Australia will have to replenish its quota in the International Monetary Fund to restore its original par value? If so, what is the amount of (a) gold and (6) Australian currency involved ? What provision has been made for such payment, and is it to be made from revenue or from loan?",14
23,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Yes , there will have to be a change of the holdings on behalf of Australia in the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank. a Gold will not be involved, but we shall to provide non-negotiable and noninterest-bearing securities. The precise I amount involved will soon be determined. approval of the Parliament will be sought for the completion of the necessary details. I shall let the honourable member know the exact details. Additional amounts will have to be provided, but will not involve additional gold. of They will, evolve additional security. CIVIL AVIATION.",14
24,Mr DUTHIE,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Has the Minister for Civil Aviation seen statements that were prominently displayed yesterday in earlier editions of the Melbourne Herald and less prominently displayed in later editions, regarding the Convair aircraft operated by TransIs it correct, as reported, that the Department of Civil Aviation has granted operational concessions in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines Convair aircraft which permit them take off from airfields in weather that one would ground all other two-engined air",14
25,Mr DRAKEFORD,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I saw the statements referred to, which appeared on page 9 of the Melbourne Herald under a threecolumn headline in the earlier editions, under a single column headline in the later editions. Apparently the MelHerald realized, after the early editions had appeared, that it was giving but prominence to a statement that was not based on sound foundations. Whether the statement originated in the office of the Melbourne Herald or in the office of Australian National Airways Proprietary is a. matter for conjecture; but, FUND. wherever it originated, it is entirely misleading and is, in fact, a complete misrepresentation of thp facts. The take-off limitations for different types of aircraft in adverse weather conditions are determined by the number of power units applicable to the aircraft and the performance of the aircraft assuming that an engine failure occurred immediately after take-off. Certain specified .minima are set out for each airport. With most airports, it is a ceiling of 800 feet and a horizontal visibility of 2 miles for both take-off and landing. However, DC4, Constellation, DC6 and Lancastrian aircraft, which can fly on three engines, permitted to take off under worse conditions than those specified for landing because they can fly safely to another airport. The performance of a Convair with one engine inoperative is infinitely superior to that of a D03, and in fact is almost equal to that of a DC4. The Convair type of aircraft has, therefore, been included with the four-engined aircraft for the purpose of this concession, with the proviso that a suitable alternative airfield is available. The Melbourne Herald's report is merely another instance of misrepresentation in respect of Convair aircraft on its part.",14
26,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Can the Minister for Civil Aviation give me any information in connection with the proposed air service to Sale, Victoria, and the proposal for a civil aerodrome between Morwell and Traralgon, Victoria ? The honourable member for Gippsland is very interested in these proposals and is anxious that the Minister should give favourable consideration to them.",15
27,Mr DRAKEFORD,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I have seen statements in the press which referred to proposed air services to Sale and Bairnsdale in Gippsland, and I also know that a number of applications were made following inquiries by the interdepartmental committee some time ago, and also that many applicants were not prepared to go on with their applications even if they were permitted to start services. As far as intra-state air services are concerned the attitude of Victorian governments has been that they are not prepared to grant, permission for services to operate between air stations that are in close proximity to railway services. That attitude ha9 so far not been modified officially, but recently the Victorian Minister for Transport, Mr. Kent Hughe9, has made some representations to the Department of Civil Aviation about air services in the Gippsland district. The matter is being examined and I have offered to meet Mr Kent Hughes for the purpose of discussing it if he could come to Canberra or, if it is not possible for him to come to Canberra, I have offered to meet him at the earliest opportunity in Melbourne. T have not heard anything previously in connection with a proposed airare field in the vicinity of Morwell and Traralgon, and so far as I know no definite approaches have been made to the department. However, I shall investigate the matter and let the honourable member have a reply later. BANKING . Mr MCBRinE - I ask the Prime Minister whether it is correct, as reported in today's press, that he told a meeting of the Australian Labour party federal executive that it was one of the most cherished hopes of the Labour party that the trading banks will be nationalized? Did he also say that the Government (lid not at present know its constitutional powers because it had not received the reasons . for the judgment of the Privy Council in relation to the Banking case. Is it also a fact that when the judgment of the Privy Council is received and has been considered by the Government, and it is thought that the Constitution makes certain steps possible, the Government intends to continue with its effort to nationalize the trading banks?",15
28,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"It is true that I addressed the federal executive of the Australian Labour party yesterday and that I referred to the subject of banking. My recollection is that I expressed the view that it had always been the belief of the Labour party that the business of banking was such a great public utility, and had such a great effect upon the lives of the people, that it ought to be controlled by the people. I added to that, of course, that under the decisions of the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council-althoug h the reasons for the decision of the Privy Council had not been received-that could not be done. I also stated that the Government woiild not be party to any unconstitutional action. I added that one of the claims of the Opposition and the banking institution was that competition in banking was highly desirable and that there would be no lack of competition if banking could not be nationalized. THE PARLIAMENT. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.",15
29,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"I ask you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, whether your attention has been drawn to a statement in this morning's press in which the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the Honourable W. H . Lamb, reported to have said in the House that lengthy answers by Ministers of the Crown have been developing into ministerial statements, and in future, unless that practice was discontinued, he would regard such lengthy answers as ministerial statements and would afford the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament the opportunity to reply to such statements? Do you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, consider that in view of the extraordinary lengths to which Ministers in this Parliament go in prepied senting answers to questions, the same courtesy might he afforded to the rates Leader of the Opposition in this House in similar circumstances? If you have not seen the statement, will you inform yourself regarding the matter and conment sider whether the same warning might not be issued to Ministers in this Parliathe ment?",16
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN," I have not seen such a statement by the Speaker of the New South Legislative Assembly, nor would I be interested in such a statement. This Parliament is governed by standing tour orders. Members are entitled to ask questions within the limits laid down by the Standing Orders, and Miniswould ters are entitled to answer them. There is no restriction on the length replies. Honourable members ask many involved questions which entail the giving of lengthy replies. If honourable members ask questions, they must be prepared accept the answers. APPLES AND PEARS.",16
31,Mr FALKINDER,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"Will the Minisarrange ter for Commerce and Agriculture whether the Australian Government and the United Kingdom Ministry of Food have reached any agreement with respect to a contract to supply the United Kingdom with apples and pears in the forthcoming season? If an agreement has been reached, what is the number of bushels involved? If a decision has not yet been arrived at, will the Minister say when we can expect an official announcement about the matter?  Kingdom Government and the Ausis tralian Government have not arrived at any agreement in respect of the forthcoming season. Immediately any agreement is arrived at an announcement will that be made by the Government. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",16
32,Mr BLAIN,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"In addressing a question to the Minister for the Interior, I point out that various religious denominations in the Northern Territory have represented that church lands, and lands occuby church schools, in the southern States, are relieved of liability to pay and taxes. In view of the work that the various denominations are doing in the Northern Territory in the education of children, thus relieving the Governof the expenditure associated with such education, will the Minister have whole case reviewed and grant tochurch authorities in the Northern Territory the same concession as is granted toin the southern States in respect of relief from the liability to pay rates and Wales taxe9 on church lands?",16
33,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS IN,"During my recent of the Northern Territory, I gave anundertaking that I would examine this matter in order to ascertain whether it be possible to extend to the Northern Territory the same benefits of as apply elsewhere. Certain specifications have been applied to church lands just as certain specifications apply in respect of Commonwealth lands in theto various States. This is a complicated, matter. I have undertaken to have it thoroughly investigated and furnish a. reply to the persons concerned. I shall for a copy of my reply to besay sent to the honourable member. NEW GUINEA. NA SERVANTS.",16
34,Mr WHITE,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"I direct a question the Minister for Repatriation relating to the pensions paid under the New Guinea civilian war pensions scheme to widows of civilians who were killed in New Guinea during the war. I point out that we were told by both the Minister for Repatriation and the Minister for External Territories that the same conditions would apply to such widows as apply to other war widows. Is it a fact that the conditions are not - equivalent and that medical benefits, furniture grants, post-war training and - war service homes are denied to these civil - widows? Why has this anomaly been allowed to exist for so long when representations for its rectification have so frequently been made in this House and in the Senate? Does the Minister intend to confer with the Minister for External Territories to have this injustice righted soon, so that these worthy people will not - continue to suffer? If not, why not?",17
35,Mr BARNARD,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"The question of the payment of pensions to the widows of New Guinea residents has been the subject - of a good deal of consultation and examination. In some respects the widows and their families have been given satisfaction. There are, however, still some aspects which it has not been possible to bring into line with the conditions ing other war widows. The matter is still being examined.",17
36,Mr WHITE,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,It has been dragging on for years.,17
37,Mr BARNARD,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,I hope that a final - decision satisfactory to all parties concerned will soon be reached. ELECTORAL. GENERAL ELECTION: POLITICAL BROADCASTS.,17
38,Mr MCEWEN,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"Will the Prime Minister state whether the amended order to govern the control of political broadcasts was considered by the Cabinet this morning? If so, is he prepared to make a statement to the House on the subject? Will he indicate what action, if any, has ""been taken in regard .to the matter of the free broadcasting time allotted to him and to the honourable member for Eden Monaro ?",17
39,Mr CHIFLEY,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"The subject of broadcasting was not listed for discussion to by Cabinet this morning, and accordingly, it was not considered. Last week, and again this week, by way of question, the honourable member for Reid asked me what decision had been made by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in relation to the matters referred to it by the Postmaster-General. If my reply has not yet reached the honourable member, it should - reach him this afternoon. It embodies a statement which was forwarded to the Postmaster-General's Department and to me by the board setting out its decision on the matter. Without dealing with the subject at any great length I can say that sections 4, 5 and 1 of the original order have been withdrawn. The only matters now determined by the order are first, that there should be no discrimination in the charges made to any political party; and secondly, that all broadcasting stations shall submit a return to the board indicating what applications have been made to them for time and what treatment has been accorded to such applications so that the board may be in a position to make a full report to the Government and the Parliament on the matter. In reply to the last of the honourable member's questions which relates to broadcasts made by governme and by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, that matter has nothing to do with the order or with the Australian. Broadcasting Control Board. Such broadcasts have been made by me and by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for twelve months or more. The broadcasts made by me do not relate to political matters. That is equally true, no doubt, of the broadcasts made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. The one or two of his broadcasts that I have heard did not seem to me to be extremely political.",17
40,Mr BEALE,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,But just a little bit political.,17
41,Mr CHIFLEY,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"When arrangements were made with the Macquarie network for me to broadcast a report to the nation each Sunday night, the understanding I had was that my broadcasts should be non-political and completely factual. I offered to submit, not only to the local broadcasting station, but also to any authority named by the Macquarie work, including the managing director of that concern, copies of the script of all the broadcasts so that it could be ascerof tained whether they were or were not of following subject:a political character. At no time have I had any complaints that any of my broadcast reports to the nation have been other than factual statements. DEPARTMEN T OF INFORMATION.",17
42,Mr RANKIN,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"I direct a question to the Minister for Information.' Is it true that the Director of the Film Division of the Department of Information, Mr J. Allen, left last week for the United States of America? If so, what is the purpose of Mr Allen's visit abroad? namely:What dollars were made available for the purposes of his visit in view of the existence of a costly organization of thidepartment in the United States of America, how does the Minister justify this jaunt?",18
43,Mr CALWELL,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"This is another framed question, as the honourable member will not deny.",18
44,Mr RAW KIN,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"It is a ""Dorothy Dixer "".",18
45,Mr CALWELL,BENEFITS TO WIDOWS OF PUBLIC,"It is a "" Dorothy "" between the honourable member and thrpress. The branch of the Department of Information which has been established in the United States is not a costly organization. As a matter of fact it is run on a very small amount of money and th* departmental officers do a very good. job. as, indeed, do officers of the department elsewhere, and as do all officers of all departments of this Government. MrAllen has gone abroad under arrangement with British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited. His visit will not involve us in any dollar expenditure whatsoever. He has taken with him some very excellent films which he will place in the commercial field in America. He is a very efficient officer and he will be able to talk to the Americans in their own language. I am sure that Australia will benefit greatly in dollars from his visit. I have the greatest admiration for his capacity and ability. I understand that he was placed in his present position on the representations of the honourable member for Warringah.

46,Mr RANKIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I present the report the Public Works Committee on theProposed erection of a Wool Textile Research Laboratory at Geelong, Victoria. BUTTER. FORMAL MOTION FOE ADJOURNMENT..",18
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH," I have received from the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, The failure of the Government to give effect to the findings of its appointed tribunal is respect of the cost of production of butter.",18
48,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Richmond) [3.16] I move That the House do now adjourn.,18
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Is the motion supported? Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion,",18
50,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The failure of the Government to make good its promises to the dairying industry is the reason why I have submitted this motion. The promise of the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley )to implement the findings of the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee which recommended the payment of an additional 3d. per lb. of butter from the 1st July last, has not yet been fulfilled. No other industry in Australia has had the same niggardly treatment. During the war years, the price of the dairyman's product was pegged by this Government. The dairy farmer was denied the equivalent of the world market price, and government instrumentalities kept the Australian price below the cost of production. In consequence of that treatment, production declined so rapidly that the Government was obliged to ration butter, and we could neither fulfil the requirements of our own people, nor meet the needs of Great Britain. During the war years, the output of butter declined by more than 40,000 tons annually compared with the production before the war, and the situation is very little better day. Production last year was 160,000 tons compared with 200,000 tons in 1939. Because of the dimunition of supplies, the Government was finally compelled to act. A committee was appointed to examine the costs of production in the dairying industry, and to recommend a price which the farmers should receive. The committee diligently set about its task, and I - commend it for its work, even though I do not accept all its conclusions. However, it pioneered much new ground and laid foundations for future determinations. Of course, the committee was handicapped by the knowledge that it would submit its report to a government which would not grant an increase of the price of butter in excess of a few pence a pound. That was a supposition which subsequently proved to be correct. I shall mention the method by which the committee worked in order to show the exactitude upon which its findings were based. Eighteen teams of experts searchingly probed .the costs of production of 1,000 dairy farms throughout the Commonwealth. One member of each team represented the Commonwealth, and the other the producers. To eliminate any possibility of bias as the result of experience of a single season, the investigators selected a five-year period. Side-line crops were excluded and factory returns were examined in order to test the farmers' own figures. Of the 1,000 farms that had originally been selected, 300 were excluded because their costs of production were either too high or too low compared with the average. By treating the remaining 692 farms as a composite farm and averaging the figures, the committee reached the conelusions that the average dairy farm was a 50-cow concern producing 9,7S1 lb. of butter from that number of cows, and that the average production was 196 lb. of butter per cow per annum. As the average production per cow per annum in 2Tew South Wales, according to the State Statistician, is only 14S lb. of butter - cow per annum, honourable members will realise that the committee worked on extremely thigh costs, and, therefore, its conclusions must have resulted in a price to that was lower than it should have been. However, the committee after its exhaustive investigations, recommended that the price of butter should be 2s. 1-Jd. per lb. In arriving at that figure, the committee assessed the value of a dairy farmer's labour at £6 18s. a week. That amount was later advanced to £7 7s. a week. Even so, that figure is less than the wage that is paid to a junior porter employed by the Victorian railways. In recent advertisements, the wage for junior porters in that service is shown as £7 10s. a week. The value of a dairy farmer's labour was also calculated on the basis of a 56-hour week at 2s. 7d. an hour. Overtime is calculated at the same rate. The dairy-farmer is not allowed time and a half or double time when he works on his farm. I contrast the dairy farmer's rates of payment and working conditions with those of a wharf labourer whose rate of remuneration when he works between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. i9 5s. 2d. an hour for a 40-hour week. If he works after 5 p.m. he is paid at the rate of 7s. 6d. an hour. If he works on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, the rate is 12s. 6d. an hour. If no work is offering, or the weather is wet, he receives 12s. a day as appearance money, and he stays at home. If the cargo on which he is engaged is smelly or sticky to handle, an extra rate is provided. For handling a cargo of sugar, the wharf labourer receives an extra 3d. an hour. The dairy-farmer has many unpleasant tasks in his occupation, but he receives the flat rate of 2s. 7d. an hour, and is not paid overtime when he works on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. Despite the thoroughness of the committee's investigations and the meagre rewards upon which its findings were ultimately based, the Chifley Government refused to accept the recommended price of 2s. l i d . per lb., and reduced it to 2s. per lb. I remind honourable members that, at that time, the Australian Government was demanding and receiving from per the United Kingdom Government a price of 2s. 3i'd. per lb. for all butter f.o.b. Australia. One of the reasons that was given for refusing the farmer his just reward of 2s. l^d. per lb. was that interest calculated at 4£ per cent, on his equity was too great and should not be higher than 3f per cent. Another reason was that the five years, which the committee had selected as an average period, were all bad seasons and that it could be expected that the following five years would be favourable. I suggest that Mr Inigo - Tones and Mother Shipton have grounds for an action for trespass against the Government for engaging in long-distance forecasting. The reduction of the price that the committee had recommended by l i d . per lb. deprived dairy-farmers as a whole of an amount of £2,200,000. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  in this matter, gave back £250,000 for expenditure on what he claimed was research to improve the efficiency of the dairying industry. However, most dairymen have a knowledge of the steps that are necessary to improve their industry. AII that they require is the financial means to enable them to give practical effect to their knowledge. The farmer's problem i9 to find the money with which to do the job. It takes money to fertilize, to lime, to subdivide, to fence, to buy barbed-wire, to improve pastures, and to get better cows. Such things cannot be done on the deadline wage of £6 15s. a week, or 3£ per cent, on capital. The policy of the Chifley Government is to deny the dairy-farmer a price for his produce that would enable him to help himself. The Government will spend £250,000 a year to employ publicity officers to tell the farmers what to do, and then deny them the means to do it. We now come to the most recent history of the industry. Two years ago, in October, 1947, the Prime Minister announced publicly that the producers would be guaranteed a price for butter for five yeare, varying up or in accordance with cost factors, as deterlb. for butter. mined by the Joint Dairy Industry is Advisory Committee, and that the price would operate from the 1st July each year. The committee made its recomThe mendation months ago, and awarded an increase of 3d. per lb. The 1st July has long since passed, but the dairyand farmers are still waiting for the higher price. Mr AnHhony. Many farmers have very low incomes during the winter months, and often thecream cheque is scarcely enough to pay the rent. Yet the Prime Minister has not yet honoured hie promise. The committee is the dairy-farmers' arbitration court, and its findings are his basic wage.. One can imagine the outcry there wouldi be if the basic wage itself were denied tothose entitled to it for one-tenth of thetime the dairy-farmers have been denied' the increased price awarded to them.. Apparently, there is one rule for thefarmer, and another for those favoured, by the Government. The Commonwealth blames the Stateprices authorities, but that is merely an. attempt to draw a red herring across the trail. There is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from granting a subsidy on butter as it still does on tea. In my opinion, a subsidy rather than a priceincrease is best for both producer and consumer. It enables the 'consumer tobuy at a lower price, and to get back something from the taxes he pays, whilethe producer has the advantage of a widermarket because the price is lower. If the Commonwealth and the States do not wish to grant a price that will cover production costs, there is a simple remedy.. The British Government will pay 2s. 9d. per lb. f.o.b. for all butter purchased' under contract. That, however, is besidethe point. The Australian housewife isentitled to butter. It is the Government's duty to see that she can get it at a pricewhich is fair both to the producers and consumers. At the present time, the Australian butter producer is amongst the world's lowest paid workers. He has been denied the advantage of post-warprosperity, in contrast with the treatment received by the farmers of Canada, the United States of America, Denmark, and Great Britain itself. The British farmer their is paid for his milk at a ratedown equivalent to approximately 5s. per Very little butter made in Britain, practically the whole output of the dairying industry beingconsumed in the form of liquid milk."" Government of the United Kingdom has wisely safeguarded its agricultural industry. It recognizes that the health well-being of its people depend upon giving a fair deal to the farmers. The day is coming when Australian governments will have to act and think in the way if they are to ensure the provision of adequate supplies of food for our people. We are accustomed to regard ourselves - as a mighty primary producing country. The fact is, however, that apart from wheat and wool, Australia is a negligible factor in the total production of food, although nature intended it to be a great factor. There are fewer dairy cows in rnilk in Australia than in the United Kingdom. In 1948, there were in Ausfarm. tralia 2,267,000 dairy cows, whereas in the United Kingdom there were 2,278,000. Total milk production for all purposes is less in Australia than in Britain. I 1947, the dairies of the United Kingdom produced 1,452,000,000 gallons of milk, - or almost 300,000,000 gallons more than the dairies of Australia. The British - Government is stimulating agriculture incentives of many kinds. For milk, it pays the equivalent of 5s. per lb. for butter, arid it pays subsidies to the farmers for every acre of fodder sown. It bonus of £4 for every dairy heifer calf raised to the age of twelve months. As - a consequence, the number of dairy heifer - calves under twelve months of age in - Great Britain was 1,457,000 in 1948. Australia, in the same year, the number was 727,000. Thus, the United Kingdom produced in 1948 twice as many yearling - dairy heifer calves as the whole of Australia. Stock needed to replace our herds in Australia is being sold daily veal to sausage makers, because the of the Government makes it unprofitable to rear the calves. The Minister speaks stabilization, but offers stabilization when the world market offers lucrative returns over a long period. The latest London report on the subject estimates that, for so far ahead as 1951, the world siipply of fats, including butter, will be almost 1,000,000 tons short of world's requirements. Almost every country in the world, - except Australia, is encouraging dairy production in the same way as Britain is encouraging it. In America and - Canada, satisfactory prices are assured. In Denmark, the contract price is equivalent to 3s. per lb. for butter, and production is rapidly approaching the pre-war level. In Holland, production has same progressed to the stage that butter rationing was abolished on the 1st July. But in Australia, under a Labour Government, butter rationing is still in force. Australia is one of the few countries in the world to retain butter rationing, and we cannot properly supply the needs of our own people, let alone supply as much to Britain as we should do. The return to the dairy farmer is insufficient to enable him to pay reasonable wages in order to keep his children on the An investigation into the ages of those who persevere in the industry would show that they are mostly men and women n of 45 years of age or more. The young people are taking better-paid jobs in the towns and cities. The price paid for dairy produce does not enable farmers to compete with the wages paid to bread by carters, railway porters, &c. Even the increased price now under discussion does not constitute an incentive price, but it would be a step in the right direction pays a if the dairy-farmers could get it. There should be no further delay. The increased price of 3d. per lb., made retrospective from the 1st July, should be included in the next factory cheque paid In to Australian dairy-farmers.",18
51,Mr FRASER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Eden-Monaro) [3.35]. - Action s are supposed to speak louder than words. The honourable member for dairy Richmond (Mr Anthony) has spoken as very loudly but he was a member policy of a government that neglected the opportunity of doing some justice to the of dairy-farmer. In those days not one only dairy-farmer in one hundred had an income sufficient to require him to pay income tax. The authority for that statement is the honourable member for Richmond himself. Speaking in the House of Representatives on the 26th May, 1938, the when an administration that he supported was in office, the honourable member saidOut of 12,275 dairy-farmers in Queensland, only 1)9 had taxable incomes last year in excess of £250 a year. Instead of abusing this Government for its treatment of the dairy-farmers, the honourable gentleman should be abusing members of his own party for their disgraceful treatment of the dairy-farmers in those years when they had to be content vvitb. 8d., 3d. or lOd. per lb. for butter. Wheu all the dairy-farmers in Australia asked the Menzies Government, which was supported by the Australian Country party, for an increase, the Menzies Government shelved the matter and took no action of any kind. Yet, not one member of the Australian Country party in the Parliament dared to say one word about that Government's disgraceful treatment of the dairy-farmers. No one will deny that today the dairy-farmer is being deprived of 2i per lb. for butter which has been shown to be necessary to bring his return up to the cost of production. No accurate historian will deny the reasons. To realise the reasons one has only to go back to the referendum at which the future of rhe control of prices in Australia was decided, and read the advertisements published by the Liberal party and the Australian Country party in which they urged the dairy-farmers to vote against the continuance of Commonwealth control of prices. The result of the referendum was that the power to provide reasonable prices for dairy products reverted to State governments. Nothing is more shameful in retrospect than the assurance then given to the dairy-farmers by representatives of the Australian Country party and of the Liberal party that they would be better off with the transfer to the State governments of power to control prices. Had the Australian Government not lost the power to control prices, the dairy-farmers would be receiving 2-£d. per lb. more for their butter than they are receiving. They are not receiving that extra payment because the control of prices is in the hands of six separate State governments, three of which are Liberal party governments. There is no possibility of those six governments, three of which represent vested financial interests, reaching a united decision that would give justice to the dairy farmers. If the honourable member for Richmond were earnest in his desire to assist dairy-farmers, he would not raise his voice against this Government, which is the only one that has ever tried to provide justice for the dairying industry, but he would raise his voice in anger against the betrayal by his colleagues of every promise that they made to the Wr. Fraser. dairy-farmers to induce them to vote against continuance of Commonwealth control of prices. He, of course>has also had his part in that betrayal. He would use his best endeavours to persuade his colleagues in the State governments to give to the dairy-farmers the price that they are entitled to receive. It is true that an assurance was given to the dairying in dustry, in good faith, by this Government. When it gave that assurance, it possessed control over prices. The assurance was accepted by the industry, equally in good faith. It is true that that undertaking should be honoured. It is equally true that the primary obligation to honour it now rests upon the six State governments. It is also true that because the dairy-farmers are loyal and patient and hard working, and are not men who indulge readily in direct action, they have not received from the State governments the justice that they are entitled to. I understand that the State governments have not even communicated finally to this Government their refusal to allow the butter producers the additional price that is necessary to cover their cost of production. If the State governments finally conveyed to this Government their refusal to pay a just price to the butter producers, I believe that the obligation would then rest upon this Government to take every step within its power to ensure the honouring of the undertaking given by it and accepted by the dairying industry in good faith. I do not know what method could be adopted to ensure that end in view of the extraordinarily difficult situation created by the defeat of the referendum as the result of the false propaganda of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party which was designed to induce the dairy farmers and other Australian electors to vote to end Commonwealth control of prices and transfer the control to the States. I do not know whether, in the event of the State governments refusing to pay to the dairy-farmers a just price, it would be possible for this Government to withhold from money due from it to the State governments a sufficient amount to enable the price of butter to be subsidized until such time as the State governments came to heel and agreed to give justice to dairying industry. The only answer the honourable member's contention that this Government has been niggardly in its treatment of the dairying industry is that it is utterly false. The coalition Liberal party and Australian Country party Government led by the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) paying refused every plea by the industry for an increased price at a time when, the evidence of the honourable member for Richmond, not one dairy-farmer in 100 earned £250 a year. Such a state of affairs continued over a long of years. As soon as Labour took office, it was energetically active in ensuring that the dairy-farmer should be justly rewarded for his arduous toil. The dustry Advisory Committee. relevant figures are on record and known by every dairy-farmer. Not dairy-farmer in Eden-Monaro will ever again accept the word of the Australian Country party.",21
52,Mr FRANCIS,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Moreton) [3.45] - I support the motion made by the honour the able member for Richmond (Mr while Anthony) for the adjournment of the State governments. House to discuss the urgently important subject of the dairying industry of Australia and the Government's failure honour the promise of. the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) to the dairy-farmers. listen to the honourable member for Edenteed Monaro (Mr Eraser) one would think that there was no other primary industry besides the dairying industry that had received the benefit of increased prices during the war period. The price of almost all primary commodities rose rapidly in war-time because of the subthe stantial increases in the elements of duction costs, such as transport charges, wages and other items. I remind the on honourable member that the price of wheat sold in a free market rose to more than £1 a bushel and that the price of wool rose to more than lOOd. per lb. Meat prices also rose considerably. But it was a Labour goverament which pegged the price of butter and made impossible for butter producers to share in the increased prices that were availis able in the markets of the world. honourable member made no reference that fact. Butter producers are still barred from obtaining the benefit of the overseas prices, which are now about to 2s. 9d. a lb. The honourable member is trying to shelter behind the fact that the people refused the Government permanent power to control prices. The Government has been paying a subsidy of about £3,000,000 on 'butter producfor a very long time and is still it, and it is able, if it chooses to pay the increased price that it underon took to pay. It is nonsense and pure bluff to say that the Government cannot honour its promise to the hard-working dairymen. Such statements amount to period an attempt to pass, the buck to the States. The Government should pay the butter producers the price that was fixed by the Joint Dairy In The are honourable member for Eden-Monaro one is doing a great disservice to the primary producers of his electorate by not fighting for the primary industries. It is most improper for him not to ask the Government to honour the promises that it made, and to leave primary producers high and dry the Government wrangles with the The Government's promises regarding to the price of butter were made in 1947 when the Prime Minister himself To promised that a price would be guaranto the producers for five years. That period has not yet elapsed. The price was to be guaranteed according to the cost factors determined by the committee which was composed of economists, oflicers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and representatives of producers. That committee has made proseveral recommendations to the Government, but the Government has not acted its report although it should have done so many months ago. The butter producers should have received an increase of at least 3d. per lb. from the 1st July last. It is now October and the Government is still wrangling about it, although its promises in 1947 regarding butter it prices were unqualified. The dairying industry is languishing today because it unable to obtain the materials that it The requires to carry on. The Minister to laughed just now when I said that the industry was languishing. It is of no high use for him to laugh because I assert that, if this industry were prosperous its production would not be falling off as it is doing at present. Not only is production falling off but the number of dairy stock in Australia is rapidly decreasing. An examination of country newspapers published in the dairy-farming districts would show that whole dairy herds are being disposed of. That is happening because dairy-farmers are finding it impossible to carry on under present circumstances. Yet the Minister laughs. I rose primarily to ask that the Government honour its 1947 promises. The Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, as I have stated, recommended an increase of 3d. per lb. in the price of butter, and nothing has been said by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro nor is there anything that the Minister could say, that could justify the Government's failure to honour its promise. If the Minister can show that the promise was not made, then I should have to regard the matter from another aspect, but I know that he cannot do so. I am familiar with the difficulties of the dairying industry, and I know that those engaged in it work hard and for long hours for 365 days a year, in winter, summer, autumn, and spring, in hail, rain .or snow. They are surely entitled to a just return. There is no industry in Australia today that has been so roughly treated and received so little consideration as has dairying industry. I know that prices for dairy products increased during the war, but that increase was not in proportion to the increases that took place in the prices of goods .produced by other industries. If the prices for dairy products had not risen during the war the dairying industry would be in a worse position than it is now. The increase of prices during the war was recommended by a committee that was established to investigate conditions in the industry. A similar committee later recommended, as I have said an increase of 3d. per lb. in the price of butter but the Government has deliberately refused to give effect to that recommendation. It is of no use for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to say that the States should tackle the problem, and that if they do not tackle it then the Mr Francis. Australia Government ought to do so. I take the view that the Government has an obligation to pay the increased price to the producers as from the 1st July last. There should be no dilly-dallying till the eve of an election when the Government might make some proposition in the hope of influencing country electors. Such an action is unworthy of any government and I trust that the Minister will not be a party to it but will see that the increased price is paid now without any further procrastination. The dairying industry has done more to develop closer settlement than has any other industry, and it will continue to do so if it is sustained by fair treatment. I believe that the present fall in production in the industry must be attributed to unsatisfactory prices and the Government's shilly-shallying, and I trust that we shall have an announcement from the Minister today that he intends to honour the Government's promises forthwith.  Commerce and Agriculture) [3.54] - I can quite understand the concern of some honourable members over the delay in paying dairymen the found and ascertained cost of production of butter that was determined by the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee and that was intended to be applied from the 1st July last. What I the cannot understand is the necessity for the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) always to couch his remarks in a most intemperate and inaccurate manner. I am particularly unable to understand his attitude, when I consider the opportunities that he had in his time as a Minister in a Liberal-Country party government to do something really practical for the dairying industry. During the course of his speech, most of which was written",23
53,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I wrote it myself!  honourable gentleman said that no industry has ever been treated in such a niggardly fashion as has the dairying industry. On the .contrary, every dairy-farmer in Australia knows that never at any time in the history of Australia has the industry been in a more prosperous condition. That does not deny the justification for the assertion of butter producers that they should be given the found cost of production but nevertheless it is true that the industry has never been more prosperous than it is today. If honourable members were to refer to the newspapers that are published in the western district of Victoria, which is a very great centre of the dairying industry, they would find that the balance-sheets of the co-operative companies in that district are at an all-time high. I read last week, in the journal of a primary producers' organzation in New South ""Wales, a report that gave the all-time record profits of the various factories in New South Wales that handle dairy products.. The balance-sheets of those factories reflect very accurately the prosperity of the dairying industry, because almost without exception they are co-operative factories. How then, can the charge made by the honourable member for Richmond, that the dairying industry is the most niggardly treated industry in Australia be valid. In this chamber, in 1941, he stood up and told the most harrowing story I have ever heard about primary industries in any country. I advise him to referto the Hansard record and refresh his memory about that vivid story of his about farm fences falling down, gates hanging on one hinge, cowsheds falling to pieces, homes deteriorating and women and chldren crying at the gates. He painted that heart-rending picture despite the fact that governments of which he had been a member had had the opportunity to assist the primary industries in the long periid between 1932 and 1941. How was he able to paint that harrowing picture if the industry at that time was being treated properly ? The honora.ble member also dealt in more inaccuracies. He told us today that butter has had to be rationed because of the decline of butter production. He knows that that is untrue. Any decline in butter production has been primarily associated with the. fact that the Menzies Government early in the war allowed recruitment of men from the dairying industry. No action was taken to prevent the drain of dairy farm labour into the military forces.",24
54,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The present Government conscripted such labour.  the honourable gentleman once when he was making his speech, and he should not interrupt me. Any interruption he makes will not put me off. Recruitment of farm labour continued right up to the time that the Labour Government took office. That Government immediately took steps to see that dairy-farmers, their sons, and their employees were placed in the category of employees in reserved occupations. To that extent the rot was stopped, but it was rather too late. Butter rationing was not caused by a decline in production. The honourable gentleman knows that when the government of which he was a member was in office it talked much of what it would do for Britain, and flaunted its patriotism, but that it was not until a Labour Government took office in 1941 that butter rationing was instituted, not to meet the conditions caused by a decline in production, but to give practical application to our belief that we should help our less fortunate fellow citizens in other parts of the world. Although the war has been over three years, and there is always the possibility of a repetition of the disastrous droughts of 1945-46, this Government has continued to ration butter, not to offset the decline in production but to help our less fortunate kinsfolk in the United Kingdom and the people of other European countries. The honourable member's hypocritical statement that the decline in butter production is responsible for butter rationing was deliberately intended to mislead the people. What are the facts? Notwithstanding the facts that during the war years the dairying industry suffered greatly through enlistments of farm labourers and dairymen in the armed forces and that the disastrous droughts of 1944-45 and 1945-46 decimated our dairy herds, production is now substantially above normal pre-war levels. It is true that there has been a fall in the volume of butter produced, but as I have said over and over again in this House the increased spending power in the hands of the people, which enables them to purchase greatly increased quantities of whole milk, means that less cream is available for the manufacture of butter. Let us consider how the consumption of whole milk has increased in Sydney and Newcastle. In comparison with pre-war years the consumption of whole milk in those two cities alone has increased by 26,000,000 gallons, or a quantity sufficient to make 6,000 tons of butter. On that figure we could reasonably estimate the increased quantity of whole milk consumed in the other capital cities at 26,000,000 gallons. Thus, throughout the whole of Australia, it would be safe to assume that increased consumption of whole milk would account for the loss of 20,000 tons of butter. It is pertinent to point out that in 1935, which was one of the worse years in the economic history of the Commonwealth, milk production reached its highest peak in our history. What was the cause of that? At that time the unemployment situation was so desperate that the sons of dairy farmers were compelled to stay on the farms because they could not find work elsewhere. Their parents were in such straitened circumstances that they could not afford to send their children to the cities to be trained as lawyers, engineers, doctors or artisans. They had to stay on the farms. In these days a dairy-farmer is able to make an adequate living from 40 or 50 cows. In those days, in order to ward off the demands of the banker or the financier, a dairy-farmer had to milk ten to twenty cows more than he had to milk during periods when prices were normal. It is undeniable that if the remuneration of the dairy-farmer becomes too great it may have a tendency to depress rather than to increase production. I:fi a dairy-farmer can obtain a sufficient income by milking 40 cows, why should he milk 50 cows? If the price of milk is fixed too high there is an inherent danger that production will fall, but that fact does not deter the Government from ensuring that the dairy-farmer receives a fair price for his product. The honourable member for Richmond expressed a very provocative opinion, which is characteristic of his whole  outlook on this matter, when he said that there was no inducement to keep children on the farm. Does the honourable member think that every dairy-farmer in this country should be indiuced to keep his children on the farm ? Many dairymen want their sons and daughters to be doctors, teachers, nurses, or, maybe, politicians. Does the honourable member think that this Government should do something to keep the children of dairymen on the farms? When he himself was assisting the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture the children of our dairy-farmers had no alternative but to stay on the farms. For them, it was a case of stay on the farms or starve. The honourable member also dragged another old herring across the trail when he told the people that we are not bleeding our kinsfolk in the United Kingdom hard enough by charging them only the cost of production of our butter. He contrasted the price paid for Australian butter with the price charged for butter from Denmark and other countries. He has said that, becatise the Danes, the Canadian? and the people of Ireland have been able to extort from the United Kingdom a few more pence a pound than we have requested this Government should be condemned. He conveniently ignored the fact that our long term butter contract with the United Kingdom, which will operate until 1955, is much more satisfactory than were those made by the United Kingdom with other supplying countries. He conveniently forgot that in Denmark the cost of meal, cereal grains and other stock feed is substantially higher than it is in Australia, and consequently the cost of production in that country is greater than it is here. He also forgot to mention that deliveries from Denmark can be made in a few hours. What he also neglected to say wa.s that this Government has been able to bring the price paid for Australian dairy products up to the level of the price obtained on the United Kingdom market by the dairy farmers of New Zealand. Another rotten inaccuracy was his statement of the purposes for which the grant of £250.000 to the dairying industry of Australia is being expended. He said that the whole amount would be spent by publicity officials. He did not tell the people that the grant bas been allocated to the State governments and is being expended by them through their Departments of Agriculture to assist and subsidize herd testing, sire testing, pasture improvement and the like. Not one Commonwealth officer will be employed on that work. No publicity officers are employed on it. Again, the honourable member was merely indulging in untrue and false propaganda. I should not have minded his moving this motion had he dealt with his submission on its merits; but he failed to do so. The Government entered into a specific undertaking to do certain things for the dairying industry of this country. A referendum was subsequently held and the Government was robbed of its power to pass on to the consumers of Australia the dairyman's additional costs of production. The need for passing on to the consumers [he increased costs of producing butter was unpalatable to a Labour government, but we did so in accordance with our obligation to maintain the price structure in Australia. In the first year of operation of the plan for the assistance of the dairying industry the additional cost was passed on to the consumer under the powers then possessed by the Commonwealth, but at the same time we paid a subsidy of 6d. per lb. on every pound of butter consumed in the Commonwealth. At the moment the situation is fluid. We are still negotiating with the State Premiers and we' hope that they will at least do the right thing and maintain throughout the length and breadth of Australia a, uniform price structure on an organized basis. If that is done the dairy-farmers will receive their ascertained cost of production. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) has said that this Government pegged the price of butter. What are the facts in relation to that matter? A government of which the honourable member was himself a member appointed Professor Copland as Commonwealth Prices Commissioner and that distinguished gentleman, acting within the authority conferred upon him by a non-Labour government, pegged the price of butter in Australia. We have merely maintained the pegged price. The honor[35] able member, from a propaganda motive, attempted to convey the impression that the Labour Government is the big bad wolf in this matter. Responsibility for the pegging of the price of butter rests entirely on a non-Labour government of which he was a member. The Labour Government continued to apply that policy. But it also did something more positive. It appointed a special committee to ascertain the costs of production in the dairying industry. The recommendations of that committee were accepted and made effective by the Australian Government when it had authority to act. On every occasion that an increase in the price of butter was reported by the committee to be warranted, we accepted our responsibility to the dairy-farmers and increased the price. We were robbed of our price-fixing powers largely as the result of the false propaganda indulged in by honourable members opposite and their powerful friends. As the result of their false propaganda the effectiveness of overall Commonwealth prices control as administered by the Commonwealth in the interests of the people generally was destroyed.

Question so resolved in the negative. NOES. STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE BILL 1949. In Committee of Ways and Means:",28
57,Mr DEDMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [4.24] - I move That, on and after the eleventh day of October, One thousand nine hundred and fortynine, in lieu of the rate imposed by the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947, the rate of the charge in respect of the employment of waterside workers be Two pence half-penny for every man-hour of employment. Under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947, a charge was .imposed on employers of waterside workers at the rate of 4&i. for every man-hour of employJ. ment. The proceeds of this charge have been credited to the Consolidated Revenue 23 Eund, and, in accordance with the .pro34 visions of the Stevedoring Industry Acts of 1947 and 1949, equivalent amounts 11 have been paid to the Stevedoring Industry Commission and to the .Australian. AYES. Stevedoring Industry Board, which replaced the former body as from July, 1949. The funds of the board are used for the payment of attendance money towaterside workers, administrative costs and the provision of .amenities to waterside workers. The purpose of this resolution is to reduce the charge to 2£d. a 'man-hour of employment on .and from the l l t h NOES. October, 1949, as it has been found that the rate of 4jd. a 'man-hour has produced revenue in excess of requirements. .The charge imposed in 1947 was based on an estimate of 30,000,000 man-hours of employment of waterside workers a year. However, the number of man-hours has substantially increased, and in the year ended the 30th June, 1949, there were approximately 35,750,000 ntanJiours. As a consequence, at the 30th June, 1949, the commission had accumulated funds of about £250,000, after allowing for liabilities incurred. It isanticipated that the reduction of the charge to 2Jd. will result in the board's PAIRS. funds being progressively reduced over the next few years. The diminishing balance will provide a reasonable reserveof working capital to cover unforeseen circumstances. I commend the .resolution! to honourable members. Progress reported. ESTIMATES 1949-50.

58,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Fawkner) [4.27] - I find a little difficulty in relating the matter that I desire to raise to a specific item in the proposed vote for the Department - of the Treasury, and am in a quandary, because I am unable to find an appropriate item elsewhere in the Estimates. Some little time ago, I asked a question about the acquisition of Craig's Buildings in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne. I endeavoured to ascertain the purchase price, and the cost of alterations to date, and of furnishing and equipping the buildings. I also asked whether office furniture had been manufactured in Sydney for use in the buildings, and had been - delivered by furniture vans to Melbourne. I further sought to elicit how many of those deliveries were made. The reply that I received was to the effect that the property known as Craig's Buildings in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, had not been purchased by the Commonwealth, but was owned by the Commonwealth Bank, and, therefore, the Minister to whom I addressed the question was not in a position to give the information to me. My reason for raising these matters",29

60,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The reason why I am - raising this matter on the Estimates for the Department of the Treasury is that the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), I understand, controls or is in a position of authority in relation to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank.",29
61,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,-Order! Mr Holt. - There is no other reference to the Commonwealth Bank,29

64,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order! The Estimates for the Department of the Treasury do not include an item relating to the Commonwealth Bank.,29
65,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The point that I desire to put to the Chair is that, presumably, in the course of the consideration of the Estimates, honourable members will be in order in referring to expenditure that comes under the authority of the Treasurer by virtue of the general control that he exercises over the Commonwealth Bank. That institution is in a different position from that of a public company, which is responsible to its shareholders, or of a government department, about the expenditure of which honourable members can elicit from the responsible Minister any information that they require, because we are not able to pursue either of those two normal methods of inquiry.",29
66,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order! The honourable member may find under the Standing Orders other means of raising the matter. There is no reference in the Estimates for the Department of the Treasury to the matter raised by the honourable member. He may not pursue his present argument any further.,29
67,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I shall not pursue the argument about Craig's Buildings, but I am mystified to know how the public, who are interested in this matter, can pursue their inquiries through their representatives in the Parliament. The Commonwealth Bank is not a public company, and it is not, apparently, a branch of the administration.",29

72,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order! The honourable member is trying to make a second-reading speech. To what item of expenditure is he now referring ?,30
73,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I intended to refer to the acquisition by the Commonwealth Bank of shares in private trading banks.,30

75,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"This matter comes under the general administration of the Treasurer. If I may not discuss it on this proposed vote, on what part of the Estimates may I do so?",30
76,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The Commonwealth Bank acquired the shares of its own volition. It was not the act of the Government.,30
77,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Surely we are entitled to discuss actions of the Treasurer which involve the Commonwealth in added expenditure, and which concern the acquisition of property by Commonwealth departments. If the Commonwealth Bank applies extensively the policy of buying shares in trading banks, then either this year or next provision will have to be made",30
78,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order! The CommonwealthBank itself financed the purchase of the shares. The Government had nothing to do with the transaction.,30
79,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,It is generally admitted that the Treasurer controls the Commonwealth Bank.,30
80,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The Commonwealth does not control the Commonwealth Bank. The Chair is not prepared to argue the matter any further with the honourable member.,30

85,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The matter referred to comes under the Estimates not of the Treasury, but of "" Miscellaneous Services "".",30
86,Mr TTJRNBULL,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Ver y well. Then let me point out that expenditure by the Department of the Treasury has shown a substantial increase, no less, indeed, than £254,029. This has occurred at a time when the Government is appealing to the people through posters and pamphlets to save money. The Government should itself set a better example, a fact which ought to be pointed out as the Estimates for each successive department are being considered. If the Government is unable to practise what it preaches, how can it expect the people to pay any heed to its preaching? Expenditure is constantly increasing, and the people are not getting value for the money expended. The Government tells people to save, but having put their money in .the savings bank its value constantly declines as time goes on. Those who disregarded the Government's advice, and bought motor cars and farm implements, did more good for the country than was done by those who saved.",30
87,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The honourable member began by criticizing excess expenditure by the Treasury, but he went on to talk of motor cars. There is no connection between the two things.",30

94,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Fawkner) [4.39] - I hope that I shall be able to satisfy you, Chairman, that the remarks I make in this debate are not contrary to the Standwas ing Orders. The proposed vote for the Attorney-General's Department shows a considerable increase over the expenditure for 1945-49. In fact it shows an increase of more than £50.000, and there is an laneous Services "". increase of about £75,000 in the proposed vote as compared with that of the previous year. Normally, we would not begrudge increased expenditure by the Attorneycases General's Department if it could be shown that the public were receiving service, and that protection which the Attorneyorganizations General is normally required to extend to citizens. The portfolio of Attorneyuphold General is one of the most important the Administration, and the Attorneylimits. General has the high responsibility of seeing that the laws of the Commonwealth are administered fairly and interpreted accurately. It is the duty of his departwas ment to protect the free people of the Commonwealth against those who violate Commonwealth laws. It is the duty of the Attorney-General to maintain the Constitution for the benefit of the people, panies I but the .present Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), who has occupied the position for a number of years, has earned an unenviable reputation in that regard. In the past, we have looked to the Attorney General to enforce the Constitution those who would defy it. However, in recent years it has become necessary for citizens of the Commonwealth time, time and time again, to expend I their own money in order to defend the Constitution against the Attorney General. Some of the legislation which the Attorney-General has inspired or applied has been successfully challenged on one or another. I do not propose to go into details, because this is, perhaps, the proper place; but the issues will be sufficiently familiar to honourable memI shall recite some of them. First of all, there were the two leading cases affecting banking legislation-the action brought by the Melbourne City Council against the Commonwealth, and that brought by the combined banks-in which State governments intervened-o n the nationalization of banking.",31

98,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"To the item covering general costs of administration by Attorney-General of his department. Surely this is an opportunity for us to examine, when such huge expenditures are involved, whether the Attorneybunal General's Department is serving the public properly, or whether it has failed the people in recent years because of policy applied by the Government. I am trying to make the point that one of functions of the Attorney-General's Department is to uphold the CommonCommonwealth, wealth Constitution.

107,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Then I shall deal with Estithe High Court as an instrument funcfor the interpretation of the Constitution and for the protection of the people against violation of the Constitution. We have to ask ourselves the whether the High Court is the proper instrument for that purpose. We, on this side, have always taken the view that the High Court is the highest judicial triin the Commonwealth of Australia, but that any case of great importance, whether it be a constitutional case or a the case under the common law in which the rights of private citizens are involved, the should be finally determined by the highest judicial tribunal in the British the Privy Council.",32

135,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I confess to being some300 what baffled as to how far one may proceed in dealing with matters relating to .. 615 the Attorney-General's Department. I do not know of any opportunity the Parliament is likely to have to discuss the High Court other than that presenbsd by the Estimates. We make an annual provision for the High Court.,33
136,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,".Salarie s of the justices of the High Court are provided by statute, not by an annual vote.",34
137,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,May I not discuss the future of the High Court?,34
138,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,At the appropriate time. The Chair is not preventing the honourable gentleman from taking the appropriate opportunity to say what he wants to say.,34
139,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The High Court has served Australia well, and it merits the continuing respect of Australia. The people are entitled to be told by the Attorney-General what is the attitude of his department and the Government to the High Court. Do they regard it as the final court of appeal on matters, constitutional or other, that arise in this country, or does the Government take the view that the High Court is not to be the final court of appeal, but that the system that has prevailed up to the present shall continue? You, Mr Temporary Chairman, say that that is a matter of policy and that it may not be discussed. I do not know where else in the Estimates there are provisions that would enable honourable members to place before the Attorney-General matters that, although they may be matters of policy, certainly affect the status of instrumentalities that come under the general supervision of the Attorney-General. I hope that the Attorney-General will make clear to the public the attitude of the Government to the High Court as a court of appeal. The Estimates for the Attorney-General's Department provide for increased expenditure on the High Court. Obviously the subdivision "" A Salaries and Payments in the nature of Salary"", does not refer to the salaries of the justices of the High Court.",34
140,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The salaries of justices are not dealt in the Estimates. They are the subject of a special appropriation by the Parliament.,34
141,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Obviously , the reference is not to the salaries of the justices the High Court, but I notice that the provision for salaries and allowances year is about 25 per cent, greater than it was last year. Possibly the reference is to justices' associates or officers attached to the justices. I wonder whether the increase indicates the appointment of additional associates or officers and whether that in turn implies the appointment of additional justices.",34
142,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,No . The appointment of justices is dealt with in the statute governing their appointment. The increased provision is due to increased cost of living payments and normal incremental advancement. No policy is involved in the increase. It is simply obedience of arbitration awards.,34
143,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"There are two other matters that I desire to refer to. The first is Division 46, ""Court of Conciliation and Arbitration"". Again, I hope that what may be described as a matter of policy may be referred to under this heading, for I assume that it is the proper place at which to discuss it. Under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court Act, the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner are required to present annual reports to the Parlisiment, and, in their last reports, the Chief Judge and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner both made recommendations, the adoption of which they considered would improve and strengthen the system of conciliation and arbitration. To the best of my knowledge, no action has been taken by the Government to carry out those recommendations, although about twelve months has elapsed since they were made. If the system of conciliation and arbitration, to which we all are pledged, is to continue successfully, why has the Government seen fit not to adopt those recommendations?",34
144,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Whic h recommendations?,34
145,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"There was a recommendation that the Arbitration Court be given stronger disciplinary powers. with There was a recommendation that there should be better co-ordination of the decisions of conciliation commissioners in order to achieve uniformity. A . recommendation was made that the existof ing prohibition on the appearance of lawyers at hearings in the Arbitration this Court and before conciliation commissioners be removed, because in the opinion of the Chief Judge and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner the presence of counsel was, generally speaking, of assistance to all parties. I think that thf Attorney-General will also find that thern were a number of other recommendations of a like nature. I. turn now to the Commonwealth In vestigation Service. I consider that the Parliament has never had explained to it in clear enough terms just what the functions of that service are, nor has it been, told how many persons are employed in it. We appreciate that much of its work must be of a secret nature and that it is not always expedient to give to the Parliament information that has been secured by that service. I consider that all of us in this free country are concerned about the maintenance, inside a government department, of what is in effect a police service but which is not of the same character as are the police services in the States. It is a police service over and above the ordinary police services that are provided for the protection of the community, and I consider that the Parliament should at least be given a clearer understanding than has been given of what is being done by it, and how th* problems that come before it are being handled. The present debate would be a convenient opportunity for the Attorney General to enlighten us on that point.",34
146,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Fremantle) [5.2] - 1 refer to Division 49, ""Patents, Trade Marks and Designs "" and direct the attention of the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to a complaint that I have received concerning that section of his department. Some time ago I received the complaint, from several of my constituents that, having submitted to the Patents Office projects which they desired to have patented, they had received no information about their applications for periods of as long as two years. The complaint seems to be general that there is an enormous backlog of work in the Patents Office. I am certain that the Attorney General realizes that the work of those who desire to proceed with the manufacture of articles that they wish to have patented may be held up by their inability to obtain patents. Will the Attorney General say whether the problem is one of Staffing, or otherwise? I know of an employee of the Attorney-General's Department itself having submitted the plans of an engineering device and having to wait for nine months for the device to be tested. I attended to some of the correspondence involved in that matter, and I know that the replies by the department to various representations regarding the delay seemed to be rather unsatisfactory and vague. I shall be glad if the Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong, but it appears to me that the Patents Office may not be offering salaries that will induce engineers and other persons with sufficiently high qualifications to pass judgment on the work of other engineers, to join the staff. It is generally believed, particularly among engineers, that the Patents Office is not obtaining the most highly qualified engineers and that' there are not enough employees in it competent to pass judgment on projects submitted for patenting. I turn now to the High Court of Australia. Will the Attorney-General explain why there is such a backlog of oases in the High Court? I shall refer to one case, though, of course I shall not deal with its merits, as it is sub judice. The delay in dealing with that particular case has held up the hearing of two other cases. It is the prosecution of Mr L. L. Sharkey. Because of the delay in completing that case no steps have been taken in the charges of sedition against a gentleman named Burns and another gentleman named Healy, who hails from Western. Australia. The Sharkey case was submitted to the High Court many months ago, but has not yet been completed. I maintain that a charge of sedition is a grave one, and I should like to know why the High Court is not dealing with such charges with more expedition. Mr HAItRISON (Wentworth) [5.6] I refer to Division 46 which relates to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I trust that you, Mr Temporary Chairman, will give me exactly the same latitude as you accorded to honourable members l<tst night when they discussed the Department of Externa] Affairs.",35
147,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,""" I ask the honourable gentleman not to take last night's debate as a precedent.",35
148,Mr HARRISON,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"You were in the chair last night, Mr Temporary Chairman, and I naturally thought that you had established a precedent. The item with which I desire to deal relates to the general expenses of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I notice that this year's proposed vote is markedly greater than last year's. The increase on five items amounts, to £14,000 and there is also an increase of about £10,000 on another two items. The proposed vote for travelling and subsistence is increased from £12,000 last year to £16,000 this year. The proposed vote for incidental and other expenditure has risen from £7,000 to £13,300. When the sixteen conciliation commissioners were appointed some honourable members on this - side of the chamber considered that their .appointment was designed by the Government eventually to destroy the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as a full - court. The estimated expenditure on the - staffs of the sixteen conciliation commissioners appears at page 243 of the Estimates. We on this side of the committee consider that the Attorney-General may at this juncture, when we are dealing with the proposed expenditure on these staffs, tell the committee just how these conciliation commissioners are, in the vernacular, ""making out"", because quite obviously the appointment of these men, whose activities were separated into watertight compartments, cut across the main principles of Commonwealth Arbitration Court procedure. Can the Attorney General tell the committee how many cases have been referred by these commissioners to the full Commonwealth Arbitration Court? Have they referred to the court anything associated with industrial matters, and if not, then why not? I ask that because quite obviously only the Full Court can assess the effect of any decisions given by the conciliation commissioners over the whole field of industry. With its peculiar knowledge the Full Court can relate industrial matters affecting on industry not only to the general economy of the country but specifically to other industries. We consider that conciliation commissioners should refer matters to the FuU Court from time to time so that the effect of individual decisions on the general economy of the country may be correlated. Can the Attorney-General also say how many disputes have been settled by the conciliation commissioners? Can he tell us whether those commissioners are worth their salaries and whether the staffs employed by them are discharging their obligations in a way that would warrant a continuance of this experiment in conciliation? Can he tell us what increases of wages and marginal rates these gentlemen have awarded, and what decisions they have reached regarding any other matters associated with the industries that are the particular concern of individual commissioners? Can he give us some indication of what evidence was produced to show that the workers in any particular industry should receive increased wages, or any other considerations that might have a direct and an adverse reflection upon other sections of industry and, through those other sections, upon the general economy of the country? In short, what I desire the Attorney-General to elucidate is whether the ultimate results achieved by these conciliation commissioners are not aimed at the complete destruction of the full functions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and whether the commissioners, each of whom operates in his own small compartment of industry have not, by gradual accretion, brought into being some form of threat to the great principles of arbitration in this country, that must ultimately result in giving effect to the Labour party's policy of the complete destruction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. That is important, because we know that such things are possible.",36
149,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The honourable gentleman's remarks are getting a bit wide of the division under discussion.,36
150,Mr HARRISON,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I admit that, Mr. Temporary Chairman, but I intended my remarks as a passing reference only, and shall not proceed any further along those lines. We know that it is possible to achieve results by indirect methods. In this instance we have the creation of the office of conciliation commissioner, each conciliation commissioner having clearcut duties to perform with no need to refer to the parent body, the full court, even on points of law. The commissioners are a law unto themselves. But their decisions may have repercussions that will affect industry generally and also the national economy as a whole. That is why I consider that we should know more about the position than we now do, before we pass these Estimates which are intended to continue these gentlemen in office so that they may carry out a policy of hari kiri that may end in the destruction, not only of their own offices, but also of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court We should know what matters they have referred to the full court, how many disputes they have settled, how many increases of wages and marginal rates they have awarded, and whether these increases have been related to one another as far as their effect on other industries and on our general economy is concerned. It has been a principle of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the past that no award regarding any industry should be made unless the court took into consideration the effect that it would have on other industries and on the country's economy. That principle has been disposed of entirely by the appointment of these conciliation commissioners with their present powers. I want to know whether they have given any effect to that principle or whether they have taken it into consideration. If not, they are useless in their positions and are a direct menace to the national economy of this country.",36
151,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Denison) [5.15] - I wish to address myself to a matter that has caused me considerable anxiety. If my remarks are out of order, Mr. Temporary Chairman, I shall be glad if you will correct me. I have no desire to make an attack upon the High Court. Indeed, I would be the last person to attempt to degrade an institution that plays such, an important part in the life of the community. My difficulty is that I do not know where the action of the Parliament in making a law ends and where politics begins. I am not clear, and nobody has made clear to me, at what stage we offend against the law. There is something radically wrong with such a set-up. I do not blame for that state of affairs the instrument under which the High Court was established. Let us consider the very much discussed, and vexed subject of banking. Why were we not able before we went to the trouble of introducing legislation into this Parliament",37
152,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH, Order ! The honourable member will not be in order in pursuing that line too far.,37
153,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Why could we not have referred to some judicial body the draft measure for the nationalization of hanking so that we should have had an' opinion as to its constitutionality before it wag. introduced into this chamber?,37
154,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Such a course was tried by a government about twenty years ago but the High Court ruled that the act which provided for prior reference to the judicial body was also unconstitutional.,37
155,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,""" I hope that the honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) does not propose to engage in a constitutional argument. We are considering the Estimates for the Attorney-General's Department.",37
156,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I do not know at what stage of the Estimates I may deal with this matter.,37
157,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,""" The honourable member will be in order in dealing with the functions of the High Court.",37
158,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I have taken the trouble to look up some of the authorities on this matter. The interpretation of the Constitution poses many vexatious problems. I cannot understand why constitutional matters should be referred to a body of lawyers and not to a body of grammarians. I cannot see why a body of lawyers should constitute themselves,37
159,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The honourable member is not in order in pursuing that line of argument.,37
160,Mr HABBISON,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I suggest to the honourable member that he should avoid the use of the word "" constitutional"".",37
161,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I wish to refer specifically to matters affecting the Constitution. The famous Jefferson once saidLaws are made for ordinary understanding,37
162,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order! What Thomas Jefferson had to say about laws has nothing to do with the Estimates of the Attorney-General's Department.,38
163,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Would I be in order if I said something about the High Court?,38
164,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The honourable member may discuss the function of the High Court; but he may not discuss constitutional matters which have no relation to the Estimates of the Attorney-General's Department. honourable member may discuss the desirability of appointing more or having fewer justices, or the salaries paid to justices; but he may not indulge in a long and rambling constitutional argument. The Chair has already given a similar ruling on a number of occasions.",38
165,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I desire to develop a constitutional argument relating to the functions of the High Court.,38
166,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The honourable member may not do so.,38
167,Dr GAHA,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"As that was the only purpose for which I rose, I shall take another opportunity to effect it.",38
168,Mr TTJBNBIJLL,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Wimmera) [5.20]. - I direct the attention of the committee to the great increase that has taken place in the cost of administration in the Attorney-General's Department. The proposed vote for the department for the current financial year is £665,000, compared with £207,000 in 1937-38. Thus, the cost of administration of the department has increased in the last ten years by £458,000. That increase seems to be out of all proportion to the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) that we are now in the "" golden age "". Division 45 covers the administrative costs of the bankruptcy administration. Expenditure on that account last year amounted to £51,141. The proposed vote for this year is £53,000, which represents an increase of £2,000 nearly over the expenditure, and of £4,600 over the vote for 194.8-49. In 1937-38 expenditure on bankruptcy administration amounted to £39,000. Government spokesmen are always boasting about the great prosperity which this country is now enjoying. They are fond of citing statistics to show that the number of bankrupts has reached an all-time low level. Notwithstanding that fact the cost of the bankruptcy administration is increasing by leaps and bounds. It cannot be claimed that our bankruptcy officials are conducting examinations of the affairs of persons who became bankrupt prior to the accession to office of the present Government. Honourable members opposite are constantly reminding us that farmers are steadily reducing their mortgages and overdrafts, and that prosperity abounds throughout the land. If that be so, how The can the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) .explain away the great increase in the cost of the bankruptcy administration? In the so-called dark days of the depression the vote for the bankruptcy administration was only £39,000. If the vote now proposed is reasonable, either the number of bankruptcies must be increasing-and I do not think they are because there is a measure of prosperity in the country as the result of the high prices we are receiving for our export commodities-o r the costs of administration of this government instrumentality are far too high. One wonders how government departments are administered in these days when the expenditure of millions of pounds means nothing to the Government. I should like the Attorney-General to explain fully the reasons for this increased provision.",38
169,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Perhaps the Government is anticipating an increasing number of bankruptcies.,38
170,Mr TURNBULL,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"How otherwise could this increased provision be explained, unless the Attorney-General in his administration of this branch of his department has no regard for the need for economy about which the Prime Minister is always preaching?",38
171,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Northern Territory) [5.27] - Unde r Division 48, ""Commonwealth Investigation Service"", there is provision for a security service and an investigation service in all the States, with, a deputy director in each State. No similar provision has been made for the Northern Territory. I am disturbed by the fact that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) is so remiss in his duty as not to have appointed a security officer in Darwin, which is our most important outpost. I am well aware that officers of the Attorney-General's Department and of the Department of the Interior are engaged on certain phases of security work in Darwin, but I believe that the time has arrived when a special security service should be established there as has been done in the capital cities.",38
172,Mr TURNBULL,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Darwi n is the backdoor to Australia.,39
173,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is so, but we prefer to call it the front door, and it is astonishing that the Government has not established a security service there, especially at a time when the Gommunist hordes with the backing of Moscow have swept through China and are following up the work done on their behalf by "" Jock"" Garden in Indonesia 30 years ago. I should fail in my duty if I did not remind the Government of the threat that lies in the fact that of the 90,000,000 people of Indonesia, 93 per cent, are illiterate and subscribe to the ideology of Russia. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" (Mr. Burke) - Order ! Is the honourable member discussing the Security Service established under the administration of Mr. Justice Reed, as distinct from the Commonwealth Investigation Service? The Security Service is provided for in "" Miscellaneous Services "", under Division 169. Mr BLAIN"" - A m I not permitted to discuss this matter, Mr Deputy Chairman?",39
174,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,That depends on whether the honourable member wishes to discuss the Commonwealth In vestigation Service or the Security Service established under Mr Justice Reed.,39
175,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"We should pay more attention to our Darwin defences, and the establishment of an efficient security service is a very important aspect of our defence measures.",39
176,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order ! The honourable member may not proceed along those lines.,39
177,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Then I shall reserve my further remarks until we have reached the appropriate stage in the Estimates.,39
178,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Parramatta) [5.30] - I seek the assistance of the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) in a matter that is of some importance. The right honourable gentleman will concede that I am one of those members of this chamber who have had a good deal of experience of the work of the Crown Solicitor's Office. As such, I should like to say that I have considerable admiration for the standard of the work that is done in that branch of the Attorney General's Department in the various States, and for the skill and integrity of the staffs. To my mind, they represent some of the finest elements in the Public Service. I grant that, while the war was in progress, a great expansion of the work of the Crown Solicitor's Office in the several States was inevitable. I have not the relevant figures before me, but I am sure that the Attorney-General will agree that that expansion was almost astronomical. However, it was necessary. A spate of work was thrown upon the staff of the Crown law department as a result of war difficulties, prices regulations, national security regulations, and many other pieces of legislation to which the war gave birth. I also concede that, for a period' after the war, it was necessary to maintain a much larger staff than I should expect in time of peace. Having made those preliminary remarks, I ask the Attorney-General to indicate how far the processes of expansion are to continue. The proposed vote for the Crown Solicitor's Office reveals that a steady expansion is taking place. That fact is emphasized by an advertisement that appeared in the press some months ago inviting applications for considerable number of highly paid positions in the Crown Solicitor's Office. A few week ago, I asked the Attorney-General whether the positions had been filled. I cannot recollect the precise answer that the Attorney-General gave, but I think that he said that they had not been filled and that the matter was still under consideration. Perbaps some of the positions have been filled, but I do not think that they have been. I have before me a copy of the Sydney Morndng Herald of the 9th February, 1949, in which some 50 vacant positions for legal officers were advertised. Some of them were very senior appointments indeed. For instance, applications were calledfor the position of first assistant secretary in the legal division of the Attorney-General's Department at a salary range of from £2,500 to £2,638 a year, and also for the position of assistant, secretary on advisings at a salary range beginning at £1,625 a year. Other positions carried lower salaries. I should like the Attorney-General to supply as much information as he can about those positions. I ask hiin to state the number of appointments that have been made, whether it is intended to fill any of the positions that are now vacant, and why that increase of staff is justified. I ask those questions, not because I want to be difficult, as I realise that some of those appointments are necessary, but because the advertisement indicates a striking expansion of staff that one ought not_ to expect when the processes of contraction should have begun. I remind the committee that there has been no increase of Commonwealth powers since the end of the war, and that the powers which the Commonwealth acquired in war-time should be shrinking. Each of the six States has its own legal department, which undertakes a mass of business in the interests of the public and at public expense. Why is it necessary at this stage for the Commonwealth to be expanding in fields which, in peace-time, should be covered by State departments? The advertisement that invited applications for some 50 positions in the Attorney^General's Department, some of them at an extremely high salary, makes one wonder what additional powers and duties the Commonwealth law department is obliged to assume in peace-time that cannot be performed by the States. The Attorney-General and I know that there are branches of the Crown Solicitor's Office, not only in the capital cities, but also in various towns throughout the Commonwealth. I recall that one of those branches is located at Townsville in northern Queensland. I should like the Minister to give me the fullest information about those matters. One honourable member, when referring to the powers and functions of the High Court of Australia, mentioned the difficulty that is experienced because of the inability to anticipate the decision of the High Court in a particular case. When the Parliament passes legislation, the act Mr Beale. may or may not be within the limits of the Constitution. I suppose that the Attorney-General will give the answer that has occurred to me, namely, that the Australian Constitution does not include a provision that permits the High Court, as the supreme'interpretive body, to anticipate or give advisings about proposed legislation. The Supreme Court of the United States of America has some such power, and I express, as my personal opinion, the thought that a similar power, vested in the High Court might be of advantage in avoiding litigation. Law books might not be filled with constitutional cases, as happens at the present time. The existing position is unavoidable as the law and the Constitution now stand. Some government in future may have sufficient courage to ask the people, at a referendum, for greater power for the Commonwealth Parliament to enable the High Court to give judgments in hypothetical cases. Experience suggests that that government may not get that power, but I offer the view that, theoretically it might be a good thing if the Parliament had it. Although the changed position might be bad for constitutional lawyers, it might ultimately be to the advantage of citizens.",39
179,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Richmond) [5.39] I direct the attention of the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) to a matter which, though comparatively minor, is causing inconvenience to many people. A few days ago, one of my constituents informed me that, two years previously, he had applied for a trade mark. He had used a certain brand for a long time, and then he discovered that it was being infringed to some degree. His application to register the trade mark was lodged at the Patents Office some time ago, and when he communicated with me recently, he asked me, as a constituent normally asks his parliamentary representative to perform a service for him, to endeavour to speed up the handling of the application. I got in touch with the Patents Office, and an officer informed me that the staff was dealing with applications that had been lodged at the end of December, 1947. In other words, the Patents Office is almost two years in arrears.",40
180,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,That is substantially correct. Precisely the same position has arisenin the United Kingdom and the United' States of America. I .shall explain the reason to the honourable member.,40
181,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The officer, who was most courteous to me in every respect, informed me that the back-log of applications was so great that it was physically impossible fbr the staff to deal with them. He also told me that the Patents Office required additional examiners.",41
182,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,To do. the technical work.,41
183,Mr ANTHONY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Prom - information that I have been able to obtain, I conclude that the examiners are not necessarily highly technical officers-. The qualifications for the work require that the examiners shall have an arts degree, or have successfully completed the first or second year of the arts course. Some of the examiners have legal qualifications. However, the salary that is offered is not attractive-. I may be incorrect but I believe that the rate is approximately £500 a year. Only four additional' examiners are required, I understand, to enable the back-log of work to be overtaken. The delays that have occurred in dealing with applications have caused considerable inconvenience. To those who desire to register trade marks or to patent inventions, the delay of years is completely unreasonable. I realise the physical difficulties department, but the staffing problem should be solved. I suggest that the applications for trade marks and patents could be sorted into various categories. I understand that the practice at present is to allot to each application a serial number, and difficult ones are mixed up with easy ones. Some of the applications may be described as "" plain sailing"". Would it not be possible to place thj) applications into a few classifications? The easy ones could be dealt with exnotice-paper peditiously, and the more complex could be set aside for determination later date. The first consideration should be to dispose of the back-log of applicaof tions as quickly as possible. The ticular application in which I am insheer propaganda. terested is of minor importance, and should not require a great deal research. Yet I am informed that it cannot be considered in less than two years. I should like the ment. Attorney-General to take the necessary steps to speed up the work of thePatents Office.",41

Frequently, I have difficulty in distinguishing whether the information in those booklets is fact or fiction. However, I have noticed that the name of the printer does not appear on some of those publications.

198,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"In that case, the Chair has no objection to the two matters being discussed together.",42
199,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The knowledge of honourable members about the newly instituted Security Service is so meagre that they would like some information about its functions, and how they differ from those of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. We have at least three, and perhaps four, separate security services operating at present in the armed services. There is one for each service and perhaps a fourth working under the direction of the Defence Department itself. Honourable members would like to be assured that there will be no overlapping. Now, it is proposed to superimpose on the security services attached to the various defence arms, and on the already established Commonwealth Investigation Service, a new security service for which £150,000 is to he .provided this year. This conjures up visions of a very extensive secret service in Australia. I should like to know how it is to be employed. It will not have to concern itself with security within the armed services, because that is already provided for, nor with offences against Commonwealth law, because they will be dealt with by the Commonwealtii Investigation Service. I ask, therefore, why it should be necessary to expend £150,000 of public money for the upkeep of a new secret service department. I should like to be assured that it will not be given a charter to probe into the affairs of private citizens but will devote its activities exclusively to matters associated with the security of the nation, and outside the recognized scope of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. If its activities are to be so restricted as that, I find it difficult to believe that it is necessary to vote £150,000 for its support. I want to be assured that it is not intended to establish a substantial new department to operate on a wide front investigating the private affairs of citizens. I have seen new departments created before this. I have in mind the Department of Information, for which the original vote was about £100,000. it is When the Department of External Affairs was instituted, its expenditure was covered hy about £100,000 also, but after a few years more than £1,000,000 has to be voted for that department. Is that, experience to be repeated? Are we now laying the foundations of a secret service which, in a few year's time, will need £1,000,000 to maintain? Honourable members, whatever their political faith, cannot be. happy in agreeing to this proposed vote unless they rocoive a full explanation. We have had many examples of the keeping of a close tab on the activities of members of the Opposition. Ministers of the C r o w have been able to say upon whom members of the Opposition called at 3.30 p.m. on a certain, day when they were in New York, and with whom Opposition members did business in Perth at 10 o'clock on a certain morning. The personal affairs of members of the Opposition",42
200,Mr SPENDER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,And even their personal correspondence.,43
201,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Yes , even that. Ministers have shown that they have had knowledge of the private affairs of members of the Opposition. While I have been speaking in this chamber, the Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman), who controls one security service, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  which have revealed that, by some device, they were in possession of most intimate knowledge of my private affairs. I should like to know how they came by that knowledge. I do not believe that they were able, by their own efforts, to keep tab on my private affairs. I do not believe that Ministers can, without assistance, learn of the activities of private members of this Parliament hi Perth, New York, or London. I am compelled to believe that wben Ministers of the Crown indicate that they possess intimate information about members of the Opposition, based upon a comprehensive dossier, public servants and public money have been employed in the gathering of the information. It would seem that some Ministers, at any rate, can maintain so close a scrutiny upon their political opponents that they are able to turn up n record of their affairs, perhaps to their political embarrassment. I should like to receive an unequivocal assurance that the new Security Service will not be PHI ployed in the gathering of information of that kind. There seems to be no doubt that some Ministers do keep dossiers on members of the Opposition showing with whom they do business, bow they conduct their affairs, how many persona they employ, and what they pay them. We should be relieved of the fear that, when we vote £150,000 for the Security Service, it will not be employed upon activities of that kind. I hope that my remarks will evoke from the Attorney-General a full explanation of the purposes for which the Security Service has been established.",43

203,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I desire to refer to the proposed vote for the conciliation commissioners and also to certain other aspects of the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The fact that in the course of the year it may be necessary to replace a conciliation commissioner who has resigned, as a number of commissioners have already resigned, prompts me to offer some observations on what I conceive to be a desirable character and the background for the appointee that ought to be properly borne in mind by the Government in exercising its rights under this proposed vote. My first point is that the men who exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions need to be objective find impartial. Objectivity and impartiality are necessary in any form of court procedure or litigation. Without it in the field of conciliation and arbitration there cannot be satisfactory conciliation or arbitration in the area of employer-employee relationship. It does not matter whether one is dealing with the court itself, conciliation commissioners or the umpire at a football match, the protagonists must have confidence in the impartiality of the judge, the commissioner or the umpire, as the case may be. Without confidence in the impartiality and competence of the person who will pronounce judgment, there cannot be any confidence that fair play will prevail. There cannot be any confidence in the judgment given. So, if there is not confidence in the conciliation commissioners, this departure in the field of conciliation, will not be found, in the final analysis, to have produced the good employeremployee relationship that we were told it is designed to produce. When people are appointed to judicial posts they are normally, ahd were always, I think, until quite recently, chosen from people with special training and no background of continuing bias in one direction or the other. There has been, a complete departure from that ancient' and fundamental principle of British judicial procedure the choice of the appointees whose salaries we are now to vote upon.",43
204,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The salaries are fixed statute-.,44
205,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I did not, say that we are to fix them.",44
206,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,We are not voting on fhem; we are dealing with the clerks.,44
207,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,We are voting money to pay their salaries.,44
208,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,That is appropriated statute. But that is a small point.,44
209,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"It is' a minor aspect. Et does not at all' affect the principles which I am directing attention. is confidence in some of the conciliation commissioners. Mr Murray Stewart, for instance, has functioned for many years, with complete satisfaction.",44
210,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Hear , hear !",44
211,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"And there is conthe fidence in some of the others. But when the Government chose the panel of ciliation commissioners who are, by statute, entitled to pronounce judgments affecting great industries from which there is no appeal it is strange and to find that it, with very few exceptions, chose men whose whole training and backemployee ground has been designed to cultivate bias in one direction. I do not say that is a vicious bias; I wish that to be stood. Nevertheless there is a bias. Let us look at recent appointments in the year or so to the ranks of conciliation commissioners. We start with Murray Stewart. He was a commissioner. No fault can be found with him. About Mr G. A. Mooney I have no comment make.",44
212,Mr FALSTEIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"He was a commisr sioner, too.",44
213,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Of course! I make no comment about Mr J. H . Portus. G. A. Findlay has been appointed determine the rates of pay and conditions oflabour in the clothing trade and textile trade. His training is that for several years he was a ministerial car driver in Canberra. ,44
214,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The Minister'sinterjection indicates the whole attitude of the in Government. These appointments are a reward fbr faithful membership of the Labour party. Mr Findlay becamethe by union representative in the Transport Branch at' Canberra, and' having heen a faithful servant of the Labour party, he was chosen for appointment as a conciliation commissioner at £1,500 a year for the rest of his working life. He pronounces judgments in the clothingtrade, from which there is no appeal'. I makino comment about Mr D'. Morrison. I by come to Mr A. Blakeley. He is a former member of the House of Representatives. He was appointed, I think, to by the Lyons Government. He has a There record of good service. 1",44
215,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"He does a good job. Mr MCEWEN. - Every one concedes that, I think. Mr E. H . Rowlands, is Chief Commissioner. No exception is taken to his appointment. We come tomani who will pronounce judgment in the field of ""engine drivers and fireconmen and dockyard employees"". He is Mr L. P. Austin. What is his qualification?. He was president of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council. bad The whole of his life has. been lived in cultivating a bias in favour of the and against the employer. Mr. a F. D. Kelly, whose field of conciliation it will be "" tanning, wool and basil workers under- (fel'lmongery), meat industry, shop assistants "", qualified for his appointment last by having been a Labour member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. Mr The requirements of road transport workers will be attended to by Brigadier A. S. Blackburn, V.C. No exception to can be taken to his appointment. Mr. R. H . Beers was appointed as a conciliation commissioner, but he resigned before taking office. So I can offer no comment. But he was replaced by Mr. Hamilton Knight, whose qualification is Mr that he was a Minister in the Labour to Government of New South Wales. A commissioner had to be appointed who would have a general jurisdiction. Who else was appointed but Mr J. M . Hewitt ? He was private secretary to the Attorney-General himself. A recent appointment was that of Mr E. W. Tonkin, who has been the private secretary to successive leaders of the parliamentary Labour party ever since I have been a member of the Parliament, and that is about fifteen years. Would that qualify him to hold the scales of justice, with knowledge and equity, in whatever great industries he has to officiate ? The conciliation commissioner in the field of ""banks, insurance oflicers, trustee officers, municipal oflicers, health inspectors, clerks, journalists, shipping clerks, architects, and draftsmen "" is Mr A. R. Wallis. He ought to be able to make awards to cover people included in that field because he was general secretary of the clothing trades employees union, Victoria! Mr. J. R. Donovan is the conciliation commissioner in the field covered by the category ""A.W.U., pastoral, hops, mining, fruit-growing, rice, dairying, harvesting, wool-classing, municipal employees "". His qualification is that he was private secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward). He holds the fate of the pastoral industry, Australia's most basic industry, in his hands. Another gentleman, Mr N . Roberts, resigned before taking office. He was formerly an organizer for the Australian Engineering Union. Building carpenters and joiners, builders' labourers, painters and decorators, stonemasons, and ships' painters and dockers will have their needs attended to by MrJ. M. Galvin. He should know everything about the trades covered in that field because he was general secretary of the Australian Locomotive Enginemen's Union, Melbourne! The field covered by "" timber, furniture trade, shipwrights, ship carpenters, coopers, paper manufacturers "" will be covered by Mr J. V. Dwyer, whose qualification for appointment as the conciliation commissioner for that field is that he was general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union. Mr G. H . Buckland has been appointed to make awards in the field of "" rubher workers, glue workers, artificial fertilizers, saddlery and leather goods, rope, cordage, boot trade "". His qualification is that he was federal industrial officer of the Australian Workers Union in New South Wale3. All that I have said points to the fact that the Government has been completely partisan in appointing gentlemen to maike awards in all these great Australian industries. The guiding principle in the appointment of the conciliation commissioners seems to have been that those who were chosen for appointment are those deserving of reward for having been faithful servants of the Australian Labour party. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has just called out, ""Hear, hear!"", which shows that I have been correct in my reading of the Government's motives. I have got that same comment again and again from that Minister. I shall not be found protesting against a reward being given for faithful service. But I say that it is disgraceful to reward the faithful service of these gentlemen flax, to the Labour party by appointing them to important positions that have such far-reaching consequences, when they are without the requisite training or background, and when their whole history leads them to be biased in favour of one interest. That kind of appointment is designed to destroy confidence in the Australian system of arbitration. Ninety thousand people attended a football match between Carlton and Essendon teams in Melbourne recently. How many people would have attended that match if they had been informed beforehand that the umpire would be chosen from the active supporters of one of the teams on the field? Such a circumstance would destroy confidence in the game of football. The Government's appointments of certain individuals to conciliation commissionerships will similarly destroy confidence in the arbitration system. That is what the Government's action in appointing these men was designed to do, and the design, in fact, extends beyond the realm of those conciliation commissioners. Jurisdiction over the maritime industry was taken away from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the industry was placed under control of the Maritime Industry Commission; and who was appointed to that commission but Mr E. V. Elliott, an avowed Communist? The stevedoring industry was also taken out of the hands of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and was placed under the control of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, now defunct. Another openly avowed Comand munist, Mr J. Healy, was appointed member of that commission.",44
216,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order ! That subject has nothing to do with conciliation and arbitration. question whether the persons appointed as conciliation commissioners should have special qualifications was discussed the time that the bill for the act under which they were appointed was being tinction considered in this House. The honorminds able gentleman is entitled to discuss whether the persons appointed actually have special qualifications such as legal or other training.,46
217,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is the point Australia that I have been discussing up to the present time. They have no special trainposition ing, but, with the few exceptions that have mentioned, they are inevitably biased in one direction in respect of the judicial functions that they have to carry out. Their appointment, therefore, is certainly calculated to destroy confidence in the arbitration system. There is one great organization in Australia which has, its openly proclaimed purpose, the destruction of the arbitration system. refer to the Communist party. These appointments are in accordance with the policy of the Communist party.",46
218,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order ! The honourable gentleman has exhausted his time.,46
219,Mr DALY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Martin) [8.18] - The attacks of the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) are not the first that have been made in this Parliament on men appointed to act as conciliation commisthat sioners, nor are his criticisms the first that have come from honourable members opposite in an attempt to break down the respect for the commissioners of the parties who appear before them.",46
220,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The conciliation commismatters sioners hold' the respect of all parties that have appeared before them. There has been no complaint by any of the employers' organizations about any the commissioners.,46
221,Mr DALY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The honourable member for Indi has cast aspersions on men who have been appointed to their positions because of their knowledge of the matters upon which they are called to adjudicate, because of their understanding of a industrial conditions and not so much because of their legal knowledge. A.« the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) has mentioned, many The members of this Parliament have come from very varied avenues of life into the totally different atmosphere of the at Parliament and have carried out their parliamentary responsibilities with disbecause they have good intelligent and, amongst other things, have an understanding and appreciation of what is required of them, as well as a knowledge of - w to adapt themselves to their new < rmimstances. It is shocking that in a democratic country like we sliould hear criticisms of a man merely because he once occupied a as a ministerial car driver or a I trade union delegate, or because h* has been able by sheer ability to win the confidence of the Parliament and gain appointment to a high position. It is dreadful that honourable members opposite should attempt to bring into disrepute men who have been appointed to as high positions because of their loyalty and experience. Some time ago in this I chamber the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) criticized a gentleman who was also mentioned to-night by the honourable member for Indi. I refer to Mr J. R. Donovan. The honourable member for Parramatta criticized Mr. Donovan's handling of matters concerning the pastoral industry and his attitude in court to conciliation matters. Some months ago he endeavoured to show that Mr Donovan was partial and could not give a fair interpretation of the matters came before him. Following that attack I received from Mr Dougherty, of the Australian Workers Union, a transcript of a statement that he had all made before Mr Donovan regarding that conciliation commissioner's attitude to of conciliation. Mr Dougherty also supplied me with the transcript of a statement made by the employers' representative on the same occasion, in of which he had paid a tribute to Mr. Donovan's impartiality and to the manner in which he had adjudicated in matters affecting the pastoral industry. Mr Dougherty and the employers' representative made those statements when they appeared before Mr Donovan on the l l t h June, 1948. In the course of his statement to the conciliation commissioner, Mr Dougherty brought to his attention the statements made in this House by the honourable member for Parramatta and indicated that aspersions had been cast by that nonorable member upon Mr Donovan's impartialit y and .ability to do his job with fairness to both sides. In the course of his remarks, Mr . Dougherty saidIt bus been overlooked apparently by Mr. Beale that the present Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court was at one time an anti-Labour Senator, and there is no person who has had any dealings with this Court who can for one moment doubt the complete impartiality of the Chief Judge . . . Mr Dougherty went ou to sayI want to say finally that furtlier proof of the falsity of the statement attributed to Mr Beale will be found in the fact that since your appointment you have adjudicated on a number of industrial disputes affecting various members of this Union, which represents over 120,000 workers in Australia, and in each case your decisions have been just, because that is indicated by the fact that they have been completely accepted by both parties, and I want to say that it is not always that this Union has been successful in regard to its applications before you since you have been a Conciliation Commissioner. Mr Allen, speaking for the employers, then said to Mr DonovanI have not read the statement to which Mr. Dougherty refers. I saw the heading and ran my eye over it and did not see any personal reference to you. I did not read it properly, but I would like to join Mr Dougherty in what he has said in this way: that both in the wool classers' case and in these proceedings you have evidenced the utmost impartiality in the hearing. You have been manifestly fair to both sides in the hearing of the cases, both the wool classers' case and this, and I cannot say more than that you have heard us very impartially and very fairly. Those are outstanding tributes from both sides and constitute a complete denial of the attitude taken about the commissioner's impartialit y by the honourable member for Indi . I have no doubt that a perusal of the records of the courts would produce similar statements regarding other conciliation commissioners. We on this side of the committee do not criticize the fact that many men who now occupy high posts in this country came from the ranks of the political parties opposed to the present Government. In most instances these men are adjudicating today most fair l y in connection with the matters that come before them. An examination of the list of political appointments would show that in various avenues of the lif e of this country are men who were appointed directly by anti-Labour governments for political purposes. The most significant feature of the speech of the honourable member for Indi was that he completely excluded from criticism any of the appointments madp by governments which consisted of members of the present Opposition - parties. It is for honourable members to decide for themselves why he omitted to mention such appointments. The fact that he omitted to mention such appointments shows that the honourable member for Indi is ipartial in his criticisms, and was endeavouring to undermine and besmirch not only the impartiality of the conciliation commissioners, but also their characters and their ability to do their jobs. Probably the only appointments that could be validly challenged are those made by honourable members opposite when they were in office. The fact is that this Parliament saw fit to legislate for the appointment of the conciliation commissioners. This Government could not bp expected to appoint as conciliation commissioners solicitors and other legal men without experience in industrial matters, with no industrial background and with no sympathy for the employees in industry, and thus betray the interests of the workers to those who are determined to serve the interests of the employing classes. The conciliation commissioners were appointed after due consideration by the Parliament, the Cabinet, the Attorney-General and by the Labour party generally of the value of such a system of conciliation and in common with all other members on this side of the committee I resent the attacks made on men like Mr . Hamilton Knight, Mr Donovan and Mr . Findlay, who have served this country in the industrial and political spheres, and by being appointed to these positions, have been enabled to continue their good work. These gentlemen, in the course of their duties, have received commendations from the representatives of both the employers and the employees. Honourable members opposite would be much better occupied in discussing fairly and impartially the Estimates before the committee than in trying to undermine the arbitration system and public confidence in its institutions. Ur. HARRISON (Wentworth) [8.29]. - Prio r to the suspension of the sitting, I spoke about conciliation and arbitration, and I pointed out that the appointment of conciliation commissioners was robbing the Commonwealth Arbitration Court of its full jurisdiction. I do not want to say anything more on that subject except that everything that the honourable member for Indi (Mr, MCEwen) has said regarding these appointments and the qualifications of the conciliation commissioners highlights Labour's policy of so ridiculing the arbitration system as to run the risk of completely destroying it. This Government is holding the whole system up to ridicule. It has taken sections of industry away from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and it has placed them in watertight compartments without worrying about the effect that the decisions made by individual conciliation commissioners may have on other industries and on the country's economy generally. The award of increased wages and marginal rates in one particular industry may have an effect on other industries. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court has always taken into consideration the effects of its decisions on industry generally and on the country's economy. That principle has now been departed from as a consequence of these appointments, and everything that the honourable member for Indi has said regarding the qualifications of the conciliation commissioners bears out my contention. I do not want to say more than that on the point. I had intended to wait until the mittee was considering Division 169 to something with regard to security but the Estimates we are now discussing contain a provision for the new security service; and you, Mr Deputy Chairman, have ruled that we may discuss Division 169 in conjunction with the Estimates for the Attorney-General's Department, so I take leave now to say what I had intended to say at a later stage.",46
222,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Such an arrangement was made by agreement of the committee, and not by the Chair.",48
223,Mr HARRISON,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I wholeheartedly agree with it, because it gives me an opportunity to say something earlier than otherwise would have been possible. Provision has been made in these Estimates for £115,000 for the Security Service. In 1948-49, an amount of £13,000 was provided for a security service as distinct from the Commonwealth Investigation Service. The Estimates of the Attorney General's Department for this year include an amount of £74,000 for the Commonwealth Investigation Servicp compared with an expenditure of £66,506 under that heading in the preceding year. It would appear on the surface that that is all the Government proposes to expend on a security and investigational service. That is not so. A close analysis of the Estimates discloses that that amount covers only one section of the investigational and security work which is carried out by this Government. The citizens of Australia are subject to more prying eyes and more snooping tactics than are the citizens of any other country in the world. Intelligence services have been established in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. We have a Commonwealth Investigation Service, and we have State police. Because of the dossiers that have been compiled on members of the Opposition, I have no doubt that there is also a security service within the Department of Information. Doubtless, there is also a security service within the framework of the Department of Defence. In almost every foreign embassy in Australia dossiers are to be found on every person of notein this country. I venture to say that in the Soviet Embassy. in Canberra theer would be found complete dossiers of every person of importance in Australia. I comknow, and every other honourable member say knows, that if any person of note moves from one country to another his dossierinvariably precedes him. Australians are subjected to more prying and more extensive snooping tactics than possibly arethe Russians themselves. I do not in any circumstances object to the establishment of a security service for the purpose of preserving the security of this nation; but there are several undesirable features - associated with the security services which - this Government has established. Not long ago the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) made a revelation in this Parliament of the contents of certain secret documents. What happened? Within, the sacred precincts of this forum, this House of Representatives, this Parliament of Australia, officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service waited on him in his room and subjected him to cross-examination about the source from which he obtained the documents which, as a responsible representative of the people of Australia, covered matters of such vital importance as to warrant their disclosure in this Parliament. From time to time, when embarrassing questions are asked by members of the Opposition, replies are fired across the chamber in which threats are made to reveal some incident in a private member's life in an attempt to intimidate him. The circumstances of these incidents are invariably twisted and distorted with a view to preventing the honourable member concerned from discharging his duties as a representative of the people in this Parliament. The public servants of every country renders great service to its people. That is especially true of our own public servants. I venture to say that the continuous application of good administrative policy is made possible only by our public servants. Yet the leaders of our public departments have protested vigorously that dossiers are being compiled about them for purposes about which they know nothing. For all they know the dossiers may be used at some subsequent time to intimidate them. Things have come to a pretty pass when the Government establishes a security service, not to police the security of this country, but to compile dossiers that may subsequently be used to embarrass people. Where this sort of thing is likely to lead 1 us has been amply shown by recent history.. These moves are the forerunners of a political police force- a gesfapo, O.G.P.U. of Soviet Russia and the like. They herald the beginning of a political police force in this country. No country which embraces the tenets of totalitarianism, as this Governments seeks to impose them on the country by its socialist programme, can get by without a political police force. The Security Service was, I understand, originally designed, and I hope it will be used only for the protection of this country and its people. I have pointed out the extent to which the services of this Government have been used to embarrass not only public servants but also public men. We should make the closest examination of these Estimates to ensure that the money voted by us is used for the purpose for which our Security Service was originally designed. I am completely in accord with the view that the activities of our security officers should not be divulged. I agree that if their activities were divulged our security could no longer be guarded. My complaint is that our Security Service' is being used for purposes for which it was not designed, and that Ministers themselves are employing their own security officers to compile dossiers. I am aware that we cannot in any way prevent foreign embassies that are established in Australia from compiling dossiers on our prominent citizens. Our embassies in foreign countries no doubt do likewise. The Attorney-General laughs at that remark. He knows that he is made aware of all the details relating to any person of note who comes to Australia from another country. Dossiers which give an outline of their history, their standing in the community, and their political beliefs, always precede prominent men when they travel abroad. We all are aware that that is so. It is regrettable, however, that people in this country should be spied upon by so many eyes. Our private affairs are subjected to closer' scrutiny than are those of the peoples of any other country. Because of the totalitarian character of this Government, we are rapidly approaching the stage when we shall have a political police force established in Australia.",48
224,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External the Affairs) [8.42] - I had intended to defer my remarks until the end of the discussion of these proposed votes and to deal with all the points raised during the debate in one review, and I should have done so but for the extraordinary speech which has just been made by the honourable member for ""Wentworth (Mr. Harrison). ""What we want to know from the honourable member is whether or not lie favours the establishment of a security service to protect the internal security of this country. His speech showed him to be both for and against it. He has said that Australia is becoming a totalitarian country. The Security Service must be operated with secrecy in order properly to protect the community. The results of the investigations of the Security Service are not published because the purpose of such a service is to protect the nation, especially against subversive activities. If the results of our security investigations were published, attempt to defeat subversive activities would always be foiled. The honourable member has also spoken about prying eyes. He has said that the Security Service is a constantly prying eye. Of course it is. That is the very purpose for which a security service is established. He tried to pay a tribute to the public servants. I remind him that all the officers of the Security Service are servants of the Commonwealth. All of these Estimates, in one form or another, are designed to provide for the salaries and allowances of trusted officers of the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite suggest that we should take every possible precaution against the spread of subversive activities, but wben the Government does so it is denounced as a totalitarian government. That is the very phraseology of the Communists. If communism exists in a democratic country, and that country desires to protect itself by establishing a properly organized security service, the great cry of the Communists is "" Totalitarianism! Terrorism! "". The truth of the matter is very simply that the proposed vote which was dealt with by the honourable member for Wentworth relates to the Security Service recently approved by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) after consultation with the British Government to protect this country against subversive Dr Evatt. * activities, and for no other purpose. We so designed it as to put it beyond the scope of political party approach. The Government decided to appoint a Supreme Court judge from South Australia, Mr. Justice Reed, to administer the service. Officers came from Great Britain in order to see that, broadly speaking, the same system, would be adopted here as had been adopted in Great Britain. This is a period in which there is a danger of espionage and of subversive activities, and the - plan for the establishment of a security service was drawn up in consultation with Mr Justice Reed, and to put the matter beyond the sphere of party politics Mr Justice Reed was given the charter to which the Prime Minister has referred. He is not subject to ministerial control in the ordinary sense. I support the proposed vote, because' we have a trusted officer in charge of the the Security .Service and, as in England, Cabinet Ministers are not interested further, other than to know, as we do know, that we have an efficient service under a completely impartial and fearless head in the person of Mr Justice Reed. Some of the confusion that has arisen about this matter is due partly to the change that has been made in the Commonwealth Investigation Service of the Attorney-General's Department. That service, which was established many years ago by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), had what might be described as a police or investigation side, and a security side. On the police and investigation side, the organization fulfilled for the Commonwealth the purposes which, broadly speaking, were fulfilled by the police forces of the respective States. The purpose of the investigation service was to secure obedience to and enforcement of Commonwealth laws. Mr Lazzarini. - Was not the Commonwealth Investigation Service hatched out of the Warwick egg?",49
225,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"It certainly grew out of a dispute many years ago, and it is an old-established service. The security side gradually developed before the outbreak of World War II , and functions of a security character were assigned to the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, which has been under the control of able men. Colonel Jones, Colonel Lloyd and Colonel Browne are three names that immediately occur to me. The Government has decided to separate the investigation and police functions from the security function. The investigation and police functions are to be left with the Commonwealth Investigation Service, of which Colonel Lloyd is the chief, and the security functions in connection with subversive activities affecting the internal security of Australia are under the control of Mr Justice Reed. I am glad that you, Mr Deputy Chairman, and the committee have consented to consider the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the Security Service together, although they are separate organizations. The proposed vote for the Security Service is more than £100,000, but it is comparatively small. If we are to have an efficient Security Service, we' must obviously employ persons who have a knowledge of other languages, who are skilled in inquiry work, and in tracing the movements of persons who may be a danger to security. Broadly speaking, the same kind of security service exists as in Great Britain, and in the United States of America where it is known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Although many officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service could perform security functions, we have separated the two organizations. The investigation service will be analogous to a State police force and its functions will be to ensure that Commonwealth law shall be enforced, and that if a breach of Commonwealth law is committed, it shall be detected and proceedings taken in the appropriate place. The Government considers that, in the interests of efficiency, the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the Security Service should be separated. These Estimates, for the first time, separate the two organizations. I hope that honourable members understand - clearly that that has been done.",50
226,Mr LANG,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Whic h organization comes under the control of the Attorney General ?,51
227,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The Commonwealth Investigation Service. The ordinary - enforcement of Commonwealth law has always been a function of the Attorney-General's Department, and that position has not been changed. The Commonwealth Investigation Service enforces not merely the decisions of the Attorney General's Department, but also the decisions of other Commonwealth departments. If an offence has been committed against a regulation of the Department of Trade and Customs or the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service are at the disposal of those departments, although nominally they are officers of the Attorney-General's Department. The Security Service, which is more important, especially under present-day conditions, is committed to my administration as far as the Parliament is concerned. I have to speak for the Security Service in the Parliament, but the charter under which that organization works gives the widest discretion to Mr Justice Reed. The Government has every confidence in the ability and independence of that gentleman. The Government does not concern itself with the precise methods that he uses. We have adopted, in principle, the practice which United Kingdom governments have adopted successfully. I have now answered questions which honourable members have asked about certain aspects of security. The honourable member for Wentworth has suggested that dossiers are kept on public servants. What does he mean by that statement? If a public servant is suspected by the Security Service of .subversive activities it is proper that a record should be kept about him. We cannot exempt any particular class. I do not know of any such case, and I do not know how the honourable member knows about one. If the Security Service has a record of a public servant, the honourable member should not know about it.",51
228,Mr DEDMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,He does not know about it.,51
229,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The Government joins in the tributes that the honourable member has paid to public servants. I want the committee to understand the line of de(markation that has been made between the enforcement of Commonwealth law, and the Security Service. The last-named organization deals with subversive activities that may threaten the internal security of Australia. The Estimates provided for the establishment as it existed prior to the inauguration of the Security Service recently, and they further provide for a number of posts in the former security section of the Commonwealth In vestigation Service. Since the Estimates were prepared, security functions generally have been assumed by the new security intelligence organization under the control of Mr Justice Reed. That is the position. I shall now deal with a few matters that have been raised by various honourable members. The Prime Minister has already given the assurance, for which the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) has asked, to the effect that the new Security Service is an organization of the character that I have described. I do not know whether the honourable member is serious when he expresses the opinion that the Government has a service that keeps dossiers on honourable members of the Parliament.",51
230,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,There is continuing evidence of that.,52
231,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Le t us be clear about the matter. No such service as the honourable member has described is known to the Government. I recall that one of my colleagues, in a semi-jocular vein, said that he had in his dossier a copy of some remarks that a certain honourable member had made. That remark was obviously in jeu d'esprit. It is sheer fantasy to say that the Government has such a service.",52
232,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Wee k by week Ministers display an intimate knowledge of our private lives.,52
233,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Honourable members opposite display an intimate knowledge of the private lives of Ministers and supporters of the Government.,52
234,Mr MENZIES,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,What a vulgar thought.,52
235,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Unfortunately , exchanges of that kind pass for repartee in a parliament where different political opinions are voiced. Honourable members opposite must take as well as give. They make attacks upon honourable members on this side of the chamber, and they must not be astonished if, occasionally, they get hit. That is all that the reference to the dossiers means. I assure the honourable member for Indi that I am certain that there is nothing more in it than that, and the honourable gentleman may dismiss it as a figment of somebody else's imagination. The fact that some one uses such a word as "" dossier"" only means that speeches made by members of the Parliament are recorded and used in political controversies.",52
236,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Newspape r cuttings of such speeches are kept.,52
237,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is so. What an honourable member might say about socialism in the heat of an election campaign might very well be contrasted with what he said a few years earlier in favour of socialist enterprise such as wheat pools and the intervention of the State in matters which were then regarded by some honourable members as very desirable in the public interest for such government intervention. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain) has referred to a crucial point in modern times from the standpoint of security, and that is the entry of air travellers into Australia at Darwin. The honourable gentleman stressed the need for proper security measures at that point. With that submission, the Government agrees. I have ascertained that both in relation to investigation and security that matter is receiving attention. That is an obvious point in respect of which security officers should keep themselves fully informed. My function under the charter that has been granted to Mr Justice Reed is to deal in. the Parliament with matters associated with the Security Service.",52
238,Mr LANG,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Does Mr Justice Reed come under the control of the Attorney General ?,52
239,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Onl y in the sense that in the Parliament I represent the Security Service, of which Mr Justice Reed is the head. The organization is a semiindependent service. Under his charter, Mr Justice Reed has access to the Prime Minister, just as his counterpart in Great Britain has access to Mr Attlee. Mr Justice Reed appoints his own officers. We have no control or share in that matter.",52
240,Mr LANG,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"If an honourable member desired to know something about Mr. Justice Reed, to what Minister should he go?",52
241,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"He should go to the in Prime Minister or myself. The honorbe desirable. able member for ""Wentworth asked me a question a few days ago about some aspect of possible subversive activity. That matter is in the hands of Mr testing ? Justice Reed. ""When that gentleman - assures the Government that there is no danger to the community, the - Government cannot go any further inquiries. - at that stage. That is the way in which we interpret the charter, and that is clearly the interpretation that has been given to a similar position in Great Britain. The organization was granting of a patent, prima facie, gives started for good reasons, some of them internal, and some of them of an external character. We adopted the system that in operation in Great Britain after we had had consultations with British and simple. Australian officers about security matters. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) have referred to arrears of work at the Patent Office. As I immediately informed the honourable member for Fremantle, the examination of applications for patents and trade marks is in arrears. In some instances, the arrears are approximately two years. That period may seem to be unduly long",53
242,Mr HOLLOWAY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The work has been in arrears for a long time.,53
243,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is so. At one the lag was even greater than it is now. Substantially the same position exists British and American patent offices. law of those two countries in relation patents and trade marks does not differ greatly from Commonwealth law. The the arrears are primarily the result of the difficulty of obtaining the services of adequate technical staff, despite repeated advertisements in the Gazette and the press. The Public Service Board, the Government, fixes the salaries of examiners. The salaries have been increased in recent years, but the demands of industry in Australia, under conditions of full employment, are insatiable. I is very difficult for the department, despite the efficiency of its officers, make up the lag. Branches have heen established in Sydney and Melbourne an endeavour to alleviate the situation, and we are prepared to'establish branches increase. other States and territories should that ,",53
244,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Does the department use the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization for,53
245,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I cannot answer that' question offhand, but I shall make In 1946, an act was passed to remove disabilities occassioned to applicants for patents because of delays in examining applications. Honourable members will see the importance of this, because the the patentee sixteen years' monopoly of is the patent. The lag cannot be overtaken by picking out the applications that look The simpler a device is the less patentable it may be legally. The legal rights of an applicant now commence automatically almost immediately upon ti e lodgement of his application. The present lag is almost two years, but during the war, which was responsible for the accumulation of work, the delay was as much as three and a half years or four years. The department wants to get staff, and is prepared to pay suitable men, but the rewards in industry are so great that we find it very difficult to get suitable staff. However, nothing will be left undone to alleviate the position. I now refer to the remarks of the time honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull), who, as a jealous guardian of in the public finances, pointed out that the The Estimates show an increase in expendito ture on the bankruptcy administration. That increase is not due to an increase in number of bankruptcies. It is due to the fact that employees in the bankruptcy office are obtaining increases of salary, due to cost of living increases, reclassifications, or general salary increases not throughout the - whole service.",53
246,Mr TURNBULL,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Coul d not the number of employees be reduced?,53
247,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I do not think so. t There are not many officers in the branch and I do not think that we should interto fere with an efficient branch of the Public Service simply because the number in of bankruptcies is at a minimum.,53
248,Mr SCULLY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The number may,53
249,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The officers are experts in bankruptcy law. I do not think that we would be justified in listening to the voice of the tempter behind me, who suggests that the number of bankruptcies might increase. <- Mr MCEWEN - Of course, we are now in the "" golden age "".",54
250,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"""Well , .primary .producers now obtain guaranteed prices for rheir products, and Australia is in the excellent financial position set out in the budget. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) paid a tribute-and it is always of some value to underline a fact of that kind-to the Crown Solicitor's Office. He said that it had won his admiration. However, he wished to know why advertisements had appeared in the press inviting applications for 50 new appointments. It is true that the work of the office has increased, but I am told r.bat of the 50 new positions, probably about 40 will be filled by officers already in the department. The new positions have been created because of the need - to reclassify existing positions. The honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) asked whether it would be possible to obtain advisings from the High Court before the Parliament passed legislation which touched upon constitutional law. It would be impossible to do so, because, as I pointed out earlier, Parliament in 1921 passed such an act, and the High Court declared that it went beyond the constitutional power of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Indi and the honourable member for Wentworth mentioned the conciliation and arbitration systems. It is"" true that when we were putting the case for the appointment of conciliation commissioners we said that delays in the hearing of cases would be prevented, and I think that that claim has been justified. Broadly speaking, the commissioners do uot deal with basic matters, such as hours and the basic wage, but with margins and conditions. Jurisdiction in basic matters is vested in the judges of the court. Up to the 30th June, last, the commissioners had dealt with 1,541 cases or disputes, and the court had had before it in the same period 242 matters. It is evident, therefore, that both the commissioners and the court have done a great deal of work during the eighteen monthssince the commissioners were appointed. The number of new awards, or variations of existing awards in the same period' was 917. The honourable member for Indi had toargue from a difficult brief. He went through the list of commissioners, but it is quite impossible that he should know them individually as others do. There is the closest liaison between the commissioners and the present Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. Chief Judge Drake-Brockman did a great service to this country, particularly during thewar, and we greatly regret his death, which was, indeed, largely due to the work he did during the war. Chief Judge Kelly has been able to tighten up the arbitration system. This has not resulted in appeals from the commissioners to the court, but it has resulted in more frequent meetings between the chairman of the conciliation commissioners, Mr Mooney r and the Chief Judge. There is more teamwork, and I believe that the system is working successfully. It was claimed that the appointment of conciliation commissioners would streamline arbitration, and avoid the irritation arising out of delays in hearing claims. I think the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) will aeree with me that it has had that resultI t is true that some of the commissioners were previously trade union officials, but the Chief Judge made the original assignment to industries on the general principle that a commissioner would not act in a claim affecting a union of which he had previously been an official. The commissioners were chosen because of their knowledge of various industries. I am obliged to the honourable member for Martin (Mr. Daly) for taking up the case of one commissioner, and reading to the committeetributes paid to him by the representative of the pastoralists, who were theemployers in one of the cases with which lis had dealt. We are entitVI to taket he view that a commissioner will discipline himself against any possibility of bias, and will give a fair decision on the evidence and the.facts. Some of them have had considerable court experience arid have acquired the habit of considering matters fairly. As a matter of fact, I have received complaints from trade unions that conciliation commissioners are so impartial that they lean over backwards in their efforts to be fair to the employers.",54
251,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Is there any training for conciliation commissioners except participation in hearings before the oourt ?,55
252,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is the best form of training, but some have had other training, also. For instance, Mr. Blackburn, as well as being a distinguished soldier, was also a distinguished lawyer. The honourable member for Indi was evidently speaking from an old brief, because he referred to Mr Rowlands as Chief Conciliation Commissioner. Unfortunately, Mr Rowlands took ill and died a considerable time ago. He was succeeded by Mr Mooney as chief commissioner.",55
253,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I referred to those gentlemen as at the time of their appointment.,55
254,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I am not trying to take a trivial point. The honourable member for Indi criticized the commissioners, and in order to support his criticism he should have shown that they had failed to deal impartially with cases hrought before them. He did not do so. Everything points to the fact that they have been fair and impartial. The only complaints against the conciliation commissioners, including former trade union officials, are that in their awards they have indicated an unwillingness to accept union claims. It is quite correct that many of the conciliation commissioners have been associated with unions. One or two have been union secretaries. One name omitted by the honourable member for Indi is that of Mr V. G. Hall, who was chief industrial officer in the ISTew South Wales railways and who, before his appointment, acted for twelve years as a board of reference under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in matters affecting the New South Wales railways. Generally the commissioners have not been appointed to act infieldsin which they acted as union officials. Working together as a group, under the chairmanship of Mr Mooney and under the general supervision of the Chief Judge, they have acted successfully. In fact, until to-night, the only objections to the group of conciliation commissioners have come from the Communist party. One Communist referred in the court to the commissioners as being perfectly useless to the workers and as more or less dilutee judges. The extremist organizations object to the fact that they are impartial. I regard that as nothing but an unconscious tribute to the attempts that they have made to play their part in the struggle for industrial peace in Australia based on conciliation and arbitration. The honourable member had a difficult task in dealing with them seriatim. They are able men. I could go through the whole list, but the honourable gentleman referred to one who, at one time, drove a ministerial car. That is a very important job, but the man in question was secretary of the Transport Workers Union. As a conciliation commissioner, he has shown a degree of ability that is quite up to standard and has been favourably commented upon in Canberra, where he operates, not only by the employees' representatives, but also by the employers' representatives. We are not dealing with the salaries of the conciliation commissioners. They are provided for by an act of the Parliament. Working with the judges, under the system of liaison and co-ordination that I have tried to describe, they have rendered a useful service to the Commonwealth. The system that we have instituted has been a success. Therefore, there is no justification for the criticism of the conciliation commissioners.",55
255,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Northern Territory) [9.20] - This afternoon, when I tried to discuss the Commonwealth Security Service under the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Investigation Service, I was' ruled out of order; but, now that it has been decided to consider the items together, I presume that I maydiscuss the Security Service and the Commonwealth Investigation Service in conjunction. I pointed out that, whilst there were security - officesand deputy directors of security in all the capital cities of Australia, there wasneither a security office nor a deputy director of security in Darwin. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) has informed me privately that a security service officer has been appointed at Darwin. I do not know whether he has taken up residence yet, but I congratulate the Government on having, at long last, through Mr Justice Reed, the Director General of Security, decided to look on Darwin as a focal point in our security service. I shall return to that matter in detail later. Provision is. made in the Estimates the salaries of the Public Service Arbitrator and the Assistant Public Service Arbitrator. The Public Service Arbitrator,, in the old days, did a mighty job in solving the problems of the railway workers from the northern boundary of South Australia through Finke River to Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, and from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie. He was Mr Westhoven. He, in conjunction, with the Minister for Air Drakeford), who was then president of the. Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, and myself, succeeded in greatly improving the lot of the railway workers on the two lines that I have mentioned. Mr Westhovenhas retired. Before he retired he did a wonderful job for the railway workers. The amount of £3 a fortnight was put on to the wages of pumpers,. Blacksmiths and other workers were given substantial margins. Westhoven's report was very useful, as an, indication of the neglect of the railway workers in central Australia and on the Trans-Australia line. That report was made in. 1937 and improvements followed. It was a pleasure to pass along the north-south railway a few months ago and' see the greatly improved conditions that exist as compared with those of the bad old days, before Mr. Westhoven, with the assistance of the Minister for Air and myselfj got to work on improving the conditions of the workers. The men now have messes. Cooks are provided. Quarters are available for married couples. Previously, the conditions under which the people lived, were disgraceful. So we should congratulate Mr Westhoven on. the manner in which he reported on. the Commonwealth railways up to that time. Both . Mr Blain. the Conservative government to which he reported and the Labour Government are also to be congratulated for what they have done to give effect to his recommendations. Thereby the conditions of the railway workers on the line to Alice Springs and of the Trans-Australia line have been greatly improved. However, the conditions of the workers on the line from Darwin to Birdum were left unchanged. I interviewed Mr Westhoven in his office in the Commonwealth Bank Chambers, Sydney, about what should be done on their behalf. He told me he for was waiting to be asked to go to Darwin by the union. Then I went to Darwin and pleaded with the executive of the railway workers to invite Mr Westhoven to do for them what he had done fbr their colleagues on the other Commonwealth lines. That was 1937, an election year. Because it was an election year and probably because acceptance of my intervention on their behalf might help me politically, (Mr the leaders of the union, .fearful of the outcome, refused to invite him to Darwin. It hurt me to think that I had put the ball at their feet and they had refused to play. So, for many years, the workers on the Darwin-Birdum line have lived1 under much worse conditions than have the workers on the Trans-Australia line and on the north-south line to Alice 1 Springs. Mr I think the Public Service Arbitrator should do something for"" the clerks, temporary and permanent, male and' female, at Alice Springs. Their secretary invited me to attend a meeting at which they were considering putting their case to the Public Service Board. I advised them not t'o go over the head of the board by1 approaching me as their federal member before the board had given a ruling. They have a good case for an increase of salary, if only because the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) increased' railway fares and freights by 25 per cent, recently. Anyway, I discussed the plight of the clerks with the union secretary, Mr. Bowditch, and also with Mr Matthews at' Darwin. I refuse to believe that they have not recently written to me because this is an election year and because they are fearful that if I took up their cudgels on the floor of the House of .Representatives and assisted them, 1 would gain political kudos. They are educated men and women. There are .five panels involved. The Public Service .Arbitrator should be deputed to go through the Northern Territory and consider their problems immediately. The workers there should not have to carry on their negotiations in - writing with the Public Service Board, which is so far distant. Let the Government take the bit in its teeth and not wait until the clerks ask that the Public Service Arbitrator go 'to the Northern Territory, 'but let it send him there with instructions to go thoroughly into all matters. I resilize that the con a fine job for the pastoral workers and hotel employees, but the public servants could well have ""their problems dealt with by the Public Service Arbitrator. Let the .Minister for the Interior, who was in the Northern Territory at about the .same time as I was there recently, not hang back in the collar, but do something for the workers there immediately. I return now to the matter of the establishment of a branch - of the Security Service in Darwin. I am disturbed that we have a Communist cell in the city. It seems to have been taken lightly by the Government. I remind Ministers that Darwin is a focal point. It is the gateway to Australia from the north. Agents of Russia-let us not back and fill about mentioning its ,name-whos e .ideology is opposed to o.ur own, could do great damage 'to the port of Darwin. They could so damage it as to prevent the .arrival of petrol for naval, military and air establishments. I .have taken part in listing the name9 of known Communists in Darwin. We bave 83 listed, many of whom are on the government .payroll. There .are whose names are not listed publicly. The prisonment Government would be surprised if I named those whom I suspect to be ComFederated munists. I put it to the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) and the Prime Minister officials. (Mr Chifley) that it is high time that Then, under they took the area of Darwin seriously. There are Communist9 on the public payroll. Apart from that, we should conaider the position of the Standard newscrucify paper, which is definitely communistic. on It has been Communist-controlled ever since the former editor, Don MCKinnon, was kicked out. 'Of the union executives 95 per cent, are rank Communists. That remark does not apply to rank and file. Does the Australian Government intend to turn a deaf ear or a Nelson blind eye to that state of affairs? It is high time my representations were heeded. I sympathized'with the young fellow who has been nominated as the Australian Labour party candidate for the Northern Territory - at the forthcoming general election. His candidature is being sponsored by the Standard and the Communists. The Minister for the Interior knows that young fellow and he knows that, in his innocence, he is being used by the Communists. I know, too, that the Communists are anathema to the Ministei-, as .a former '.leading official of the Australian Workers - Union. That young fellow is playing with fire in allowing liis candidature to be sponsored in this treasonous newspaper, the Standard. I desire to know how the Communists came to obtain the printing .machinery from the Army for a song after the war. Surely the security officer had the right to visit that newspaper's office. It is up to the Government to .prevent that from printing what it now .prints. That is to say, it would be up - to a real government which was not itself being used as .a Trojan horse by the Communists. To indicate to the committee the character of this newspaper I shall read some of the items that appeared on the front page of its issue of Sth July which, because copies of the newspaper are not airmailed to Canberra, is the last issue that I have available. Here is an example of what the Communists who produce this newspaper think of this governmentTlie Federated Iron workers' Association was 23 today tined £1,000 by the Court. Jack MCPhillips was sentenced to six months' imand has been arrested. Ken MCKeon, Sydney District Secretary of the Iron workers' Union, was fined £100. Other cases nre proceeding against Union the headline "" The Betrayers "", the newspaper says"" L a b o u r "" Premier Chifley who went on - strike in 1917 once said that he would never 'the workers. Now he has em-barked the infinitely .more cruel course of attempting to starve them into submission. Evatt frequently prates of human rights, now lie is striking at the very foundation of all human rights-the right to eat. That is the position in Darwin and I ask the Attorney-General, the Minister for the Interior, and the Government in general, what they are going to do about these Communists who are astride our road to Singapore. The Communists in Darwin are able to flit back and forth by air to Singapore, Timor and Djokjakarta and I ask the Minister to inform the committee of the identities of the men and women who fly so often back and forth between Australia and its neighbouring - countries in the east. I ask that the Director-General of the Security Service, Mr Justice Reed, be instructed to order that people who make these flights shall be very carefully watched. Mr HOI.I-OWAV - He will be aware of what the honourable gentleman has said lo-night.",55
256,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I am glad that my representations are being heeded. Tho Communists in the Northern Territory .are treason merchants who are definitely trying to get the multitudes of Indonesia into the Communist camp. Mr "" Jock "" 'Garden started it , as I said before the pension of the sitting. The Communist ideology is moving like wildfire in Indonesia. Now China has joined that .amorphous mass under the encouragement - of the Moscow pressure group. influence of the Communists now stretches right across Europe and the Asian mass into Malaya. There is not much of Malaya left that we can call British the danger there is very serious, - cularly when we recall what has happened in Burma. I shall now quote from a speech made at a Methodist Church .gathering by Dr TJsman, the Indonesian representative in Canberra, on the August, 1947, to an audience of 1,500 people. This extract will give the mittee some very interesting information :about what is happening in Indonesia. have a typewritten copy of his speech, three pages of which are concerned with on the Chair. Dr TJsman trying to prove how cruel the Dutch were statedA real parliament never existed nor a university. After three and a half centuries of Dutch rule, ninety-three per cent, of the Indonesian population illiterate . . .

258,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I am merely trying to pin-point the trouble in Darwin and to show the committee how dangerous it is, for security reasons, that Communists are permitted to thrive in Darwin, which is situated in such close proximity to our neighbours in the very near north. Dr TJsman continuedFor a population of approximately seventy millions there are only three colleges for higher education, namely, one for engineering, one for medicine and one for law, respectively, at Bandung and Batavia.",58
259,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH, Order! The honourable gentleman must come back to the Estimates. He had better get back to the subject of Darwin.,58
260,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"r - As I have not been given suspermission to state the whole case, perhaps I may be allowed to state part of it . A further extract from the speech readsWell known outbursts against Japanese cruelty and rule were the farmers' revolution The of Singaparna, in 1943-the military revolts at Bliter in 1944 and Chilachap early in 1945. the plot in West Borneo in 1944 where more land than 5.0011 Indonesians were killed.",58

263,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH, I Order! The honourable gentleman will withdraw and apologize for his reflections,58
264,Mr BLAIN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I withdraw my reflection, but I point out that I was referring in Indonesia, to the Government itself.",58
265,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Fremantle) [9.36] are still The only parts of the Opposition's contribution to this debate which may be taken seriously were the speeches immediately following the resumption of the sitting that were made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen). The honourable member for Wentworth spoke of lengthy dossiers about public servants. Very good evidence of the keeping of dossiers was given to us this evening by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain), who informed us that he had dossiers on 83 people in the Northern Territory, including 20 public servants. The honourable member for Wentworth regards the keeping of dossiers as very deplorable. I hope that the criteria on which the honourable member for Northern Territory has based his dossiers were a bit more scientific than those on which be based his argument in the speech that he has just concluded. The honourable member for Indi, taking his cue from those members of the Opposition who belong to the legal profession, attacked the system of conciliation as a device to undermine the system of arbitration. The legal members of the Opposition have, on a number of occasions, gone further than that and have suggested that the qualifications for a conciliation commissioner should be those of law, that is to say, that they should be graduates in law. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) once put it, a legal training gave them the forensic ability that was necessary when they were adjudicating in arbitration and conciliation cases.",58
266,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I referred to practical forensic experience.,59
267,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The suggestion that conciliation undermines the arbitration system was made more crudely by the honourable member for Indi, who, apparently, did not appreciate the refinesioners ments of the points made by the honourable member for Parramatta. I find the suggestion that conciliation undermines arbitration very interesting. It is quite clear that the founders of the Constitution clearly differentiated in section 51, sub-section (xxxv.), between conciliation and arbitration. They conceived them to be two distinct things. They conceded it to be necessary to have non-legal [36] judgments in court cases. The honourable member for Indi was a Minister in a government that made several amendments to the original Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and in view of his performance to-night it is interesting to read section 25 of the original act of 1904, which founded this sacred system that, according to the Opposition, is only now being altered by a Labour government, which is laying hands on what was a purely legal court and putting in these hobbledehoys who are not lawyers. The act of 1904 was amended in 1910, 1911, 1926, 1930 and 1934, and also on other occasions and right up into a period when the honourable member for Indi was a Minister. Section 25 of the original act readsI n the hearing and determination of every industrial dispute the Court shall act according to equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform its mind on any matter in such manner as it thinks just. That is the legislation that was maintained, quite rightly, by honourable gentlemen opposite when they were in office.",59
268,Mr MCEWEN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,It provided for appeals to the court.,59
269,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"A decision of a conciliation commissioner does not concern anything fundamental such as the basic wage. The commissioners make decisions on what one might call minor industrial problems that arise in the course of industry and that, in view of the number and type of disputes requiring adjudication, would be quite clearly beyond the ability of courts consisting of highly trained lawyers to handle, because of the time involved in hearing them.",59
270,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Conciliatio n com mis also give decisions on major matters.,59
271,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"After all, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is mvolved in many complicated legal technicalities. For instance, the question of the exact limits of the jurisdiction of State arbitration courts and of the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has at times been a very difficult problem. Honourable gentlemen opposite are quite right, however, in assuming that there is a general objection in the industrial moveniunt and in the Labour party to lawyers appearing in arbitration courts. There was a reversal of form quite recently hy the Labour Government in Western Australia, in connection with the Public Service in that State. It decided that teachers who were appealing against the appointment of other teachers' to higher positions should have the right to legal representation, and that the adjudicating body should be not just a Public Service appeals board, but a much more formal instrumentality. Then the beanfeast for lawyers began! When some teachers put in their appeals in .October, just after the relevant act had been passed, the standard fee for legal representation was £5. A great many of these appeals began to be heard and the lawyers realized that here was a field from which revenue could be obtained. Within a month the standard fee was £10. Then, over the Christmas holidays, realizing that a large number of appointments would be made in February, which would be the subject of appeals, the lawyers of Perth got together and the standard fee became £25. The result was that a member of the teaching profession who wished to appeal against the appointment of another member to a position had to pay £25 to get legal representation, and if the case lasted very long he had to pay out a bit more. There are some Ministers in this Government who have had a great deal of experience in conducting union cases before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, when legal representation was almost essential. Unions had to face paying fees of £100 a day plus refreshers of £90 a day",59
272,Mr MENZIES,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,It sounds like a Commonwealth brief.,60
273,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The expense of justice as administered by lawyers and as advanced by lawyers, have been impressed rather forcibly on the minds of a great many people, and I have no doubt that although the teachers union of Western Australia is an extremely respectable union, and has not had anything to do with the Labour party, it will come round very sharply to the viewpoint that there is perhaps a very wide field of arbitration in which it is possible to have a court that shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform its mind on any matter in such manner as it thinks just. This may not happen of course until a few of its members have been mulcted by lawyers with heavy fees. The honourable member for Indi quoted the occupations of conciliation commissioners. He approved of Mr Blackburn, who was a lawyer, as a very good conciliation commissioner. He said that he thought that the others were not so good. Of course, his argument was useless because we did not submit any evidence of incompetent jurisdiction by even one commissioner. We gathered that he regarded the previous positions that some of the appointees had held as rather amusing, and he thought apparently that if a man had been a trade union secretary, a position in which he would necessarily have become well versed in arbitration procedure over a number of years, he would be unfit to be a conciliation commissioner. The honourable member was unable to produce a shred of evidence to substantiate the charges he made against any of the individuals he named. He spoke of them as being former, party politicians. I do not make any complaint about that. If honourable members read through Hansard they will find, that when the Labour party was in Opposition, Labour members had a good deal to say about political appointments that had been made by the government of the day, both to the Arbitration Court, to which the former Liberal senator, Mr Drake-Brockman, was appointed, and to the High Court to which Sir John Latham, who was Leader of the Opposition during the regime of the Scullin Government, was appointed Chief Justice. As everybody knows, Mr Latham, as he was then, was elevated to the High Court in order to make room for Mr Lyons to assume the leadership of the Opposition.",60
274,Mr MENZIES,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,That is a monstrous statement. Mr Latham was elevated to the High Court four years after Mr. Lyons had assumed office as Leader of the Opposition. Evidently facts mean nothing to the honourable member.,60
275,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) may be quite correct. The point I made was that the honourable member for Indi had characterized a certain gentleman, Mr. Hamilton Knight, as having been a member of the Labour party, and had suggested that hi3 membership of that party should have disqualified him from selection for appointment as a conciliation commissioner. The analogy between his position and that of Chief Judge DrakeBrockman and the Chief Justice of the High Court is that they had all been members of political parties. If I have made a misstatement of the actual circumstances of the appointment to the High Court of the Chief Justice I regret it. The point made by the honourable member for Indi in relation to Mr. Hamilton Knight is the pertinent point in this argumeut. I have not heard it suggested by any responsible person that the Chief Justice of the High Court is any worse a judge because of the fact that he has had (political experience. I do not think that the fact that Mr. Hamilton Knight had practical experience in the Government of New South Wales should disqualify him for appointment as a conciliation commissioner. The honourable member for Indi made a most unworthy speech. He suggested that there was an intention on the part of the Government to undermine arbitration, and he clearly implied that the appointment of these fifteen conciliation commissioners was an instance of how arbitration was being undermined. If that were so, all these gentlemen would be contemptible instruments. The honourable member said that the Communists are trying to bring arbitration into contempt. There is no question about that. The only persons who publicly suggest that conciliation commissioners are the means by which this Government is trying to undermine arbitration are persons who themselves are attempting to bring the system of arbitration into contempt. In trying to score this point the honourable member was attempting to score very unworthily. I doubt whether the country will take very seriously the objection which he has raised to these appointments, especially when it is not backed up by evidence of poor jurisdiction on their part. The speech made by the honourable - member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) on the subject of security was extremely interesting. He complained that dossiers had been prepared on certain civil servants, but he did not inform us of the character of those dossiers, nor did he say whether the civil servants concerned were suspect. He spoke of the compilation of the dossiers as a terrible thing. The honourable gentleman is most vocal in this Parliament on the subject of the employment of Communists in the Public Service. He has asked questions on many occasions about their employment in the Postal Department, which he rightly described as a key communication service. How is it to be known whether or not Communists are employed in the Postal Department if nobody is to inquire about these things or exercise any supervision over public servants? When he sees evidence that there is some surveillance of a section of the Public Service, he speaks of it as deplorable. There is no consistency about the honourable member. He opposes simply for the sake of opposition. While he claims that there is need for surveillance, when he sees evidence of it, he deplores it . Hia claims to knowledge of what goes on in foreign embassies and in the most secret sections of our Security Service will not be taken very seriously. The Estimates for the security and investigation services of the Commonwealth seem to be very inadequate. That only £115,000, plus an additional amount for the service under the control of Mr. Justice Beed, has been provided appears to suggest that we are the most modest spenders on security in the world. Most countries expend very large sums on their security services. I do not suggest that we need to provide larger amounts for this purpose, but I do suggest that the votes are not excessive and that they should not be queried on that ground. I thank the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) for his explanation of the position in regard to patents. The statement which he made regarding the difficulty in getting technical officers to examine claims for the patenting of processes seems to he unanswerable, and appears to confirm the fear on the part of some engineers who have submitted claims that their qualifications are superior to those of some of the officers who deal with their claims. I suppose that that is inevitable in these days when technicians can obtain better salaries outside the Public Service. I i trust that a revision of salaries in the Patent Office will be made so that the important business of dealing with patent applications may be expided.",61
276,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Wide Bay) [9.52] - The honourable member for Ereworrying mantle (Mr Beazley), who has just resumed his seat, made so many misnow representations and so distorted the views of honourable members, on this side of the chamber that I do not propose Page Government. to waste my time by replying to him. Everything possible should he done to improve the system of conciliation and arbitration in this country so that the prospects of peace in industry may be enhanced. It has been said by an honorI able member opposite that in 1929 I joined other honourable members now on this side of the chamber in voting for abolition of arbitration. Nothing could be further from the truth. I orable members that what I then did I did in company with honourable members of all the political parties that were represented in this Parliament. Up to plain his' actions. that time unsuccessful attempts had been made on four occasions to induce the people to clothe the Commonwealth with full authority in industrial matters, but on each occasion the people rejected the prosought posal. Only three alternatives were then open to the government of the day. First, it could have held another referendum of the people, at a cost of approximately £100,000; secondly, could have asked the States to exercise full authority in industrial matters; and thirdly, it could have asked the States to hand over to the Commonwealth full powers over industry. The Bruce-Page Government, which was then in office, decided to adopt the third alternative, but the States rejected the proposal. The Government thereupon introduced a bill into the Parliament which was designed to hand over to the States full authority to deal with all arbitration matters. Had that bill been passed it would have affected no fewer than 29 awards in my own State.",62
277,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH, Order ! The honourable member is departing from the Estimates now under discussion.,62
278,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"You , Mr. Temporary Chairman, have been worrying and preventing me",62
279,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Order! The Chair has not been worrying the honourable member. On the contrary, the honourable member has been the Chair. He must relate his remarks to an item in the Estimates under discussion. He is out of order in discussing the circumstances which brought about the defeat of the Bruce",62
280,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The hearing of the Chair is at fault. I did not refer to the defeat of the Bruce-Page Government. It has been suggested that am opposed to the granting of moneys for the purpose of maintaining the arbitration system. It has been suggested the that in 1929 I voted in favour of a measure which was designed to abolish assure hon the arbitration system.,62
281,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The honourable member has had ample opportunities on other occasions to ex,62
282,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I have not had such opportunities.,62
283,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Then the honourable' member should have them. During the consideration of the Estimates of the Attorney-General's Department, he will not be permitted to discuss the action which he took in 1929 in relation to the arbitration proposals it of the Bruce-Page Government.",62
284,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I wholeheartedly support the system of conciliation and arbitration. If , in fact, I had opposed the continuance of arbitration in 1929, I should oppose it today. You, Mr Temporary Chairman, may get out of that one, if you can. I go further and say .that I would support an extension of the arbitration system if by that means we could ensure peace in industry. The most that the Opposition can do is to press for an amendment of the law to provide for the holding of compulsory secret ballots before a strike may be declared. Let the free men in this free democracy express themselves and not be dictated to by the agents of a foreign power. Those saboteurs are determined to cause industrial turmoil and delay the housing programme.",62
285,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Order! I ask the honourable member to relate his remarks to the proposed vote for the Attorney-General's Department.,63
286,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I shall do so. I have supported every move that has been made to strengthen the arbitration system.,63
287,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Fawkner) [10.1] - The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), in his reply to the debate, either omitted or neglected to make any reference to three of the four matters which I raised this afternoon. If the right honourable gentleman speaks again, perhaps he will find an opportunity to deal with those points, should he consider that they are of sufficient consequence to warrant a reply. However, I return to one of the four matters that I mentioned earlier because I feel that although the Attorney-General may have made a genuine and sincere attempt to give information on it, there are various phases of it that shall require clarification. I make it clear, at the outset, that I am trying to treat this matter as objectively and as factually as I can. The Commonwealth police force is primarily and almost entirely a secret police force. We see only a few officers in uniform in the precincts of the Parliament, at aerodromes and in some public places. A large majority of the members of the police forces of the States are in uniform and in full view of the public. Many of the leading officers are well known to the public generally. However, members of the police forces conducted by the Commonwealth are not known widely to the public or even to members of the Parliament and of the Public Service. I do not make that remark with any sinister intonation. The fact is, and I do not think that it will be denied, that the police forces of the Commonwealth are, in the main, secret bodies in the sense that personalities are not known, and that their activities are not widely 'known either to the Parliament or to the public. Therefore, it is all the more important that the administration of those police forces should be above suspicion, and that there should be no feeling, either in. the Parliament or among the people, that they are ever used improperly or for partisan political purposes by th_ Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, who apparently is now to administer the Security Service, or any other Minister. One point which I should like to clear up with the Attorney-General is the statement that he made that our police forces were conducted upon somewhat the same lines as the Federal Bureau of Investiga* tion in the United States of America.",63
288,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I referred to the Security Service, under Mr Justice Reed.",63
289,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I understood that the Attorney-General said that the Department of Trade and Customs might require the services of a member of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, and, rightly or wrongly, I got the impression that he stated that the Commonwealth Investigation Service was conducted on much the same lines as the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America.",63
290,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,I referred to the Security Service.,63
291,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Apparentl y the Attorney-General did refer to the Security Service, which is a new organization. The right honourable gentleman mentioned that the Department of Trade and Customs might require the services of an officer of the Commonwealth In vestigation Service. As the result of the war-time expansion of departments and of the great increase of Commonwealth activities, many persons were appointed to police the operation of regulations. The Attorney-General may correct me on this matter if I am wrong, but I understand that by no means the greatest number of officers who have been appointed to police those regulations come under the right honourable gentleman's administration. From, my understanding of the position, I believe that almost every senior Minister in this Government has attached to his department investigation officers who are not members of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, and who do not come under the general supervision of the Attorney-General.",63
292,Mr WARD,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,That is not true.,64
293,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Then I shall mention the departments which, according to my understanding of the position, have their own investigation officers who function under the general administration of their respective Ministers. The Department of Trade and Customs has its investigation officers. We were informed recently that some of those officials, apart from their ordinary duties, check from time to time incoming mail and parcels in collaboration with oflicers of the Postmaster General's Department. The last-named department, I understand, has its own investigation officers. The Department of the Treasury has its investigation officers, many of whom are employed in the Taxation Branch. Not long ago the Department of Trade and Customs had special investigators to deal with problems of rents and prices control, and I should be interested to learn whether they have been withdrawn from those duties. I assume that they are carrying on investigation work either in the Department of Trade and Customs or in some other department. The Department of Immigration, I understand, employs investigation officers who inquire into the bona fides of immigrants and deal with other matters which come under the purview of the Minister for Immigration. Each of the three service departments maintains its intelligence service, although what those three intelligence services do in peace-time is somewhat of a mystery to me. I am not attempting to make the point that if those services exist they are being used improperly by the respective Ministers for political purposes or for any other purposes; but I say that, if this growth has occurred during the war and as the result of the expansion of departments, all those services should be brought under one central administration, which should be responsible to one Minister, and, through him, to the Parliament. If every senior Minister has his own team of investigation officers, the opportunity does exist, whether it is exercised improperly or not, for a Minister to assign to those officers tasks which should not normally be given to them and which could be designed to embarrass a political opponent or to take an improper advantage of a citizen.",64
294,Mr HABBISON,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,The Repatriation Department has investigation oflicers.,64
295,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"We learnt recently of the methods of those investigators in relation to some war widows, who, it was alleged, had not been conducting themselves according to the standards that were approved by the department. I should like to know whether investigations of that kind are carried out by the Commonwealth Investigation Service or by officers who are answerable to the Minister for Repatriation and are employees of that department. Within the Department of Information, there are many men at the present time who were censors during the war. In that role, they naturally came into possession of a great deal of confidential information about people throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Many of them are still working with the Department of Information, and are carrying out research functions-to give the term a rather euphemistic turn-for the Minister for Information. If we line all of them up, we shall have quite a team of investigators of whom comparatively few are officers of the Comonwealth Investigation Service. Another group of officers, the peace officers, were formerly working for the Department of Munitions. Their functions were to safeguard munitions establishments which came under the general jurisdiction of that department. If nearly every Commonwealth department has its own team of investigators who are not answerable to any central administration or to the Attorney General, obviously honourable members' do not get a true picture of these activities by merely examining the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department. What the Parliament and the people should be told, in order that they may have a realistic picture of bow many investigators are employed by the Commonwealth, is the total amount that is expended on such services. I invite the Attorney-General to give us a complete and clear picture of the situation. I ask him whether my understanding of the position, that there are scattered throughout various departments a number of investigators, is correct. I should like the right honourable gentleman to tell us his own opinion about my suggestion for bringing all those activities under one administration. I think that he will agree that a system of the kind that I have described, if it exists, is capable of serious abuse. It would be in the interests of better government if there were one organization responsible to one Minister and answerable, through him, to the Parliament. In that way, we should have a check, but under existing conditions, these growths could take place and the Parliament and the people would not know anything about it. The day could come when we should find ourselves with a sinister network of investigation and inquiry that would represent an unwarranted and unreasonable intrusion into the private lives of the citizens.",64
296,Mr MENZIES,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.13] - I do not propose to occupy the time of the committee for more than a few minutes, but I feel that some reference should be made to a very unfortunate remark which fell from the lips of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). I am sure that the honourable gentleman fell into this error quite inadvertently; but it is one that must be put right. In the course of his address to the committee, the honourable member referred to the appointment of politicians, or former politicians, to judicial office, and to illusfar trate his point, he ventured to say that the present Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir John Latham, had been appointed to that office in order to get him out of the road so that Mr J. A. Lyons might become Prime Minister.",65
297,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,So that Mr Lyons might become the leader of a party.,65
298,Mr MENZIES,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is so. The statement by the honourable member for Fremantle, as honourable members who are familiar with the facts know, is completely wrong. Mr Lyons became Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives in 1930, and Sir John Latham became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia in 1935. One has only .to mention the dates to demonstrate how absurd the allegation is. As a matter of fact, when Sir John Latham became Chief Justice of the High Court, I was Attorney-General, and I had the privilege of nominating him for appointment by the Lyons Government. Formerly he had himself been Attorney-General in that Government. It is interesting to recall that his appointment as Chief Justice of the High Court took place after I had become Attorney-General in sui;uession to him. I mentioned those dates because the honourable member for Fremantle should have them in mind before he makes charges like that again. As a matter of fact, Sir John Latham was an eminent lawyer. If to be a member of Parliament, or a Minister of the Crown, is to be a disqualification for judicial office, then Sir John Latham was disqualified; but if to be one of the few outstanding leaders of the bar, and a lawyer of great experience, is to be a qualification, then Sir John Latham had that qualification. All I need to do is to point out that he was appointed on my own nomination five years after Mr. Lyons had become leader of the party in succession to him, and he was appointed entirely on his merits. I do not share the view that service in politics is a disqualification for appointment to the Bench. It would be absurd to say that a lawyer of great knowledge and experience was disqualified for judicial office because he had the public spirit to serve the country in parliament. That would be fantastic. My only complaint, in so as I have a complaint, is that service in the Parliament should not be regarded as a substitute for legal knowledge and experience. Assuming that a man has legal knowledge and experience, and the judicial mind and character, his experience in public affairs may be of great value to him, particularly in certain jurisdictions. Reference has been made to the conciliation commissioners. Apropos of them, I should like to say that I do not regard the fact that a man has been a member of Parliament, and therefore a party politician, as a disqualification for office as a conciliation commissioner. A person's suitability for such a post should be decided entirely upon an assessment of him as an individual. My own criticism of the system of conciliation commis< sioners, as established, is that it substitutes tj_e conciliation commissioner for the judge. Under existing conditions a conciliation commissioner does not act as a conciliation commissioner, but as an arbitrator. He is himself the judge in the case. When the legislation under which the commissioners were appointed was before the Parliament, we on this side took the opportunity of saying that if it were proposed to wipe out the ordinary arbitral jurisdiction of the judges, and to set up fourteen or fifteen conciliation commissioners who would themselves be judges, it was a great error to leave the decisions of the commissioners without appeal or control. The commissioners might easily apply different principles to cases, and thus produce a series of anomalies of the kind that give rise to industrial dissatisfaction. Experience has supported that criticism. I think that arbitration court judges would say without hesitation that there ought to be some means of getting rid of such anomalies.",65
299,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,It has already said so.,66
300,Mr MENZIES,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"That is so. It would be undesirable to grant the right of appeal in every case, because that would string proceedings out to the crack of doom, but I do not know why there should not be an appeal by leave of the courts itself, such leave to be granted only when there was a matter of real importance to be decided. On some future suitable occasion, when this matter is under review, I shall seek to have the law amended along those lines. The real point of the criticism of the conciliation commissioners is embodied in what .1I have just said. The majority of the commissioners were union secretaries. I am not quarrelling with that, as such. I have had, in my time-it was a fair number of years ago. I agree- a good deal of experience in industrial matters, and have had to do with union onicials and organizations nf pmnloyers. The commissioners are, no doubt, experienced men. They could be used effectively if their function was that of conciliation or getting the parties together: but when their function becomes arbitration, so that they sit in final judgment between the union on one side and the employer on the other, honourable members should not be surprised if there are many people in Australia who feel that the decision of a union secretary in such a position is not necessarily an unbiased one. I am not making a personal attack on any of the commissioners. I am quite certain that they are all doing their best. I have no desire to criticize them or to attack them as men; but it is undesirable, where people sit in final judgment-and there is no appeal from the decision of the commissioners-that we should have a3 final adjudicat rs men, the whole of whose training, zeal and loyalty, admirable as those qualities are, tend to bring their judgment down on one side rather than on the other. Dr. EVATT (Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs [10.251 - The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) criticized the conconciliation commissioners on the ground that they had been associated with trade unions, and that one of them had actually, as a member of Parliament, supported the Labour party. The remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) were made in reply to that criticism. It is impossible to reconcile the criticism by the honourable member for Indi with the observations of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). I think that every one on this side of the chamber will agree with what the Leader of the Opposition has just said. Indeed, I have said much the same things myself. I believe it to be true that experience of parliamentary life, or of the semi-public life of a trade union official, is an asset. A person may have loyalties, but when he is in a position where he must discharge judicial or quasi-judicial functions, he will be conscious of those loyalties and guard against them. The honourable member for Fremantle merely pointed out that in many instances persons otherwise qualified were appointed to judicial positions, notwithstanding the fact that they had been members of the Parliament, or even of the Executive. In my judgment, the fact that they have occupied such positions is a qualification, not a disqualification. I am able to accept everything that the Leader of the Opposition said on that point. But the right honourable gentleman then went on to criticize the conciliation system, and to say that there should be an appeal from the decision of the commissioners. He admitted, fairly enough, that if there were an appeal in every instance cases would go on to "" the crack of doom"", as he put it. Of course they would. It was because of the delays arising from the hearing of industrial disputes the new system was introduced. It would be possible, of course, to have a system of by judges of the Arbitration Court that appeals limited as the Leader of the Opposition suggested; but the method followed has been to encourage consultation between the commissioners and the judges, and that method is working satisfactorily. It may be that the present system will have to be revised in the light of experience, but the commissioners are working well with the judges. Difficulties experienced at the commencement are being overcome, and everybody hopes that the system will be successful. In reply to the matter raised by honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt), it is true that there are investimust gation officers in some departments as the Department of Trade and Customs.",66
301,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Are there such officers all the departments I enumerated?,67
302,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Possibly , but the able member mentioned only three or four departments out of a total of nineteen. Side by side with the system of internal investigation officers in certain departearlier ments, we have had a Commonwealth Investigation Service ever since it was established by the right honourable memto ber for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) sioners. nearly 30 years ago. In that service there are officers who have become experts, particularly in enforcement proceedings. Arbitration Bill. That does not mean that enforcement proceedings could not be taken without them, and it may be that the activities of such officers could in some instances be unified. The Public Service Board is now considering the desirability of unifying staffs where possible, but that would not be a help in 9ome departments. Immigration inquiries are not usually concerned with breaches of the law. Where a breach of the law has been committed, the matter .is usually taken over by the investigation service of the Attorney-General's Department. I do not think there is any substance in the honourable member's point. It is true, of course, that in the Commonwealth of Australia police, officers are not usually in uniform; but that is only another way of saying that the ordinary enforcement of law and order in Australia, outside Commonwealth territories, where there are uniformed police forces, is a matter for the States. Commonwealth peace officers protect Commonwealth property, such as aerodromes, the service departments and the like. But there is no secrecy, in any sinister sense. There is simply, I submit, tb normal procedure for detecting and dealing with breaches of the Commonwealth laws which are administered by one or another of the nineteen Commonwealth departments. If the Public Service Board takes up this point further, I have no doubt that the points raised will be considered. the But there is no fear of any infringement of the rights of citizens. There be a body of people to enforce such the Commonwealth laws. I know that the honourable gentleman does not object into that. That sums up the position. I am obliged to honourable members who have made helpful suggestions about the honoradministration of the department.",67
303,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Parramatta) [10.31] -1 . rise to correct another observation made by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). He made some reference to something that I am alleged have said about conciliation commisI think he must have been referring to the speech that I made last year on the Commonwealth Conciliation and,67
304,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,When the honourable gentleman deplored suspicion of lawyers.,67
305,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I remember what was said on that occasion. I did not advance any case for the exclusive appointment of lawyers as conciliation commissioners. What was said then and was repeated to-night by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) dealt with the importance of the Arbitration Court itself and th.i undesirability of enlarging the jurisdiction of the conciliation commissioners, as it was being enlarged by the Government in that amending legislation. I stressed the value of legal training and, in particular, of practical forensic experience as a way of getting at the truth and enabling people to see both sides of a question. That was all that I attempted to advance. I do not believe that there is any necessity or any case for confining appointment as conciliation commissioners to lawyers. .No argument could be advanced for that to be done. Some of the conciliation commissioners are lawyers. I think the Chief Conciliation Commissioner, Mr Mooney, is a solicitor of some experience. Some of us have respect for the work that he has done.",67
306,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,He is not a fully qualified solicitor.,68
307,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Perhaps not, but he has had many years of experience in a legal office.",68
308,Mr HOLT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,He is a very able conciliation commissioner.,68
309,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Yes . The point I wish to make from that is that I am sure that some of his skill and ability is derived from his practical experience in the courts and in dealing with legal matters generally. Mr Commissioner Blackburn is, I believe, a trained lawyer, and I believe that his legal trainthey ing has added to his qualifications and value as a conciliation commissioner. The point is that, after the passage of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which created the present conciliation commissioner system, about sixteen conciliation commissioners-d o not bind me to precise figures, for I may be one or two out-were appointed. I think one retired and one died and that both were replaced. It is a fact that almost all the original appointees were either trade union secretaries or were active participants in the Labour movement. My first comment, which was made at the time and is repeated now, is that the Government cannot tell me that the nnly people who should be appointed as conciliation commissioners are peopjle drawn from the Labour movement. I can well understand, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that there is a case for the appointment of men of wide industrial experience, but why draw almost all of them from one side of industry? We submitted that point when the bill was being discussed. We said at the time, and I say again, that the inference to be drawn that the Government was concerned in getting into the job men who would have, by their training and experience, bias in one direction. I think experience in several cases, although not for what was said by Government supporters at that time was in all, has wholly borne that out.",68
310,Mr CONELAN,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Nam e the cases!,68
311,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I have named some of them. I do not propose to name them again. I know the men to whom I referred. I have appeared before some of them. At the moment proceedings in which I am interested, are before the High Court to restrain one of the in who is determined to get his way, which happens to be the Labour party's way.",68
312,Mr BEAZLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,Why not let the High Court decide?,68
313,Mr BEALE,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"I agree. The High Court has restrained him, and he is trying to get round the injunction. We have taken out a second injunction. I mention that only in passing. Experience has shown that several of the conciliation commissioners are biased. I do not say that are wickedly or deliberately biased. But men drawn from a particular field, with a limited background, cannot avoid bias. The Government should have picked people from various fields. The matter need not be considered only in the light of what the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) and I , or other lawyers with experience, may say. In formation may be obtained from parties who have appeared before many of the conciliation commissioners. If one reads the journals issued by the various federations and associations in the last couple of years one sees complaint after complaint about some of the conciliation commissioners. One may say, well enough, that some of these complaints are biased and express the employers' point of view; but where there is smoke there is fire, and when one has complaint after complaint one must conclude that there is some substance in the complaints. Experience has shown that some of these commissioners are in capable of approaching, in a truly i m partial spirit, the problems that they have been asked to solve. Tbat brings us to the point that we made last year and that was well made again to-night by the Leader of the Opposition, that it was wrong to give to the conciliation commissioners the enormous jurisdiction that they have without any right to appeal, because as honourable members know, apart from hours of work, rates of pay and rates of pay for females, everything is now decided by conciliation commissioners. It was because of that that the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court recently made the criticism that he did make of the present system. Chief Conciliation Commissioner Mooney made a similar criticism. Honourable members w i ll not say that those criticisms were biased.

318,Mr TTJRNBULL,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"Wimmera) [10.43]. - I refer to questions that I have recently addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr . Chifley) in this House. On Thursday of last week, at question time, I asked the Prime Ministerwhether it is a fact, as reported, that the Australian Government has hypothecated to its own use an amount of petrol per annum equal to approximately GO per cent, of the supply that was available under the recently terminated .rationing scheme to the whole State of Tasmania? The Prime Minister repliedI do not know of any special allocation of refined petrol that has been made to Commonwealth departments. On Tuesday of this week, I asked the Prime Minister a further question and prefaced it by sayingThe Prime Minister has indicated that no provision has been made to assure the Australian Government of an adequate petrol Bupply. of the I then askedIs the Government at present hoarding petrol ? If it is not doing so how is it that, present, the Government appears to have abundant petrol for its vehicles while the public are forming queues or travelling all over our various cities to try to obtain petrol ? The Prime Minister answeredI infer from the honourable gentleman's question that he suggests that the Australian Government should become the sole importer of and trader in petrol. In other words, he considers that the Government should completely the petrol industry. If that is so, I should be glad if he would advise the public accordingly. Any one can see that the inference taken by the Prime Minister was quite incorand I regret to say that I am conthat he knew, when he gave the answer, that I was not suggesting by my question that the Australian Government should socialise the petrol industry. The Prime Minister did not want to give a l straight answer to a straight question and and he framed his reply in a way that was gauged to gain some paltry political advantage. Every one in this House knows that I am totally opposed to socialism and to the lack of enterprise and production that are always associated with it. All I ask is that I he given a reasonable answer to a straight question. What are the facts? The High Court of Australia ruled that petrol rationing was invalid. Then the coal strike increased the requirements of petrol beyond the normal amount. Private consumers and businessmen found it difficult to secure adequate petrol, because the Government did not see fit to allow more petrol to be brought into the country to offset the greater demand. Government vehicles, however, appeared to be abundantly supplied. The Prime Minister stated that no provision had been made to assure the supply of petrol available in Australia to the Government, so the logical question was: Is the Government hoarding petrol ? Petrol hoarding is a procedure that the Prime Minister has condemned. Instead of answering this question the right honourable gentleman endeavoured to twist it and suggested that I favoured socialization of the petrol industry. Consequent upon the suggestion in my first question that the Australian Government had reserved for its own use an amount of petrol equal to approximately 60 per cent, of the recent ration allocation to the whole of Tasmania, I have ascertained that the yearly allocation for Tasmania under the recent rationing system was 14,300,000 gallons, and thai the amount used by the Australian Government and its departments for the same period was 8,400,000 gallons,' which is approximately 60 per cent, of the total supply available to Tasmania. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS. The following papers were sented :Commonwealth Public Service Act-A p pointment-Departmen t of the Treasury - S . R. P. Allen-Rand.

323,Dr EVATT,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"On the 20th September, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) asked the following questions, upon notice:With reference to the provision in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act requiring certain organizations to lodge bal ance-sheets with the Industrial Registrar each year, will he state: (o) how many unions are required under the act to furnish balance sheets; (6) how many have furnished balance sheets to the Registrar, and what are the names of such organizations; (c) how many balance-sheets are outstanding and from which organizations; (d) if it is intended to enforce the provisions of the act against the organizations concerned; and (e) whether there are any provisions for the balance-sheets to be made available to honourable members? I then promised that the information would be obtained and furnished to the honourable member as soon as it was available. I am now in a position to furnish the following answers to the honourable member's questions:(a) Every registered organization is required under the act to file its balance-sheets or financial statements. (b) and (c) There are 194 organizations registered under the act-14 4 organizations of employees and 50 of employers. After a great deal of research the Industrial Registrar has furnished me with a statement setting out the information asked for by the honourable member regarding each of the 194 organizations concerned. As the honourable member will appreciate, the statement runs into many pages and is not suitable for incorporation in Hansard as part of an answer to a question. The Industrial Registrar's statement may be summarized as follows:(1) Organizations which have not at any time filed balance-sheets or financial statements - Employees' organizations, 10; employers' organizations, 18.

The number of sitting days is not a true index of the amount of work performed by a conciliation commissioner. A considerable amount of time is expended by conciliation commissioners in inspections and informal consultations and, after hearings, in studying the transcript of evidence and in drawing up awards or orders. In addition, conciliation commissioners are assigned to industries or groups of industries throughout the Commonwealth and are thus compelled to expend much time in travelling.

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. 0 Mr DRAKEFORD - On the 9th March last, the honourable member for Swan 6 (Mr Hamilton) asked me the following 6 questions:(a) Is it a fact that those oflicers contributed to the superannuation scheme as ."" employees"", whilst other officers, including permanent commissioned warrant officers, contributed as "" officers "" ? (6) Is it also a fact that all officers were credited with deferred pay by authority of the same A i r Force order? (c) Is it a fact that the officers who contributed as "" officers "" to the superannuation scheme have the right to elect from three alternatives, as laid down in A i r Board Order No. 58/1948, paragraph 46, and will receive their deferred pay either as a paid-up contribution to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Scheme, or in a lump sum upon retirement? {d) Is it also a fact that the deferred pay standing to the credit of these temporary commissioned warrant officers, in most instances ranging from £350 to £500, is to be denied them either as a paid-up contribution or in a lump sum? I now advise the honourable member as follows:(a) The officers mentioned did contribute to the superannuation fund as "" employees "" for pensions payable on retirement on reaching the age for retirement or on prior invalidity or death. This applies also to all other officers who, prior to being granted commissions during the war in the Citizen A i r Force, were airmen of the Permanent A i r Force. Officers of the Permanent A i r Force, except those of the Permanent Commissioned Warrant Officer (Commissioned Warrant Officer) Branch, contributed as "" officers"" for pensions payable only on death or invalidity. Permanent officers of the Commissioned Warrant Officer Branch of the Permanent A i r Force contributed as "" employees "" for retiring pensions. (6) Deferred pay under A i r Force Regulations, frequently referred to as Permanent Air Force deferred pay, as distinct from the deferred pay under War Financial Regulations with which, it is presumed, this question is not concerned, was not credited to all Royal Australian A i r Force officers. Those to whose deferred pay account such deferred pay was credited were as follows:(i ) Officers of the Permanent A i r Force. (i i ) Officers of the Citizen A i r Force who, prior to being appointed during the war to commissioned rank in the Citizen A i r Force, were airmen of the Permanent A i r Force and wenappointed prior to the 2nd A p r i l , 1942, to the General Duties Branch, Equipment Branch or Commissioned Warrant Officer Branch of the Citizen A i r Force. (i i i ) Citizen A i r Force officers who commenced continuous full-time duty aa officers prior to the 6th October, 1939, and (iv) Citizen A i r Force officers who had commenced continuous full-time duty as airmen of the Citizen A i r Force prior to the 6th October, 193b, and were appointed to commissioned rank in the General Duties, Equipment, Medical or Commissioned Warrant Officer Branches of the Citizen A i r Force prior to the 2nd April, 1942. Officers who were not credited with this Permanent A i r Force deferred pay included:(i ) Citizen A i r Force officers irrespective of branch who had not commenced continuous full-time service prior bo the 6th October, 1939. (i i i Those who, although they had been airmen of the Permanent A i r Force or airmen of the Citizen A i r Force who had commenced continuous full time service prior to the 6th October, 1939, were not appointed to commissioned rank until the 2nd April, 1942, or later or, if appointed to commissioned rank prior to the 2nd A p r i l , 1942, had been appointed to the Administrative and Special Duties Branch or the Accounting Branch. Citizen A i r Force officers who were credited with Permanent A i r Force deferred pay as mentioned above were not so credited under the same A i r Force Regulation as that under which officers of the Permanent A i r Force were so credited but under a separate regulation, lixcept those who had been airmen of the Permanent A i r Force, Citizen Air Force officers did uot contribute under the Superannuation Scheme. (c) Officers who contributed as ""officers"" to the Superannuation Scheme, i.e., officers of the Permanent A i r Force other than those of the Commissioned Warrant Officers Branch, did have the right under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme to three alternatives as set out in paragraph 46 of A i r Board' Order A.58/48. The alternatives are(i) To have deferred pay accrued to 1st - Tuly. 1948, applied towards the pi rchase of f u l ly paid units under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Scheme and to contribute by fortnightly contributions for the remaining number of units appropriate to their rates of pay. In such a case the retiring pension to be full pension provided by the act, in accordance with circumstances of retirement. On retirement under conditions not conferring an entitlement to a pension or other benefit, to receive a refund of contributions including the deferred 0 pay used for the purchase of paid up units. No further credits of deferred pay after 1st July, 1948. (i i) Deferred pay to remain at credit of respective deferred pay accounts of officers concerned for payment to officers on retirement and to be increased by interest but not by further credits of deferred pay. Officers to contribute to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Scheme by fortnightly contributions for the number of units for which they would so contribute by fortnightly contributions under alternative (i ) , i.e., the number appropriate to rate of pay less the number of full y paid units' which their deferred pay would have purchased. On retirement to receive deferred pay to 1st July, 1948, plus interest and also a pro rata pension or benefit calculated on the number of units for which contributions were made or, if not entitled to a pension or benefit, a refund of contributions, (i i i ) Deferred pay to remain at credit of deferred pay accounts' and to be increased by continued credits of deferred pay and interest. Officers contribute to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Scheme at the - low rate at which they contributed as ""officers"" to the Superannuation Scheme for ""death or invalidity "" benefits only. On retirement, except on invalidity, deferred pay as increased by further credits and interest, to be paid to officers. On retirement on invalidity or on death a pension is payable normally but deferred pay is forfeited although the deferred pay may be taken in lieu of the pension if desired. Thus, officers of the Permanent A i r Force who contributed to the Superannuation Scheme as officers may receive their deferred pay as either a paid up contribution of part of their retiring pension or as a lump sum on retirement and may receive, in addition, that part of thp pension towards which they have contributed by fortnightly payments. They cannot receive deferred pay ns a lump sum and also a full nension. («f) Deferred pay accrued prior to the 2nd November, 194.2, to the credit of commissioned warrant officers of the Permanent A i r Force, i.e.. during the period they were contributins: as "" officers"" for benefits on death or invalidity terminating their service,, is held to the credit of their account and paid to them on retirement. Deferred pay which accrued to commissioned warrant oflicers of the Permanent A i r Force since the 1st November. 1942. and deferred pay of Citizen Air Force officers being ex^irmen of the Permanent A i r Force who contributed to the Superannuation Fund aa ""employees"" for invalidity, death benefits and a pension.on retirement was, under the Superannuation Act forfeitable if the benefit other than a. refund of contributions under that act was greater than the accrued deferred pay. The same position exists under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act. They may receive accrued deferred pay and a refund of contributions under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act if retired in circumstances which do not confer entitlement to pension or a greater lump sum benefit under the act. The member cannot, however, receive a doable retirement benefit of pension and also deferred pay. Deferred pay in the case of such officers is not available under the act for purchase of fully paid units as it is subject to forfeiture if the member or his dependants became eligible for benefits under the act. The question regarding the disposal or utilization pf deferred pay referred to in (d) above received consideration when the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act was drafted. The deferred pay of officers of the Permanent Air Force who contributed as ""officers"" to the Superannuation Fund waa the only benefit payable on their attaining retiring age. Officers of the Commissioned Warrant Officers Branch and ex-airmen of the Permanent A i r Force commissioned in the Citizen A i r Force and who contributed aa "" employees"" under the Superannuation Act had a retiring benefit of either deferred pay and refund of contributions nr ii retirement benefit of pension or a lump - uin payment under that act greater than .Inferred pay. These officers had no right to payment of deferred pay other than as an alternative retirement benefit and this position hns been maintained under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act ",73
330,Mr DRAKEFORD,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"On the 16th September, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) asked the Prime Minister, in my absence, the following questions in relation to the aircraft accident which occurred near Fairbairn Aerodrome, Canberra, on the 15th September :1. Is formation flying an extremely dangerous exercise because the risk of collision is great and very great if carried out at night or continued into cloud as it was yesterday I 2. Further, is formation flying quite obsolete for operational or other purposes, except, perhaps, as a spectacle to be observed from the ground 7 3. If they are facts, will the right honourable gentleman ask the Chief of the A i r Staff to issue an order prohibiting formation flying entirely or limiting it to the keeping of formato tions of not less than two wing Spans distance, or only to aircraft fitted with automatic ejector-type seats, which allow the pilots' canopy to fall away and catapult the pilot clear of the a i r c r a f t ! 4. Furthermore, will the Prime Minister inquire whether the aircraft that spun in yesterday and could not be approached because of exploding point five ammunition was about to engage on a gunnery exercise TI f it was not, will he ask A i r Marshal Jones to order that live ammunition is not to be loaded unless a gunnery exercise is to be carried outt In o w f u r n is h hereunder the following replies to the questions asked:1. Formation flying is not regarded by the Air Staff as an extremely dangerous exercise because of the risk of collision. Formation "" take-offs"" with twin or multi-engined air. craft, however, can he dangerous because of the risk of engine failure; which would cause the aircraft in which the failure occurred to swing across the paths of other aircraft. For this reason formation ""take-offs"" in twin and multi-engined aircraft are forbidden. There is a safety distance laid down for pupil pilots and this distance is two wing spans, whilst, at the game time, the pilot must fly in a position in which he can see all other aircraft in the formation. The distance laid down for qualified pilots is half a span for fighter aircraft. According to A i r Staff advices, flying in formation at night is not difficult provided navigation lights are used, or provided the night ie clear. Formation flying in cloud is again not unduly hazardous and is, in fact, an operational necessity. The press report that the Mustangs at Canberra collided as the formation was emerging from cloud is quite incorrect, as the formation was never in cloud at any time. In fact, it if authoritatively reported that there was no cloud whatever at the height at which the aircraft were flying. 2. Formation flying is not obsolete for operational or other purposes. Precision bombing by day, particularly in the face of enemy fighter opposition, demands formation flying, firstly for mutual support against attack by enemy fighters, and secondly to ensure a concentration of bombs on the target. Fighter aircraft always fly in formation, and so far as can be seen at the present time, will, in any future war, continue to fly in formation so that aircraft can mutually support each other, and, more important, to ensure that effective control can be exercised at all timer by the Squadron or Wing Leader. In general. Air Staff has adviBed that formation flying was, is, and must, continue to be employed when moving aircraft from point to point to ensure effective control by the Squadron or Wing Leader as well as for the efficient anil expeditious movement of the aircraft. 3. In view of the replies to questions 1 and 2, the question of issuing an order prohibiting formation flying does not arise. Wit h regard the automatic ejector type seat, that fitment has only become necessary because of the impossibility of the pilot getting out of the latest types of jet propelled aircraft which fly at speeds in excess of those attained by orthodox aircraft. Experience has shown that escape can be made from the orthodox type of aircraft under practically all conditions. In all aircraft escape hatches are provided for this purpose and are capable of extremely rapid operation. In the Mustang the canopy can instantly be jettisoned by pulling an escape lever, and in . thia particular instance, the pilot did, in fact, jettison his canopy, and did leave the aircraft. Unfortunately, the canopy of the parachute became caught on the tail-plane of the aircraft. 4. In operational aircraft, ammunition is normally carried because, without it , the aircraft would ""handle"" very differently, and the pilot would be given an entirely wrong impression of the "" handling "" characteristics and general capabilities of MB aircraft. For example, the weight of ammunition carried in a Mustang is 620 pounds, and bearing in mind that this weight is carried in the wings of the aircraft, it will be appreciated that, if that weight were not carried, the aircraft would.""handle"" and perform very differently. The inference in this question is that it may not be possible for the crew of a burning aircraft to be rescued because of exploding ammunition preventing a near approach by rescuers. In this regard, it can bo stated that ammunition will not commence to explode until a fire has heen burning for an appreciable time by which the occupants of the crashed aircraft would either have been rescued, OT would be beyond aid, In the particular case under reference, A i r Staff has advised that the pilot's body was lying well clear of the aircraft, and assistance to him was in no way retarded or endangered by the exploding ammunition. ELECTORAL: GENERAL ELECTION; POLITICAL BROADCASTS.",75
331,Mr CHIFLEY,WOOL TEXTILE RESEARCH,"On the 20th September, the honourable member for Held (Mr. Lang) asked me questions concerning the recent order by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board on political broadcasts. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has furnished the following statement:The Political Broadcasts (Federal Elections) Order was made by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in pursuance of an obligation imposed on it by section 6a of the Australian Broadcasting Act to ensure equitable facilities for the broadcasting of political matter. The board realized that this particular legislation was of a novel character and, in the course of its deliberations on the subject, it was confronted with great difficulties in determining what would constitute equitable facilities in the political field as it exists in Australia today. Consequently, before deciding to make an order covering the broadcasting of political matter during the forthcoming federal election campaign, the board carefully examined the practices adopted in other English-speaking democracies and those which had been recommended unanimously by all-party committees .of the Federal Parliament for adoption in Australia. The order which the board made incorporated principles which are substantially comparable with those followed by the English-speaking democracies, notably Great Britain, the United States and Canada and arc in substantial conformity with the recommendations of the Gibson Committee and the first report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting. Nevertheless, it would seem from the discussion which took place in the Parliament last week that, notwithstanding the relevant provisions of the act, it is not the desire of the Parliament, which has power to disallow any order of the board, that these conditions should be applied to the broadcasting of political matter prior to the forthcoming federal election. The board has therefore decided to repeal paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of the order. The remaining .provisions will require the licensees of commercial broadcasting stations to refrain from discriminating between parties and candidates in respect of charges, and to submit returns to the board. These returns will enable the board to .place before the Parliament a complete report on all aspects of election broadcasts so that the whole matter may be reconsidered in the light of the information available.",76
