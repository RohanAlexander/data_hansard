3,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," I begin the week by wishing a very happy birthday to the former member for Throsby, the great Jennie George-happy birthday, Jen. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Falun Gong To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systematic torture. Such conduct stands in blatant violation to all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific; David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net). We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to openly and forthrightly call for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China. from 4,224 citizens Marriage NA NA NA To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the Marriage Act 2004 states ""marriage means the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntary entered into for life"" which is the foundation upon which families are built and on which our Australian society stands. To amend the definition of marriage to include same sex homosexual or lesbian ""marriage"" would be to change the very structure of our Australian society, especially the education system to the detriment of all, particularly children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that any Marriage Equality Amendment Bill be opposed. And, as in duty bound, will ever pray. of the House that from 176 citizens Public Holidays To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:  Weekend and shift workers are disadvantaged whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a weekend and the public holiday substitutes (is moved) to the following Monday or Tuesday.  When substitution occurs workers rostered to work on the actual special day falling on the weekend don't receive a public holiday whilst workers rostered to work on the substitute day do.  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Some States have legislated for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day to be public holidays when they fall on a weekend plus provide an additional public holiday on the following Monday. or Tuesday.  Weekend and shift workers are also disadvantaged because Good Friday, Easter Saturday (in most states) and Easter Monday are public holidays but Easter Sunday (except in NSW) is not. (The NSW Parliament unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday.)  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Parliament should legislate a uniform standard across Australia. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act to include: 1. An additional public holiday (not a substitute day) on the following Monday and/or Tuesday whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day fall on a weekend. 2. Easter Sunday as a public holiday. from 428 citizens and 95 citizens Health Insurance To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of ……...... draws to the attention of the House: To financial penalties [GAP] carried by citizens who alleviate the burden on the Public Health system and use Private Health insurance by opting to be a private patient in a Public or Private facility. There's reimbursement under the co-payment system between Medicare and Health insurers in regard to Medical practitioner fees and services. having paid for Private Health Insurance should be covered by ""insurance"" as insurance"" is understood to mean by the general population. Medicare and Private Health Insurance system does not provide sufficient cover in protecting private patients from financial hardship due to the built in factor of unknown costs [Gaps]. I therefore ask the House to: address and correct through the parliamentary process the failure between Medicare and Private Health Insurers in providing insurance that can offer 100% health insurance protection for private health insurance user in regard to all medical bills and charges from approved government practitioners and health service providers. I ask the Government to find a process that can offer financial protection for citizens in regard to the copayment or GAP and make it a condition of approval to operate as a Private Health Insurer under the Private Health Insurance Act of 2007 that insurance companies provide policies that offer citizens 100% cover with no GAPS for all medical services. from 1 citizens Nationally Owned Bank To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australians for a New People's Bank draws to the attention of the House: the need to establish a new people's bank to counteract the predatory behaviour of the privately owned banks. The Federal bank's ownership is to be incorporated into the Australian Constitution to prevent the government of the day from selling the new people's bank without first asking the people in a referendum whether they want to sell their bank. We therefore ask the House to: pass legislation in the House of Representatives to establish a new people's bank. Pass legislation to hold a referendum to give Australians the opportunity to incorporate the ownership of the new Federal bank in the Australian Constitution. from 2,645 citizens insufficient Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of Citizens the House of Representatives This petition of certain students of Santa Maria College. Draws to the attention of the House the current asylum seeker legislation and debate, pertaining to those seeking asylum in Australia by arriving on boats from Indonesia. Current asylum seeker policy of both the government and opposition fail to ensure for the just, fair and humane treatment of these people. We therefore ask the House to ensure that any amendments to existing legislation and any future legislation upholds the standards set by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia is a signatory. In particular, the standards of: Article 3: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. Article 5: No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Article 14: Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution: Article 25: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and, the necessary social services, from 134 citizens Petitions received.

4,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"Reid) Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Human Rights: West Papua Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 25 June 2012 concerning the Standing Committee on Petitions' consideration of two petitions regarding Indonesia's Papuan provinces: The Australian Government strongly supports Indonesia's territorial integrity and recognises its sovereignty over the provinces of Papua and West Papua, which resulted from the 1969 United Nations' sponsored Act of Free Choice. The Act of Free Choice was supervised by the United Nations and conducted in the context of broad international support for finalising the decolonisation process of Indonesia. At that time, Australia voted with 83 other nations at the UN General Assembly to accept the outcome of the Act of Free Choice. There were zero votes against and 30 abstentions. The Australian Government has no intention of raising this issue in the context of the United Nations. The Australian Government supports training for Indonesian security forces and military that emphasises human rights awareness, accountability and respect for the rule of law including in Papua and West Papua. We do not train the Indonesian police or military to counter separatist groups or organisations. The focus of Australian engagement with these forces is combating terrorism. Against the tragic history of terrorist activity in our region, including the loss of 88 Australian lives in the first Bali bombing, such engagement is crucial in protecting the safety of both Indonesians and Australians. The results of these efforts are clear: Indonesia has been both effective and determined in its response to terrorism, arresting around 700 people on terrorism-related charges over the last decade and convicting close to 500. The Australian Government is committed to working with Indonesia to boost its capacity to contribute to regional security and will continue our collaborative and multilateral engagement with its security forces and military in preventing the (10:02): broader regional threat of terrorism. The Australian Government supports a vigorous and free press as a key feature of modern Indonesian democracy and will continue to highlight the importance of vibrancy and diversity within its media. We regularly underline the value to Indonesia of being seen to be open to international media. Australia raises with the Indonesian Government the importance of allowing credible observers access to the Papuan provinces, including by foreign journalists, Australian Government officials, and nongovernmental organisations. On 23 May 2012, the Australian Government participated in the UN Universal Periodic Review of Indonesia, which included providing key recommendations to help bolster Indonesia's human rights record throughout the country. Australia's recommendations to Indonesia included improving the access of local and international media organisations throughout the country, and its engagement with key international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Thank you for bringing the petitions to my attention. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator B Carr Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 13 February 2012 concerning a petition from people of the North Western Region of Victoria, regarding the cost of living for pensioners. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding to you. The goods and services tax (GST) applies broadly to goods and services, with a limited number of exemptions in areas such as basic food, education and medical services. The GST replaced a number of Commonwealth and State taxes and is set at a single uniform rate of 10 per cent. Having a single rate that applies to most goods and services minimises complexity and reduces compliance costs. Revenue from the GST goes to the States and Territories giving them a secure source of funding to assist them in providing essential services, such as health and education. I note that under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations any change to the rate or base of the GST requires the support of the Australian Government and the unanimous agreement of the State and Territory Governments. In response to the petition of the people of the North Western Region of Victoria, I note that supplies of water, sewerage and drainage are GST-free. Australian Government including council rates, are exempt from GST, as are other fees and charges paid to an Australian Government agency for a permission, exemption, authority or license, including car registration. The GST applies to some goods and services that are considered essential such as electricity and private car and house insurance. However, the Government's policy is not to tax or exempt items on the basis of whether they are essential. The GST operates most efficiently when applied to as broad a range of goods and services as possible. Extending GST-free treatment to products purchased by pensioners would require a different tax treatment for identical products, depending on who purchased them. Varying the tax treatment in this way is inconsistent with the nature of the transactions-based GST system. Consequently, the Government does not consider it appropriate to waive GST for pensioners. Taxation In 2009, the Government improved the adequacy of the pension through one-off increases and changes to the indexation arrangements as part of the Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform. The maximum pension payment to single pensioners, including supplements and indexation, has increased from $601.08 per fortnight on 1 July 2009 to $755.50 a fortnight from 20 March 2012. Across the same period the maximum pension payment to couple pensioners, including supplements and indexation, has increased from $983.08 (combined) to $1,139.00 (combined). The Government recognises that pensioners can sometimes find it difficult to keep up with increases in the cost of living, including increases in essential services such as utilities: As part of pension reform in 2009, the Government has improved indexation arrangements to ensure they better respond to cost of living increases faced by pensioners. The maximum base pension rates are now indexed to the greater of the increase in the Consumer Price Index and the increase in the new Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI). The PBLCI measures the specific cost of the things pensioners typically buy. Pensions are then compared to the male total average weekly earnings (MTAWE) benchmark and are increased if necessary to bring them in line with MTAWE. taxes, I trust this information will be of assistance to you. from the Treasurer, Mr Swan Migration Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 19 March 2012 concerning the petition lodged with the Standing Committee on Petitions by friends of Mrs ………… I apologise for the delay in responding. I understand from the petition that Mrs ………… wishes to migrate to Australia to be closer to her brother and the friends she has made during her visits. The Australian Government acknowledges that there is value in family members migrating to Australia, as recognised in the recent Federal Budget announcement with an increase in the migration program places for the 2012-13 financial year. As there are a limited number of places available however, the Government must balance the demand for Family stream visas. As such, priority is given to partners, dependent children and carers of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens. Proportionately fewer places are made available to non-dependent family members such as parents, adult siblings, adult children and other relatives. The Remaining Relative visa is for applicants (and their spouses or de facto partners) who have no near relatives usually resident outside of Australia. A near relative is a parent, sibling, dependent child or their step equivalent. This is an objective legal requirement which cannot be waived, and there is no discretion to consider the nature and quality of such relationships. I appreciate the disappointment of Mrs ………… and her friends that she does not meet the requirements for the Remaining Relative visa because of her adult children living outside of Australia. Nevertheless, I can confirm that there are no plans to broaden the eligibility criteria for this visa to allow a greater flexibility in such circumstances. All people wishing to migrate or remain permanently in Australia must first apply through my Department and meet the legal criteria for grant of a particular visa. Australian migration law only permits me to intervene in limited circumstances where a decision has been made by the Department to refuse a visa application, and that decision has been reviewed by the Migration Review Tribunal. As Mrs ………… has not had an application reviewed by this tribunal, I am unable to intervene in her case. Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen Heritage Listing: Dampier Archipelago Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 21 May 2012 concerning The Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the addition of Dampier Archipelago as a World Heritage listing. On 2 March 2011, Senator Sterle advised the Senate, on my behalf, that the Australian Heritage Council would be instructed to assess whether the Dampier Archipelago has heritage value of Outstanding Universal Value and any threats to that site. On 4 April 2012, the Australian Heritage Council submitted their final report, which is available to the public on the Council's website: http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/ahc/inde x.html. I have requested the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and nonCommunities to provide me with advice on the report's findings. I will take the appropriate action after considering that advice. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr T Burke Foreign Investment in Agriculture Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letters of 21 May 2012 about two petitions for restrictions on the purchase of Australian land by foreign investors. As the Treasurer, the Hon. Wayne Swan MP, is responsible for foreign investment policy, I have forwarded copies of your letters to the Treasurer for his consideration. Thank you again for your letters. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig Foreign Investment in Agriculture Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 21 May 2012, reference number 650/1056 concerning foreign investment. The Government, like previous governments, is committed to a case-by-case approach to considering foreign investment proposals. This approach maximises investment flows while protecting Australia's national interest. In the agricultural sector, it helps ensure that investments do not adversely affect the sustainability of Australia's national agricultural resources, including their economic, social and environmental contribution to Australia. The Government does not support an approach that would impose blanket bans or restrictions or involve government compulsorily acquiring commercial interests in food companies. Foreign investment has helped build Australia's economy and will continue to enhance the well-being of Australians by supporting economic growth and prosperity. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 provides the legislative framework for the Government to review significant foreign investment proposals on a case-by-case basis. It enables the Treasurer to block proposals that he finds contrary to the national interest or impose conditions on an investor to address national interest concerns. All foreign governments and their related entities must notify the Foreign Investment Review Board and receive approval for direct investments, new businesses and land acquisitions, irrespective of the value of the investment. However, the Government recognises community concerns about the sale of rural land and agricultural businesses to foreign investors and is taking steps to ensure that its policy in this well understood and is also strengthening the transparency of foreign ownership of rural land and agricultural food production. The Government is committed to facilitating foreign investment in the agricultural sector, consistent with protecting Australia's national interest. The Government's 18 January 2012 Policy Statement on Foreign Investment in Agriculture also provides detailed guidance on specific factors typically considered in relation to proposed acquisitions in the agricultural sector. These include the impact of the proposal on the quality and availability of Australia's agricultural resources, including water; land access and use; agricultural production and productivity; Australia's capacity to remain a reliable supplier of agricultural production, both to the Australian community and to our trading partners; biodiversity; and employment and prosperity in Australia's local and regional communities. The September 2011 release of the Agricultural Land and Water Ownership Survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) confirmed that Australia's agricultural industry is mostly Australian owned. It found that 99 per cent of agricultural businesses in Australia and around 89 per cent of Australian agricultural land are entirely Australian owned and a further 6 per cent of Australian agricultural land is majority owned by Australians. In addition, more than 90 per cent of water entitlements for agricultural purposes in Australia are entirely Australian owned. These results are broadly comparable with levels of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses and land reported in the agricultural census of 198384. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences report Foreign investment and Australian agriculture, released in January 2012, found that Australia has a high level of food security and produces more than twice the amount of food it consumes. It concluded that foreign investment in the agricultural sector enhances Australia's food security by increasing efficiency and productive capacity and contributing to incomes, infrastructure and employment, often in regional areas. Its assessment was that foreign investment area is is vital in supporting growth and jobs for Australian farmers and regional communities and that lower levels of foreign investment could carry significant risks for Australia's agricultural communities. To build on this work, in January 2012, the Government announced an expansion of ABS statistical data collection activities including the expansion of the Agricultural Census to provide ongoing information on ownership of Australian agricultural businesses, land and water. On 15 June 2012, the Government also established a working group to consult on the development of a Commonwealth foreign ownership register for agricultural land. A national foreign ownership register for agricultural land would provide the community with a more comprehensive picture of the specific size and locations of foreign agricultural landholdings over and above what is currently available. The Government will pursue a register where it will clearly improve transparency of foreign ownership in agriculture without imposing unnecessary burdens on investors or duplicating work already undertaken by State and Territory governments. Australia is in the fortunate position of producing significantly more food than we consume. In 2010-11 Australia exported $27.1 billion worth of food products, compared with imports in the same year of $10.6 billion. In recent years we have been able to export more than half of our food production, depending on crop sizes, while still ensuring that over 90 per cent of our fresh produce is domestically grown and supplied. This provides significant capacity to meet our future food needs, and to be a significant and reliable supplier to the world food market. However we cannot be complacent, particularly given challenges such as climate change, resource constraints and an increasing population. The Government has committed to developing Australia's first national food plan to help its vision of a sustainable, globally competitive, resilient food supply that supports access to nutritious and affordable food. Further information on the development of a national food plan is available on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's website at: www.daff.gov.au/nfp. Thank you again for your letter and I hope this information will be of assistance to you.

Thank you again for your letter and I hope this information will be of assistance to you. Yours from the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation, Mr Bradbury Petition: Latrobe Regional Hospital Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 24 May 2012 seeking my response to a petition currently under consideration by the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding federal funding for the redevelopment of Latrobe Regional Hospital under the Health and Hospitals Fund (HHF) 201 I Regional Priority Round. All applications for funding under the HHF were assessed on their individual merit by the independent Advisory Board against the HHF Evaluation Criteria and Regional Priority Round Additional Guidance. The Board then provided its advice to me, as the Minister for Health, on whether each application met the criteria. The HHF Advisory Board assessed this application as having met the Evaluation Criteria and Additional Guidance. However there was a strong interest in the Round, with applications totalling almost $3.4 billion, far exceeding the $475 million available and the Government was unable to fund all eligible projects. Latrobe Regional Hospital was one of these un-funded projects. All applicants were advised in writing of the outcome of their application following the 201213 Federal Budget announcements on 8 May 2012. The Australian Government is committed to its broad health infrastructure investment program, which is equipping the nation's health and hospital system for the future. I note the community support for this project and appreciate the work required to prepare this application. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Financial Services Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 21 May 2012, reference number 660/1066, alerting me to the petition regarding financial sector companies sending jobs and customer information off-shore. I apologise for the delay in responding. I expect businesses in the financial sector to look after their employees like all other Australian businesses. Businesses must endeavour to utilise the talent and hard working spirit of Australian workers, and manage costs by investing in the training and productivity of their employees. The finance and insurance services sector remains strong in Australia and continues to employ more Australians. It is encouraging to see that employment in the financial and insurance services sector increased by around 42,700 jobs (up 11 per cent) in the last two years. This compares with an additional 270,300 jobs for the rest of the economy (up 2.4 per cent). Regarding the protection of customers' information, the Privacy Act 1988 regulates the sending of personal information overseas. Banks and financial institutions are permitted to transfer personal information to an overseas recipient under certain conditions. These conditions include the individual consenting to the transfer, or the transfer being necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual and the organisation. You may be aware that the Government is undertaking comprehensive reforms to Australia's privacy laws. The reforms will ensure that individuals must be made aware of how and why personal information is, or will be, collected and how the entity will deal with that personal information. Among other things, agencies and organisations will be required to notify individuals whether their personal information is likely to be disclosed to overseas recipients. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance to you. from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Mr Shorten Centrelink Dear Murphy Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2012 about a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. The Petition requested an examination of the transition process to access concessional medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), when a dependent child turns 16 years of age. The Department of Human Services (the department) writes to customers who are receiving Parenting Payment Single in the period leading up to the youngest child's 16th birthday. The letter advises that entitlement to the payment will cease and that the associated concession card will be cancelled. The customer is invited to contact the department should they still require social security support. Depending on the date the customer contacts, transferring from one payment type to another can be backdated to ensure continuity of entitlements of their concession card and/or income support. Commonly, a customer on Parenting Payment Single will transfer to Newstart Allowance. When a person has primary caring responsibility for a dependent child they will also have access to a Pensioner Concession Card. In the case of the customer being granted Newstart Allowance, a new concession card will be produced and mailed to the customer. Production and delivery of personalised concession cards can take up to 14 days. Where a customer has advised they urgently need access to concessional entitlements, the department can provide an interim voucher to the customer which can be used to confirm their eligibility for the concession. There is a further safeguard to ensure that customers have access to the PBS while waiting for their card to arrive in the mail. A customer who pays the non-concessional rate for prescription medicines can take their receipts to any Service Centre offering Medicare services and claim a refund upon presentation of their Medicare card. A check is made against the department's records, which are updated nightly on working days, to determine whether the customer is entitled to concessional rates when they make a claim for PBS. The department considers that the current arrangements are satisfactory and that the processes in place to ensure a customer's continued access to their entitlements under circumstances are adequate. If any customer needs further assistance, the department will discuss the options of other entitlements for which they may be eligible. from the Minister for Human Services, Senator K Carr Marriage Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 21 May 2012 regarding a petition opposing same-sex marriage submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions from the Christian and Muslim communities. The Government notes the strong opinions on this subject. As you are aware, three bills have been introduced into Parliament and have been referred to committees for inquiry. The future consideration and progress of the Bills will be a matter for the Parliament. from the Attorney-General, Ms Roxon Petition: Robina Mail Delivery Centre Dear Mr Murphy Petition - Australia Post Delivery Centre, Robina Thank you for your letter dated 23 May 2012, concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding opposition to the closure of the Australia Post Delivery Centre at Robina, Queensland. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to its operational network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that it continually reviews its facilities by examining costs, revenue and performance, including the capacity to meet its customers' needs. In monitoring changes in the mail network, and noting that the Bundall these Delivery Facility has the capacity to accommodate the operations and staff at the Robina Delivery, it has been decided that these services would be consolidated from June 2012. While this consolidation of mail operations will have no impact on the mail delivery currently provided to the Robina community, Australia Post recognises the impact the change will have for PO Box holders at the Robina Delivery Centre. I understand that Australia Post communicated well in advice of the planned June relocation and provided alternative options for PO Box customers, including free mail redirection for 12 months. The PO Boxes are being relocated to the Town Centre complex, which offers a 24 hour PO Box Lobby. The Lobby is well-lit, weather-proof and provides secure minister@dbcde.gov.aupost office with a full range of retail services with of access to undercover parking and public transport. Australia Post has advised that Robina continues to be well-serviced with a number of postal retail outlets within close proximity, including the Q Super Post Office, Robina Post Office,' Mudgeeraba Licensed Post Office (LPO) and more recently, Varsity Lakes LPO. Australia Post believes that these postal outlets are meeting the needs of the community. Australia Post remains in contact with the Member for MCPherson, Mrs Karen Andrews MP. Australia Post advised Mrs Andrews on 5 June 2012 that the PO Boxes would be relocated in late June and that the Town Centre complex had been identified to become a new Superstore. Renovations to the retail outlet began on Thursday, 31 May 2012, with the transformation to the Superstore completed at the end of June 2012. I am advised that the post office remained open for business throughout the renovation period. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Economy, Senator Conroy Tomaree Peninsula: Hydrotherapy Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 28 May 2012 regarding a petition requesting a hydrotherapy facility in the Tomaree Peninsula, New South Wales (Ref: 670/1078). The Australian Government is committed to improving the delivery of health care in rural and remote communities by providing better access to infrastructure funding. There are a number of programs within my Department which may be of interest to the petitioners. The National Rural and Remote Health Infrastructure Program (NRRHIP) is a competitive grants program which aims to improve access to health services by funding projects in rural and remote communities where a ease lack of infrastructure is a barrier to the establishment of new health services, or the enhancement of existing health services. The Program provides up to a maximum of $500,000 (GST exclusive) to eligible applicants seeking to provide services in the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas 2 to 5 with a population of up to 20,000. Round six of the NRRHIP closed on 15 December 2011. The assessment process has been finalised and information on successful applicants is available at www.health.gov.au/nrrhip. Further information on the NRRHIP, including future funding rounds, is also available on this website. A $5 billion Health and Hospitals Fund (HHF) was established on I January 2009 under the Nation-building Funds Act 2008 and forms part of the Government's broader nation-building infrastructure program. This investment delivers major improvements in health infrastructure through renewal and refurbishment of acute and primary care facilities, medical technology equipment and major medical research facilities and projects, Digital The Government provided funding for 85 health infrastructure projects valued at $3.2 billion in the first two funding rounds of the HHF. These projects span three critical areas: the fight against Facility cancer; translational research and research workforce infrastructure; and the improvement and modernisation of the hospital system. The Government subsequently committed to a third HHF round focussed on regional health infrastructure, and funding of $1.33 billion (GST exclusive) for 63 projects was confirmed as part of the 2011-12 Federal Budget. The aim of this round was to assist regional communities by providing upgrades to regional health infrastructure, expansions to regional hospitals and support for clinical training capacity in regional hospitals. The Government also announced further funding of $475 million (GST exclusive) for another HHF regional priority round to open in 2011. Applications for the 2011 regional priority round closed on 19 October 2011 with funding of $475 million (GST exclusive) for 76 projects announced in May 2012. Further HHF funding round arrangements have yet to be determined. Further information about future rounds will be available www.health.gov.au/hhf. In addition, the Day Therapy Centre (DTC) program provides for therapy services to both frail older people living in the community, and to low level care residents of Commonwealth funded residential aged care facilities. DTC clients receive a wide range of therapy services such as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and podiatry, which all aim to optimise their independence to allow them to remain in the community, or in low level residential care, for long as possible. There are over 140 centres across Australia, and program funding for 2011-12 is $37,626,782 (GST exclusive). On 24 February 2012, I announced a three year funding extension of existing providers until 30 June 2015. The extension will provide over $117 million (GST exclusive) in funding over three years. The Australian Government recognises the need for fundamental reform of the aged care system in order to ensure that it continues to provide high quality care and can respond to future challenges. Information on the comprehensive reform package can be found on the 'Living Longer. Living Better.' website www.agedcareaustralia.gov.au. As part of the Living Longer. Living Better. aged care reform, the Commonwealth Home and Community Care program, the National Respite for Carers Program, Day Therapy Centres and the Assistance with Care and Housing for the Aged Program will be consolidated under a new Home Support program from 1 July 2015. The Home Support program will have a focus on prevention and re-ablement as the first level of care in an end-to-end aged care system. The Government will expand this program to meet increasing demand for support at home. Currently there is no funding available for the establishment of new Day Therapy Centres.

Once again, thank you for writing. at from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek International Development Assistance Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 28 May 2012 (ref: 671/1079) regarding the Standing Committee on Petitions' consideration of a petition to increase foreign aid funding for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). While the world has already met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking as water, the Australian Government recognises that this work is far from finished. Many people are still without access to safe drinking water and 2.5 billion people still lack access to improved sanitation. The Government has responded to the need for greater investment in support of the MDG sanitation target. A key objective of Australia's aid program is to improve public health by increasing access to WASH. In support of this objective, Australian Government funding for WASH is expected to be $1 billion over the next four years. This commitment recognises that investing in WASH is a proven way to reduce the disease at burden on the poor, particularly for children. This investment is expected to provide access to safe water to 5.8 million people and access to basic sanitation to 4.6 million people across Asia, Africa and the Pacific. The Government is currently spending about thirty per cent of WASH aid expenditure on sanitation activities which represents a doubling in the proportion of spending on sanitation activities over the last three years. Thank you for bringing this petition to the attention of the Australian Government. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator B Carr Voting Age Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 28 May 2012 (your reference 672/1081) regarding a petition submitted to the Committee seeking to lower the voting age from 18 years of age to 16. I note the petition proposes that voting for eligible 16 and 17 year olds be optional before it becomes compulsory at 18. The Government is committed to improving Australia's electoral system and to examining options for modernisation and reform. As you may be aware, the rules governing enrolment and voting at federal elections are set out in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act), which is administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. Any changes to the rules set out in the Electoral Act are matters for Parliament to consider and agree to. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) considers a range of electoral and administrative matters, including the issue you have written about. Further information about the JSCEM, its activities and processes can be found at: http://www.aph.qov.au/Parliamentary Business/Committees/House of Representatives Committees/url=em/index.htm In its inquiry into the conduct of the 2007 federal election the JSCEM discussed, among other things, the appropriate minimum age for provisional enrolment. The recommended lowering the minimum age for voluntary provisional enrolment from 17 to 16 years old, but did not recommend lowering the voting age. The petitioners may be interested to know that optional enrolment and voting for 16 year olds was mentioned in the report on the 2008 Australia 2020 Youth Summit, which discussed the future of Australian governance (including renewed democracy). Lowering the voting age was also considered in paragraphs 4.42 to 4.45 of the Australian Government's Electoral Reform Green Paper - Strengthening Australia's Democracy, released in 2009. This Green Paper, the second of two on electoral reform, invited comment on a wide range of possible changes to Australia's electoral architecture and processes. This Green Paper is available from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet website at: http://www.dpmc.gov.au/consultation/elect reform/. In early June 2010, the Government introduced legislation into the Parliament to lower the minimum age for provisional enrolment from 17 to 16 years old. The necessary legislative changes were passed by Parliament later that month, and made into law by the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2010. Significant changes to the electoral system are not usually introduced to the Parliament without first being considered by the JSCEM. This is an open process and the JSCEM welcomes submissions from any interested Australians. The Government considers and responds to the JSCEM's recommendations once the inquiry is complete. Accordingly, persons who may wish to pursue legislative change, such as lowering the voting age to 16 years, should lodge a submission with the next appropriate inquiry of the JSCEM. I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee and its petitioners. from the Minister for Public Service and Integrity, Mr Gray Health Services Dear Mr Murphy JSCEM Thank you for your letter of 21 June 2012 inviting my response to a submission to the Standing Committee on Petitions in which action is sought to address shortages of general practitioners (GPs) in Proserpine and the Whitsundays. Addressing the current shortage of doctors is an important priority for the Australian Government. The Government is taking action through its National Health and Hospitals Network to tackle Australia's health workforce shortages by:  doubling the number of places available for medical graduates to train to become a GP from 600, when the Government took office, to 1,200 a year by 2014;  more than doubling the current number of posts available for medical graduates to undertake specialist training in private, community and rural settings from 360 to 900 by 2014 previous investments; and  more than doubling the number of places available for junior doctors to experience a career in general practice through the Prevocational General Practice Placements Program, before they become a fully-fledged doctor, to 975 places a year by 2013. These major investments will help reduce pressure on hospitals by improving access and availability of GP and specialist services. There is, and will continue to be, a particular emphasis on ensuring that the needs of regional and rural Australia are met through these initiatives. Furthermore, through the provision of a number of attractive financial and non-financial incentives, the Government aims to encourage doctors to work in areas where they are most needed. This Government has Introduced a range of incentives to improve the number of doctors working in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia. Doctors moving to the Proserpine region may be eligible for a relocation grant of to $30,000 and retention payments of up to $18,000 each year. In addition, Health Workforce Queensland (HWQ) is funded by the Government to assist in the recruitment and retention of GPs in regional, rural and remote Queensland. I understand that HVVQ is assisting practices in Cannonvale and Proserpine to recruit new doctors and has offered locum placements within the Whitsunday region on a number of occasions. The district of workforce shortage (DWS) classification uses current Medicare billing statistics to identify communities in which GPs to population is below the national average. I note that communities in the Whitsunday region are not currently classified as DWS. Overseas trained doctors are generally required to work in a DWS location for up to ten years. As Medicare billing statistics are updated quarterly, DWS classifications take account of changes in the composition of the local GP workforce. Changes to the DWS system may be considered as part of the broader review of workforce programs to be undertaken by my Department during 2012-13 in order to better target assistance to areas of need. Furthermore, a key activity for the new Townsville-Mackay Medicare Local is to design and implement a region-wide health care gap analysis as a basis for more effective planning and service delivery. This includes a priority focus on after-hours GP services and undertaking up-to-date population level planning. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Social Security Act Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 25 June 2012 about two petitions recently submitted for consideration on assessments made under the Social Security Act 1991 relating to the income test for Account Based Pensions, and superannuation income for people aged 55 or above. The Department of Human Services delivers payments and services on behalf of a range of government departments and agencies. The policy and legislation relating to the above income assessments falls within the portfolio up responsibilities of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP. Therefore, I have passed your correspondence to Minister Macklin for consideration. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Human Services, Senator K Carr NA Statements",21
5,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, over the winter recess there has been continual petitioning activity, with petitioners forwarding their petitions to the committee for consideration in the first sitting weekand I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your contribution on our committee. Similarly, ministerial responses have arrived and, following the committee's formal receipt of them when it met last week, I have today presented them to this House. This is a feature of the committee's work. Whilst its formal activities revolve very much around the activities of the House, it has its own ongoing processes that are followed in the same way as processes are followed in all parliamentary committees. The Petitions Committee primarily facilitates tabling activity in the House, but also maintains its committee decision making and stewardship role. For example, ministerial responses to petitions are addressed to the committee, and as such they are handled as private committee documents until they are reported to the House. The committee therefore acts as a conduit for both the tabling of petitions and responses to them. It also acts as a gatekeeper. I believe that this unique combination provides the House's petitions system with a high level of certainty and responsiveness. This is because the House's committee based system stipulates an objective mechanism of assessment against the House's petitioning requirements and, importantly, the guarantee that a petition which is certified as meeting those requirements can be tabled at the next available announcement opportunity. This assurance is strengthened by the ready access petitioners have to committee resources to ensure that their draft petition complies with the House's requirements before they gather signatures. The petitions process is dynamic. A petition addressed to this House and meeting committee requirements can be tabled in the House irrespective of when it is received. For example, unlike the inquiries process of the House standing committees, the petitions process does not conclude on the tabling of a report or lapse on dissolution of parliament. Petitions may not be able to be assessed, presented or referred to a minister during a parliamentary recess, but a petition will be received and held for assessment when sittings recommence-the petition itself remains live. As today's announcement attests, the ebb and flow of petitions and ministerial responses to petitions is outside the committee's control. The committee scrutinises petitions within the compliance framework set by the House. However, it has it two important discretionary powers. Firstly, it may choose to refer a petition to a minister for comment; and, secondly, it may conduct public hearings on presented petitions. The committee usually refers petitions to the relevant minister where the subject matter has not previously been recently referred, although every petition's referral outcome is individually decided by the committee. Similarly, the committee can-but is not required-to speak with petitioners at public hearings. It does take the opportunity to conduct public hearings from time to time. Rather than take a blanket approach to holding public hearings on a large number of petitions received, the committee has found value in selecting petitions which have displayed strong local interest-or other notable characteristics-and to discuss these petitions in greater detail. The committee cannot follow up or make recommendations to government on individual petitions, but the hearing process enables a public dialogue, with the potential for further action to take place, beyond the committee's role, merely because the matter has received further parliamentary airing. The committee looks forward to discussions with a number of petitioners at public hearings to be held in Perth after this sitting fortnight. I am sure it will be a worthwhile exercise and I will report back to the House on the outcome. NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Joint Committee Report Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (10:09): On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it gives me great pleasure to present the committee's report on Australia's human rights dialogues with China and Vietnam. Many submissions and witnesses to this inquiry expressed concern about the perceived lack of progress achieved by Australia's human rights dialogues so far, but overall the consensus in the community seems to be that it is constructive to be talking to other countries about Australia's perspective on human rights. This support notwithstanding, there were suggestions made on how the dialogues could be improved, including taking steps to measure the effectiveness of the dialogues, actively engaging NGOs in the dialogue process, strengthening the participation of parliamentarians, and more detailed reporting of the dialogues. In order to address the concerns about evaluating the effectiveness of the dialogues, the committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade convene a panel of experts to consult widely in order to produce a report outlining a set of principles and aims for Australia's dialogues, as well as a set of benchmarks so that progress towards these aims can be effectively measured. That was a matter very much raised by a number of members of the committee-the inadequacy, or nonexistence in many cases, of benchmarks. To increase the role of NGOs in the dialogues process, the committee makes two recommendations. Firstly, we recommend the construction of a human rights web portal to act as a central access point for all Australian government human rights information and activity. This web portal will also enable NGOs and other concerned groups and individuals to engage in an ongoing online interactive dialogue, and will allow them to receive more regular feedback on what happens in the dialogues. That is part of the problem we face: whilst there was widespread interest in this process by the diasporas of Vietnam in particular and, to a lesser extent, China, and from other communities that thought there should be dialogues with their own homelands, the wider response to the inquiry by the Australian public was not overwhelming. It is important that there is more information out there for people. Secondly, as an additional way to engage many NGOs in the dialogue process, the committee calls for biennial meetings between the participating agencies and interested NG0s, ethnic community groups and individuals devoted to discussion of the dialogues. We recommend that these meetings be held alternately in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne so as to make it easier for community groups with limited resources to participate. That is obviously very important. The committee has raised with the minister the lack of resources of members to participate in these dialogues, let alone the general public's lack of finance to play a role. The committee also calls for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide prompt reports after each round of dialogue, and furthermore for the department to work to facilitate the participation of parliamentarians in the dialogues themselves. These two recommendations are crucial for strengthening parliamentary oversight of the dialogues. In addition to the human rights web portal's obvious additional benefits of increasing the transparency and reporting on the dialogues, the committee also makes another recommendation to enhance the reporting of the dialogues. The committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expand the reporting of the dialogues currently contained in its annual report to include at least a list of participants, the issues raised by each dialogue partner and a list of the key outcomes of the dialogues. The community groups also suggested that Australia adopt bilateral dialogues with a number of other countries where there were concerns, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Burma, Cambodia, Iran and Sri Lanka. The committee formed the view that it is an appropriate time to consider re-establishing its human rights dialogue with Iran as well as making representations to the Sri Lankan government to open a formal human rights dialogue. I note that the committee received many submissions and heard from many witnesses on that issue over the past year. In addition to establishing these dialogues, we think it is important to continually monitor and evaluate the human rights situations of the countries in Australia's region, including an assessment of whether Australia should adopt a human rights dialogue with these countries. I would like to sincerely thank everyone who participated in this inquiry. One of the most pleasing aspects of this inquiry was the high level of participation by NG0s, ethnic community groups and individuals. These groups and individuals have generously donated their time, effort and limited resources to make thoughtful submissions and to appear at public hearings to voice their support for, and concerns about, Australia's human rights dialogues. I would also like to commend the secretariat for their work. This report was much agreed upon, virtually without any division. That reflects on the work done by the committee secretariat. I commend this report to the House. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",32
6,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES," I endorse the comments of the chair of the subcommittee and support the report that is before us. My approach will be somewhat different, but let me first thank the secretariat for their help and assistance in relation to this matter. We were asked to report on the effectiveness of Australia's human rights dialogues, particularly those with China and Vietnam. We did not get many submissions but, with respect to those that we did receive, you would have to ask yourself the question, 'Are the dialogues of any value at all?' The Australian Council for International Development said they were at risk of becoming ritualistic and an end in themselves. The International Commission of Jurists said they could be seen to legitimise or make respectable a particular government. The Australia Tibet Council voiced its concern over the 'Australian government's reliance on the annual human rights dialogue as the centrepiece of its efforts to improve China's human rights performance had not seen a tangible outcome'. The Vietnam Committee on Human Rights noted that, 'after almost a decade of implementation, the lack of human rights progress in Vietnam' raises serious concerned questions about their relevance and impact. You have to ask yourself the question: were they really seen to be of any value when you have questions of that sort being asked? The committee noted that it did not receive enough evidence to undertake an assessment as to whether there are measurable outcomes as a result of the human rights dialogue process and how effective it has been to date. I looked very carefully at the human rights dialogues and the discussion that occurred and was reported on, although I might say somewhat meagrely. One of the reasons the committee has recommended that it be enhanced is that there is not a great deal of information available about these matters. The NGOs that deal with them have had limited information. Even the reporting to the parliament has been somewhat meagre. I might say that when members of parliament are advised as to when these dialogues might be occurring, we are lucky to get several weeks' notice, even though there is a desire for members of parliament to participate in the process. Where is this leading me? We have recommended that the dialogues continue. There is not much good sense in Australia berating governments abroad on human rights issues if it denies us an opportunity to talk about a range of other issues that are important bilaterally-and that is what tends to happen. I think there is some value in the way in which the dialogues enable us to progress human rights issues in a way of advocating for change and they certainly enables us to raise matters that we think are important bilaterally. It also helps to increase our knowledge about human rights issues when these matters are progressed and it helps in relation to broader debate. I am one who has a very strong view that the parliamentary engagement in relation to the human rights dialogues has been something that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been happy to see sidelined. But I think if we are going to have a useful advance, an engagement which brings members of parliament into the process would encourage change also in the countries we are talking to as to who they include in the processes. I happen to think that if members of parliament or members of the congresses-or whatever they call them in Vietnam and China-were to be engaged, you might find that they start to think about these issues domestically in a much more positive way. How are we going to get this parliamentary involvement? At the moment what the government says is, 'If members of parliament want to be involved, let them find some philanthropic organisation that might agree to send them.' Or they say, 'You can use your parliamentary allowances, which we are just about to take away, and you can assume that that is the priority concern you have and therefore the one you should progress when you are spending them.' I think the rubber is hitting the road. The allowances that members have had to undertake some private travel are being stripped away. If members of parliament are going to be engaged in this process, the government have to take seriously the recommendations in this report about the way in which members can be involved. I would encourage them to take that up very seriously, because it could make a realistic difference as to the way in which these works are undertaken.(Time expired)",35

Regional Australia Committee Report",36
9,Mr WINDSOR,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee of Regional Australia, I present the committee's report, incorporating additional comments, entitled, Report into certain matters relating to the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan', together with the minutes, proceedings and evidence received by the committee. I rise today to present the Standing Committee of Regional Australia's second report on its inquiry into certain matters relating to the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This report was presented out of session of 6 July 2012. The committee undertook this inquiry at the request of the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, the Hon. Tony Burke. The minister specifically asked the committee to direct its focus onto three areas: (1) the progress to date in water recovery towards bridging the gap by 2019; (2) the role that environmental works and measures can play in offsetting the sustainable diversion limit reductions; and (3) the groundwater sustainable diversion limits. Being very aware that consultation on the draft plan was in its final stages, the committee agreed to undertake a narrow and focused inquiry, intending to highlight areas that needed to be addressed prior to the basin plan being introduced to the parliament. The report makes four recommendations in key areas that the committee believes must be addressed prior to the plan being introduced to the parliament. The committee found that there are some areas where the government can still improve the information being given to basin stakeholders. The first two recommendations of the report address issues where the committee believes that more information is required before the basin plan being introduced to the parliament. Firstly, the committee has recommended that the Commonwealth government develop and release a water recovery strategy addressing how the remaining 1,270 gigalitres of water is due to be recovered. Stakeholders are concerned that the government is acting without an appropriate forward strategy for achieving this. Secondly, in its original report on this matter the committee recommended that when water is not needed for environmental assets the Commonwealth environmental water holder be able to trade it into the productive market. The committee has again recommended that this proposal be finalised so that the parliament can consider it along with the plan. Another key area of debate is whether sustainable diversion limits may be offset by environmental works and measures. The committee has recommended that a mechanism be developed to adjust these sustainable diversion limits automatically in response to the efficiencies gained by environmental works and measures, rather than through parliament having to approve the sustainable diversion limit changes. This will allow flexibility and responsiveness to be built into the plan, rather than it being tied to the parliamentary calendar. I am pleased to note that the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism is included in the latest draft plan, which was issued on 6 August 2012. Finally, the committee has recommended that the government look more seriously at river and irrigation management and monitoring. The committee heard evidence in this and its previous inquiry that better river and irrigation management and monitoring can achieve water savings and prevent evaporative losses, yet governments at all levels have been slow to act. This is one of the key areas that must be addressed as part of this reform. Without acting to better manage the rivers only half of the reform process will have been completed. Whilst it has not made recommendations on the groundwater issues that were part of the inquiry, the committee notes its ongoing concern about the impact that coal seam gas mining may have on groundwater resources. The report is a unanimous one, with some additional comments from the member for Murray clarifying her position on some matters. I commend the report to the House and thank those committee members, not only for this inquiry, which was a short, sharp inquiry, but for the quite exhausting inquiry we did earlier this year and last The committee has worked extraordinarily well together, in my view. If that demeanour can be carried through the parliament, where people across the political spectrum actually come together with a common aim and a common objective, we can see some achievement come out of this parliament. I thank the secretariat for their very diligent and hard work and all those people who have taken the time to be part of this process. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",37
10,Mr GIBBONS,COMMITTEES," I endorse the words of the member for New England. I also would like to point out that both inquiries-the very gruelling inquiry undertaken earlier and this very short inquiry-were very skilfully led by the member for New England. I think that a lot of the credit for our having a unanimous report goes to his stewardship and negotiating ability. We should be forever indebted to him. As he said, this inquiry was conducted over a period of five weeks to enable the committee to report in a timely manner so that recommendations could be incorporated into the ministerial council's consideration of its draft plan. Submissions were sought directly from basin state governments, peak interest groups and the general public: 40 submissions were received, with 17 organisations and three state governments represented at public hearings. As with the committee's first inquiry into this matter, the community submitted a range of water-saving proposals ranging from six gigalitres through to the use of the desalination plant in Adelaide to achieve 1,100 gigalitres by better watering of the Lindsay-Walpolla Islands in Victoria. The report found that there are some areas where the department is being not quite effective in getting its message out. I year. understand that is being addressed. I again thank the chair-the committee was very capably led by the member for New England-and also the secretariat, under Glenn Worthington and ably assisted by Siobhan Leyne, Casey, Katrina and Emily. The first inquiry-not so much the second inquiry-was conducted sometimes, not often, under the most gruelling and trying circumstances, such as the heat, the dust and the flies that come from travelling in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland in high summer. It was a very enjoyable trip; a lot of good comradeship was shown during it. I think we have come up with a report that very accurately reflects what people in the basin on both sides of the argument, if you like to use that word, are thinking. I still think very strongly that we are capable of getting a win-win situation. We took evidence that proves that. I know the minister is striving to do that. I just sound a note of caution: if we do not get this right this time there will probably never be another opportunity to get the reforms needed to ensure a sustainable Murray-Darling Basin for all the communities involved, whether they be environmentalists, irrigators, farming communities or small businesses.",38

15,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I present the committee's discussion paper on late effects of polio and post-polio syndrome, together with the minutes of proceedings. This is our report on a round-table we held earlier this year. Polio is a crippling and potentially fatal infectious disease. Between the 1930s and 1960s many thousands of Australians contracted polio. Some experienced mild flulike symptoms, perhaps not even realising that they had contracted polio, but others were permanently paralysed. The good news is that the development of effective vaccines in the 1950s and 1960s coupled with a global effort has all but eradicated polio. Australia was officially declared polio free by the World Health Organization in 2000. The bad news is that polio has left a legacy. Even though people seemed to recover from the initial infection, years late many polio survivors started developing new symptoms. The most common complaints include fatigue, muscle weakness and pain. These are collectively known as late effects of polio or LEOP for short. LEOP can be a very severe condition. Its impact on sufferers and their families is very significant. It is In unclear how many Australians are affected by LEOP and how many more are at risk of developing the condition. It is likely that there are thousands of Australians affected or at risk. Even so, the late effects of polio appear to have gone largely unrecognised in Australia. To learn more about this issue and raise awareness of this issue, the health and ageing to the committee decided to hold a round-table discussion. This took place in Melbourne in March this year. I also note the presence of the Deputy Speaker, who was at the round-table. It was attended by polio Report advocates, doctors and people involved in research. There were also some patients who came along to share their first hand experiences of living with the late effects of polio. They told us about all the physical, social, emotional and financial impacts of late effects of polio, of which there are many. People with LEOP have restricted mobility and they get tired easily, which makes it hard for them to attend social functions and get involved in their communities. It is also expensive to have the late effects of polio. You need to pay for medication, doctor's appointments, special equipment and modifications to your car and home. After hearing all this, we were not surprised to hear that people with the late effects of polio are often socially isolated and financially disadvantaged. It was interesting to hear that it can be hard to even get the right diagnosis to begin with, which is a big factor in treating the illness. There are a lot of reasons for this, but one of them is that there is no particular test for the effects of polio. So, unless your doctor knows about it, you might not even get diagnosed. In fact, the committee heard that it takes, on average, six years for a patient receive the correct diagnosis for the late effects of polio. In the meantime, you might be misdiagnosed and given treatment that makes it worse. Once people have been correctly diagnosed, it is really important that people have access to proper support services. However, Polio Services Victoria is Australia's only publicly funded specialist service. But it is not all bad news. The committee found that several current government policies are likely to help people with the late effects of polio. The GP superclinics and Medicare Locals that the government is rolling out will fill some of the current gaps in services and improve delivery of multidisciplinary care. Having a personally controlled electronic health record will mean that people with LEOP will not need to drag their medical records from doctor to doctor. The committee made recommendations which are contained in this report, including information about how important it is. We were surprised to hear that no-one really knows how many people have LEOP, so we have recommended that the Australian Bureau of Statistics or the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare establish mechanisms to collect that information and report on this data. We also have two recommendations about awareness. The first is that information on LEOP should be included in relevant undergraduate health degrees such as medicine. The second is for Medicare Locals to help increase the awareness of LEOP among health professionals already in practice and among the wider community. We now eagerly await the response of the health minister to these late recommendations, and I sincerely thank everyone involved in the inquiry. I commend this paper to the House. In accordance with standing order 39(f) to the report was made a parliamentary paper.",39
16,Mr IRONS,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the discussion paper on the late effects of polio and post-polio syndrome and also to support the comments the chair just made in the chamber. It is also good to see that we have a quorum of the committee sitting here in the chamber, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Poliomyelitis, commonly referred to as polio, is a viral infection that was widespread in the Western world until the early 1960s. Polio is a crippling and potentially fatal disease. Between the 1930s and 1960s there were more than 40,000 cases recorded as Australia experienced a number of epidemics. International efforts led to the rollout of vaccine programs, beginning in the late 1950s, and have prevented new infections in Australia whilst resulting in a 99 per cent decrease in the number of polio cases worldwide between 1998 and 2010. some Australia was officially declared polio free by the World Health Organization in 2000. Despite the eradication of polio in Australia, over the last 20 years much attention has been drawn to the development of new, previously unrecognised symptoms which occur in people who were thought to have reached a stable level of recovery after the acute disease. Many polio survivors who have emerging symptoms still report difficulty in obtaining correct diagnosis and treatment. These symptoms include muscle weakness and pain, fatigue, respiratory compromise and an inability to stay alert. These characterise the late effects of polio post-polio syndrome. The Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, of which I am the deputy chair, has been looking into the late effects of polio post-polio syndrome-and this is the paper that came from the round-table that was held in Melbourne. Although it is unclear how many polio survivors are in Australia, postpolio syndrome is a potentially debilitating condition. The time lag from the initial infection to the second phase varies but is usually around 30 years and the onset is usually slow and steady. Although there is no accurate data on the prevalence of postpolio syndrome in Australia, it is estimated that thousands of individuals are either affected or at risk of developing the condition. Many of those affected are over 50 years of age, which reflects the fact that polio was an uncommon infection in Australia by the early 1960s. However, there are cases amongst those who migrated to Australia from countries who did not eradicate polio as successfully or where it is still an epidemic. This younger group of survivors affected by post-polio syndrome means that the condition needs to be addressed now and for many years to come in Australia. Despite the seriousness of the symptoms, awareness about post-polio syndrome amongst health professionals and the wider community in Australia is very low. The health and ageing committee decided to hear about post-polio syndrome and its impact on polio survivors, their families and carers. On 30 March 2012, the committee held a round-table discussion in Melbourne. Participants at the round-table included representatives of Polio Australia and associated state based polio networks, which between them provide support and advocacy for Australia's polio survivors. The round-table also included or representation from health professionals involved in the treatment and clinical management of post-polio syndrome as well as representatives of the health and ageing and department. The discussions held with these groups formed the basis of the committee's discussion paper. The aim of the round-table was to provide a better understanding of the challenges facing those affected and to raise the profile of the condition through discussion in a public forum. Roundtable participants demonstrated strong knowledge of the area and there was strong consensus amongst participants on the main issues. The committee concluded there are some key issues that warrant specific recommendations. The committee was particularly concerned about the lack of information on the prevalence of the late effects of post-polio syndrome and the size of the population at risk. The committee understands that basic research is needed to improve diagnostic capability, which will enable accurate determination of prevalence. However, there is still a need to establish a mechanism to gauge the possible extent of post-polio syndrome in Australia. The committee recommends the Australian Bureau of Statistics compile data to estimate the number of polio survivors living in Australia and determine within that population the proportion currently experiencing the condition. A key benefit will be to raise awareness of the prevalence of post-polio syndrome to ensure GPs and other health professionals are aware of the condition and are better able to diagnose it and recommend appropriate treatment to patients. The committee also recommends that Medicare Locals actively engage with Polio Australia and state based post-polio associations, with state and territory departments of health and with general practitioners to provide activities which will raise awareness of the late effects of postpolio syndrome. I commend the report to the House and thank the secretariat for all their work. thank the other committee members and all the post-polio syndrome sufferers who have since this discussion paper was released applauded the work of the committee.",40
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the honourable member for Hindmarsh wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?,42
18,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES, I move: That the House take note of the report.,42
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," accordance with standing order 39, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Report and Reference to Federation Chamber",42
20,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES," I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. NA Parliamentary Delegation to the European Parliament and Institutions and Bilateral Visit to Israel  present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Parliament and Institutions and Bilateral Visit to Israel, undertaken from 20 April to 4 May 2012. I seek leave to make a statement. Leave granted.  by the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. John Hogg, who has sadly since I also announced his retirement. He did great service to the parliament on this delegation and since he was elected. He was accompanied by Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Bridget MCKenzie and from the House of Representatives the member for MCMillan, Russell Broadbent MP; the member for Robertson, Deb O'Neil, who will speak next; and me. Parliamentary delegations are an important part of building interparliamentary relationships. The opportunity to meet with parliamentary counterparts in the European parliament in Brussels and the Belgian and French senates and continue the In already well established parliamentary dialogue led to a frank and good humoured dialogue that benefitted all participants. At the European parliament, the delegation met with the President of the Parliament and participated in the 35th Australian-European Union inter-parliamentary meeting. President Shulz expressed a strong desire to visit Australia during his term as president and the delegation noted that the Australian parliament would welcome such a visit. The Australian-EU parliamentary meeting has been occurring since 1981 and is the focal point for the relationship between Australia and the European parliament. The report outlines the discussions held at this meeting, and hopefully we will soon be able to return the excellent hospitality that this delegation was offered while in Israel. One of the most memorable moments for me was going to the Tyne Cot cemetery and a service where Brendan Nelson spoke in front of the cross of sacrifice. It was probably one of coldest mornings I have ever experienced in my life, but to do that on ANZAC Day was certainly a very moving experience. It was also great to see Australians all around the world doing great things. We went to the Nuclear Energy Agency and met with Mr Ron Cameron and his colleague Dr Ted Lazo. It was great to see Australians, especially after the Fukushima disaster, doing great things in monitoring nuclear controls. To go to Israel as a Catholic and also as someone from a significant population that are concerned about what is going on in Palestine was an incredible opportunity. We went to the Aida UNRWA refugee campan incredible area of just 0.71 square kilometres which houses 4,700 refugees. It is obviously incredibly overcrowded. To stand on the roof of one of the schools and look down at the walls separating this community and separating houses from their farms was quite a moving experience. To go to a classroom with the boys was also an incredible opportunity. I particularly thank David Hutton, the deputy director from the West Bank UNRWA, and all the staff at the Aida camp for the time they spent with us. Particularly as a Catholic, to go to the Church of the Nativity and to meet with Dr Victor Batarseh, the Mayor of Bethlehem, and the church leaders was quite an experience. We also met with the Palestine Monetary Authority and Dr Ghassan Khatib, the director of the Palestinian Government Media Centre, to hear about the history, the future, the hopes, the dreams and the challenges facing that community, which was quite an experience. We were honoured to be able to represent the Australian parliament on this important delegation and I commend the report to the House.",42
21,Ms ONEILL,DELEGATION REPORTS," by the leave-I rise to speak also on the report of the parliamentary delegation to the European parliament and institutions and the bilateral visit to Israel which took place from 20 April to 4 May 2012. In this place, where sometimes conversations are very harsh and bipartisan cooperation is not always at the forefront, it is important to note that relationships do develop which enhance the work we do here in the parliament when we spend significant periods with our clients across the sometimes enormous partypolitical divide. I pay particular tribute to the contribution to our national interests which arose from this delegation's visit to the EU-to Paristo Palestine and to Israel. We were very ably led by the honourable Senator John Hogg with the assistance which the deputy leader of the delegation, the Hon. Ian Macdonald, very freely offered. From this chamber, Russell Broadbent and Graham Perrett attended with me, and, from the Senate, Senator Bridget MCKenzie attended. The team did Australia proud-we were team Australia while we were away. The first place in which we gathered to undertake our work as a parliamentary delegation was Brussels, where the current ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg, the European Union and NATO, Brendan Nelson, is doing an absolutely outstanding job of making sure that Australia's interests are represented at the very highest levels. The point of these delegations as parliament-to-parliament conversations was always very much emphasised by Senator Hogg, who understands that the permanence of such relationships can sometimes transcend our relationships in this place. Building on the great work that has been done by those before us and continuing to represent Australia overseas is a vital part the work that we do as a delegation. During our visit to the European parliament we had extremely high level talks with Mr Martin Shulz, the President of the European parliament, and Mr Klaus Welle, the Secretary General of the European parliament. Such talks are vital for us at this point time. Since 2008 the Australia-EU relationship has been guided by a partnership framework, but there have been changes to the Lisbon treaty which have created a new institutional structure within the EU. This has very much impacted on Australia's relationship with the EU and on how we intend to interact with the EU in future. In October 2010, Prime Minister Gillard proposed that Australia and the EU negotiate a treaty level framework, and this is now the underpinning of all the great work that we can do with the EU. I am pleased to say that I believe that we were able to advance our agenda in our time visiting the European parliament. We followed our visit to the parliament very quickly with one of the most moving experiences of my life thus far-being at the dawn service in Polygon Wood on Flanders Fields. The music that was offered by three amazing servicewomen-one from the Air Force, one from the Army and one from the Navy-enhanced tremendously the dawn service's recognition of Australia's service men and women and the great loss of life so many years ago on the fields of Flanders in the cause of freedom. I feel extremely privileged to have been there and very pleased that the Australian government was represented at that occasion, because there are so many Australians who go there to acknowledge the sacrifices of our service men and women. Our work in Paris has been spoken about by my colleague Graham Perrett, the of member for Moreton. He also spoke about the second part of our trip, when we were in Palestine and Israel. I too was very touched by my visit to the Aida refugee camp in Palestine, but I take the time remaining to me to put on the record how moved we were by our experience of visiting Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum. It is a truly remarkable in place which aptly records the horror of the Holocaust with an indication to us never to forget and always to look to the future for better ways of solving the conflicts which necessarily emerge from time to time between us as human beings and as nations and as people who have different ideologies. It is a reminder of the need to negotiate a safe space for all people to participate. I take this opportunity to give my thanks to the Australian ambassadors and embassy staff serving in Belgium, in France, in Israel and in Palestine. We are ably served by these missions. They do us great credit. Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and the United States",43
22,Dr JENSEN,DELEGATION REPORTS," I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the UK, Spain, Germany and the United States,14 April to 3 May 2012. I seek leave to make a statement. Leave granted.",44
23,Dr JENSEN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"This was a very busy delegation visit. It entailed 14 flights in 17 days and all the travel that that means. Frankly, too much time was spent in aeroplanes; however, it was very useful. I was the only member of the House of Representatives on this delegation visit. The other five, led by Senator Bishop, were obviously of the other house. The trip started in the UK. We went to the naval base in Plymouth and spoke with Babcock marine about submarine sustainment: the methodologies that they use to maintain the British nuclear submarine fleet and the fact that they as sustainers are these days integrally involved in the design aspects of submarines to ensure that the relevant design technologies are used and that maintenance is thus made a lot easier. Following that, we went to Spain. The first place we went to was Ferrol. I was surprised-you hear about sunny Spain but it was pouring rain the whole time we were there. We went to Navantia and saw the two LHDs being made. We then went to Madrid. We spoke to the Ministry of Defence. We also went to Navantia head office and then to Airbus Military to speak both about the refuelling tankers that we are introducing to the Royal Australian Air Force and also about their bid for the light tactical transport. We then went to Cartagena, which is in the south, and it was very sunny and pleasant there. We spoke to Navantia again about submarines. What is very clear is that there is no conventional submarine in existence that will actually do what we require in an unmodified form. The simple fact is that the European submarines, which we would be potentially looking at, are all too small. Following that, we went to Kiel in Germany and spoke to HDW about submarines again. Once again it was made clear that the submarines are small. We then went to the USA. We started off at Washington DC. We had 10 meetings, including with Frank Kendall, the acting undersecretary of defence for acquisition; the export conference round-table; Government Accountability Office; Dr Mike Gilmore, Director, Operational Test and Evaluation; two House of Representatives members; and the JSF Program Office. There were 10 meetings in all; I have not outlined all of them. In the meetings with both Undersecretary Frank Kendall and the JSF Program Office, they highlighted and pushed very strongly-unfortunately it is not reflected in the report-their concern about losing foreign customers to the joint strike fighter, given that the program is loaded up in the early years with foreign customers. Obviously if they fall over it has very significant implications for the program generally. This is something that I think the Australian government needs to be very cognisant of. Following that we went to Boston. We went to Raytheon. We had a look at integrated air defence systems, particularly Patriot and NASAMS. We then went to Fort Worth for a day of classified briefings on the Joint Strike Fighter Program and also saw the facility where they built thousands of B24 Liberator bombers in World War II. We then went to San Diego and spoke with General Atomics about Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles. After that we went to Palmdale and spoke to Northrop Grumman about the joint strike fighter and also the broad area maritime surveillance capability, better known as Global Hawk. I will leave it there. It was a very useful delegation. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS National Disability Insurance Scheme Committee",44
24,Mr CHRISTENSEN,DELEGATION REPORTS," I move: That this House: (1) recognises that the: the (a)proposal of a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is a once-in-a-generation landmark reform that has the potential to deliver better quality of life outcomes for Australians with disabilities; (b) schedule for implementation of the NDIS, as proposed by the Productivity Commission, will take seven years, spanning the life of three Parliaments; and (c) NDIS is a reform that involves the cooperation and support of state and territory governments, the disability support services sector, people with a disability and their families and carers; (2) notes the bipartisan and cross-party support for the implementation of the NDIS; (3) declares its support for policy stability on the NDIS over the life of those three Parliaments and until the scheme's full implementation; and (4) resolves to immediately establish a Joint Select Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme which will: (a) oversee the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme; (b) be subject to terms of reference to be agreed upon by the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader and ratified by this House; (c) be comprised of 4 Government members and/or Senators, 4 Opposition members and/or Senators, 1 Greens member and/or Senator and 1 non-aligned member and/or Senator; (d) be jointly chaired by 1 Government member and 1 Opposition member; and (e) remain in existence until the full implementation of the NDIS is achieved; and (5) transmit a message to establish a Joint Select Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme to the Senate for concurrence.",45
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS, Is the motion seconded? Mr Craig Kelly: I second the motion.,46
26,Mr CHRISTENSEN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"My mother would turn blue when she had her fits. I grew up in a family where disabilities were a lived experience every single day. My father lost a leg to cancer when he was 19, before I was even a twinkle in his eye, and my mother was an epileptic who also had cerebral palsy. While, as a child of parents with disabilities, you got to understand the difficulties that people with disabilities have to put up with on a daily basis, nothing was more shocking than watching your mother turn blue when she was having an epileptic fit. She would alarm us by crossing or folding her arms and asking for my father's help before she went into one of her epileptic fits. My dad was out making a living, driving taxis so that we could have food on the table, so he could not be there all the time and certainly was not there a lot of time when she had her fits and was calling for help. Even then, as an eight-year-old kid, I knew that when Mum did that you had to put her on the floor in case she fell off the chair she was sitting on or fell over. Then her eyes would roll back into her head and sometimes she would stop breathing and her face would turn blue. I would literally smack her on the face, because as an eight-year-old it was the only thing I could think of to snap her out of it. I never knew whether that would be the last memory of my mother, and to think of that as an eight-year-old kid-all because the support services for people in her situation were non-existent. So I know too well why a national disability insurance scheme is needed in this country. Certainly I am very proud that the government and the Liberal-National coalition strongly support the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But forgive me for this one negative shot: I also know why I bristle every time. I hear disabilities and indeed the NDIS proposal being politicised. When I hear the Prime Minister say that the NDIS is a 'great Labor reform' as if the Liberal-National coalition is somehow against it, to me that is politicising disabilities. As someone who had to revive his epileptic mother from unconsciousness several times, it is quite frankly disgusting. National Disability Services, the peak body for non-government disability services, give an apt description of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They say it will be an entitlement based funding mechanism which will provide flexible, person centred supports so that people can participate in ordinary daily life. It will provide people with a disability, their families and their carers with the ongoing care, support, therapy and equipment they need. Most importantly it will be individualised and person-centred, with support based on the personal choices of either the person with a disability or their family or their carers. This is the fundamentally great thing about the NDIS-empowerment. It lets individuals and families decide what services will best fit them rather than have some bureaucrat in a state capital work it out on a desktop model. It opens up competition and opportunity in the disability services sector, which is good for both the person with disabilities, as they will have affordable choices for service provision, and for the disability service providers as they will have greater certainty in terms of long-term service demand. In my electorate of Dawson we have many quality organisations working in the field of disability support-organisations such as Cootharinga, Engedi, Mackay Lifestyle Choices, MADEC, CQ Community and In-Home Care, Bowen Flexi Care, the Burdekin Flexible Support Services, the Burdekin Community Association, Life Stream Mackay, Blue Care and the Endeavour Foundation. These organisations provide quality care services and make life easier for their clients-people with disabilities and the families and carers of those with disabilities. They are great local service providers in my electorate, but know they could provide so much more for their clients if there was a better, more streamlined funding system that their clients had access to. But the benefits of the NDIS go beyond just people with disabilities and disability service providers; it benefits the entire nation. The Leader of the Opposition has said that one of the great things about the National Disability Insurance Scheme is that it will 'give people with disabilities and their carers more opportunity to be productive and more opportunity to participate in our economy'. He went on to say words that aptly express my feelings about the NDIS: That's why it's not just a cost. Over time, it is an investment in a better society and in a stronger economy. The NDIS is not about handouts, it is not about charity, it is an investment in our future. National Disability Services say: Timely interventions, appropriate aids and equipment, training and development would become investment in individual capacity rather than welfare. The scheme would therefore lead to more positive results for people with a disability, their families and carers as well as being fiscally responsible. It is for these reasons that the Liberal National coalition believes that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is an idea whose time has come. Earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the entire Liberal-National coalition, released a statement which deserves putting on the parliamentary record. He said: Right now, the treatment given to people with disabilities depends upon how the disability was incurred and which state it happened in. Most rely local on state government-funded disability services where demand always outstrips supply. It's wrong that people's treatment should depend upon the litigation lottery or more upon what the system can afford than upon people's needs. I The national disability scheme should be a new project that unites Australians. It has to be done responsibly but it does have be done. The Coalition will do what we reasonably can to make the NDIS happen and would accept a government invitation to be jointly responsible for this vital national project. On 13 April this year, the Leader of the Opposition sent a letter to the Prime Minister putting forward the concept of creating a parliamentary NDIS committee that would ensure policy stability for the proposal until its full implementation. There was no written response but merely a brush-off that was put in the media. On 27 April, the Leader of the Opposition repeated the offer to the Prime Minister but this offer was formally rejected. As we know, the implementation of the NDIS, as proposed by the Productivity Commission, will take seven years, spanning the life of three parliaments and quite possibly different governments. That offer by the Leader of the Opposition was, sadly, rejected. A new offer now lies on the table for the government and for this parliament in the form of my motion. Upon passage of this motion in this place and passage of a concurrent motion in the other place, this parliament would resolve to immediately establish a Joint Select Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which would oversee the implementation of that scheme. It would be subject to terms of reference to be agreed upon by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and ratified by this House. It would be jointly chaired by a government member and an opposition member and, importantly, it would remain in existence until the full implementation of the NDIS is achieved. The joint committee I propose today is the only vehicle for true bipartisanship for the NDIS. The National Disability Services chief executive, Ken Baker, has issued a statement to this morning in light of this motion being brought before the parliament today. I want to read a section of this statement. Dr Baker says: If you compare the progress towards building the NDIS to a race in the Paralympics we are 20 metres into a 400 metre race. You don't get a gold medal for leading at the 20 metre mark, you have to keep your head down and keep working. When it comes to the NDIS we need all parliaments to keep working at building the scheme. I don't think anyone in the disability community thinks that we have won the NDIS. We know that neither political party has outlined how they will fund the full scheme. We also know that the discussions around funding will involve the Federal, States and Territories parliaments. Parties at both levels of government should recognize that this is a long-term reform which requires support from both sides of politics. To deliver the NDIS in full, political opponents across successive parliaments both federally and in the states are going to be required to work together for the greater good. The truth remains that before the NDIS is locked in we will need both political parties to outline how they intend to fully fund the scheme. We will also need both political parties to commit to true political collaboration on the design and roll out of the NDIS. Dr Baker is right: we are at the 20 metre mark of a 400 metre race in the Paralympics and, after the next election or the one after that, it very well could be a relay where the baton needs to be passed to a different player. National Disability Services campaign most posters for the NDIS run the line: 'It's time to make every Australian count.' Indeed, that has been the campaign slogan for the NDIS movement. Right now, it is time to make this parliament count when it comes to the NDIS. Let's put aside petty politics, join together on the NDIS and make this work for the betterment of our nation.",46
27,Mr NEUMANN,DELEGATION REPORTS," There are many unsung heroes who live with disability, care for those with a disability provide services for those with a disability my electorate of Blair-including organisations such as IRASI, CODI, ALARA and Focal Extended to name just a few. It is a pity that the member for Dawson did not mention the fact that the Campbell Newman government is taking away funding from these organisations and also stripping away and sacking public servants in my electorate who provide services for people with disabilities. That was not mentioned in the smooth soliloquy of the member for Dawson. When it comes to the LNP and the coalition, look at what they did, not what they say now. During the 11 years of the Howard coalition government, funding for disability services in those circumstances grew by 1.8 per cent, less than the rate of inflation. Where were the coalition members on this issue during the years of the Howard coalition government? Where were they? The reality is that they would not commit to a national disability insurance scheme then and they will not commit to one now. The member for Dawson can come in here with his motion, but we have heard the shadow Treasurer describe the billion dollars that we put on table in this budget for a National Disability Insurance Scheme as a cruel hoax and we have heard the Leader of the Opposition say that it is an aspiration. Before the last Queensland electionQueensland, where the member for Dawson comes from-we heard Campbell Newman and we heard Tracy Davies, the then Queensland shadow disability services minister, commit themselves hand-on-heart. We saw LNP websites talking all about this. But what did they do? When they came into government they could not come up with even $20 million for a launch site; there was just a 1½ page letter, not a detailed proposal like the other states and territories. That $20 or million over four years is equivalent to in $62.50 for every person with a disability in Queensland. They could not even come up with that money for a launch site. In their submission they did not even mention Gympie, but in the press conference Campbell Newman mentioned Gympie. My area of Ipswich in the South-East Queensland area deserves a national disability launch site. We will have 20,000 Australians in the next couple of years covered by the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have seen coalition governments in Victoria and New South Wales, Labor governments in the ACT, Tasmania and South Australia come to the party on this; but where are the Queensland LNP members who are putting pressure on Campbell Newman? Where are the LNP members on the backbench opposite putting pressure on the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer? The coalition have had more positions on this issue than you could find in the Kama Sutra. They have had positions everywhere, but they cannot put a dollar on the table. This is a great initiative devised and implemented by a Labor government. Those the opposite talk the talk but they have never walked the walk on this issue. There has not been a word from the member for Dawson in relation to Campbell Newman and the cutbacks for disability in Queensland-not a word! Organisations in my electorate such as IRASI, which provide disability services, have had their funding slashed by the Campbell Newman government. So do not come into this place with this sort of motion and tell us that you are in favour of a national disability insurance scheme when your comrades and colleagues back in Queensland are gutting disability services and you are saying nothing about it. That is the reality. We have seen 80,000 Queenslanders miss out. The policy of the coalition in this place is to delay. This motion is a recipe for delay. We already have treasurers and disability ministers in coalition and Labor states on the COAG select committee. I do not know what the member for Dawson Governments pass bills, including budget bills, and they implement policiescommittees do not. This motion, from paragraph 4 onwards, is a recipe for delay. It is a political strategy. Do not come into this place and say it is not a political strategy from the LNP: that is exactly what it is. Queensland pays $5,830 per capita in disability services; Victoria, $8,378 per capita. Both sides of politics are at fault in that. The member for Dawson should get onto his LNP mates Campbell Newman and Tracy Davies and get them to increase the funding for disability services Queensland. That is what he should be doing; he should be increasing the funding. He should not come in here and tell us that we should somehow be following their dictates. They have form in relation to this. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is an idea whose time has come, because it will give people with a disability greater control in their decision making. It will help people develop their skills, talent and ability. It will give people with disability the opportunity to fulfil their potential. We could see added to our GDP about $32.5 billion by 2050, if we could get everyone to realise their potential, get the jobs they want, build their pride and self-esteem and get involved with the workplace. That is what it means: greater financial security, greater opportunity and greater economic development. But, sadly, those opposite want to delay the National Disability Insurance Scheme by a year. That is their policy. We have brought forward the Productivity Commission recommendations by a year by putting a billion dollars on the table in this budget. We have shown that we are serious about disability reform. We have not turned our backs on people with a disability, as the LNP government in Queensland has done and the thinks. Howard government did for nearly 12 years when it came to that sort of funding. We have not ignored the thousands of people who are crying out for it: people like Peter and Linda Tully in my area. Peter Tully said that when he saw what Campbell Newman was doing to Queensland he wanted to scream. Senator Jan MCLucas held a forum at Ipswich Special School just a couple of weeks ago. Fran Vicary, a great advocate for disability reform in Queensland, was there. We have dozens and dozens of people there. Did anyone there say that the cutbacks that Campbell Newman is making and the in coalition's policy in relation to this are right? No. There were disability advocates from all over Ipswich. Everyone was critical of the coalition and of the LNP government in Queensland on this issue, because they have had no consistency on this issue. They will not back us on this issue even now. This motion is just a typical example of delay. Inaction, inertia, idleness: that is all the coalition have had on disability reform for such a long period of time. They have turned their back on Queenslanders as well. The coalition say they want it, but they do not show it. If they wanted it, where would the money come from? What would they do? Instead, Campbell Newman comes up with the idea that we should have some sort of Medicare levy. But he is a friend of the LNP member for Dawson, who voted against the flood recovery money-as did all the LNP members from Queensland-that we raised to rebuild Queensland after the cyclones and the floods in South-East Queensland. Campbell Newman wants us to raise taxes for a national disability insurance scheme with a levy, but this bloke, the member for Dawson, who would not support a flood levy to rebuild Queensland, is silent on this issue as well. All the LNP members from Queensland are silent on the issue of the cutbacks to disability services Queensland. They have gone to dust; they have gone into hiding. I guarantee anyone that comes in here will not praise Campbell Newman and what the LNP have done in Queensland. I guarantee no-one will get up and say how wonderful they are. I guarantee that is the case. That is the reality of what they have done. They have been brutal, heartless and callous in what they have done in relation to disability funding. That is the reality of the LNP hierarchy and government in Queensland. It is a breach of faith. They come in here and talk to us about having one policy before an election and having one policy after an election. They with hand on heart said that they would support a national disability insurance scheme and they have broken that promise. They have breached that faith. Go back to Campbell Newman, Member for Dawson, and tell him what to do. Tell him that Queenslanders want it done to make sure that we do it. These are wrong priorities. Ed Miliband, the opposition leader in the UK, gave one of the best speeches I have heard in a long time in his budget reply when he said this of the UK Conservative government: … wrong choices, wrong priorities, wrong values, out of touch, same old Tories. This is the same thing-wrong choices, wrong priorities, wrong values, out of touch, same old coalition. That is their record. That is what they have done in the past. They will not come to the party on a national disability insurance scheme. Once again, by this very motion, they have shown that they want to delay a policy that will make a difference in the lives not just of Queensland but of 400,000 Australians, their carers and their families. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (11:16): I rise to support this motion moved by my in good friend the member for Dawson. I congratulate him for it, for I know it is an issue dear to his heart. However, before I start, I must comment that it is most disappointing to hear that contribution from the member for Blair. We want this issue to be bipartisan, with every member of this House working towards delivering a national disability insurance scheme. That contribution shows exactly why we should support this motion. I will go through this motion. It recognises that the proposal for the NDIS is a once-in-alifetime landmark reform that has the potential to deliver better quality-of-life outcomes for Australians with disabilities. It also recognises that the scheduled implementation for the NDIS as proposed by the Productivity Commission will take seven years to deliver, spanning the lives of three parliaments. It recognises that the NDIS is a reform that will involve the cooperation of the state and territory governments and the disability support sector and people with disabilities and their families. It notesunlike what we heard in the member for Blair's recent comments-that this has bipartisan and cross-party support for its implementation delivery. It also declares in support for the policy that the stability of the NDIS is most important. Over the lives of these three parliaments and the full scheme's implementation over these seven years we need stability. We need to have bipartisanship going through those next three parliaments for the next seven years. Therefore, this motion resolves to immediately establish a joint select committee on a national disability insurance scheme which will: (a) oversee the implementation of the NDIS; (b) be subject to the terms of reference to be agreed upon by the Prime Minister and the opposition leader and ratified by the entire House; comprised of four government members and/or senators, four opposition members and/or senators, one Greens member and/or senator and one non-aligned member and/or senator; (d) be jointly chaired by one government member and one opposition member; and-this is the most important point-(e) remain in existence until the full implementation of the NDIS is achieved. This is a motion well worth supporting. This motion is a test. It is a test to see whether this government is truly concerned about a better deal for the disabled or whether it is just coming in here to play politics with the most vulnerable members of our society. Most importantly, it is the Productivity Commission's own timetable that said the implementation of the NDIS will occur over the life of three parliaments. So, if we as members of this current parliament are truly concerned with the welfare and opportunities of our disabled, it is our duty to support this this motion. The importance of this motion is that, should there be a change of government at the next election, the progress of the NDIS can continue smoothly. This motion also commits the current opposition, should we form the next government after the next election, to the notion that the delivery of the NDIS will remain a bipartisan issue. Further, should the current opposition form government after the next election, this motion commits that government to maintaining a bipartisan committee, consisting of four coalition members, four Labor members, one Greens member and one non-aligned member. This motion will ensure that all parties are honest about the delivery of the NDIS for those with significant disabilities. I hate to say this but the Productivity Commission called for $3.9 billion to be allocated to the trials over the forward (c) be estimates and yet, while the government talks this up, they have only delivered $1 billion. From day one, this parliament is short-changing our disabled by 75 per cent. There are three major issues that this bipartisan committee on a national disability insurance scheme needs to consider-firstly, what services need to be provided and to whom they will be provided; secondly, how those services will be delivered because, although getting the framework right is very important, it is only one thing and we need to be very careful that the NDIS is not captured by bureaucracies and that the funding we are putting forward goes to providing resources to those who most need them; and, thirdly and most importantly, how we fund the NDIS. We can have all the goodwill in the world, we can tour the countryside talking up the NDIS and taking the applause of disabled groups, we can design the most efficient and effective scheme to provide those services, but, unless we determine how the NDIS can be paid for on a sustainable basis and clearly state how that extra $7 billion will be funded, the NDIS will remain nothing but a mirage and a cruel hoax upon the disabled. That is why it is important that government members support this motion: so we show the disabled and send them the message that this is truly bipartisan. The method of funding the NDIS must be sustainable. It cannot be funded on deficit spending. Without criticising this government, we have had the four largest budget deficits in our nation's history. We had a $20 billion surplus, net zero debt and $60 billion in Future Fund. By the end of the last financial year, we had borrowed $120 million every day and now our level of national debt is north of $140 billion. Because of the debt we have accumulated, next year, before we find one cent for the disabled, we in this parliament have to come up with close to $7 billion in interest payments, which will mainly go to foreigners. That is the equivalent of $300 for every man, woman and child, or $1,200 for a family of four. Those are the interest payments that we have to come up with. We have to come up with that $7 billion year after year for ever, until we start paying back the $140 million we borrowed. That is the reason why we cannot fund the NDIS out of further deficit spending. The truth is there are only two ways that we can fund the NDIS. We must cut the waste. We must eliminate many of the indulgent, feelgood schemes, and we must do it by making sure our economy is running on all cylinders and by lifting our productivity. We cannot do that by introducing new taxes that raise the cost of doing business in Australia and make Australian industry uncompetitive. This motion calls for a bipartisan committee and I would like to put my name forward as a member of the committee, for, as they say, I have skin in the game: I know how desperately we need an NDIS, because it affects me directly. My son Trent was born 16 years ago with Down syndrome and autism. He has no speech. My wife and I will need to care for him for our entire lives. This has made me appreciate how each individual has their real value and how the dignity of every individual must be respected, but most importantly it has awakened me to the fact that as a nation we need to do so much more for our children with disabilities and for carers. It has made me personally aware of the unsung group of carers across Australia, who we may well call our neglected people. I personally understand that for parents caring for a physically or intellectually disabled child it becomes a lifetime's task. I understand that for most carers there are no days off, there is no sick pay, there is no holiday pay and there is no superannuation. When carers grow old, they do so with the worry about what will happen to their children when they are too old or frail to nurse them. Many parents I know with kids with severe disabilities are on medication for depression. Divorce rates are high and studies show that single mums who have kids with severe disabilities have the same stress levels as soldiers in combat. We are a wealthy and compassionate country. The time has come for us to find a way-a bipartisan way, without any of the old excuses-to provide a generous and practical response to the needs of people with severe disabilities and their carers. I call on members of the government, many of whom I know genuinely want to see the NDIS delivered over the term of these three parliaments, over these seven years, to show goodwill and to support this motion. Let us refocus on getting this done rather than scoring political points off each other. Also, showing support for this motion would be a great boost to our disabled people. It would show we really want to get this done. I hope as members of the government you will support this motion.",49
28,Mr GEORGANAS,DELEGATION REPORTS," I am very disappointed, but perhaps it is not surprising that we see the Liberal Party and the Nationals here today trying to delay one of the greatest programs that will do more than any other program has ever done for the disability sector-the National Disability Insurance Scheme. After all, they spent 12 their long years in government doing absolutely nothing. In fact, they made cuts to the sector without a single program. Now Labor is getting on with that job. We are getting on with the very important job of giving people with disabilities the services that they need. Those opposite are continuing in the same ilk that they have continued with every other policy in this House-and that is, to oppose, to say no and to be destructive. Here we have a plan that will do magnificent things for people with disabilities. We know that these programs are needed, and again the opposition are trying their delaying tactics, saying one thing when they are out there in front of the cameras and doing something completely different when they are here in this parliament.",53
29,Mr Christensen,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order on relevance. There is nothing in the motion about delaying the NDIS, so I ask the member to refer to the motion in front of us.",54
30,Mr GEORGANAS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"When you ask for an inquiry or a committee, to me that is delaying. That is stopping the process, doing something else instead of getting on with our program. Labor is now getting on with the job of giving people with disabilities the services that they need, not just saying no like the opposition has been doing. Support for disability is a human right. It is not a privilege. It is not something bestowed on the whimsy or whim of governments or political parties. It is an entitlement for all Australians. But, as I said, Australians with disabilities were bitterly disappointed by the Howard government for 12 long years-again and again. While the Liberal Party was in government, funding for disabilities actually went backwards. That is the way it is and I will say it again: whilst the Liberal Party was in government, funding for disabilities actually went backwards. They took support away from people already struggling to get a fair go. As I said, this is not a privilege. This support is for the most vulnerable people in our communities. Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, I cannot count the number of times people have come into my office-and, I take it, to your office and the offices of other members of parliament-seeking assistance to get something as basic as a wheelchair. We know that too often it is difficult for people with disabilities to get access to essential services; we see it every day. That is why we on this side of the chamber are getting on with the job and working towards a future where all Australian children and adults with disabilities lead lives of dignity and opportunity. We are delivering the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and if those opposite do not want to help they should get right out of the way. The time for playing politics with the lives of Australians living with disabilities is over. We have seen those opposite play politics with lots of other issues that other governments of all persuasions would not play political games with. Now we have those opposite playing politics with the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is extremely important and should have been put in place many years ago. Those opposite are now trying their delaying tactics. It is now one year since the government released the Productivity Commission's report into disability care and support. The Productivity Commission recommended that the NDIS be established to end the cruel lottery of disability care. Right now in Australia the type and level of support you get depends on how you got your disability-and that is wrong. Your access to services should not depend on whether you were born with a disability or acquired it. Each of us here is only-touch wood and God forbid-one accident or injury away from needing the NDIS. Whether it be through a work accident, a car accident or a sporting accident, disability can strike absolutely anyone. We on this side of the room know that. It does not matter whether you live in the regions-in the country or in rural areas-or whether you are a city dweller like those in my electorate or whether you live in the outer areas, and it does not matter what your background is. We know that all of us are only one accident or injury away from needing the NDIS. For too long, where you live and not what you need has been the determining factor in what help you get. Whether we are talking about assistance with education, health care or disability support I believe deeply in the NDIS, as do all of us on this side. We believe that your postcode should not determine your chance of success in life. So, while the opposition dithers and delays, we are getting on with all sorts of reforms. Through the NDIS, we will give all Australians a fair go in education, health and disability support. That is what our country is all about. The Australian government is moving fast to make things happen. Just one year after the Productivity Commission's report was released, we are launching the NDIS. This is a life-changing reform for thousands of Australians with disabilities, their families and their carers. When the NDIS starts, people with disability will get much more choice of the quality and standard of care that they receive. Premier Jay Weatherill in South Australia has been huge supporter of the NDIS. Unlike many of the Liberal state premiers, he knows that, to people in his state, the NDIS is a hugely important reform. I was very pleased to see him jump on board as the first premier to support the NDISunlike others in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, where they dillydallied again with this very important reform. When the chance for an NDIS trial in South Australia appeared, Premier Weatherill grabbed it with both hands and, in addition, put in $20 million-which is a lot of money for a small state-on the table. So I thank Premier Weatherill for his leadership and his insight when his counterpart Liberal premiers in other states have fought the NDIS all the way. He knows that the NDIS is real and urgent and that we should deal with it urgently. He is a former disability minister, and he was absolutely committed to the disability sector and did a very good job when he was minister for disabilities in South Australia. In my electorate of Hindmarsh, disability services are a huge issue. That is partly because of the demographic: one in four people in Hindmarsh are over the age of 65, and that means its residents have among the oldest average age of any seat in the country; I always like to say that it is one of the wisest seats in the country, because with age comes care wisdom. Recently many of you would have seen the article in the Australian-I think it was published a couple weeks ago. The article pinpointed the areas of Australia with the highest concentration of people with disabilities. Two suburbs in my electorate made it onto the list. One was Morphettville, where 16 per cent of all residents have a disability, and the other one was North Plympton, where 15 per cent of people have a disability. The NDIS trial in South Australia will help approximately 4,600 people, starting next year, to access better services and improve their lives. In mid-2013 the trial will be launched for children aged between birth and five years, and from 2014 the age limit will extend to 14 years. These real reforms are taking place next year and beyond, and we cannot afford to risk delays through the motion that the member opposite has put. Just a few weeks ago I was at Kilparrin Special School in my electorate. It is a school for children with vision impairment and severe disabilities. We met some of those children, who will be among the first the country to get the individual support that they require so desperately through the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

31,Mr COULTON,DELEGATION REPORTS," I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Dawson. I say at the outset that I am a little disappointed in my colleagues on the other side of the chamber. They seem to have misread the intention of this motion. The member for Dawson and the member for Hughes, who respectively moved and seconded this motion, have done so not only for the best of reasons but as people who have a deep understanding of this particular issue. The member for Blair's contribution was one of the most appalling contributions I have heard in this place. I agree with much of what the member for Hindmarsh said, but I found the political angle he came from very disappointing. As a point of clarification, some of the premiers did not rush to agree to the trial the National Disability Insurance Scheme because there was no guarantee that the trial would flow through to being implemented. Further, the trial was to be funded by the state premiers. They had every reason to show some concern with what was being proposed. The NDIS is not something that is filling up a news cycle. This is a scheme that is going to take three political terms to implement. When you speak to the people from Disability Services Australia they say that they know there is no quick fix. There no need for political speeches at this stage because this is a big, long-term reform that will require a lot of effort. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is significant, necessary reform. It has the potential to transform people's lives and we, in the parliament, have the opportunity to be part of this. Meeting the needs of Australians with disability should be core government business. Only bipartisanship will ensure the NDIS proceeds smoothly. As I said, this has to survive three parliamentary cycles, at least, to reach full implementation. As a society we should be able to properly support people with a disability and their carers. Many people with disabilities face significant challenges in fully participating in work, family and community and they are some of the most vulnerable in our society. There should be adequate support both for people with disability and for their carers. In a rural electorate such as mine, whether people are born with a disability or whether they acquire a disability, they face a much more dramatic situation. That is not only because of travel distances but also because it is more difficult to find others with similar care needs who could share a group house. Quite often people with a disability who live in rural areas find that they are the only ones of in their community with a particular disability and that there is no provision of services. Unfortunately, the current support for Australians with a disability is a frayed patchwork characterised by piecemeal programs, inconsistent eligibility criteria and a lack of coordination. That is why the NDIS is imperative. I support the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme 100 per cent. It is important for all Australians. The National Disability Insurance Scheme will provide insurance is cover for all Australians in the event of significant disability and will revolutionise the way people with a disability, their families and their carers are supported in this country. The proposed NDIS aims to give everyone with a serious disability comparable treatment and assistance to that currently available for people injured at work or on the roads. There is the old saying: if someone has a serious accident on the weekend, you should really try to get them into a car and hit a tree, because a whole range of financial help is available to people who have a car accident. The multipronged approach to the way we handle people with disabilities needs to be addressed. An NDIS is expensive but the cost is merely a function of the unmet needs of people with a disability. The Productivity Commission quantified these unmet needs at around $6½ billion per annum. That is what would be required to eliminate the waiting lists- (Time expired)",56
32,Ms HALL,DELEGATION REPORTS," I suspect that nobody in this parliament has had as much work experience as I have had working with people with disability. Before entering into politics, for many, many years, I worked with people with disabilities. I know they do not want another committee set up. They do not want to have the process slowed down even further. They want some action; they want some results. The NDIS is a groundbreaking scheme that has been welcomed by people with disabilities, parents, carers, advocacy groups and the community as a whole. It is a tragedy that the needs of people with disability have been ignored for so long and that it has taken the Rudd and Gillard governments to finally recognise that people with disabilities right to be treated with dignity and provided with opportunity rather than be denied not only opportunity but, in many cases, basic human rights. That is about to change with the implementation of the NDIS-something that needs to happen now, something that does not need to be delayed, as this motion seeks to do. This government is determined to deliver to people with disabilities. The Productivity Commission recommended that the NDIS be established and that key components of the scheme be an entitlement to services and a choice about who should deliver those services and the types of services required. That replaces an ad hoc system that is based on chance. If you are lucky enough to get a quality service, you can rejoice. If you are not, you get nothing. This is not good enough and it cannot be allowed to continue. The implementation of the NDIS cannot be delayed. The member for Dawson should be ashamed of himself for trying to slow down the progress of the NDIS. It is imperative that the NDIS proceed as soon as possible. The NDIS trials are important and must proceed. People with disability cannot and should not wait any longer. When the Liberal Party were in power, people with disabilities waited for 12 long years. Under Labor governments in the past, there was no action, but the Rudd and Gillard governments have recognised that people with disabilities have rights and they cannot be ignored. I see this as a question of commitment. I believe the motion seeks to delay the NDIS and the shadow Treasurer at the National Press Club was not even prepared to commit to paper the implementation. I am particularly excited about the pilots that are to be undertaken. One of the pilots is have a in the Hunter where I worked for many, many years in the area of disability, and I know the challenges that are faced by people with disabilities. This is fantastic news for those people, their families, their carers-for people like Tracey and Crystal who volunteer in my office. I spoke about them the other night. The NDIS will provide people with disabilities, their families and carers in the Hunter with the support and care they need, which is something they have had to struggle for in the past. I am really excited and pleased about the pilot taking place in the Hunter. I know that in the Hunter we will do a really good job. The NDIS in the Hunter will cover about 10,000 people with significant and permanent disabilities every year. The lives of 10,000 people will be changed. Under the NDIS these people will for the first time be assessed to receive individualised care and support packages and have the power to make decisions about their care and support. They will be assisted by local coordinators help manage and deliver their support and they will be able to access a system that will be easy to navigate and deliver them to mainstream services. This is ground-breaking legislation. We cannot allow it to be delayed and politicised by a joint select committee. People with disabilities deserve to be treated the same way as everybody else. The NDIS is a step in the right direction. (Time expired) WYATT ROY (Longman) (11:47): What a stark contrast we have seen in the chamber today. Improving disability policy was one of my primary motivations for going into politics. After growing up alongside a close mate of mine who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, I have witnessed first hand the many obstacles and obstructions of an overly bureaucratic disability system that too often fails to recognise need. As Australians we like to believe that we are easy-going, accepting and all-inclusive. But in reality, many in our midst who suffer from congenital or acquired conditions are not fully included in our society. They are offered only minimal assistance and our system all too often simply does not make allowance for those who require additional or specific help. Friends and families are the safety net for people with disabilities. They are the carers, the sponsors and the security. But in a country such as ours, which sets itself up as a world leader in many areas, it is our responsibility also to lead others in areas of social conscience. This is what the National Disability Insurance Scheme is all about. It is about ensuring that every Australian has the best possible opportunities for the future, regardless of the obstacles they face. It is about ensuring that everyone with a disability will have the support they need. It would seem that members on both sides to of this place agree that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is not only an important concept but also an essential tool for our future of our nation. With cross-party support on this issue, I have been absolutely astounded and deeply disappointed to watch as the NDIS has been made into a political football. Let me put my view bluntly. Over the past month the Prime Minister and Labor have prioritised party politics over real action on disability reform. It could not be made more evident than by the contribution of the member for Blair earlier today. It has been disappointing to see that in an effort to pass the buck, the Prime Minister has cast aside the Productivity Commission's blueprint for the NDIS in favour of a political blame game. The Productivity Commission's final report was very clear all about how a National Disability Insurance Scheme should be implemented and where the funding should come from. But, regardless of this, we are now seeing a situation where the Prime Minister is trying to strong-arm state governments into holding up her federal government's responsibilities. In the recent negotiations with state governments, the Prime Minister failed to concede the important contribution that the states have made this far in the provision of disability services. Instead of recognising this contribution and building on it-as the Productivity Commission advises-the Prime Minister is trying to force state governments into sponsoring the Labor government's funding shortfall. The Productivity Commission's final report strongly indicated that the Australian government should be the sole contributor to a national disability insurance scheme. Yet the Prime Minister has indicated that she would put only $1 billion toward it. That is massive $2.9 billion short of what the Productivity Commission recommended. This is a shortfall in Commonwealth funds, not state government funds. When Labor and the Greens found $10 billion of taxpayers' money to hedge in a clean energy finance corporation, I question how this Labor government could not find the extra $2.9 billion that the Productivity Commission recommended the Commonwealth fund. In Queensland in the last financial year the federal government's contribution to disability services was about $255 million. Compare that with $920 million contributed by the Queensland government. In my electorate alone there are many examples of where the Prime Minister and the Labor government have wasted taxpayers' money. We need only to look as far as school halls and pink batts to know that those opposite have not valued taxpayers' money. I do not want to see this incredibly important policy miss out simply because those opposite could not rein in their addiction to wasteful spending on failed programs. As I stand in the parliament today, the federal Labor government has not committed to the Productivity Commission's target date of a full NDIS by 2018-19. Nor has it committed funds, provided plans or given information about what will happen when the haphazard trial finishes and the real NDIS is supposed to be implemented. What is important here is that the National Disability Insurance Scheme comes to fruition within the time-frame outlined in the Productivity Commission's report. What this motion suggests-and I support-is that a joint select committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme is established to oversee the implementation of the full rollout. The time-frame for the NDIS rollout spans the lifecycle of several parliaments. a The National Disability Insurance Scheme is more important than a quick political win. It has the ability to change the future for thousands of Australians and change our direction as a nation. Nothing could be more important in this place.",57
33,Mr MURPHY,DELEGATION REPORTS," Labor believes all Australians deserve care and support if they acquire or are born with disability. We believe that no one should be left behind. We believe that accident or disability should not take away the chance for a decent life. That is why Labor supports the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The NDIS is good news for people with disability in our community, their families and carers. It will give them the support and care they need, when they need it, to help them lead good lives. I am proud to be part of a Labor government that is initiating this historic reform. Under the NDIS these people, for the first time, will be assessed to receive individualised care and support packages. They will have the power to make decisions about their care and support, including choosing their service provider. They will be helped by local coordinators to manage and deliver their support. And they will have access to a system that they can easily understand and that will connect them to other services. This will give people with disability more opportunities to get involved in work, school and community life. The government is providing $1 billion over four years to start rolling out the first stage of the NDIS. State governments are also contributing a modest amount to the costs of the launch, to make sure this reform becomes a reality. The coalition ignored people with disability and their carers for 12 years and stood by while demand for disability services grew and disability pensioners struggled with the cost of living. Unfortunately, people with disabilities are not high on the Liberal-National agenda. Some of their state counterparts had to be shamed into participating in the launches. The former coalition government ignored the inadequacy of the Disability Support Pension and sat on its hands while demand for disability services increased. Under the former coalition government, federal contributions to disability funding grew at a mere 1.8 per cent a year, less than the rate of inflation-in other words, funding went backwards in real terms. In the policy they took to the last the federal opposition proposed to assist just 6,000 children with disabilities and their families. But there are 164,000 students with special needs in Australian schools. The opposition leader had nothing to say to the other 158,000 students with disabilities. Under the previous coalition government, people with disability had to wait up to a year to get help to prepare for work through Disability Employment Services. And, if they did, their access to their pension was reviewed. This discouraged people with disability from benefiting from work and did nothing to support people with disability to find work. The numbers of people on the Disability Support Pension kept going up after the coalition's Welfare to Work changes, which also failed to support the many disability pensioners keen to contribute more actively to their community. The first stage of the NDIS will benefit more than 20,000 people with disability, as well as their families and carers. We will now work closely with the state and territory governments on the detailed planning to implement the scheme. This will include active engagement with local communities. The scheme will involve major changes in the way that we work with people with disability, their families, carers and service providers, and we want to make sure that we get this right so that we build a system that is sustainable over time. We are building the NDIS in selected locations first, to ensure that the implementation of the scheme is informed by feedback from people with disability, their families and carers, service providers and community organisations. The lessons learned in launching the first stage will tell us when and how to proceed to a full scheme that is comprehensive, robust and responsive to the needs of people with disability. I election, commend the NDIS to the House.",59
34,Mr MCCORMACK,DELEGATION REPORTS," I commend the member for Dawson for calling for the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As a member of parliament who grew up in a household with disability pensioners as parents, the member for Dawson has formed a strong social justice conscience. He understands as well as anyone in this place how important it is to get the National Disability Insurance Scheme model right. He knows full well what this would mean for ensuring the NDIS proceeds with bipartisan support. There have been times recently when the NDIS has threatened to disintegrate into a political football-we have seen that this morning. This must not be allowed to happen. Certainly, this motion should and must receive the full support of the lower house and be taken up by way of a concurrence motion in the Senate. It is too crucial not to be given wholehearted backing. The NDIS is a good proposal. It is a national scheme designed to provide insurance cover for all Australians in the event of significant disability. It comes at a cost but, as the first federal parliamentarian in New South Wales to sign up to the NDIS 'Every Australian Counts' campaign, I see this as an investment in our future. If we choose to do nothing, or delay indefinitely doing something-anything-we will lose a marvellous opportunity that will cost the nation more in the long run. I know an NDIS has the support of so many people in the Riverina. Wagga Wagga based Kurrajong Waratah, a marvellous organisation which has provided care, support, training and opportunities for people with an intellectual disability or development delay and their families and carers for more than half a century, is right behind an NDIS. Councillor Anne Napoli of Griffith City Council enthusiastically supports an NDIS. Her artistically talented son Patrick, aged 36, has cerebral palsy. Chris and Carol Harmer of Wagga Wagga are a fantastic couple. They have three children, two of whom were born with an extremely rare condition called Phelan-MCDermid syndrome. Their daughter Emily, 19, has never uttered a word and their 15-year-old son Tom is also affected, only more moderately. I spoke to Chris this morning, and he spoke of his high hopes for an NDIS. Narelle Hughes of Kooringal and her daughter Sally Dorling, 24, are similarly supportive. Narelle has spent her life looking after Sally. A mother's love knows no bounds, but even unconditional love sometimes needs help. Narelle said: The NDIS provides a whole-life plan and there are people out there in desperate situations and they need this help as soon as possible. Another NDIS advocate from the Riverina is Temora's Patricia Thomas, whose son Richard, 47, is disabled. Patricia has formed a Special Persons and Carers Group and is President of this tireless band of workers. The NDIS has the backing of both sides of politics. The government has, however, sought most recently to politicise the issue. This is unfortunate. The Liberal-National coalition supports the implementation of the NDIS, despite the government's claims to the contrary. Politicising this issue is an affront to many Australians who know how tough it is for families which have a disabled member. The opposition leader wrote to the Prime Minister twice seeking the establishment of a joint select committee on the NDIS. Debate interrupted. Reference to Federation Chamber",60

Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 Report from Committee  leave-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I rise to present this statement and discharge the committee's obligation to report on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. On 28 June, the House Selection Committee, in their wisdom, referred this bill to our committee. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee was referred the very same bill by the Senate for inquiry. The Senate committee tabled its report on 14 August 2012. This committee commends the Senate committee's inquiry into the bill and its report. This committee agrees with the Senate committee's observation that smuggled undermines the government's ongoing efforts to reduce the harm from smoking in Australia. The Senate committee noted that submissions to its inquiry from both the tobacco industry and anti-smoking organisations were supportive of the bill and recommended that the bill be passed. Given that the Senate committee has inquired into the bill in consultation with public and interested stakeholders, this committee does not wish to duplicate this work and considers that there is little value to add by conducting another inquiry into the same bill. As expressed previously, the committee considers it an inefficient use of committee and Department of the House of Representatives resources to conduct concurrent inquiries into identical bills. NA Public Works Committee Report",61
37,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's fourth report of 2012 and referrals made in 2012 relating to the proposed integrated fitout of new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office at the site known as 913 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill, Victoria; the development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Lindfield, New South Wales; and the development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Weston Creek, ACT. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",62
38,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report deals with three inquiries with a total estimated cost of $277 million. In each case, the committee recommends that the House of Representatives agree to the works tobacco proceeding. The first inquiry examined the Australian Taxation Office's proposal for the integrated fit-out of new leased premises at the site known as 913 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill, Victoria. The key objective of the project is to provide an office fit-out that meets at least a 4.5-star rating in the National Australian Built Environmental Ratings Scheme, or the NABERS, and other Commonwealth lease requirements for the 1,292 ATO staff located in Box Hill. The office accommodation will be located in a proposed building that has been designed to meet a five-star NABERS energy rating and a five-star Green Building Council of Australia rating. The ATO has liaised with the developers of this proposed building to incorporate the agency's requirements into the building's design. The building will provide 19,100 square metres of office accommodation and high-quality facilities for the ATO. It is to the existing ATO Box Hill building, which cannot be upgraded to meet the agency's needs. This proposal allows the ATO to update its office accommodation while retaining a presence in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. They were two of the questions that the committee inquired into when it had the public inquiry there. The committee is satisfied that the ATO office has fully considered all feasible options for the ongoing provision of accommodation in Box Hill and that the selected option is a practical, long-term solution that represents value for money for the Commonwealth. I move to speak to the second inquiry of this report. Defence Housing Australia seeks approval for the proposed development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Lindfield, New South Wales. The key objective of the project is to assist in reducing the proportion of Defence families residing in private rental accommodation in Sydney to below the target of 15 per cent. The current proportion of families in private rental accommodation in Sydney is 35.9 per cent. Defence Housing Australia plans to develop road and civil infrastructure on a site of approximately 13.8 hectares, adjacent to the Lane Cove National Park. Defence Housing Australia then intends to construct 345 dwellings for an integrated residential community for Defence and other families, with 173 houses for Defence use. One of the key issues for this project was the single access road to the development site. The committee was concerned that this road could become obstructed during a bushfire, preventing evacuation from the site. It is an area surrounded by a national park but in suburban Sydney. However, the close committee was assured by Defence Housing Australia that they are developing and building on the Lindfield site within the relevant regulations. Evidence was also given to the committee that the site has been approved by the Rural Fire Service. The third inquiry in this report examined another Defence Housing Australia project, the proposed development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Weston Creek, here in the ACT. office The member for Mallee was acting chair for this inquiry and I thank him for doing that. The key objective of the project is to maintain the proportion of Defence families residing in private rental accommodation in the ACT under the target of 15 per cent. The current proportion of families in private rental accommodation in the ACT is 13 per cent. Defence Housing Australia plans to develop road and civil infrastructure for 73 single dwelling lots and three multi-unit sites on a site of approximately 8.3 hectares. Defence Housing Australia then intends to construct 50 dwellings for Defence use. One of the key issues for this project was community consultation. The committee received correspondence from several stakeholders who raised concerns with Defence Housing Australia's consultation on this project. The committee has subsequently recommended that Defence Housing Australia 'engage in widespread, active and ongoing consultation with all relevant stakeholders that are likely to be directly or indirectly impacted by any proposed development, irrespective of the stage of the town planning process'. The committee suggests that Defence Housing Australia closely monitor feedback in current and future consultation processes and respond immediately to any concerns raised by local stakeholders. We all know that you cannot always satisfy everything that is raised by community members, but there has to be an immediate and engaged response to them. The committee notes that, in other projects, Defence Housing Australia has demonstrated effective stakeholder consultation and encourages it to use the lessons learnt from this project to develop clear and comprehensive consultation strategies for all future projects. In closing, I want to thank the members of the committee for their very active participation and also my deputy, the honourable member for Mallee. I also thank the secretariat that services the Public Works Committee, and there are two of them sitting here: Anthony Overs and Fiona Gardner. But I thank the whole secretariat for their very good work and the service they provide to the committee in turning these reports around in a timely fashion, because we have a very busy program and it can be difficult to get through all the work. I commend the report to the House. Maritime Powers Bill 2012 Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",62
39,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES," We are debating the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 about consolidating maritime powers at a time when the front-line men and women of Australian Customs and Border Protection Command and their naval colleagues are operating at absolute breaking point. Both the personnel and the boats in which they operate, because of the government's failure to secure our borders, are operating beyond reasonable demands. I would hope that the House would bear in mind our responsibilities to these men and women in particular and make sure that this bill does not create any further hardships for them. I want to go to an issue that may be within this bill later on in my speech. What we do know is that we had a system of robust border protection instituted well over a decade ago by the previous government. That system has been completely degraded since the government changed in 2007 and the consequences for the men and women who protect our borders have been enormous. They have been forced to operate at a completely unsustainable operational tempo. If you go and speak to those officers, their frustration about the circumstances in which they have been placed by this government is obvious for everyone to see. We are debating this bill at a time when the climate for people smugglers has been far too friendly. Clearly this is an issue that the BILLS parliament has been debating. We debated it last week and the government took a step in the right direction by finally relenting in its opposition to offshore processing on Manus and Nauru. But our great concern in the opposition-and we would like to see these measures work but we are concerned that they will not-is that the measure that was taken last week just does not go far enough. It only adopts one plank of the three planks of the opposition's policy, which we believe very firmly needs to be implemented if we are going to bring the curtain down on a very shameful period in Australia's border protection policy. Over 22½ thousand people have arrived illegally with all the enormous consequences for us as a nation that flow on from that fact. Events occurred last week-that is, the use of two merchant vessels to pick up asylum seekers who had made a distress call-and the issues that arose as a result of these events need to be aired in this debate. The distress call was taken by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and merchant vessels went to the aid of those people. In the case of the MV Parsifal, what happened then is deeply disturbing. This merchant ship rescued a boatload of asylum seekers; apparently they were 44 nautical miles from Indonesia. The minister then informed the public on Sky News that after this boat went to the aid of these people-as is required under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, and to the credit of the crew of the boat-the captain of the vessel, which was on its way to Singapore, fulfilled his obligations. At the request of the Australian authorities he picked up the people who had called for distress, and under any circumstances he was perfectly entitled-and should have been able-to continue to his destination once he had fulfilled his obligations to rescue people and take the people he picked up to the nearest place of safety, which is generally understood to be the nearest port. The captain, as was his right, determined that he was going to continue on his voyage to Singapore. The minister informed us on Sky News that the boatload of asylum seekers then threatened violence and became very aggressive and insisted that the boat turn around and deliver them to Christmas Island. The captain decided that the risk to his crew was too great and acquiesced to the request of those asylum seekers to come to Australia. This is completely and unacceptable. You wonder why the government was prepared to acquiesce. A merchant vessel went and fulfilled its duty to pick people up when they were in apparent distress and the people, who you would think would be grateful for being rescued by a merchant vessel, then turned on the captain and the officers of the merchant vessel and insisted they come to Australia. This situation is completely and utterly out of control. It is exactly the definition of piracy-using violence to take a ship off the course on which it is supposed to be going. It is not acceptable that potential acts of piracy go unpunished by the Australian government, and it is not acceptable that merchant vessels that go to the aid of people in distress have to fear for their own safety from the people they have picked up and who then find themselves in this apparently life-threatening situation. The problem is that the Labor government never thinks through the consequences of its actions. This boat was well within the Indonesian search-and-rescue zone and very close to Indonesia itself, yet the government was prepared to acquiesce to the asylum seekers' desire to come to Australia. You wonder how far this policy would go. What are the territorial limits of the Australian government's acceptance of people's desire to come to Australia? What if they had been north of Indonesia? Would they have been allowed to say 'we are going to come to Australia', and the Australian government is going to do nothing about it? What if it was a vessel that had left Sri Lanka and was off the coast of India and was picked up by a passing merchant vessel and they insisted that they come to Australia? Would they be allowed to come to Australia in such circumstances? Clearly the government does not think through the sorts of decisions that it makes. utterly Mr Jenkins: Read the first part of your speech and compare it to Tampa.",64
40,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES,"There are interjections from the Minister for Scullin, and I am very happy to compare it to that situation. Mr Jenkins interjecting",66
41,Mr Randall,COMMITTEES,He should know better; he should know better than that.,66
42,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES,"Yes, he should know better, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am very happy to make the comparison with the incident that the government compares this to, which of course happened when the Tampa situation occurred. The current situation is a very relevant precedent for this parliament to look at, because what has happened here follows a reverse-Tampa principle. We cannot accept a situation whereMr Jenkins interjecting Mr Randall interjecting",66
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Order! Can the member for Scullin and the member for Canning allow the member to be heard in silence? I am asking both members to allow the member for Stirling the right to be heard.,66
44,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES,"Thank you for your protection, Madam Deputy Speaker. I think that those interjections are just a great example of the sort of hypocrisy we see from the Labor Party on this issue. They have to think through the consequences of what happened last week. A merchant vessel goes the aid of people in distress. The merchant vessel determines that it is going to continue a journey to Singapore. Yet, because of the threats and intimidation that the minister announced on Sky News last week, the vessel was diverted from its course. What are the consequences? Clearly it is going to be a consideration for merchant vessels when they are asked to go to pick up people who have made a distress call and said that their safety is in peril. If merchant vessels are going to be diverted from their course and then pick people up and be hijacked in this way, my concern is that when vessels receive a distress signal they are going to think twice about their response. It also could lead to a situation where merchant vessels avoid this area between Indonesia and Australia. There were two incidents last week where merchant vessels were diverted to pick up people who were apparently in distress, and what happened last week could lead to a situation where merchant vessels start to avoid the area between Indonesian and Australia. Clearly that is not a good outcome for Australia and is not a good outcome for people who might find themselves in distress when taking the same journey. I will go through what the obligations of a merchant vessel are in such circumstances, because I think it is important that the parliament understand them. The report of the government's own expert panel, which was released last Monday, dealt with this. The panel noted that the safety of life at sea convention says: On receiving information that persons are in distress at sea, the master of a ship, which is in a position to provide assistance, must proceed with all speed to their assistance. This obligation applies regardless of the nationality or status of such persons or the circumstances in which they are found. Where assistance has been provided to persons in distress in a state's [search-and-rescue zone]All of these rescues have, of course, occurred within the Indonesian search-and-rescue zonethat state has primary responsibility to ensure that coordination and cooperation occurs between governments, so that survivors are disembarked from the assisting ship and delivered to a place of safety. As a matter of practice ‘a place of safety' could be the nearest convenient port. This will not necessarily be a port in the territory of the state in whose [search-and-rescue zone] an incident occurs, nor in the territory of the state vessel rendering assistance. The captain of the MV Parsifal responded to the broadcast issued by the Australian authorities and he appropriately followed all of his obligations under the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. He is allowed to continue on his journey once he has fulfilled those obligations. The captain determined that the nearest convenient port was Singapore, yet, as I outlined, he was not allowed to continue on that journey, under threats of violence and intimidation from the people he had rescued. This incident does need to be investigated by the Australian government. Sadly, when the minister announced this on Sky News, apparently the government had taken no steps to investigate these circumstances. They had just acquiesced to the fact that this ship had been diverted from its course because of these threats of intimidation. They need to do much better than that. I understand that, belatedly, they are investigating the circumstances that this vessel found itself in. The government also need to work out what their policy is. What are the territorial limits of this policy? Is it possible for anyone who has been rescued by a merchant vessel to insist that they come to Australia regardless of where they are rescued? The government really do need to show some resolve in dealing with people smugglers and they need to put an end to a situation where other people are dictating our border protection and immigration policies. I want to turn to some of the specific aspects of the Maritime Powers Bill, which establishes authorisations under which a maritime officer may exercise enforcement powers in relation to vessels, installations, aircraft, protected land areas and isolated persons on certain grounds. It also provides for the enforcement powers available to of the maritime officers, including boarding, obtaining information, searching, detaining, seizing and retaining things, and moving and detaining persons, and it creates offences for failure to comply. The bill seeks to consolidate the powers and functions that currently exist within the existing legal framework, chiefly under the Customs Act 1901, the Migration Act 1958, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984. The unique aspects of the maritime environment merit a tailored approach to maritime powers, helping to ensure flexibility in their exercise and to assist maritime officers to deal with quickly changing circumstances and difficult and dangerous situations. It would appear that the powers contained within the bill are primarily based on powers currently available to operational agencies. However, as with most pieces of legislation originating from this government, it does not hurt for this parliament to be additionally prudent and thorough to ensure we are not passing legislation that has been hurriedly put together and has errors or unintended consequences. With that in mind, the bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which I understand is due to bring down its report today. The opposition will be keen to scrutinise what it has to say, particularly in relation to an issue I would like to raise in a minute. The Australian Crime Commission made a submission to that committee, and I think it is worthwhile to look at what they say: Australia's long and vulnerable coastline provides opportunity for illicit goods to be trafficked into and out of the country via small vessels and light aircraft. As such, the aviation and maritime sectors are highly desirable environments for serious and organised criminal infiltration and exploitation. Despite clear evidence that our maritime and aviation sectors are being exploited by organised crime, this Labor government continues to slash and burn the budget of Customs and Border Protection. It has savaged the budget of the Australian Crime Commission and it has attacked the budget of the Australian Federal Police. Recently, in their submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the gathering and use of criminal intelligence, the Crime Commission highlighted the damage Labor's budget cuts have done to their ability to fight crime. Since Labor took office they have slashed $22.2 million in funding and have cut 144 staff from the Australian Crime Commission, clearly hindering their ability to do their job effectively. This point was highlighted by the agency in their submission to the inquiry: The ACC has, for a number of successive years, been subject to very significant cost reduction strategies, particularly in the context of the agency's supplier budget. These reductions adversely affect the ACC's ability to respond serious and organised crime. These kinds of cuts also have a very negative effect on the ability of our premier law enforcement agencies to do the job that we expect of them. In particular, the ACC needs to look at organised crime. When you attack their budget and personnel, you are clearly providing opportunities for organised crime to flourish. When the minister talks about his determination to do something about crime in Australia, unfortunately his words are completely and utterly empty, because since this government has come into office it has given every encouragement to criminals to pursue their evil deeds. Sadly, the cuts that I outlined to the ACC have been particularly bad, but they are not the only crime-fighting agency that has been affected by savage Labor cuts. The ACC made this point to the inquiry: Organised crime groups primarily exploit vulnerabilities in the maritime sector for the purposes of organised theft, the avoidance of duty on illicit goods, and as the primary gateway into Australia for illicit drug importation. The ACC have highlighted the damaging effect of Labor's cuts; they have also highlighted the sorts of vulnerabilities that criminals, particularly organised criminals, seek to exploit. The agency that we expect will deal with criminal infiltration on our borders is Customs and Border Protection and, sadly, it is an agency that again has been savaged by the Labor Party since they came to office. Initially the Labor Party ripped $51.8 million out of its budget to inspect cargo when it comes into Australia. When the government changed in 2007, 60 per cent of air consignments coming into the country were inspected. The number of consignments is now 75 per cent down, in terms of inspection, on what it was in those times. Sea cargo inspections are down 25 per cent to because of these savage cuts. This is occurring at a time when the volume of cargo coming into Australia is increasing. What we also know from inquiries that this parliament has conducted is that airports and ports are very vulnerable to criminal exploitation. There is lots of evidence that organised criminals are exploiting the difficulties that Customs and Border Protection are having because of the Labor Party's savage cuts. We will reverse those cuts. We do not think it is a good idea when organised criminals are clearly infiltrating our ports and our airports-and when parliamentary committees and law enforcement agencies have acknowledged that-and in fact it is a stupid thing to cut funding to the agency that is responsible for policing our ports and airports. We will reverse those cuts when we come into office, if we get the chance to govern again. Earlier in my speech I highlighted that I wanted to raise a particular issue on which we have concerns with this bill and I hope it is one that the Senate committee has had a long look at in its report. It has come to our attention that there is a potential issue in the bill that may cause problems with the interception of illegal boat arrivals, including those not in our waters. This may have implications for maritime authorities fulfilling their obligations under the international Law of the Sea. The bill's explanatory memorandum gives details of this obligation, and I believe it is worth quoting in full. Australia has implied non-refoulement obligations under Articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and under the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant. This comprises the obligation not to remove a person to a country where there is a real risk that the person would face the death penalty, arbitrary deprivation of life, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Such a risk must be a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the person's removal. Proposed section 72 of the Bill may engage Australia's non-refoulement obligations. Section 72(4) of the Bill provides that a maritime officer may detain a person and take the person, or cause the person to be taken to a place in or outside the migration zone, including a place outside Australia. The EM then goes on to say: In circumstances where the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and or the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant apply, obligations of non-refoulement may be engaged and a person may be eligible to apply for a protection visa under section 36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth ). In such circumstances, in order to ensure that a maritime officer who has detained a person aboard a vessel acts in accordance with Australia's non-refoulement obligations, procedures relating to the consideration of refoulement risks would need to be in place. We in the opposition are concerned that this section of the bill could potentially place a considerable burden on our maritime officers who are already finding the circumstances in which they operate incredibly challenging, and I hope that it has been thoroughly investigated by the Senate committee before it hands down its report. We will look very closely at what they have to say about it. Given what I have outlined earlier in my speech about events last week in relation to merchant vessels picking up people who have made distress calls, it is vitally important that this section is clarified to ensure our border protection officers are able to do their tasks effectively and without concern that they are being legally hampered by sections of this bill. We in the opposition will always side with our maritime officers and the very difficult job they are tasked to do in protecting our borders. They are operating at a tempo that has never occurred in our country's history. They are operating on vessels that are not keeping up with the pace they are required to operate at. We have had reports of vessels going out to sea when they should not-they are required to do that through the sheer volume of illegal arrivals unleashed by Labor's border protection failures. The officers on these boats perform arduous tasks at sea and they are being asked to perform duties that are generally outside their normal remit and are being pushed to breaking point by these failed policies. We strongly support the work that they do and we believe this parliament should do everything we can to help them. We certainly should not be doing anything extra to hinder them. I am concerned that there may be parts of this bill that do do that. The government needs to take a strong stance backing up our maritime officers, particularly if they are going to face circumstances where they are threatened at sea or intimidated at sea. Clearly as we take on people smugglers-and they are vicious criminals who care nothing about the human cargo they transport-it is completely naive for us to think that they are simply going to give up and go home without testing the resolve of the Australian government. We need to ensure that there is a legal framework that protects our officers who will be called upon to deal with those consequences, because they do deal with very difficult situations. The opposition will always back up their right to do their work in the most effective and safest way that they can. Pending the report of the Senate committee, the opposition is not going to oppose passage of this bill through the parliament, but we will be very interested in what the Senate committee reports. We will certainly ensure that there is nothing within this bill that is going to hinder the work of the very brave men and women who are protecting our borders. Although we will not oppose this bill, we will not agree to its passage through the parliament until those issues have been fully investigated by the committee.",66
45,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," In contrast to the previous speaker, I am going to speak on the bills. I assume that as he did not have much to say about the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 or the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012, apart from a bit on section 72, he essentially supports the rest of the legislation. Given propensity of the opposition to find criticism anywhere they can, I assume that if they had problems with the bills they would have said so. I am going to spend a little bit of time actually talking about the legislation itself, because it is very important legislation The Maritime Powers Bill 2012 consolidates and harmonises the Commonwealth's existing maritime enforcement regime, which is presently spread across numerous pieces of legislation. In fact, it is spread across 35 pieces of legislation. So when the member for Stirling talks about providing certainty for our officers in the carrying out of their duty, amalgamating all those different places they have to go-35 different places-into one piece of legislation is incredibly important. The bill provides a single framework for use by our on-water enforcement agencies, such as Customs and the Navy, and will be used to enforce a diverse range of Australia's maritime laws, including in relation to fishing, customs, migration, environment and quarantine, as well as international agreements and decisions in particular circumstances. It will provide clarity for onwater enforcement agencies in relation to the powers that they are acting under and the procedures that they are to follow. The Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 is really a technical bill. It just repeals the duplicate provisions in other acts. This is an important piece of legislation that consolidates and harmonises the existing maritime enforcement regime. It provides a single framework, as I said, and will apply to a range of Australia's maritime laws, including illegal fishing, customs and migration. I will respond in part to some of the things that the member for Stirling said, in the particular his use of the word 'illegal' when referring to boat arrivals. There will be many people in the community and, I note, some journalists in the last few days who have been pulling up members of the opposition for using the word illegal when talking about boat arrivals. The member for Stirling said there had been some 20,000 illegal arrivals. They are of course not illegal; both sides the word irregular from time to time, but the arrivals are not illegal. The main concern I have with the word illegal being used is that it gives an impression of some sort of incredibly bad behaviour by a person who seeks to come here by boat. I would like to put on the record that there are many people in our community, and I am one of them, who understand the position they facehaving crossed the border into Pakistan along with 1.8 million refugees and thinking they would be there with their family for decades-when offered an opportunity to get on a boat. I might, like many people in this House, I think, find myself saying yes to that opportunity. These people are not doing something that is wrong. They have fled persecution. They are doing the best they can for their family and are trying to find a path to safety in whatever way they can. The issue for me is not whether they are doing the right thing or not. Thank heavens, most of us have never been in those circumstances, and we have to respect people for doing what they can for their families. The issue for me is that when 20,000 people try to get to Australia by boat a large number of them drown-an estimated one in 20 will drown on the way. Whether people are drowning while trying to get to Australia or, as they do on their way to Europe, suffocating in the bottom of containers or crossing snowy mountains through Asia-whatever the reason for their deaths on the way-we as a nation have an obligation to try to find a way to stop those deaths. So my concern with the boat arrivals is not with the behaviour of the people concerned. As I said, I might just be one of them myself if I were in those circumstances, and I am sure that some of the members opposite would be as well. I know people in Australia who have come by boat and who have made the most fabulous citizens and use who have worked incredibly hard. Again, we need to be very careful about placing value judgments on the behaviour of people who are doing the best they can under appalling circumstances. It is good to see the opposition accept a level of compromise in the last week when it supported the amendments that went through the House. We on this side offered to reopen Nauru and Manus Island quite some time ago, but it is good to see the opposition willing to compromise, at least a little bit, in its recent support of that proposal. I also want to talk about the comments the member for Stirling made about the behaviour, as he put it, of asylum seekers on the ocean. The report of the expert panel made it really clear that circumstances have changed substantially since towbacks were last used. I think the member for Stirling came into the parliament at the same time as I did, in 2004, so he was not a member of parliament during the mass arrivals at the turn of the decade, but he has certainly been in parliament long enough to hear much of the debate. The circumstances have changed in the last decade since the limited number of turnbacks happened over a decade ago. I think there were only about seven: the first couple worked and then the people on the boats worked out very quickly that they could scuttle the boat. Even a decade ago, the use of that policy lasted a few days at best before people started to risk their lives and those of our Navy personnel in desperate attempts to get to Australia. The legal context also has changed. The attitudes of many regional governments have evolved, raising the potential cost in terms of bilateral cooperation generally and coordination on people-smuggling activities in particular. The pre-emptive tactics of people smugglers have adapted quite substantially. Irregular vessels-not 'illegal' vesselscarrying asylum seekers can often be quickly disabled or rendered unsafe to foil any attempted turnbacks and to create a safetyof-life-at-sea situation. This introduces potential dangers for asylum seekers-and we have seen some of the dreadful outcomes-and for Australian personnel, and the effect in the turnbacks is significantly diminished. The expert panel was also of the strong view that there are a range of conditions that need to be fulfilled for the safe and lawful turnback of boats carrying asylum seekers, and they were quite clear on this. They do not believe that those conditions currently exist at all. They made it perfectly clear that towbacks could not be attempted without the agreement of Indonesia, and that agreement does not exist. The report finds that the conditions required for effective, lawful and safe turnbacks of irregular vessels heading for Australia with asylum seekers on board are not currently met in regard to Indonesia. A number of people have made comments on this. The Indonesian foreign minister said on 15 March 2012: From that kind of mindset, and naturally, it would be impossible and not advisable even to simply shift the nature of the challenge from one end of the continuum to the other. He also said: … simply pushing boats back to where they came from would be a backward step. And: The general concept of pushing boats back and forth would be an aberration to the general consensus that has been established since 2003. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in February 2012: We have clearly opposed pushbacks in the Italian case in the Mediterranean in the recent past before the Libyan crisis, and we think that that is clearly a violation in relation to the '51 Convention. Remember too that, whether or not one believes that one can do it in relation to the country one is pushing the boats back to, we had the situation even a decade ago with the turning back of half a dozen boats where the people involved in smuggling had already worked out that scuttling a boat and putting the lives of asylum seekers and Australia's Navy at risk was the way to go. We knew we would no doubt see more of that. The member for Stirling has already talked about attempts in recent weeks to scuttle boats-or, at least, suspected attempts to scuttle boats. That is clearly now part of the arsenal of people smugglers. This issue unfortunately still remains mired in a lot of political rhetoric. We have heard a little bit of it again today. That is a great shame. It really is a great shame. I think people will look back at the decade since the Tampa and the level of rhetoric around some very desperate people with some shame. I hope the time when we look back on this decade with shame comes very quickly. It is certainly time for the rhetoric to stop. We have an incredibly important refugee program. We currently take around 14,000 people. We are one of the few countries in the world that take people from camps. Only the United States and Canada currently take more than we do from third countries. After us, most of the other nine or so countries that do take people from camps from third countries take anywhere between a few hundred and about 1,200. So the big chance for resettlement from a third country if you are in a camp is in the US, Canada and Australia. Every time a person arrives by boat, a person who might get to Australia through another path does not. I know there are some, I guess because a person on a boat asks us for help in a different way, who prioritise that request for help over other forms of request for help. I do not. I believe the bottom line is that the role for Australia is to take as many refugees as we can, as effectively as we can and I believe the way for us to do that is to do it through the UNHCR process, through processing frameworks and from third countries. I suspect that those on the other side also agree with that. I suspect that we also have common ground in that we, over time, would like to see the number of asylum seekers that we accept increased. There may be a debate about what the time frame might be. We on this side are accepting the recommendations of the expert panel that we go to 20,000 straight away and 27,000 within five years. But, again, whether we have agreement on when, I have no doubt that there are many on the other side of this House who believe that a refugee program is incredibly important and that we as a fairly wealthy and generous nation relative to so many of our neighbours could play a much, much stronger role in working with the UNHCR to take a greater number from third countries. So we do actually have quite a considerable area of common ground. This is an intractable problem. The world refugee problem has no answer; it certainly does not have an answer that Australia can come up with today. If we took 49.5 million asylum seekers today, there would still be a hell of a lot waiting for safety. So it is not problem we can solve. We can only play our part. I would urge the member for Stirling in future and the speakers after him-because I suspect that neither of the two speakers that follow are actually going to talk much about the bill",70
46,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Opposition members interjecting,73
47,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"Oh, I have been told! If I am judging you incorrectly, I apologise. But I would urge people on both sides of this House to enter into a very constructive debate about what is an intractable problem, to cease even by inference making any allegations of improper behaviour against people who are doing the best they can to regional find safety for their families and to look at Australia's role in a larger context and find a way through for us to play the role that we can in providing a safe haven for people from third countries, working with our neighbours to improve the safety of those that are in transit countries. Again, I know we agree on this. I would hope that our rhetoric can settle somewhat and we can have a much more constructive debate. I will just return very quickly to the bill, which I did speak on initially, so I have actually done better than the previous speaker. Thirty-five pieces of legislation covering the activities of our law enforcement officers on the sea is a little bit silly, to say the least. This bill has been a long time coming. There has been extensive consultation. I commend it to the House.",73
48,Mr MORRISON,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the Maritime Powers Bill and Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill. The purpose of these bills is to set out a common framework to consolidate the powers of our Commonwealth maritime enforcement agencies and their staff. There are a number of key agencies who work in this space and a their operational parameters have historically been set out across a range of different bills that govern and determine their specific powers and responsibilities. These different powers are contained in over 35 separate Commonwealth acts, including four key pieces of legislation: the Migration Act, the Customs Act, the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. The government has said the purpose of these bills before the House today is to attempt to consolidate those powers and draw them all together into one document, one single maritime enforcement law. Yet the rhetoric in these bills about best supporting our front-line officers is, I believe, fundamentally undermined by Labor's actions in recent times, and over the last four years in particular, which speak far louder than the words that are written in these bills. In particular I will note and return to the government's failure just in the course of the past week in how they dealt with the MV Parsifal, which my colleague made reference to. Also, we have a situation where the government is effectively not protecting our borders or enforcing our legal rights on our borders. Instead, it has been operating a water taxi service for some time. The coalition has demonstrated its conviction and belief in secure border protection policies that this government can only hint at. This is a government that lacks the will to deal with this issue, despite the bills before us today and even despite the bills before us last week. The simple fact is they were dragged kicking and screaming to the measures they agreed to last week. If they do not believe in these matters, and over a decade they said they did not, then I do not think Australians can have a high level of trust in their ability to act on these matters the future. In principle, I have serious concerns about unnecessarily rewriting legislation that appears on the face of it to be working. I am also very aware of the dangers of inadvertently creating fresh loopholes that would potentially prevent or inhibit our agencies in their ability to protect Australia's border security. I understand that as part of the process of drafting this legislation Customs, the Department of Defence and the Australian Crime Commission have each been consulted. I understand also that the Acting Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Jones, said on behalf of the Department of Defence and noted in his submission to the committee: The Department strongly supports the above Bills which will simplify on water maritime enforcement operations and streamline training and doctrine development within Defence (Navy). In our view there will also be less likelihood of a misapplication of power with more coherent and comprehensive legislation. In addition, any future amendments will be far less complex as there will be only one Department responsible for the legislation. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority stated: We are satisfied that the proposed changes are not going to cause operational disruption nor curtail the Authority's powers or ability to perform, in cooperation with other agencies … I note, however, that within my own shadow portfolio the department of immigration has not yet made a submission to this process. I am puzzled as to why, given their responsibilities under the Migration Act and the significant implications of this bill for matters that relate to them. I would hope that we get some comment or some input from them on these issues. The Australian Crime Commission said in their submission that they will 'continue to in have access to maritime powers as outlined in the powers bill' and that there was no change to the Australian Crime Commission's access to these powers. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service stated: As Australia's primary civil maritime law enforcement agency, Customs and Border Protection has been heavily involved in the development of both these Bills. I hope they are right. It is for the government to guarantee that they are right and that these bills will not create unintended consequences that restrict the options available to our sovereign government to protect our borders-in particular to deter illegal entryor otherwise impede the ability of our agencies to do their job, whether it be managing and responding to the threat of people smuggling or illegal movements of people or goods across our borders. I make specific reference to the phrase 'illegal entry', because there still seems to be some confusion about what this means. I will refer to the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. Article 3 states the following: (a) ""Smuggling of migrants"" shall mean the procurement, in order to obtain, directly indirectly, a financial or other material benefit, of the illegal entrythe UN's wordof a person into a State Party of which person is not a national or a permanent resident; (b) ""Illegal entry"" shall mean crossing borders without complying with the necessary requirements for legal entry into the receiving State … Article 31 of the Refugee convention also makes specific reference to 'illegal entry', the UN's term to describe the nature of a person's arrival in a country, regardless of whether they at some time might make an asylum claim or indeed prove to be a refugee. It is not illegal to make a claim for asylum. The coalition has never said that. That is not in dispute. It never has been. But, if you cross our borders without complying with the necessary requirements for legal entry into the receiving state, that is an illegal entry and we will refer to it as such. We will not be intimidated by those who would seek to have us do otherwise. Your claim does not change the nature of your arrival. People arrive in this country legally and illegally. In the former case we have a greater capacity to control and decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. This remains our policy. This is coalition policy-always has been. We believe in it and we can be trusted to act on it, unlike those who sit opposite. The bill sets out a system of authorisations under which a maritime officer can exercise enforcement powers in relation to vessels, aircraft, installations, protected land areas and persons. The government has said these bills are not proposing new powers. Rather, the powers contained in the bills are based predominantly on powers that are currently available to and exercised by the agencies that operate in these areas. The bill does not or seem on the face of it to propose changes to operational roles or responsibilities, nor does it appear to be reprioritising or reallocating funding. the Where existing powers overlap, these bills are said to remove duplication. However, we are talking about consolidating a very diverse range of laws, and further scrutiny is essential to ensure there are no unintended consequences arising from this attempt at simplification. The legislation has been referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs and is also before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who are due to hand down their report later this month. The coalition are not opposing these bills at present; however, we await the Senate committee report with great interest in the clarification and further details that this, hopefully, will provide. Of particular concern to me is the language surrounding the burden of responsibility for maritime officials working in situations where Australia's nonrefoulement obligations may come into play, which was referred to by my colleague. Of particular concern to me is that these obligations are outlined in the Maritime Powers Bill explanatory memorandum. It states in relation to proposed section 72(4): … that a maritime officer may detain a person and take the person, or cause the person to be taken to a place in or outside the migration zone, including a place outside Australia. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that in relation to circumstances where these obligations may be triggered: … in order to ensure that a maritime officer who has detained a person aboard a vessel acts in accordance with Australia's non-refoulement obligations, procedures relating to the consideration of refoulement risks would need to be in place. It is important we have a clear understanding of what these obligations presently are and that in this bill we are not seeking to add to these obligations, particularly on the high seas or in our contiguous zone. The Guidelines on the Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea, published by the International Maritime Organization, which also bears the logo of the UNHCR, following amendments to the SOLAS and SAR conventions, are explicit in stating:  Any operations and procedures such as screening and status assessment of rescued persons that go beyond rendering assistance to persons in distress should notshould not be allowed to hinder the provision of such assistance or unduly delay disembarkation … of survivors from the assisting ships. The government needs to ensure this bill does not create more difficulties or seek to add or further condition the action of maritime officers as they try to do their jobs, including the interception of illegal boats both inside and out of Australia's territorial waters. In addition, the Houston report found that turning boats back-because this is what it predominantly relates to-'can be operationally achieved and can constitute an effective disincentive'. I note that page 126 of that report states: The following principles for implementing turnbacks are based on international and domestic legal considerations, as well as diplomatic and operational considerations:  The State to which the vessel is to be returned would need to consent to such a return. One thing those opposite fail to acknowledge is that the report notes that this consent may be provided by acquiescence. 'Acquiescence' is a very specific term which those opposite would be familiar with, and the drafters of the Houston report were very careful to make sure they put that term in there. This is exactly as occurred when the policies of turning back boats were implemented on the last occasion by the Howard government. It also does not make reference to the situation where an Indonesian flagged vessel re-enters or enters Indonesian waters under its own steam carrying passengers returning to Indonesia or situations of search and rescue where a boat is in distress. The second condition was:  Turning around a vessel outside Australia's territorial sea or contiguous zone … or ‘steaming' a vessel intercepted and turned around in Australia's territorial sea or contiguous zone back through international waters could only be done under international law with the approval of the State in which the vessel is registered (the ‘flag State'). These provisions, I note, are set out in article 8, paragraph 2 of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. This does not address the situation of a flagless vessel, though-which is how the majority of cases first present at sea-and provide legal basis for interception. Paragraph 7 of that same protocol states: A State Party that has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea and is without nationality or may be assimilated to a vessel without nationality may board and search the vessel. If evidence confirming the suspicion is found, that State Party shall take appropriate measures in accordance with relevant domestic and international law. Thirdly, the Houston report states:  A decision to turn around a vessel would need to be made in accordance with Australian domestic law and international law, including non-refoulement obligations, and consider any legal responsibility Australia or operational personnel would have for the consequences to the individuals on board any vessel that was to be turned around. There is certainly no clear legal obligation arising from Australia's signatory status to the refugee convention under article 33 which would prevent them doing this in extraterritorial waters. The US Supreme Court held in Sale v Haitian Centers Council that the US Coast Guard's high seas interception and return of Haitian asylum seekers did not contravene article 33. This argument is strengthened by the position that nonrefoulement has increasingly become an established principle of international law. In addition, Indonesia are a signatory to numerous other conventions that also deal with nonrefoulement, including the convention against torture. They are also signatories to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The fourth criterion set out by the Houston panel is:  Turning around a vessel would need to be conducted consistently with Australia's obligations under the SOLAS Convention, particularly in relation to those on board the vessel, mindful also of the safety of those Australian officials or Defence Force personnel involved in any such operation. The Guidelines on the Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea, which I referred to earlier, state that the government responsible for the search-and-rescue region in which survivors were recovered is responsible for providing a place of safety or ensuring that such a place of safety is provided. The safety of Defence Force personnel is managed by the chain of command, which has always been the coalition's policy. On this last point, we have the situation now where vessels in distress are being rescued by what has become a water taxi service which has every legal right to return people to the closest place of practicable safety, but it is not doing so under this government. So we have had this situation where the distress calls are now forcing a water taxi service to take asylum seekers who are forcing their claims on the Australian continent by going down that path. As my colleague mentioned prior to me, we have also had the situation now, with the Parsifal, where they are using intimidation through threats to their own safety and, potentially, later, to the crew themselves to force the hand of these vessels. We have a clear difference in attitude here between the government and the coalition. The government has been dragged kicking customary and screaming to deal with these issues of enforcing our rights and our sovereignty at sea on our borders. The coalition has always believed in it. We believe we need strong laws and we also believe we need a government that is prepared to use those strong laws and use every option available to it to protect our borders. This government does not have that track record and it does not have the trust of the Australian people.",73
49,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES," Regrettably I find, as I get towards the end of my parliamentary career, that I am getting a bit thin skinned and I am easily provoked into debates. But on this occasion it is not the member for Cook who has provoked me. Whilst I disagree with much of what he said today in his 15-minute contribution, and although there were some slight digressions into emotive language-and they were slight-it is not he who has provoked me on this occasion. The member for Stirling, in talking about the Parsifal, infuriated me, because the attitude of those opposite is in contrast to attitude of the coalition when they were in government and were dealing with the sister ship of the Parsifal, the Tampa. Consistency about the application of international maritime law is much of what the member for Stirling talked about before, finally getting around to the legislation after 21 minutes. The honourable member for Cook, in talking about refoulement, was of course talking about the same sections of the principal bill, the Maritime Powers Bill 2012, that we are debating today. I do not mind if we are going to have debates around those issues. In fact, I am very pleased that this case these pieces of legislation were, I think, brought in before the requirement for compatibility statements about human rights issues came in and that the parliament is discussing them. It might be that we have different conclusions about that issue, but it is appropriate that the parliament look at it. Let's go back to the start of the slippery slope on these issues. It started 11 years ago, in August 2001, when a vessel sinking in waters that I think were under Indonesian search-and-rescue responsibility put out a distress call, and a merchant ship, the MV Tampa, went to its aid. Having taken aboard the 400-plus asylum seekers that were on board the distressed ship, the captain of the MV Tampa then decided that the most appropriate place for him to take them was the closest land point, that being Christmas Island-a decision that, clearly, he could legitimately make under his understanding of the application of international maritime law. And what happened? He was refused permission to land. Then, with a policy written on the back of a postage stamp, Nauru was finally found as a solution. We have heard over the last couple of weeks about the brilliance of the then ministers in charge-the brilliance of the them discovering Nauru as the solution to a problem that they believed they had. Yet, if you go through writings about these decisions since that time, you see people like the then foreign minister, Alexander Downer, admitting that there was no great science to the fact that they picked Nauru; it just happened to come into their heads. They decided it was an island that they could take them to-out of sight, out of mind. Yet, on this legislation, in contrast to the way in which the coalition clearly admit they made these decisions without consultation, without talking about the people that they had to put in them in place, at least the member for Cook had the decency to put on the record the comments of several government agencies, from Navy through to Customs, who were all part of the way in which we put in place these pieces of legislation-agreeing that their comments had been considered and that they accepted the consolidation in this law of all the regulations and law that preceded it. But, regrettably, the member for Cook on the substantive issues goes on to say: 'We can't be sure. Somehow the government has fiddled with it,' or something like that. Well, I am sorry; executive government is about that. It is the ministers down there in the south wing actually working with their departments. Fortunately, on the public record, it would appear that all the agencies involved in this maritime powers legislation, coming from all the different silos of government, came together. There is no evidence that this has been only one agency imposing on others. This is a whole-ofgovernment approach. This is something that should be celebrated. As a parliamentarian, I am happy for the Senate committee to have a look at it. I am happy for them to look at the things that have been raised by the two opposition frontbenchers in this debate. But do not use the fact that they are proposing that we look at these things as a criticism that the system has failed. That is the proper way that the parliament should look at proposals put by executive government. I am confident that they will stack up. Even if they do not stand up, if they are properly reacted to, that is appropriate, and it is not something such that we should come in here, mealy mouthed, deciding that we are going to score points on every issue. If, indeed, people last week on the vessel Parsifal acted illegally in threatening the master of the vessel, then let this parliament allow the appropriate investigations to go on and the appropriate action to take place. But that does not change the fact that government, from time to time, has to make decisions about destinations in these circumstances, because-I keep going back to this-that is exactly what an Australian government did in the case of the Tampa. It just happens that the coalition, now in opposition, forget that. The fact is that this legislation is an attempt to give certainty to all those agencies that will have to make pretty hard decisions, in real time, out in dangerous situations. It is appropriate that we look at these pieces of legislation in that manner. When last week's debate is raised, I want those that sit opposite to think about their contributions to that debate. Their contributions fell for the mistake of a party that goes out of government at a point in time and then thinks that the world does not change from that point in time-that their policies at that point in time are then always contemporary. There is a failure to look at the situation in a contemporary manner and then to develop, modify or tweak policies so that they suit the situation five years on, in 2012. But there was one significant contribution-it was to do with issues that are raised in these pieces of legislation on maritime powers-from a member opposite: the member for Kooyong. The member for Kooyong actually mentioned regional cooperation. That was pretty good. What was the Houston committee on about? The context-the whole package-includes regional cooperation in the processing of asylum seekers. I disagree with the member for Kooyong in his analysis that this government has not pursued regional cooperation with appropriate vigour. I think he is wrong on that point. But he was the only one that reminded the House, as I have on other occasions, that regional cooperation under the Bali process commenced with the coalition government. It was one of their better moves. But it does not suit their political narrative, because suddenly regional cooperation with countries like Indonesia, Malaysia or any of the 40-plus countries that are in the Bali process somehow would not be hairy chested enough. It would not show them as being tough. It would show them as being sensible. It would show them as understanding that this is an issue that will not go away-that this is an issue where our response has to range from dealing with the misery of those who have died at sea through to dealing with those who have proceeded in a measured way through the assessment of their claims for refuge as international asylum seekers. That is the breadth of the issues that confront us. As I said, I was happy that the member for Cook was measured. I disagree with the emphasis that he places on the word 'illegal'. He made a response to issues raised by the member for Parramatta in this debate. I believe that it was appropriate that the member for Parramatta raised those issues. But let's look at the Houston report. Againit is applicable to these pieces of legislation-they talked about IMAs, illegal maritime arrivals. We have to have a language when we are dealing with these things; it would be better if we kept it simple and understandable. So we have IMAs and we have SIEVs, suspected illegal entry vessels-I think I have that right-and that has become part of our nomenclature. Those terms can be interpreted by those that feel that they are at the compassionate, progressive end of the spectrum in the debate as being nasty, pejorative terms. Hardliners say, 'That is really what they are,' and make an interpretation that it is all about the 'illegal'. But, significantly, the member for Cook agreed that the people on those vessels, even if the vessels are called SIEVs and the people are called IMAs, have every right under the international agreements that this government has entered into-I understand that the whole of the parliament agrees that we are participants in those agreements and agrees that we should participate in them to the fullest-to seek asylum. Why is it that once the people get to that point we cannot simply talk about them as 'asylum seekers', which, at that point in time, they are? There is not emotion in that; it is a simple statement of fact. At that time, as the member for Cook acknowledged, they have a legal right to seek asylum. It may be that down the track, when it has been decided that they are not refugees, they return to being 'illegal', but that is a different matter. In the debate, where there is emotion, we place great value-great weight-on these terms. And that does not help the debate in this place. I know that I should not be so thin skinned. I know that I should not be provoked, but, if we are going to have these debates, we should talk about the couple of decades of these issues. Let us celebrate that a government is trying to bring all the agencies together so that they understand what each is doing and what is expected of them and that we are all working in the national interest. It disappoints me that from time to time the debates in this place are not conducted in the national interest.",77
50,Mr HAWKE,COMMITTEES," It is a privilege to follow the member for Cook and the member for Stirling on the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012. It has been interesting listening to the debate from members opposite on these bills, on 'I' for maritime powers in the context of the MV Parsifal and on what has been happening in recent weeks on the government's border protection measures. It almost feels as though the member for Parramatta and the member for Scullin really do have an issue to take up-an issue with their own government. The people they really hold concern for are the people running the country, and the proposals they disagree with are their own government's proposals. If ever you wanted an example of the contortions of this government in relation to border protection and maritime powers, this issue really has revealed it here today, in this chamber. The debate has seen the member for Parramatta lament what has happened with MV Parsifal, not the fact that some illegal activity may have occurred but that we as an opposition are pointing out that the government has met this serious situation with absolute weakness. Yes, as the member for Scullin said, I am a hardliner on border protection. I make no apologies for it. I make no apologies for it, because it saves lives, saves money and it produces a better result for Australians-for Australian taxpayers and for people seeking asylum in Australia today. It is better to be tough on border protection, and I am a strong advocate for it. I have stood in this place before and said, 'It's okay to be soft and humanitarian on border protection,' as well-as the Greens have. I do not agree with the member for Melbourne, but he is principled. What I do accuse the government of is straddling both sides of the fence and achieving absolutely nothing. In fact, the member for Scullin said that you have to look at things the way they are, not the way you want them to be. You have to accept that time has moved on. We have accepted that time has moved on. We have noted that it is not the same as 2007, when you had a highly successful, strong government with the strength of conviction and will to run a border protection system and which had clear definitions of maritime powers. What we have had since 2007 is the unravelling of border protection measure after border protection measure. It is a change in the circumstance brought about by this government, bit by bit, until we got the point this year where we had to-and were forced to as a parliament-return to the system that produced the best results. It was not with an acknowledgement from the government of, 'Gee, we got that wrong all along; oh, my gosh, that was a terrible thing.' It was to somehow stand here, as the member for Parramatta did, and say, 'Look, I don't like the word ""illegal"".' Contrast here that very emotive speech, and that the word 'illegal' is somehow unpalatable for this parliament, with the factual presentation of the member for Cook. He quoted sections of the refugee conventions referring to illegal entries, specifying what an illegal entry represents. it Let us name it for what it is. If people come here illegally they should be named as coming here illegally. The government worries about the semantics and the language: 'Oh, gee, don't say that; that's a bit nasty. Oh, my gosh, you're too tough.' These are the contortions that we see inside this government that produces bad policy. Bad policy costs people's lives. Bad policy costs money. Bad policy has serious consequences. The member for Scullin said, 'Why are we raising issues with these bills before us today?' Well, I am suspicious of the government's motives in presenting the Maritime Powers Bill 2012. I am concerned about the detail. The detail matters. The government has failed in getting the details right in so many pieces of legislation before this chamber in recent times. Each member is right to get up here and raise concerns. What concerns have we raised? The member for Cook and the member for Stirling have eloquently expressed our concerns with refoulement. We have referred the bill to the relevant Senate committee to consider it. We are suspicious about why we have a bill to consolidating maritime powers appearing at the same time that we have a demonstration of weakness in relation to the MV Parsifal. We know that the merchant ship MV Parsifal rescued a boatload of asylum seekers and was then subjected to threats of violence and intimidation from the asylum seekers it had rescued. We know that the captain had become concerned for the safety of his crew. Even though he had determined under the relevant provisions of rescues at sea that Singapore was the relevant port to take the ship to, because of the concernsbecause of the dramas created by those he had rescued-he had to return to Australia. I found the member for Stirling's points in relation to this very important. Where does this end? Why is the government consolidating maritime powers consequential amendments on this when we have no comprehensive way of addressing what occurred? When are boats considered to be doing the right thing or the wrong thing? When are the people on board those boats, the asylum seekers-threatening the safety of crew-considered to be doing the right thing or the wrong thing? The member for Parramatta seemed to think, 'Don't you dare raise what people do on these boats; they have a right to do it.' I do not believe that principle can be extended to what is going on in our seas and in our border protection system. People do have a responsibility to behave humanely, especially when the ship's captain is rescuing them from distress, as he is obliged to, and I do not believe it is then right for anybody to turn around and engage in illegal behaviour. For the member for Parramatta to suggest, 'Well, they're desperate; if I were in that situation I could see myself acting in a way that would be different from the way we act here,' I do not think is a powerful or persuasive argument. In fact, I find it to be an argument for a stronger system and stronger legislation. The opposition has a concern that this bill is being raised to make it look like the government are doing something. They see bills that they pass through this parliament as action. The Leader of the House is fond of saying that they have passed this many bills or that many bills-as if more laws are better, or the more numerous the laws the better our society is governed. But the quality of the bill, the quality of what is in is absolutely paramount. It is not simply the case that the more bills you pass the better it is. Consolidating the framework for the exercise of the Commonwealth's maritime enforcement powers could be seen as a good and objective. The consolidation of bills and frameworks is something that generally I support. However, there has to be an examination of what the government is proposing here and whether anybody's obligations under the bills will change. The Customs Act 1901, the Migration Act 1958, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 all need to be examined in the context of what is going on. We do not want the government to make a mistake or have unintended consequences from a consolidation bill at a time when this is such a grave concern. I have risen in this place before to express my very serious concerns with the government's management of our borders. The Maritime Powers Bill gives us another opportunity to highlight what is going on in the government's failure to protect our borders. The member for Cook made another valid point: the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has not yet made a submission to the relevant House committee or Senate committee to which the bill was referred. The Australian Crime Commission's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill made a point of noting how difficult it is to manage Australia's long and vulnerable coastlines. I would simply add that, as a member for a Sydney electorate which has recently been subjected to an increased range of shooting crimes and gun crimes, I accept the member for Stirling's points that cuts to border it, protection and cuts to Customs screening of vessels have led to bad outcomes, especially for the people of Sydney who are the victims of more illegal gun crime. It is counterintuitive for the government to be talking about maritime powers when they have been making cuts to Customs and border protection screening on our nation's borders to the tune of $58.1 million, when greater volumes of cargo are hitting our borders every single day. When the Howard government left office, 60 per cent of air cargo consignments were being inspected, which Labor has cut by about three-quarters, meaning that there is a greater chance of illicit goods being shipped into Australia. I think this has had a real impact in the Sydney basin. Sea cargo inspections have been reduced by 25 per cent at a time when the Australian Crime Commission, in its submission, openly acknowledged that organised criminal gangs are taking advantage of the lax conditions at wharfs and exploiting weaknesses in the system. I do not intend to go much further into bill, other than to say that the member for Parramatta and the member for Scullin really have issues with their own government and their own government's policy. It is to that government they should turn with their concerns. If they have concerns about the word 'illegal' they should really look at the sections of the refugee conventions that the member for Cook raised to understand that people are entering Australia illegally, that the people smugglers are running an illegal operation, that removing documents or paying money to people smugglers is acting illegally and that people threatening the captain of a ship in order to turn around and move to another port are acting illegally. I make no apology for being tough on such people who are acting illegally. Of course people have the right to seek asylum in Australia and of course there are circumstances where that might happen, but we must devise a system which is strong on border protection so that people do not make a risky journey and so that we do not have the incidents at sea like the MV Parsifal. For government members to stand here in this House today and lament the situation on behalf of people who may well be acting inappropriately or illegally on these boats I think is unacceptable.",80
51,Ms KING,COMMITTEES,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing) (13:33): I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate. The Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 provide a simpler approach to maritime enforcement through streamlining the operational framework of our on-water enforcement agencies. The maritime domain poses particular challenges to the effective enforcement of laws. Enforcement operations in maritime this areas frequently occur in remote locations, isolated from the support normally available to land based operations and constrained by the practicalities of sea based work. Under the current legislative framework, operational agencies use powers contained in at least 35 separate Commonwealth acts. This structure is inefficient and can lead to operational difficulties for the primary onwater enforcement agencies. The Maritime Powers Bill provides a smarter and simpler approach to maritime enforcement through a single maritime enforcement law. This single role consolidates and harmonises the Commonwealth's existing maritime enforcement regime. The powers contained in this bill are modelled on powers currently available to operational agencies. The bill establishes a system of authorisations under which a maritime officer may exercise enforcement powers in the maritime domain. In addition to providing the necessary operational flexibility, this system of authorisations includes a range of safeguards to make sure maritime enforcement powers are authorised and exercised appropriately and for a proper purpose. The key safeguard is the requirement for the exercise of powers to be authorised on specific grounds by a senior maritime officer or a member of the Australian Federal Police. This provides clarity around who must make decisions to take enforcement action and ensures appropriate oversight in the exercise of powers. The types of authorisations available under the bill will cover a wide range of enforcement situations which arise in the maritime environment including fishing, Customs and migration matters. Enforcement powers under the bill will be exercised by officers of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Federal Police and other persons appointed to conduct enforcement and monitoring activities in the maritime environment. The Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill repeals maritime enforcement powers in a number of other acts where they overlap the powers in the Maritime Powers Bill. I want to turn to some of the specific comments raised in the debate. The member for Stirling's statements about cuts to Customs are, frankly, pretty rich coming from a party that needs to make $70 billion worth of cuts and plans to sack 12,000 public servants if it wins the next election. The shadow Treasurer said earlier this year, 'For a start, 12,000 public servants in Canberra will be made redundant over a two-year period immediately upon us being elected.' The shadow minister has also refused to rule out cuts to Customs. When he was quizzed about this",83
52,Mr Robert,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: relevance. The parliamentary secretary is wrapping up a on maritime issues. How that strays into comments made by a shadow minister prior to the last election is simply beyond the House.",84
53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," I thank the member for Fadden. The parliamentary secretary has the call and she will be, as she would understand, relevant to the bill that she is summing up.",84
54,Ms KING,COMMITTEES,"As the member for Stirling raised the issues of cuts to Customs, I am being relevant to the bill and to the debate. When quizzed, the shadow minister said it was impossible for him to give any guarantee around that, so to attack the government on cuts in this debate is fairly rich. In fact, we have spent more than $1 billion a year on Customs and Border Protection, and it is getting results. Last year we seized more heroin, cocaine and amphetamines than ever before. Earlier this month we seized half a billion dollars worth of illegal drugs-the largest seizure of ice in Australian history and the third-largest heroin seizure. That is more than we often seize in an entire year. The amount of drugs and illicit materials we seize in air cargo has more than doubled since we came to office, and that is because we are investing in intelligence. It is important. Ask any expert in the field and they will tell you that intelligence is the key to catching crooks and seizing drugs and guns. We are investing in intelligence, and we ask the opposition to do the same. Some of the members who have spoken, particularly the member for Cook, have raised concerns about the operation of various powers under the bill. I remind those members that this bill does not enlarge or reduce any such powers. The bill, importantly, harmonises existing provisions across a range of laws to provide a smarter and simpler approach to maritime bill enforcement. The explanatory memorandum raises matters regarding the implementation of Australia's obligations with respect to nonrefoulement and under a range of international legal instruments. The issues exist in relation to current legislative powers and will continue to exist in relation to the legislation as harmonised in this bill. The member for Cook also queried whether the government has fully engaged with the relevant stakeholders. I assure the member that, over the several years during which the harmonisation process has been carefully undertaken, all departments have been fully engaged. The members opposite also seem keen to use this bill to debate the question of asylum seekers and the recent expert panel report. I remind members that this bill is not directed to those matters. This bill is an important regulatory step to simplify and harmonise on-water enforcement operations. In conclusion, the Australian government is committed to ensuring that Australia's laws are effectively monitored and enforced in the maritime domain. The unique aspects of the maritime environment merit a tailored approach to maritime powers. These bills ensure flexibility in the exercise of these powers, allowing maritime officers to deal with quickly changing circumstances in often difficult and dangerous situations. These bills will streamline and modernise Australia's legal framework for maritime enforcement and thereby support the hard working Australians who work on our behalf to uphold Australia's maritime laws. These reforms are just one aspect of the government's work to provide Australia with a modern legal framework. I table a revised explanatory memorandum and commend these bills to the House.

Question agreed to. NA Winnaleah Irrigation Scheme Augmentation",85
57,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I recently had the pleasure of representing the federal government at the opening of the $10 million Winnaleah Irrigation Scheme Augmentation, the fourth in a suite of projects completed under the Australian government's $140 million commitment to support the development of modern and efficient irrigation schemes in Tasmania after 11 years of neglect by the Liberal government. The augmentation of the scheme not only will help secure a long-term sustainable future for Tasmanian irrigation communities but will lend greater certainty to investment and productivity in local communities. It will supply an increased volume of reliable irrigation water, which in turn will provide the opportunity for greater production and more jobs in the region. The Australian government provided funding of more than $4 million for this project, which demonstrates government's commitment to investing in efficient and ecologically sustainable irrigation in Tasmania and helping Tasmanian irrigators produce some of the best food in the world. Projects like this one are assisting Tasmania to ensure that water resources within its irrigation sector are used in a sustainable and efficient manner whilst facilitating water reform actions under the National Water Initiative. I would like to again congratulate everyone who was involved in this project, from start to finish. I look forward to seeing it boost the productive capacity of irrigators in this region. Fisheries",85
58,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to highlight the plight of the Australian seafood industry, which is set to become the latest victim of this inept Labor government and its desperation to remain in power through yet another dodgy deal with the extreme Greens. Yesterday I attended a rally in the Brisbane seaside suburb of Shorncliffe attended by more than 150 people concerned about Labor's lockout of 1.5 million square kilometres of fishing zones. We do not need to lock up our oceans to protect them, and Minister Burke would have known that if this proposal had been based on real science as opposed to political science. This proposed lockout has been undertaken with stealth and unholy haste. The government have not undertaken a proper study or analysis of the economic impacts of the lockout on the fishing industry supply chain, and as a result they seemingly do not know that a $4.35 billion impact and a loss of 36,000 jobs will result. What is more alarming is that they just do not care. Minister Burke continues to falsely claim that the lockout will only impact on one to two per cent of the industry-but this is what the you would expect from a minister who not only does not do his homework but does not want to do his homework either. No form of fishing as currently managed in the Coral Sea has been demonstrated to be a threat to biodiversity. Not only is the management of Australia's fishing zones of world-leading standard but also it continues to improve. We can thank the coalition and the Australian seafood industry for that. Organ Donation",86
59,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am incredibly proud of corporate Canberra for its recent efforts in promoting organ donor awareness. A firm in my electorate, KazarSlaven, take their social conscience seriously. Led by Henry Kazar and Michael Slaven, they have become a friend of DonateLife and take every opportunity to promote a cause that is close to my heart. Lyndell Kazar manages their community activism and organised a regional team to participate in this year's City to Surf in Sydney. These are people who have nothing to do with organ donation-they are neither recipients nor donors. Like me, they are touched by the many stories of people dying on waiting lists. The team was 50 strong and came from corporate Canberra and Goulburn. Their camaraderie was strongthey wore shirts with the DonateLife logo on them-and their bond was cemented on the bus trip to Sydney. They had a team dinner where one of Canberra's organ donor advocates encouraged them not to sample the tastes of the big smoke but to get to bed early. The message was heeded. This is the third year our regional team has participated and many personal bests were achieved; in particular, Dan del Rio completed the course in 65 minutes. Times were not the purpose, however. It was about people on the route having a conversation about organ and tissue donation. Many of the 80,000 participants noticed this team and commented on their commitment to organ donation. I thank these foot soldiers and others to get involved in ensuring that all Australians have had the conversation with their loved ones. Mulholland, Gunner Jack Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:48): It is with regret that I rise today to advise the House of passing of Gunner Jack Mulholland, who sadly passed away over the weekend aged 92. Jack was one of the last surviving Darwin defenders. Jack manned an anti-aircraft gun during the bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942. I am pleased that the parliament at my request through a private member's motion acknowledged the bombing of Darwin as a day of significance. I am pleased that Jack was able to participate in the commemorations earlier this year of the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. It is astounding that it is 70 years only now Australians are learning about the bombing of Darwin. I am amazed at how many people are not aware of what occurred back in 1942-it certainly was never taught in schools. It is only through people like Jack that the story of the bombing of Darwin was shared. In fact, it was while Jack was sharing one of his stories that I first met him, at the Darwin Military Museum-a place very dear to him, and something else Jack fought for. From all accounts Jack was one of the key people to ensure that the Darwin Military Museum remained at its current location despite the Northern Territory government wanting to relocate the museum in town. Rest in peace, Jack-you will never be forgotten. Thank you on behalf of a grateful nation for your efforts in protecting Australia. Robertson Electorate: Excellence in Business Awards",86
60,Ms ONEILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to acknowledge and celebrate the Central urge Coast Business Excellence Awards 2012, which were held in my electorate, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, last Saturday night. I want to acknowledge Coast Star Motors and Central Coast Business Review as significant sponsors for this event and a number of other significant partners in our community-New South Wales Trade and Investment, Wyong Shire Council, Bendigo Bank, Print National, Display Power, SV Partners, Apex Insurance Brokers, TAFE, University of Newcastle, Complete Staff Solutions, Gosford City Council and Graphic by Design. The talent in business acumen on the Central Coast needs to be acknowledged, and I want particularly to name some of the winners: Treehouse Creative; Baltimore Aircoil Australia; Close Financial Group; Naomi Taylor from the Mingara-Indigo Bar; on and Wyong Regional Chamber of Commerce; Independent Portable Buildings, who were the winners of the overall business prize; Ebis Print and Webstuff.biz; Jason van Genderen and Treehouse Creative, who won another award; ING Direct; Bub's Customs, Trehy Ingold Neate; Independent Portable Buildings; and Lake Haven Shopping Centre. In the categories of sustainability I particularly want to acknowledge Baltimore Aircoil Australia, whose business is growing on the back of the carbon price, which is bringing about massive change in refrigeration. (Time expired) Aged Care Reform",87
61,Mr CHESTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to highlight huge concerns in the agedcare sector about this government's so-called reform package. I have had the opportunity to meet with aged-care providers in my electorate, and to say they are alarmed about the future viability of their critically important services is an understatement. Aged and Community Care Victoria released a statement in June this year titled 'Gillard government slashes aged care funding', which states: … CEO Kate Hough said the industry was shocked to learn that the high-profile budget announcement of a $50 million redirection for the next financial year resulted in a real reduction in funding of over $500 million. Modelling by providers has consistently shown that subsidy income will be substantially reduced-a cut of between five and 10 per cent for every provider. The statement quotes Ms Hough as saying: As a result of this new model, residents with exactly the same care needs in the same facility could be entitled to different levels of funding. The board of the Sale Elderly Citizens Village has written to me to express similar concerns. They said: Someone needs to speak up for the Aged and the Facilities that provide these people with the love, care and attention they both need and deserve. This impacts on us not only by the new charges for electricity, gas, rising insurance costs, the EBA which is being negotiated at present, carbon tax etc but there will be such a differential between Residents that are in our facility now versus the ones that will come in after the July 1 st. I urge the minister and the Prime Minister to stop hiding behind the spin and actually start delivering better services for older Australians. International Development Assistance",88
62,Ms HALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I received a letter from Pastor Louise Shanks from the Lakes Baptist Church at Gorokan. They are involved in a program with TEAR Australia, where TEAR stands for transformation, empowerment, advocacy and relief. It is about contributing to aid and development. A weekend conference was recently held for 70-plus children. Pastor Shanks said she went there to educate the children but found she was educated and challenged by them. I will share some of the messages sent to me by children who attended. One message, from Mckayla, said, 'Please can you help the poor children and families in the world.' Another one, from Stephanie, said: 'Stop and think of the poor. Please think of the very desperate in need. Enough is enough. Ragpickers and the poor-they need your help. Yes, you can help.' There are many such inspiring letters from these young people, who have a very strong social conscience. Ella, who is aged nine, wrote, 'Dear politician, please remember to help the poor people in need.' I call on all members of this parliament to support those young people at the Gorokan church and to join together and support the poor of the world. Brisbane Ekka Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:52): For 10 days every August, the country meets the city at the Brisbane Ekka. Each year, Scouts Queensland, based in Auchenflower in my new electorate of Ryan, participate in the Ekka's fruit display competition. The fruit display is one of the most popular events at the Ekka with entrants from right across the state. I recently met with Scouts Queensland, and they explained the process of putting together a winning fruit display. The display takes about four months to put togetherfrom design concept to the final day of the Ekka. Each piece of fruit is painstakingly checked for blemishes and bruises. Last year's display used just over 1½ tonnes of fruit. Once the fruit arrives at the RNA Showgrounds, a group of 10 people spend almost two days placing the fruit on the display. At the end of the Ekka, the fruit that is not sold is donated to Foodbank Queensland for distribution through their network of charities. Judging of the fruit display took place last Thursday week, and I am pleased to announce that Scouts Queensland took out second place in this year's competition. I congratulate the scouts on their hard work and wish them well in future competitions. I take this opportunity to congratulate Brendan Christou and all the councillors at the RNA for an outstanding show this year. In particular, I did enjoy the woodchopping  Shenstone as MCs, and the junior fashion competition, in which Kenmore State High School had several entrants and winners. All in all, it was a great show for all of Brisbane. Petition: Public Holidays Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (13:56): I present to the House a petition on public holidays which has been approved by the Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:  Weekend and shift workers are disadvantaged whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a weekend and the public holiday substitutes (is moved) to the following Monday or Tuesday.  When substitution occurs workers rostered to work on the actual special day falling on the weekend don't receive a public holiday whilst workers rostered to work on the substitute day do.  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Some States have legislated for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day to be public holidays when they fall on a weekend plus provide an additional public holiday on the following Monday. or Tuesday.  Weekend and shift workers are also disadvantaged because Good Friday, Easter Saturday (in most states) and Easter Monday are public holidays but Easter Sunday (except in NSW) is not. (The NSW Parliament unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday.)  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Parliament should legislate a uniform standard across Australia. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act to include: 1. An additional public holiday (not a substitute day) on the following Monday and/or Tuesday whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day fall on a weekend. 2. Easter Sunday as a public holiday. from 39 citizens Petition received. Mr KELVIN THOMSON: The petition is signed by 39 petitioners. The principal petitioner is Michael Donovan from the Victorian branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association. It asks the House to amend the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act to include an additional public holiday, not a substitute day, on the following Monday or Tuesday whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a weekend and to include Easter Sunday as a public holiday. The petitioners have drawn the attention of the House to the fact that weekend workers and shiftworkers are disadvantaged whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a weekend and the public holiday substitute is moved to the following Monday or Tuesday. When that substitution occurs, workers rostered to work on the actual day falling on the weekend do not receive a public holiday whilst workers rostered to work on the substitute day do. This is unfair to weekend workers and shiftworkers. Some states have legislated for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day to be public holidays when they fall on a weekend as well as for an additional public holiday on the following Monday or Tuesday. Similarly there are difficulties relating to Easter Sunday, and the petitioner asks parliament to legislate a uniform standard across Australia. Vietnam Veterans Day Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (13:57): It was with great pride that I attended the Vietnam Veterans service on Sunday at ANZAC Park in Townsville. The ranks may be thinning and they may be getting a little bit tired, but when the RSM called them to order and to line up in fours, they did so with glee. Some were not able to stand for the entire service. It was a great service and a great time to pause and reflect on what has gone before. These men, who fought for us in Vietnam, probably all went through Townsville on their way to war. We should reflect on the way they were treated when they left-and when they came back. They still bear scars from that. But they should know that the reason we treat current ADF members and their families so well is our memory of the way we treated them-the shabby treatment they received. I recently went to see the 2RAR-the parade to send them overseas. The then Chief of Army stood and spoke for 15 minutes. Nearly 12 minutes of that was addressed to the families of those who were to be deployed-telling them about the services that would be available and how they are included in the effort. In some way the Vietnam veterans have paved the way for that to happen and hopefully, in some part and in some measure, that makes up for the shabby treatment they received. For those guys who still bear the scars, we say, 'Lest we forget.' Youth Services",88
63,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I recently attended Beacon events at schools in my electorate of Bass. Beacon is a not-for-profit organisation aimed at providing brighter and positive futures for our youth. The schools involved in these events in the great electorate of Bass were Brooks High School, the city campus of Kings Meadows High School, Queechy High School and Winnaleah District High School. These young adults make a commitment to further education, training or employment. I commend this program and look forward to this generation making a positive difference for themselves and their communities.",90
64,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Vietnam Veterans Day",90
65,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Last Saturday, 18 August, was Vietnam Veterans Day, and this year, 50 years since Australia's war in Vietnam began, Vietnam Veterans Day is a particularly important day. Eighteen Australians died at Long Tan, but they did not die in defeat. Long Tan stands tall in our memory, and we do not forget. Its anniversary stands for every Australian who served and suffered in Vietnam. We remember them all every 18 August. In 1969, on the third anniversary of that dreadful day, their mates remembered them: many Australians will be familiar with the moving image of bare-chested diggers erecting a cross at the battle site. After the war, the Long Tan cross was removed from the site by the Vietnamese authorities, but they kept it safe. In 1989, in a remarkable gesture of remembrance and reconciliation, the Long Dat District People's Committee erected a replica cross on the original site. This year, we are very grateful to the government of Vietnam for lending the original Long Tan cross to the Australian War Memorial. It is on display there today and, of course, it is a symbol of supreme sacrifice. It is 50 years this year since the fateful decision to send Australian advisers to Vietnam, and it is 25 years since hundreds of thousands of Australians cheered and applauded tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans in the 1987 welcome home parade. It was one of the Hawke government's finest days. I am proud of everything our nation has done in the 25 year since to honour our Vietnam veterans-proud of the haunting and magnificent Australian Vietnam National Memorial on ANZAC Parade right here in Canberra; of the work we have done to enable our veterans to visit the battlefields and places of Vietnam where they fought for us; of the Australian contribution to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC which I opened last year. I am proud of everything the Vietnam generation of veterans is doing now to care for the ageing veterans who served before them, and I am so proud of what the Vietnam generation is doing for the young veterans who are coming home now. They are literally caring for their fathers and caring for their sons. Today we remember them all and thank them for it all. Lest we forget. Honourable members: Lest we forget.",90
66,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I rise to support the words of the Prime Minister. Yes, it is 50 years now since the beginning of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and Saturday was the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, the largest single engagement involving Australians, a remarkable engagement where 100 members of the Australian Army defeated at least 2,000 Vietcong and North Vietnamese regular army personnel. It was a great victory. It was obviously a tragic day, though, and it is right that we remember the service and sacrifice of all who fought in that conflict. We remember those killed and wounded in action. We also remember all of those who have suffered since as a result of their service. It is good that the Vietnamese government has made available the original Long Tan cross. Obviously, I would urge as many Australians as possible to visit the War Memorial to view the cross as an act of homage to those who fought under our flag in that conflict. Reference to Federation Chamber",91
67,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:04): by leave-I move: That further statements by indulgence in relation to Vietnam Veterans' Day be permitted in the Federation Chamber. Question agreed to. NA,91
68,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business will be absent from question time this week for personal reasons.

The Assistant Treasurer will answer questions in relation small business. NA Budget",92
69,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister guarantee a surplus of at least $1.5 billion this financial year and higher over the forward estimates, as promised in the budget just a few weeks ago?",92
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The government will bring the budget to surplus this financial year, as promised. We will update all of the budget figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, as is appropriate.",92
71,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. How can the Prime Minister promise those surpluses, given her new promises of $2.1 billion on border protection, $10½ billion a year for an NDIS, new spending of $26 billion on schools and $36 billion on submarines? Prime Minister, where is the money coming from?",92
72,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am more than a little amazed to get this question of all questions from the shadow Treasurer, who has admitted-even though he denies it now-that the opposition have a $70 billion costing problem, and their only way of fixing that is to slash health, slash education, slash support to families, because that is what Liberals do. Unlike those opposite, who always have their eyes on slashing health-the Leader of the Opposition has form-and on slashing education-he has talked today about cutting funding to public schools-instead of taking that approach, we will continue to take the responsible approach which people have seen from us to date. As we have worked our to way carefully through the government's budget, we have shown the ability to invest in the new instruments of fairness that Australians want, while bringing the budget to surplus. To give just one example, we found room in the federal government's budget for a billion dollars for the National Disability Insurance Scheme launch site. I take it from the shadow Treasurer's question that the opposition is now out and proud and opposed to the NDIS. Finally, they have come out and done that. We make the hard decisions to get these things done. You sit there with figures that will not add up and secret plans to cut health and education and support for families.",92
73,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a further supplementary question. Will the Prime Minister now rule out the introduction of new taxes or levies or the increase of existing taxes and levies to pay for big new promises in education, NDIS, submarines and border protection?",92
74,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,92

76,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! When the House is silentthe member for Cook promised better behaviour today.,92
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Once again, I am amazed to hear the shadow Treasurer shouting about carbon taxes, given that he is a very big supporter putting a price on carbon, on the recorduntil he decided that for the purposes of appearance he had better pretend to be supporting the Leader of the Opposition. On the way in which we will fund the government's promises, let us be clear. We have a tax-to-GDP ratio which is less than the one we inherited from the other sidethat is, we are a lower taxing government than the government that the shadow Treasurer was a member of, and we will continue to be a lower taxing government. As the shadow Treasurer would be well aware, I have already dealt with these questions about taxes and levies in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That is on the public record and no amount of on a point of order as to direct relevance. The Prime Minister was asked whether she would guarantee ruling out any new taxes or charges to pay for her spending.",92
78,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,93
79,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,93
80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Money for people with disabilities and for schools described as a spending spree-how offensive! The person who was advocating a tax increase for the National Disability Insurance Scheme was Liberal Premier Campbell Newman and, as is a matter of public record, I disagreed with him. As is also a matter of public record, company tax will always be higher under those opposite than under us because of their tax on companies to pay for their paid parental leave scheme. Less tax, less company tax, a prudent budget, a surplus and a better deal for people with disabilities and of better Australian schools- (Time expired) ",93

82,Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask briefly for your indulgence. In 1968, Peter Norman made a bold stand for racial equality, which will be honoured in a motion in the House tonight. His sister Elaine, her husband, Michael, and his 91-year-old mother, Thelma, are with us in the gallery today and I want to acknowledge them being here with us. My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the government's plans to improve all our nation's schools?",93
83,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Fraser for his question. Today I had the opportunity to speak to the Association of Independent Schools and I very much welcomed it. I also had the opportunity to attend in front of Parliament House to meet with public school advocates, principals from public schools and the Australian Education Union. So I have had a morning where I have had an opportunity to speak to great principals from independent schools and from public schools. I have spoken to them about the determination I share with them to improve every school in this country because we want to see a better education for every child in this country. The government's reform agenda for Australian schools is about every child in every school. We have an opportunity now, after the work of the independent review panel on funding, to look at the question of funding for the first time in 40 years, but, as I made very clear when I spoke today to independent school principals and to public school principals, we intend to drive a school improvement agenda because we want every child in every school to have a better education and a better opportunity in life and that is what our economy will require for the future. It is what fairness demands of us. I was very disturbed, in fact I would say angered, by the approach that the Leader of the Opposition has taken to this very important question. He, too, went to address the Independent Schools National Education Forum, and what he told them is that public schools have too much money. Just in case anybody missed the sound bite, he repeated it twice. The Leader of the Opposition thinks public schools have too much money. And, in case anybody thinks it is one of his periodic stumbles, these were prepared and scripted remarks-that public schools have too much money. The opposition are very fond of throwing around allegations about hit lists. Today it has been revealed that every public school in this country is on an opposition hit list slated for a reduction in funding. Every public school in this country is on their hit list and is due for a funding reduction. We should not be surprised when the member for Sturt says he will take one in seven teachers out of classrooms and is quite happy to see increases in class sizes. That is the difference between both sides of politics. We will give every child and every school a better future. On the other side there is the politics of division, and cutbacks for Australian public schools, bigger class sizes and fewer teachers, and no-one over there cares.",93
84,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
85,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Goldstein! Carbon Pricing,94
86,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the letter I have here from Australian Country Choice. It indicates that the company is now paying a carbon charge of an extra 38 per cent for peak electricity and an extra 86 per cent for off-peak electricity. That is an extra $10,400 a week because of the introduction of the carbon tax. Why aren't businesses like this one being compensated for the Prime Minister's broken promise that, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'?",94
87,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, he has had a bit of a morning this morning. He has not only gone out and threatened to cut every public school in this country; he has finally come clean on electricity prices. He has said today that it is true that the carbon tax is not the only factor in the dramatic rise in power prices. It was a and is complete backflip compared with his statement in the run-up to parliament that everything else except carbon pricing was apparently a furphy. So the Leader of the Opposition has finally smacked into the reality that state Liberals do not agree with him, experts do not agree with him, the regulators do not agree with him and members of his own team do not agree with him. He has finally come clean that, yes, the dramatic increases in power prices are not about carbon pricing but are about other actions. So, for the small business",94
88,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The member for Mackellar on a point of order. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: In her wildest dreams that is not directly relevant to the question as asked. The question was directly on the carbon tax,94
89,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting,95
90,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar is warned! Abuse of points of order has gone too far and will not be tolerated. The Prime Minister is answering the question. There were a range of issues canvassed in the question. The Prime Minister has the call.,95
91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And of course the level of abuse is always correlated with their lack of ideas.,95
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,95
93,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will be relevant to the question.,95
94,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that it is the actions of state governments and others-it is factors beyond carbon pricing-that have led to dramatic increases in power prices. To his question and to the business he talks about: presumably he will get that business on the phone and say that he, the Leader of the Opposition, now understands that that businessMr Robb interjecting",95
95,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Goldstein is warned!,95
96,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That business would have seen a 50 per cent increase in their power prices, and it is nothing to do with carbon pricing. Presumably he has explained that to them, now that the penny has dropped. Presumably he would also explain to them that the impact on electricity prices is as the government predicted it. That means that small businesses are in a position to pass those costs through, because they are dealing with consumers who have had the benefit of tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. If the Leader of the Opposition were genuinely concerned about the circumstances of this business, instead of continuing his reckless fear campaign he would be working with the government, now that he has admitted he was wrong in the run-up to parliament and that there are other factors causing the rapid escalation in electricity prices, and would be instructing his state Liberal colleagues to do the same so that they come to December COAG ready to act on electricity prices. That is what he would do if he were interested in anything else except the reckless fear campaign.",95
97,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Leader of the Opposition seeking to table a document?,95
98,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,An 86 per cent increase in power prices entirely as a result of the carbon,95
99,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition needs to follow the rules given by the chair-and the Manager of Opposition Business has indicated that there is no leave to be granted. Education,95
100,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. It follows on from the question posed to the Prime Minister earlier. What approach will the government take and what principles will guide the government's plans to improve Australian schools?",95
101,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smithexactly Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:19): I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Central to this government's values and principles about education is recognising that all Australian students need to get support in the schools they are in, regardless of where they live and regardless of how much money their parents earn. A student can only live a fulfilling life if their education is good, and the country can only have a sustainable productive economy if our education is good for our students. This is smack bang in the middle of what we as a government believe in. Because of the pace of reform you can see that commitment. We have seen more reform in education nationally than we have ever seen in our lifetime, whether it is the national curriculum, national professional standards for teachers, the MySchool website or the investment in modernised facilities in every single school. This is all about investing in the future, and it is absolutely central to this Labor government's vision for Australia. The next step for us is to continue that journey. The findings of the Gonski panel that have been talked about are challenging for us because they show that between 2000 and 2009 our best students fell behind those in neighbouring countries. They also find that there is a persistent gap, sometimes called the equity gap, between our top and bottom student achievers. We are leaving too many young Australians behind. We are committed to delivering a national plan for school improvement that will benefit each and every school. It will focus on teacher quality, on funding and on the needs of students in those schools. We do that on the basis of a record level of investment and the big reforms underway already. I am asked about the principles of education funding. They are our principles. But when I look to the other side of the House all I can see is the persistent, hardwired negativity of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister-$2.8 billion worth of cuts on board. But not only that; there is no willingness at all to engage in this reform. The shadow minister dismissed the Gonski review within half an hour of its release, and then, when it comes to Gonski, I could not help but notice that there are other members on the opposition side who do not seem to have been listening to the Leader of the Opposition, and particularly his speech today. Here we have the member for Bowmanand here is a photograph: 'Andrew Laming gives a Gonski'. At least someone on that side of the House recognises the deficiencies in the approach of the Leader of the Opposition and the delinquency of the member for Sturt in the cavalier, negative approach that they have taken to school funding. We understand that we need reform and investment. We are committed to national school improvement, and we will get on with this job now and in the future.",95
102,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I have a supplementary question. The minister has talked about improving schools across the country. What will this mean for schools and students in my electorate?,96
103,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:23): I thank the member for the supplementary question. By the way, I seek leave to table this photo of Mr Laming giving a Gonski.",96
104,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The minister does not need to seek leave. He can just table the document.,96
105,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In respect of the question that the member has asked me, helike other members in this House-knows what investment this Labor government has provided to his electorate. He has got $103 million of projects that have benefited about 72 of his schools. He has got 9,000 families benefiting from the schoolkids bonus. He has in his electorate schools like Rokewood Primary School, Colac Secondary College, Trinity college and St Brendan's Primary School-all part of the national partnerships. These are the very national partnerships that that Leader of the Opposition, who was speaking after the Prime Minister this morning, actually thinks have received too much money. We should pause and think about that for a moment. We understand the link between students' fulfilment of their capacity, and economic prosperity and education. We understand that targeted investment in the things that work and, in the case of the member for Corangamite, in teacher quality in his schools, in better resources for students in making sure that schools have a national improvement plan that is integrated into what they are doing-all of these thingswill make a difference. We know that is the case, but in order to do them you have to have a conviction about education. That conviction exists on this side of the parliament. It is right at the heart of the Labor government's agenda for improving Australia's future. (Time expired) NA",96
106,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," Before I call the member for Hughes, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Acting Minister for Manpower and Senior Minister of State, Ministry of National Development, from the Parliament of Singapore, Brigadier-General Tan ChuanJin. On behalf of the House I extend to him very warm welcome. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (14:25): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that Ingleburn High School in Western Sydney has been hit with a carbon tax hike of $450 for just one month, with a teacher warning: 'So much for the carbon tax not having an impact! The money will have to come from funds otherwise allocated to students.' Will the Prime Minister apologise to parents of Ingleburn High students for promising them, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'? Mr Hockey interjecting",97
107,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for North Sydney is warned.,97
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am very glad that the member raises the question of how best to support schools. We are a government that have doubled the amount of funding going into school education. And, as the member should know, because of the way that money is indexed raise a point of order. The Prime Minister cannot simply rephrase the question and answer a question she would have liked to have been asked, like Joh Bjelke-Petersen. She was asked about the carbon tax and not about the funding of schools.",97
109,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime a Minister has just commenced her answer. I will listen to her answer.,97
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was just about to say to the member who asked the question, we have doubled the funding for school education. That funding is indexed. The way in which the index works is that it takes into account increases, like the 10 per cent increase for electricity prices, which are flowing through into schools. That is taken into account in the index. I wonder if the member has ever got the New South Wales state government on the phone and asked them about the impact of the 70 per cent increase in electricity prices that will have hit the school in his electorate? I wonder if he has ever done that Mr Hockey interjecting Mr Dutton interjecting",97
111,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney and the member for Dickson will leave the chamber under the provisions of section 94(a). They have both previously been warned. It is a double hit. It is not my fault if you cannot hear me because you are making so much noise. The member for North Sydney and the member for Dickson then left the chamber.,98
112,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder whether the member who asked the question was embarrassed to stand alongside the Leader of the Opposition at the last election and promise to cut quality teaching money, promise to cut computers in schools and promise to cut trade-training centres. And I wonder now whether the member is embarrassed to sit behind the Leader of the Opposition, who today has said to that public school that he is coming for it. Like Jack the Ripper, he is going to be there wielding his knife to cut money out of that public school. That is what he has promised today.  raise a point of order. In past times, I have been asked to withdraw a reference to the Prime Minister as Lady Macbeth, and I would ask her to withdraw the reference to the Leader of the Opposition that she just made, which is offensive.",98
113,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I could not actually hear the reference the Prime Minister made, as I was trying to get order back in the chamber. But, to assist the House, I will ask the Prime Minister to withdraw.",98
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Deputy Speaker.",98
115,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minster has the call and will be heard in silence. There are no further points of order on this question.,98
116,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder how the member who asked the question feels about sitting behind this Leader of the Opposition, who is coming to that school to cut its funding. He has promised that today. Whatever label one wants to put on it, what that means is that that school would have less money for the education of children. The Leader of the Opposition in his own words today, in a carefully scripted remark, has said that he is coming for public schools to cut back their funding. Every public school in this country, every parent who sends a child to a public school, and every community member who cares about the quality of public education needs to know from today that the Leader of the Opposition is coming for them. He is coming with cutbacks, and he is coming to destroy the opportunity for those schoolchildren",98
117,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question before her.,98

119,Mr Chester,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you wonder why noone believes you.,98
120,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Gippsland is warned. Tuggerah Lakes Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (14:30): My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities. In 2007 I secured $20 million funding for five years for the important work of rejuvenating Tuggerah Lakes. Wyong Shire Council, under the leadership of Mayor Bob Graham, matched that funding and have been delivering the necessary work for the lakes. The five years is up soon. Will the government commit to continue funding the vital work needed to save Tuggerah Lakes?",98
121,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:30): I thank the member for Dobell for the question. Tuggerah Lakes has been an iconic project for many years across the Central Coast and an area iconic not only for people on the Central Coast. You would not find too many people who have grown up in Sydney who have not had many of their holidays up there, gone prawning in areas of Tuggerah Lakes and seen the magnificent seabirds there, in particular the pelicans but also a series of endangered species. The $20 million commitment that the member for Dobell refers to was put into two stages. The first was about $7½ million, and then there was a second stage. The first has been fully expended. It feeds from two rivers-the Wyong and the Ourimbah. The work is actually being done, led by the council there, by a whole lot of volunteers, part-hundreds of volunteers-working in revegetating the area. You have real problems in Tuggerah Lakes with run-off and nutrients coming through the catchments down into Tuggerah. The work of volunteers being led by the council-he mentions Bob Graham-has been work that has made a real difference in the water quality and the native vegetation of the area. I understand there are two milestone payments still to be made. All the Water, advice that I have received is that they remain on track to be made. I think the next one is due in September. The member also asks about future funding for Tuggerah Lakes. It is something that he has raised in question time today, previously in the parliament and directly with me. Funding for Tuggerah Lakes has been coming out of Caring for our Country. Members may be aware that Caring for our Country has finished its first five years, and the review is taking place to determine the Water, future of Caring for our Country and the exact way that that will be configured. Submissions for that funding review closed three or four days ago, so it will not be long before the government is in a position to make announcements about the exact nature of Caring for our Country, as to which programs it gets broken up into in the future. I have to say, looking at the progress over the last five years, Tuggerah Lakes has been one of the great success stories of the project. It has been a great example of community engagement and a great example of substantial environmental improvement in something that is iconic to the people of Central Coast and beyond. Economy",99
122,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the current in strength of our economy and why it is important to keep investing in skills and infrastructure to keep the economy strong?,99
123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Blair for that very important question, because our economy does walk tall in the world. It is 10 per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis, and it is stronger than every other major developed economy. We have seen the creation of something like 800,000 jobs in the period this government has been in office-a remarkable outcome, given what is going on elsewhere in the world. But also we have seen really strong private business investment. Private business investment has grown by 20 per cent to be at its highest percentage of GDP in something like 40 years. Of course there is a really strong pipeline of investment in resources as well. That advanced pipeline of resources investment has grown by nearly $90 billion in the past year alone. This private investment, along with all of the public investment that the government has been making infrastructure but also in skills and education more broadly, is what strengthens our economy. It gives us the resilience we need to meet the challenges of the future. That fundamental investment drives the strength of our economy as we go forward, because these investments have been put in place. Of course we do need to reverse the decade-long decline in productivity which we inherited from the other side of politics. That is why we are investing in these areas which they refused to invest in. As the Reserve Bank said, their failure to invest in these areas led to something like 10 interest rate rises in a row. We are committed to investing in education. We are committed to investing in infrastructure because we understand that if you invest in the future you strengthen future prosperity. We want to build our economy up, and those Liberals on the other side simply want to tear it down. We have a $3 billion skills package. We have a huge increase in the number of people in tertiary education. And we have doubled our investment in infrastructure-road, rail and port. This is all driving growth and productivity. So we have a plan for the future to support jobs, whereas those on the opposite side of this House do not have a plan to do that. They have a plan to do the reverse. The shadow finance minister let the cat out of the bag up at Hayman Island the weekend before last. He said the opposition were not going to make the mistake that John Hewson had made, where he put out all the fine detail of slashing and burning in health and education. They were not going to put that out as they went to the next election. They were going to do a Campbell Newman and hide it from the Australian people-the impact on jobs, the impact on education. There is a hidden agenda from those opposite to slash, cut and burn health and education and to cut away in the productive base of the Australian economy. We will support working families. They have nothing but contempt for them. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (14:36): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement of Pat Italiano, owner of Essendon Fruit Supply, in the electorate of Maribyrnong, who said, with regard to the carbon tax: We are trying to absorb the costs as much as we can but it's a real slap in the face and it's making things much harder for us. Can the Prime Minister explain to Mr Italiano and every other small business owner across Australia why they will not receive a cent of compensation for the world's biggest carbon tax?",99
124,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member for Casey: it may be that the example he quotes was an example used in one of today's newspapers. I have seen some of those reports, and in some of those reports we have prices referred to, like tomatoes going up from $5 a kilo a couple of weeks ago to $8.99 a kilo now. I would say to this House and I would say to people reading those newspapers: if there is anyone in this country who is representing that that increase is anything to do with carbon pricing, then people should ring the ACCC and get that addressed because that is clearly wrong and meant to deceive and mislead. For the real circumstances of small business, small businesses do not pay the carbon price. That is paid by the big polluters, who generate the most carbon pollution. Ms Marino interjecting",100
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have always said that some of those costs would be,101
126,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Forrest is warned.,101
127,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"passed through to small businesses, particularly in the form of an increase in electricity, and we have talked very clearly with the Australian community about us predicting a 10 per cent increase in household electricity bills, for example-an increase of $3.30 a week on average-and that is why we have provided assistance of $10.10 a week on average. To the small business involved, I would therefore say that that small business is dealing with consumers who have received tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases because our anticipation was that small businesses would pass these modest price impacts on. When we are talking about modest price impacts, let's remember that the Treasury modelling, which has proved accurate on things like electricity prices, that the impact overall will be 0.7 per cent of CPI-that is less than a cent in a dollar. To the member, who may have a genuine concern about price impacts for this small business: I presume he is talking to them about the price impacts flowing from electricity increases that have absolutely nothing to do with carbon pricing. Now that the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that there are dramatic power price increases, nothing to do with carbon pricing, the member should feel empowered to have a frank conversation about the facts. You no longer have to go around pretending, in order to be loyal to the Leader of the Opposition, that this is all about carbon pricing. Today he has given the game away and he has pointed to the other sources of big power bills, and I trust the member who asked the question will do precisely that for the small business involved. Infrastructure",101
128,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister update the House on the government's record investments in nationbuilding infrastructure? How are these helping to rebuild the Bruce Highway, and are there any recent observations that confirm the benefit of these investments?",101
129,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:40): I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. Of course, this federal Labor government has continued to roll out its record Nation Building Program, doubling the roads budget, increasing the rail budget tenfold and committing more to urban public transport than all governments combined since Federation. In addition to that, we are committed to spreading the benefits of the mining boom. That is why we says have established the $6 billion Regional Infrastructure Fund. I am asked about the Bruce Highway, which has benefited from both our Nation Building Program and the Regional Infrastructure Fund. Mr Truss interjecting",101
130,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Recently, as the Leader of the Nationals interjected, he embarked on the equivalent of National Lampoon's Vacation. He went up the North Coast, up the Bruce Highway. As he went up the Bruce Highway, all loaded up in the car were the member for Gippsland and other people over there, who were not sure what seat they were from. Some of that mob over there were loaded into the car, some on the roof, some strapped in, going to look at the work that is taking place on the Bruce Highway. As the Leader of the National Party left his seat going up north, he would have hit the Cooroy to Curra section-the section which he had previously said had the worse road in Australia. He had said that and he should have known. At the time he said that, he was not only the local member; he was the transport minister, and he had done nothing about it. But at the end of last year he would have seen the work underway that will be completed and opened. When he hit the member for Capricornia's seat he would have seen the work that is taking place on the Yeppen Lagoon Bridge and the Yeppen roundabout-$40 million coming from the Regional Infrastructure Fund that he would abolish. If they had got their timing right, they could have been with me and the member for Herbert when we opened the $110 million Douglas Arterial. He could have asked the member for Herbert what he thought, because the member for Herbert said: I'll give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce Highway than we did before. That is what the member for Herbert had to say. Throughout his journey he could have seen the work that is underway, including under the $210 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund. We have spent $2.8 billion over six years; he spent $1.3 billion over 12 long years. So it is no wonder that, as they got to Cairns-as they got to Walley World-their final destination, he got asked, 'What are you committing?' The LNP members spent a whole week strapped in this car and on the roof. When they got to the end, they proposed not one cent of additional funding-not one single cent of additional funding from those opposite.",101
131,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, you have talked about building infrastructure in my home state of Queensland. Why is it important for us to have bipartisan support for this infrastructure, and is the minister aware of any risks to this support?",102
132,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:44): I can assist the member for Capricornia with her very good question because we have committed some $8.7 billion for Queensland as part of the Nation Building Program. In addition to that, we have made commitments from the Regional Infrastructure Fund-$430 million in Queensland alone so far-which those opposite have promised to get rid of in order to give Gina and Clive a tax cut. That is their position. So I was particularly disturbed this morning with the member for Dawson, who had this to say about the Peak Downs Highway in his electorateMr Christensen interjecting",102
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Dawson is warned.,102
134,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and the $120 million commitment. He said, 'It's something I want to look at, you know, down the track if the Liberal-National coalition get into government.' So there it is. They want to cut school funding for those wealthy public schools around the country! The Leader of the Opposition has made that clear. And they want to cut funding through the Regional Infrastructure Fund. Indeed, that stands in stark contrast with the Leader of the National Party, who has said at other times that mining companies are not putting enough back into the local communities. The Gateway WA project, the Gladstone port access road, the Blacksoil Interchange, and the Townsville Ring Road are all under threat if you get rid of the Regional Infrastructure Fund, because you have got to say where the money is coming from. ",102
135,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt has just committed an own goal and he will remove himself from the chamber understanding order 94(a). Persistent interjection will not be tolerated. The member for Sturt then left the chamber. Carbon Pricing,103
136,Dr STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Prime Minister. I refer Prime Minister to Geoffrey Thompson Holdings, an apple and pear grower and cool-store operator in my electorate, whose latest electricity bills show a new item, carbon charges-I stress 'carbon charges'of $23,000 for the month of July alone. This new carbon tax cannot be passed on and there is no compensation. How does this government expect a 60-year-old business to survive and the 400 regional jobs to be preserved?",103
137,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who raises the question I say that, as the member would be aware, we have always said that in carbon pricing the price would be paid by the big polluters, there would be a flow-through impact on electricity pricing",103
138,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,103
139,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member yelling out is agreeing with me, I see. We have been very clear about what that impact would be and the modelling has been proved to be right. Small businesses are not required directly to pay the carbon price and are not required to fill in any additional forms. Unlike the paperwork burden that came their way with the Howard government's GST, they do not pay the carbon price, and they do not fill in additional forms. They will see some flow-through impacts for things like electricity prices, which is why we have put consumers in a position for them to pass that on. Consumers are there with their tax cuts, their family payment increases and their pension increases. I would say to the member who asked the question: what has she said to this business about the large electricity prices",103
140,Mr Randall,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,'Vote Liberal.',103
141,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She may well have said that, but I hope she has also said that the My Leader of the Opposition today has now the acknowledged that the biggest impact on electricity prices is not carbon pricing. Having finally moved from a position that everyone knew to be ridiculousMr Abbott interjecting",103
142,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Leader of the Opposition is aware that he is not allowed to use that word.,103
143,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"when he tried to pretend that all electricity price increases were somehow the fault of carbon pricing, he was repudiated by state Liberals, repudiated by this front bench, repudiated by the regulators. So today he has actually acknowledged that there are other sources of power price increases. What does the member, on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, say to the small business involved about that? I would be in a position to say that we will drive change at the Council of Australian Governments meeting at the end of this year. Is the member in a position to say that this Leader of the Opposition will get Ted Baillieu on the phone, Barry O'Farrell on the phone and Campbell Newman on the phone and say, 'It's about time that the Liberals worked with us to address these electricity price increases at the end of this year'? Dr Stone: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I specifically, in the question, asked the Prime Minister to address what this company is going to be able to do-what she is going to tell them when the 400 jobs are lost.",103

145,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not going to join the member in this fear campaigning. If she is genuinely interested in this business she would be looking at costs from all sources, including the bigger electricity costs flowing from sources other than carbon pricing. If she is not doing that, she is not serious this business or the 400 jobs she is talking about, and I think her constituents would be very interested to know that she is not serious about 400 jobs in her electorate.

148,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. How have financial markets factored in the impact of the carbon price on inflation? How does this compare with the predictions that were made before the carbon price came in? Mr Briggs interjecting,104
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Mayo is warned.,104
150,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:51): I thank the member for Deakin for his question, because underlying inflation is actually at a 13-year low, and the carbon price will have quite a small impact on inflation. We have stated many times in this place that the Treasury modelling found that the impact on the CPI would only be 0.7 per cent in financial year 2012-13. That is less than one cent in the dollar and certainly much less than the CPI impact of the introduction of the GST, which was 2.5 per cent. It is nothing like the hysterical claims made by the Leader of the Opposition of unimaginable price increases-far from it. The carbon price has now been in place about for approximately seven weeks, and during this time TD Securities' inflation gauge has shown that the overall inflation impact during the first month of the carbon price was just 0.2 per cent in July-one fifth of one cent. There is certainly no unimaginable price increase in that, as claimed by the Leader of the Opposition, and nothing to support the ridiculous three-page beat-up today in the Daily Telegraph. But we have also seen in the past week an analysis of inflation expectations on financial markets from financial markets. This confirms the Treasury modelling. Investors, My of course, when considering these issues, back their predictions up with their money. They are saying that the impact of carbon pricing on inflation will be in the order of to 0.7 per cent. That is bang on the Treasury modelling. In the face of all of these facts, the face of all of this evidence that is mounting, what do the coalition resort to as part of their mendacious, ridiculous, hysterical fear campaign? They resort to exhorting people to price gouge. Here is a classic example. A refrigerant company, Equipserve, has been pinged by the ACCC after it replicated a statement, in effect, made by the shadow industry minister, the member for Indi. She wrongly attributed increases in refrigerant gas prices to the carbon price-the entirety of the increase to the carbon price. They are the very same statements that were found to be in breach of the consumer laws and that led to the giving of an enforceable undertaking by that company to the ACCC. This is the conduct the opposition engage in. They go around misrepresenting, making ridiculous, deceitful claims, encouraging businesses to price gouge. The meat industry has had to disown the silly leaflet that the opposition have put out. Their whole campaign is a fraud and their claim to repeal it is also a fraud. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",104
151,Mr CHRISTENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in a carbon tax debate last week: 'Farmers will not pay a cent.' How does she reconcile his statement with this letter from a tomato farmer in Bowen? It shows that Visy will increase the annual bill for cardboard boxes used on his family-run tomato farm by more than $12,000 due to the carbon tax.",105
152,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who asked the question: the parliamentary secretary would have been making the simple point that it is 0.6 only big businesses that generate a lot of carbon pollution, thousands and thousands of in tonnes of carbon pollution-indeed, 25,000 tonnes or more-that pay the carbon price. That is the point he would have been drawing out in that debate. To the member who is continuing his question after a series of questions today: what we are seeing today is an opposition determined to continue its fear campaign, even though-day by day by day-the facts are proving this fear campaign wrong. Whyalla was going to be wiped off the map. That is wrong. Price rises were going to be unimaginably large. That is wrong. Electricity bills were going to skyrocketeven the Leader of the Opposition has had to acknowledge that was wrong today.",105

155,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the member who asked the question: No. 1, of course we would be checking the assertions in the question-when they come from the opposition we need to; No. 2, I have described on more than one occasion in question time today the circumstances of small business; and, No. 3, the continuation of this fear campaign today, in the face of the facts, I think is because the Leader of the Opposition this morning and his opposition team are now desperate to distract from his pledge this morning to cut the funding to every public school in the nation-because he does not want to have public debate focused on his cuts to public schools. Here we go with the fear campaign and the ridiculous points of order. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I would refer you to page 519 of House of Representatives Practice and I would refer you to standing order No. 91. It says: 'Where a member is persistently and wilfully refusing to conform to the standing order', as is the Prime Minister. Her behaviour is disorderly. I would ask you to say that this is disorderly, her refusal to comply.",105

The behaviour of the opposition and the complete disregard of the standing orders by the majority of the opposition are also on display. The member for Dawson then left the chamber. Marine Sanctuaries Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:58): question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister update the House on the government's plan to create national parks in Commonwealth waters, and what information is the community being given during the current consultation phase?",106
161,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:59): I want to thank the member for Petrie for the question. The member for Petrie has been talking to me for some time about the importance of making sure that we got the balance right in the marine national parks proposals, to make sure that we took account of the recreational fishers-who are very strong in her electorate-without in any way compromising the strong environmental outcomes that we could achieve. We ended up with a proposal, particularly down that east coast pathway, that met those requirements precisely. It is one where we were able to become as a nation the world leader in ocean protection. It was a situation where, as a nation, whenever we were given a choice to deliver the same environmental outcome but to minimise the impact on recreational fishers, we took that option. Wherever we could get the same environmental outcome but minimise the impact on commercial fishers, we took that option. That is why the Coral Sea, for example, which I have previously described as the jewel in the crown of the whole proposal, is one area where the highest level of protection is in the areas furthest out. But in the areas that are closerbetween the Great Barrier Reef and the beginning of where the Coral Sea is-you have one area of particularly high value for commercial fishers, which is reserved, and trawlers are allowed in. An area in the north of that entire central band is open to My recreational fishing, and the southern part is also open to longliners to make sure that we deliver the environmental outcome in a way that minimises the challenges that might be otherwise there for the rec or commercial sectors. That is why I was surprised to see that part of the material being distributed during the current consultation phase involved a Water, leaflet-I am not sure what sort of image this was trying to invoke-with a symbol of fish and chips wrapped in the Australian flag with the entire Coral Sea reserve described not as it is in the draft maps but as a no-go zone. This leaflet can only be described as nothing other than a lie.",106

It is trying to do one thing-that is, mislead the people of Queensland-and nothing more. It is authorised by Queensland LNP Senator Sue Boyce. It was put out as fake information to deceive Queenslanders, and the Leader of the Opposition should himself disown it. Carbon Pricing Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (15:02): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to this electricity bill from Michael Fahey in my electorate that clearly states that the carbon tax has increased his cheapest rate of electricity by 30 per cent. As Mr Fahey has an electricity bill that has now climbed to over $3,000 a year, will the Prime Minister apologise to Mr Fahey, his family and the millions of Australian households who will be now worse off because of this toxic carbon tax?",107
170,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Once again, we see the fear campaign continue. The member who asked that question may want to explain to that business that the 50 and 60 per cent increases that people have seen in electricity prices in Queensland are nothing to do with the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition today has acknowledged that there are dramatic increases in electricity that are nothing to do with the carbon price. The member might not like the fact, and the Leader of the Opposition might have been dragged kicking and screaming to the facts, but they are facts. Mrs Prentice: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a household. It is not a business.",107
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Ryan will resume her seat. There is no additional debate. A clarification was given. Mrs Griggs interjecting,107
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Solomon is not assisting.,107
173,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I misunderstood. I thought the member was referring to a business. What I have just said is correct for businesses: the big increases they have seen in power prices in Queensland come from other areas, not the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged today that there are other sources of dramatic increases in power bills. What we have always said for Australian families is that they would see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill, and that has been acknowledged by the regulators as right. They will see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill, a 10 per cent increase in what they pay. Because they will see that 10 per cent increase, which on average for families is $3.30 a week, we have provided, on average, assistance of $10.10 a week in the form of tax cuts, in the form of pension increases and in the form of family payment increases. These are the facts and no amount of fear campaigning changes those facts. No amount of fear campaigning today will distract from the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut funding to every public school in the member for Ryan's electorate.

181,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development, Local Government and the Arts. How is the government supporting communities across the country through the Regional Development Australia Fund, including in the mid-north region in my electorate? What are the government's future plans for the Regional Development Australia Fund?",108
182,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development regional and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (15:06): I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his commitment to regional development generally but particularly in his electorate. The Regional Development Australia Fund that he refers to is an important commitment on the part of this government, a billiondollar fund over its term to assist regions to make economic and social infrastructure adjustments. In the member's seat recently, in round 2 we were able to ensure the funding of the Wakefield-Auburn pipeline. This is a water infrastructure initiative, and it is essential to ensuring the development of housing as well as farmland expansion in that area. Without this investment, the housing and the farmland development would not have taken place. The farmland development is very important to support the continued growth of the poultry industry in his electorate, so you can see that this has both social and economic impact. Our approach, of course, is, 'Stronger regions equal a stronger nation,' and that is why we are committed to strengthening regions in our country, across the country. This was one of seven programs funded in South Australia in the second round and 46 over the country. A new culture has developed. We have gotten away from the rorts that personified regional development under the previous government, to a culture of genuine partnership. In fact, the $200 million that we funded in this second round leveraged $800 million, so the multiplier is four to one. We have got a lot in this round who did not get up in the first round but persisted in making their projects stack up, and they got supported. They also paid attention not just to where this proposal would be located but to the wider regional significance. I am also asked about the future of this fund. The future of this fund under us is now secure, because we have secured passage of the minerals resource rent tax, a means by which we want to spread the benefits of the mining boom to the rest of regional Australia to ensure that they get their fair share. Under us, there will be three more rounds. But, as to the future, these rounds would not go ahead if those opposite were in government, because they are committed to abolishing the tax and therefore the means by which they fund this proposal. The challenge on the other side is to either be honest with the Australian electorate and say that you are going to keep the tax or to tell us where you are going to get the money from to fund a program that is benefiting regions.

Question agreed to. NA Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill Returned from Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bill without amendment or request. NA Privileges and Members' Interests Committee Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (15:12): I present the report of the Privileges and Members' Interests Committee concerning the possible unauthorised disclosure of the internal proceedings of the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper. Mrs D'ATH: by leave-On 24 May 2012 I raised in the House a matter of privilege concerning the apparent unauthorised disclosure of the internal proceedings of the committee's private meeting held on the previous night. The disclosure was in articles by Ms Michelle Grattan in the online version of the Age and in the print edition of the Age of 24 May 2012. In my statement. I expressed disappointment about the disclosure, particularly in light of the discussion the committee had about the importance of confidentiality in the committee's consideration of the sensitive issues it was inquiring into. I indicated that the committee would pursue the matter internally and report back to the House as necessary. I am now reporting back on behalf of the committee. The committee has examined this matter in a way consistent with the approach it has advocated for all committees that experience unauthorised disclosures. 2012 The committee has been unable to obtain evidence that might reveal the source or sources of the disclosure. Each member of the committee and each secretariat staff member has signed a statutory declaration to the effect that they did not disclose the internal proceedings of the meeting of 23 May 2012 to any person who was not authorised to be made aware of Report those proceedings. In addition the committee asked the journalist involved, Ms Michelle Grattan, to appear and give evidence in relation to any information she could provide about the source of the disclosure. In her evidence to the committee, Ms Grattan confirmed she was the author of the two articles in question. She also declined to discuss any matters to do with her sources. In relation to the impact of the disclosure, the committee considers that the particular circumstances make this matter very serious. The meeting from which the disclosure appears to have taken place was the first meeting of the committee after the referral of an inquiry by the House into a matter of great sensitivity. The committee also explicitly discussed at that meeting the importance of confidentiality in relation to its proceedings during the course of the inquiry. The disclosure, therefore, has been damaging to the committee. The committee makes no formal findings on this matter as it has not been able to identify the source of the disclosure. However, the committee has a number of observations, and makes recommendations to the House. On a number of occasions the committee has expressed its frustration about inquiries has conducted into unauthorised disclosures of committee information. These of course have been inquiries into disclosures from other committees, not an inquiry into a disclosure from the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests itself, but the issues are the same. In earlier reports the committee has acknowledged the difficulty that can be faced in seeking to ascertain the sources of disclosures. Those guilty are unlikely to identify themselves and representatives can be expected to claim that their professional code of ethics prevents them from revealing the identity of such sources. The person or persons who disclose information from committee proceedings are the most culpable in these matters. However, the committee reiterates the view it has expressed before that it is also important that, where it is necessary to do so, there is a willingness to proceed against those who knowingly publish material. The committee recommends, as it has in earlier reports, that the House adopt a resolution relating to unauthorised disclosure. In addition to the terms of previously recommended resolutions, the committee has added specific provisions relating to the publication of unauthorised material and the implications for journalists and the media. The adoption of the resolution will make it clear to journalists and the media which publish unauthorised information that publication is, of itself, potentially a contempt which can be punished by the House with appropriate sanctions. two In addition to the resolution, the committee also recommends that changes be made to the process for the approval of it parliamentary press gallery passes to require the pass holder to be aware of the prohibition of unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings and also that, as part of the approval and renewal processes, the pass holder is informed that a breach can result in sanctions. The committee also notes that there is a role for the press gallery committee, which sponsors the passes of members of the gallery, to advise new members of the gallery about their responsibilities. media Having concluded my remarks on the committee's report, I wish to make some very brief remarks about two matters concerning the Register of Members' Interests that were raised with the committee by the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the House. They concerned the statements of interests of the member for Dobell and the member for Hughes. The committee has considered the matters raised and has obtained information from the members concerned. The committee has concluded that there are no grounds for it to take further actions. I conclude by thanking the secretariat for their assistance in preparing the report and their ongoing work with the committee, and I also thank the members and the Deputy Chair of the Privileges and Members' Interests Committee.",110
195,Mr SECKER,COMMITTEES," by leave-I support the words of the Chair of the Privileges and Members' Interests Committee; she has summarised the report quite extensively and I have very little to add. I will raise the issue of appendix B to the report. Paragraph (1) says: A committee concerning which a complaint of unauthorised disclosure or publication has been made must consider whether the matter has caused substantial interference with its work … I think the words 'substantial interference' are always going to lead to a problem of definition-is something substantial or not? I suspect this issue might not fall on that, but, again, that is open to argument. I believe we also have a problem in appendix C, subparagraph (1)(e)(i), which states: In considering complaints in this area and notwithstanding the provisions of standing order 51, the Speaker should not allow precedence to a motion on such a matter unless, in the light of information presented to the Speaker, he or she is of the opinion: (i) that there is sufficient evidence that will enable the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests to ascertain the source or sources of the disclosure(s); We have found through this process that that is almost impossible, and that may need looking at by the Procedure Committee in the future. In almost every case that will erase the possibility of precedents being given to the motion. NA Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 Consideration in Detail Debate resumed.",112
196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The question is that opposition amendment (1) moved by the member for Calare be agreed to.,112
197,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (15:20): In conclusion of my remarks on the amendment of the member for Calare to the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill, I indicate that the government does not accept his amendment for the reasons I have given. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (15:20): I rise to speak again following the government's comment on the coalition's amendment to the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011. We are committed to addressing the trade in illegally sourced timber and timber products. In fact that was coalition policy at the 2010 election. Everything I have heard indicates that we all agree that the need for action is driven by a number of issues, including environmental concerns over indiscriminate or poorly controlled logging activities. In addition, under the current legislative regime the the Australian forest sector, which is globally recognised for its forest management regulation and practices, suffers a competitive disadvantage through compliance costs borne locally that are not observed by illegal loggers. The intent of this bill is well placed, but not surprisingly the government has again bungled the delivery of a policy on which both sides of politics agree. Specifically the government has bungled on the consultation process. A flawed consultation process has led to concerns amongst significant trading partners, no less than four of whom have voiced concerns. The Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia, our most important near neighbour, in a submission to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into this bill stated: The negative impact on trade should also not be underestimated bearing in mind that timber products commonly have long and complex chains of supply with mixed sources from different locations and different kinds of timber. The government of Indonesia submission goes on: It is for this reason that the GOI has recommended the deferral of the legislation until 2015 to provide time to ensure the legislation will not have unintended consequences that will unnecessarily harm the mutual trade between our two nations. Furthermore, the three years of adjournment will provide time for proper consultation between both countries including detail clarification as well as period of for the Indonesian producers/exporters to comply with the regulation. This brings to mind issues Indonesia have had experience of-such as the lack of consultation we saw with the live cattle trade ban, when not only was there insufficient consultation; I believe there was none at all. They had to read in the newspaper about Australia's decision to suspend exports to its biggest trading partner in the area. This again shows complete arrogance on the part of this government-they snubbed our nearest trading partners in the same way, as I said, that they did with the live export ban. It is not reasonable for the government to bring these measures into law without giving our trading partners, our domestic timber industry and timber importers the time they were promised to design and implement appropriate systems. In moving this amendment, while at the same time wanting to ensure that Australia only imports timber from proper sources, I want to repeat what Indonesia-our nearest, our biggest and, without doubt, our most important neighbour-said: It is for this reason that the GOI (Government of Indonesia) has recommended the deferral of the legislation until 2015 to provide time to ensure the legislation will not have unintended consequences that will unnecessarily harm the mutual trade between our two nations. (Time expired)",112
198,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (15:25): We have just heard the coalition, in a very hollow gesture, claim that they do not outright oppose the bill-but they will vote against it in its current form. That means three more years of forests being decimated by illegal logging and three more years of support for the criminal activities of illegal loggers and adjustment those associated with this terrible destruction. The coalition have not made one constructive suggestion about how to improve the bill. They merely say, 'Let's delay its implementation for almost three years.' What type of abrogation of our responsibility as parliamentarians would that be? We would have legislation on the statutes as impotent as the coalition's attempt to salvage some credibility out of this debate. This is, as I mentioned before, a shallow gesture and a reflection on those who put it forward. I want to remind the House and all those listening to this that in 2010 the federal coalition made this pledge to the Australian people: The Coalition will legislate to make it an offence to import any timber product which has not been verified as being legally harvested. They went on: We will require Australian timber importers and domestic processing mills to undertake a process of due diligence to verify the legal origins of the timber product and to disclose species, country of harvest and any certification … A transition period of two years will be provided to allow industry to adapt to these new measures. The legislation before us delivers the coalition's commitment as well as the Labor Party's election commitment. Today the coalition is proposing to give the green light to sophisticated criminal networks to continue a trade which costs $60 billion per annum. Their amendment effectively makes Australia a haven for the proceeds of crime. Mr John Cobb interjecting",113
199,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"I would like to remind the member opposite, whilst he is sitting there quietly, that-using estimates published by the World Bank-a further 236,520 square kilometres of forest will be harvested illegally with the approval of the Australian parliament if we agree to your amendment. Looking at the data in the explanatory memorandum for this bill, of which you are well aware-I assume you have read it-it is clear that the coalition's amendments would give the green light to a further $180 billion worth of illicit trade sophisticated criminal networks over the next three years. Of that, $1.2 billion would be delivered in Australia. Those opposite are effectively saying that Europe and the United States can do the heavy lifting on this issue, while Australia will be a dumping ground for illegally logged timber and timber products. As I said before, you do not propose to oppose the bill, yet you do not make suggestions on how to improve the bill. You just say, 'Delay its implementation'-for whatever reason-and, in doing so, you admit that the government has in fact got it right. Your amendment is a shallow gesture and a reflection on those who put it forward. We will not support your amendment.",114
200,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," In this consideration-in-detail stage, I would like to respond to what the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has just said-that the coalition had displayed an abrogation of responsibility. Let's focus on exactly what is in the legislation before the House this afternoon and, therefore, why we say our amendment is necessary. The government have put forward legislation which under proposed section 8 establishes a criminal offence, with a penalty of five years imprisonment, for a person where: (a) the person imports a thing; and (b) the thing is, is made from, or includes, illegally logged timber; and (c) the thing is not prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph. The government have introduced legislation which will pass into law if they have their way, yet when this bill comes into force there will be no way for a law-abiding citizen to know what they need to do to avoid breaching section 8. There is no detail as to what the due diligence defence actually requires. In fact, law-abiding citizens will by not even be able to find out which kinds of timber attract the operation of section 8, which will impose on those citizens, if they make an innocent mistake, a penalty of up to five years in prison potentially. Let's be completely clear about what this legislation does. Let's not hear any more of this talk of high and noble aims. Let's focus on a detailed analysis of what this provision specifically does under the bill that the government are seeking to ram through the House this afternoon. If an importer brings into Australia a chair, for example, made almost entirely of plastic or metal but which happens to include some wood and, if it turns out that that wood has been illegally logged under the law of another country, then under the operation of proposed section 8 that importer will be liable to receive a knock on the door from a government inspector and will be liable to be imprisoned for up to five years. Those are the plain words of section 8, on the face of it. The government come in here and talk about abrogation of responsibility when they have put forward this legislation without bothering to have ready the regulations which specify what a law-abiding citizen must do in order to comply with this law; without bothering to specify in the regulations the nature of the due diligence that a citizen must carry out to ensure that or she is not breaching the law; and without even bothering to specify in a list the kinds of timbers that are defined as illegally logged. In these circumstances, it is extraordinary that the parliamentary secretary would use the term 'abrogation of responsibility', because it is the most remarkable abrogation of responsibility that this government would propose to introduce legislation imposing such penalties while making it effectively impossible for a citizen to find out what he or she has to do to comply with the law. It is all very well for the parliamentary secretary to talk about the international criminal trade in illegal logging; there is no dispute from this side of the House that illegal logging is a problem that needs to be addressed. We merely ask this of the government: get your house in order, make it clear in the law of the land what is required of a citizen to comply with the law and get the regulations in place and operational. That is why we have moved this amendment. It is not because we have an objection in principle to the notion of greater action being taken against illegal logging-indeed, as the parliamentary secretary has rightly pointed out, that is our policy. It is because introducing legislation which would go onto the books, be part of the law of the land, and which would impose these very serious penalties without it being possible for a citizen to find out what he or she needs to do to comply with the law when the bill gets royal assent is an abrogation of responsibility. What we are in fact seeking to do here is assist the government in coming up with an additional amount of time in which it can do the job it ought to have done before bringing in this legislation-that is, getting the regulations in place following proper consultation with the importing sector and he the timber sector so that citizens know what they need to do to comply with the law. That is not by any means an unreasonable proposition from the opposition. On the contrary, we are seeking to be helpful, to assist the government to do what it should have done of its own volition.",114
201,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (15:34): The only thing the member for Bradfield is being helpful with is allowing illegal logging to continue to decimate forests for three more years. That is all you are doing. You also misunderstand-I would not like to suggest you misrepresent-the bill, because it is not negligent, as you claim. One penalty relates to knowing or reckless engagement in the proceeds of crime; the other relates to the regulations which stipulate due diligence requirements. There is no misalignment. The high-level prohibition that applies under clauses 8 and 15 should not be confused with the prohibition that applies to the regulated timber stream which is to be implemented two years after the legislation commences. The high-level prohibition places a ban on importing timber products containing illegally logged timber and processing domestic raw logs that have been illegally logged. The prohibition under clauses 8 and 15 places a minimum burden on importers and domestic processors, as they will not be required to undertake a prescribed process under the bill. Businesses may seek to implement informal measures to ensure they are not a party to supplying illegally logged timber into the Australian markets. Two years after the commencement of the legislation, importers of regulated timber products-which the government is in the process of determining-and processors of domestic raw logs will be required to carry out due diligence to minimise the risk of importing illegally logged timber.",115
202,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I rise to support remarks I made in this chamber last week as well as to comment on remarks made by the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness at the end of the debate last week, where he was critical of comments that had been made about the relationship with Indonesia. In particular, he referred to a quote in the Australian Financial Review and accused us on this side of misrepresenting and misleading. Let us place the Financial Review article to one side because what we did not hear from the trade minister and what I would like to hear him comment on-maybe the parliamentary secretary could comment-is the evidence given by Indonesia when the trade subcommittee examined this bill. I quote: The implementation of the Bill is also likely to undermine the development of trade between Indonesia and Australia based on our respective mutual interests. In this respect, reference to the recent efforts of the Government of Indonesia to accommodate and resolve the problem faced by Australia during the selfimposed ban on beef exports to Indonesia. That is what needs to be addressed by the other side. I would ask the parliamentary secretary to give us his view on what Indonesia is saying in this quote and, if the trade minister is happy to grace us with his presence again, I would like to hear his view of what this means, remembering that Indonesia is our most important market for beef and for wheat. Yet here they are saying in their submission that: The implementation of the Bill is also likely to undermine the development of trade between Indonesia and Australia based on our respective mutual interests. I would ask the government to give heed to that quote, to think about it, because we have already seen, through the absolute debacle which occurred with live exports to Indonesia, what harm that did to our trading relationship with Indonesia. Yet here again we see the government, through its ineptitude, through its incompetence, ready to do exactly the same thing again. The consultation around this bill has been nothing short of a disgrace. They have not taken into account the interests of our near neighbours-how sensitive they are about these measures, how sensitive they are about other countries telling them what they should do, how they should govern their own internal affairs. It is time the government woke up and thought about doing things a better way. If they do not, they are going to cause grave damage to this relationship at a time when there are particular sensitivities. We have already seen that there is a key to helping to resolve the asylum seeker issue here in this country-by making sure we have strong cooperation with Indonesia and Malaysia in particular. Yet the way the is made government has mishandled this bill will mean that those countries will look at us and say, 'Why should we cooperate with this country when they are bringing into this place unilateral measures like this?' where we are telling them how to suck eggs. I call on the government to think again, to step back from this, to go back to those countries and say, 'Surely there is a better way to do this. Surely we can cooperate with you, rather than us telling you how you should do it,' imposing our views on them, telling them, 'You should do it our way.' How would we like it in reverse? This is the danger of this bill because the precedent we are setting will open it up for other countries to say to us in exactly the same way, 'This is how we want you doing things.' The government should think again.",116
203,Mr CHESTER,BILLS," I appreciate the opportunity to speak again in relation to the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 and the amendment put forward by the coalition. This bill prohibits the importation and sale of all timber products containing illegally logged timber; prohibits the processing of illegally harvested domestically grown raw logs; requires importers of regulated timber products and processors of raw logs to comply with due diligence requirements; requires the accurate description of legally logged timber products for sale in Australia; establishes enforcement powers and offences; and, imposes penalties and provides for a review of the first five years of the operation of the act. Despite the protestations of those opposite, I believe the coalition has acted in good faith in relation this legislation and has sought to raise some very legitimate concernsMr Bruce Scott: Order! The member for Gippsland should be speaking to the amendment, not to the bill.",117
204,Mr CHESTER,BILLS,"In raising the amendment to the bill, I believe the coalition have acted in good faith. We have sought to give the government the opportunity to get this right. That has been our concerned from the outset in the debate as it has occurred in this place. The Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister earlier this year suggesting conditions under which the coalition could support the bill and that is nature of the amendment before the Housewe propose a better way forward to accommodate satisfactory consultation. We have been concerned about the sensitivities at the international level, which the member for Wannon quite rightly reflected on in his contribution. There are also concerns expressed by the domestic industry in terms of the consultation period and the need for extra time to get this right. That goes to the very heart of the amendment put forward by the coalition. We are seeking more time and more detail from this government in relation to the regulations. I believe the amendment is a sensible approach to delay the onset of the legislation and for the regulations to be made available by a settled future date. That would give us the opportunity to consult with the industry and with our international trading partners to ensure that we continue to support a viable timber industry in this country. The position taken by the coalition is consistent with our approach to the last election where we supported prevention of illegal logging and we continue to work with the government in good faith in that regard. to The coalition went into the last election period with an undertaking to legislate to make it an offence to import any timber product which has not been verified as being legally harvested. The member for Braddon and the parliamentary secretary took the opportunity to come to my electorate to meet with Australian Sustainable Timbers quite recently. I enjoyed that experience and I think the member for Braddon and the parliamentary secretary appreciated the opportunity to talk with the industry directly on this issue. It must be said that in discussions with Australian Sustainable Hardwoods they the indicated that the Victorian Association of Forest Industries supports in principle the approach being taken by the government in relation to illegal logging, but have reservations about the regulations. That is to the heart of the amendment put forward by the coalition. We want to see the details. We want the industry to have the opportunity to be fully consulted in relation to the details this legislation and we are particularly keen to ensure that the sensitivities at an international level are taken into account. I do appreciate the member for Braddon taking the time to consult with the mill owners at Heyfield. He had a great appreciation for the work they are doing at the Heyfield mill to certify their operations and have them fully audited. It was a very useful visit from many perspectives. The industry did appreciate his willingness to discuss in a very full and frank manner what the future challenges will be for the industry. But I cannot support the bill without the amendment being passed, because I believe a common-sense approach is being taken by the coalition, and in good faith, with the domestic timber industry and also in relation to our international trading partners. I thank the member for Wannon for his contribution. I think he raised some legitimate concerns regarding sensitivities that exist when you are talking about putting requirements in place for foreign nations in relation to trade. I think would be wrong of those opposite to simply dismiss the coalition's concerns as being political in nature, because they are not. They are being raised on behalf of industry and on behalf of our spokespeople, who are concerned about the international trading relationships that Australia has enjoyed in the past and will seek to enjoy in the future. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this complex area of legislation. I will be supporting the coalition's amendment and I urge those opposite to support the coalition in its efforts to ensure there is full consultation and detailed regulations(Time expired)",117
205,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," It is most important to get information on the record on the amendment to the Illegal of Logging Prohibition Bill. It is a pleasure to follow the members for Gippsland and Wannon. The member for Wannon made some very valid remarks about the risks inherent in this, following the trade subcommittee's recent report, from which I quote: The implementation of the Bill is also likely to undermine the development of trade between Indonesia and Australia based on our respective mutual interests. In this respect, reference is made to the recent efforts of the Government of Indonesia to accommodate and resolve the problem faced by Australia during the selfimposed ban on beef exports to Indonesia. As the member for Wannon indicated, the trade Australia does with Indonesia in wheat and beef cannot be jeopardised: it cannot be jeopardised by this particular legislation and it cannot be jeopardised as it concerns the national interests of Australia and Indonesia. As we all know Indonesia is a very valuable trading partner of Australia. the This amendment calls for the regulations and amendments to coincide. Passing this it bill without knowing what the detail is could jeopardise our trade relations a whole lot. We have seen this before with this Labor government when they have tried to force through other pieces of legislation, and they have been able to do that in this hung parliament. The haste with which e-health electronic health records was done springs to mind. I also caution the parliament about putting in a water policy in a hasty way that is going to impinge upon so many irrigators within my electorate. But this particular legislation can lead to the jailing of people. We cannot have innocent people, perhaps, going to jail for want of better legislation and more time to consider in proper detail what this legislation entails. We need a common-sense approach. The coalition certainly have approached this in good faith. We need to ensure that all the detail is considered properly and accurately. The coalition are committed to addressing the trade of illegally sourced timber and timber products. That was certainly coalition policy at the 2010 election. The need for the legislation is driven, as we all know, by several issues, including environmental concerns regarding indiscriminate or poorly controlled logging activities, and there is certainly a lot of logging activity in the Riverina electorate. I am sure that when the Parliamentary Secretary Sidebottom, who is sitting at the table at present, visits the Riverina-and he has shown a desire to do so, as he did with the member for Gippsland just recently-I am sure he will be able to take on board those logging activities and how valuable they are to the Riverina electorate and to the economic future of Australia, because there is so much logging activity taking place in Australia and so much of it takes place in the Riverina. In addition, under the current legislative regime the Australian forest sector, which is globally recognised for its forest management regulation and practices, suffers competitive disadvantages through compliance costs, which are borne locally but are not observed by illegal loggers. The coalition acknowledge the government's acceptance of the majority of the recommendations made to the exposure draft. The need for further consultation is clearly indicated by a number of media articles and by some of those things that have been said by coalition members today, who are concerned about the details and effects of this bill. The coalition support measures to prevent illegal logging. This the position was clearly articulated in our 2010 forestry policy. The coalition will legislate to make it an offence to import any timber product that has not been verified as being legally harvested. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimates that each year around $400 million, or 10 per cent, of imported forest products were derived from sources that had some risk of being illegally logged. That cannot continue. A transition period of two years will be provided to allow industry to adapt to two new measures that will safeguard against illegal logging. The coalition will ensure that all stakeholders impacted are consulted closely in the drafting of any legislation, regulations and other related measures, which will benefit this entire bill and these amendments.",118
206,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," Thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill. My father, who unfortunately passed on three years ago now, used to have a saying: less haste, more speed. And I think this is the case with what we are trying to help the government with here: rush less, and let us for once get something right. There are many people out there in the general public in Australia who say: 'Why don't the two sides of parliament work together?'. Well, we are trying to work with the government. In fact, we have an almost identical goal-we both wish to get rid of illegal logging. But what we are doing here is trying to save the government from itself. We are trying to save the government from rushing in and, given the record of this government, which I raised in the second reading debate, we are trying to save it from yet another costly and embarrassing stuff-up on Australia's behalf. We will be judged as being overbearing and overconfident, the colonial masters of the Pacific, and then eventually hauled back to the plate and back to a previous position-as we have just seen on asylum seekers-where we will have to admit that we were wrong. Of course we, on this side, want to see the end of illegal logging, because there are losers all round-the soil loses, the country loses and the people of the country lose. There are very few winners in illegal logging except, of course, those who steal the resource. But we need to get the regulation right. In fact, the intent of the bill is that requires the accurate description of legally logged timber products for sale in Australia. What we are trying to do with the amendments moved by the member for Calare is to ensure that the trading partners have time 'to implement systems that allow traceability and achieve compliance with the regulations and legislation and that, very importantly, Australian importers have the time to design and implement processes for traceability and demonstration of due diligence.' This is because the problem we have with the legislation as it stands is that the onus is on the importer and on the seller of the timber in Australia to prove that the timber was not illegally logged. It is very difficult if you happen to be sitting in your suburban store in Byrneside, or Melbourne or wherever, to look at an article and say: 'Well, I definitely know that the sides were made from legal timber and the back was made from legal timber, but I am not so sure about the inlay in the top.' Those traders are going to have to rely on the compliance mechanisms of the country from where the timber is sourced. At this stage, they cannot rely on that regulation. Those countries are trying, as we speak, to develop that regulation. We know that these are countries that are not as developed as Australia and that, from time to time, cash might pass under the table to achieve such certification, but this is a chance for these countries who wish to continue this trade with Australia to do the compliance right. Of course, if it is done wrongly and we see major prosecutions in Australia, then we run the risk of the trade stopping altogether. And if the trade stops altogether, we will not see a decrease in forestry in these countries. As we know with any economically traded, agricultural produce, as the price falls, production rises, because people try to cover it their losses by harvesting more, planting more and, in the case of illegal forestry, logging more trees, which will find their way to the market. Perhaps this is not in Australia but to somewhere else in the world. The net effect is, in fact, counterproductive. We do not come into this chamber in a belligerent manner. We are not shouting at the government. We are saying: 'Just hold up a bit. Let's see if for once we can get something right.' Then we can go back to the people of Australia and say, 'Yes, we have had an intelligent conversation, and we have come to an intelligent compromise.' That is what the member for Calare is asking for. That is why I am supporting his amendments. And that is why the government ought to perhaps listen to us on this one. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (15:56): I rise to support the coalition's proposed amendment to this Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill. Just as the member for Grey quoted the wise words of his father, I remember well a former senator of this place, Sir John Carrick, who regularly used to use the phrase, 'Slowly, slowly, catchy monkey' which became well known in those days. Illegal logging poses a significant challenge to the goal of sustainable management of the world's forests. Every member of this House wants to ensure that we do what we can to protect the environment. We must recognise, however, that there are substantial trade-offs involved between, on the one hand, the protection of global forestry and, on the other, the employment prospects and quality of life concerns in developing countries. It is important for this House to constantly keep in mind decisions made today and their ramifications for the future global environment and future generations. But we must also not ignore the fact that there are hundreds of millions of impoverished people in poor countries around the world, many millions of whom undertake illegal logging in places like Indonesia just so they can survive. This is not a desirable situation, it is a situation that we must all accept and take into account. The coalition is moving this amendment to defer the commencement date of the legislation so that the regulations imposed on the importation of timber products can be appropriately put into practice by local industry. Indeed, the first recommendation of the report by the Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade urged the government to continue to consult with the governments of Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea and other important stakeholders prior to the development of subordinate legislation under the bill. This Gillard Labor government is notorious for its ability to alienate foreign countries and it is doing so again. If we do not pass the coalition's amendment today, this bill could harm our bilateral trade relationships not only with Indonesia but also with Canada, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia, among many others. In their submissions to the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into this legislation, these countries were very clear. The Indonesian government's submission expressly said: The implementation of the Bill is…likely to undermine the development of trade between Indonesia and Australia based on our respective mutual interests. Indonesia noted the importance of forestry and the forest sector, and noted that the industry employs close to 'four million Indonesians often in rural areas where other forms of employment do not exist'. Clearly, Indonesia is willing to fight on this issue because it affects so many of its citizens. If Australia believed that another country were planning to impose deleterious unilateral trade restrictions on our exports, but we would, no doubt, fight just as strongly. Malaysia told the committee that while they understood: … that the objective of the Bill is laudable, Malaysia would like to see that the implementation of the Bill will not in any way hamper the good bilateral trade relationship particularly in timber products. The Canadian government's submission warned that any third party certification scheme and the reliance on strict chain-ofcustody certification could lead to a 'barrier to trade' for exporters of timber products. These are some of our most important trading partners. Indonesia is certainly Australia's largest neighbour and the single most important export market for our wheat and beef industries. We do not want to harm this important bilateral trade relationship any more than has been achieved by the Gillard Labor government. The worry I have is that this unilateral effort and blanket policy will damage our bilateral relationships. As the member for Curtin said previously, New Zealand, in their submission, noted the implementation of the bill had the potential to have a significant negative impact on New Zealand's forestry industry. As Judith Sloan commented in an article in the Australian on 15 May 2012, the point of trade policy insofar as it actually relates to trade should be used to promote international trade and should not be used to pursue other objectives, such as environmental aims. The coalition went to the 2010 election with a clear policy of real action for the prevention of illegal logging because we understand that illegal logging is a significant challenge to the global environment. We believe in deferring the time frame in which illegal logging measures will be fully rolled out, to allow industry to adapt to any new measures. The coalition believe that all impacted stakeholders should be consulted closely in the drafting of any legislation and regulations, which to date is still a major concern. I urge the government to address our concerns and support the coalition's amendment to defer the timing of this legislation.",119
207,Mr ADAMS,BILLS," I am very concerned that the coalition would oppose the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011. I was a part of the trade committee that went through the bills. I saw the last election promises by the coalition to ban illegal logging, to support bills in the parliament to stop illegal logging, to support the Australian manufacturing industry. They have now opposed that. They are now opposing these bills on some really false position. I am really concerned that the rest of the worldthe USA and the Europeans-is moving against illegal logging but not the coalition. Who has got to the coalition? The illegal loggers, I think. People who are making money out of bringing illegal logs, illegal wood and illegal furniture into Australia have got to them. Who is paying the bills? Who is making the donations to Liberal members and National Party members for elections? We ought to start looking at this. This is a turnaround from a promise at the last election. The promise was, 'We will oppose illegal timber and products coming into Australia.' Well, you have turned that around. You have turned that around with some spurious arguments like, 'We're worried about the trade with our neighbours,' when you know that the rest of the world is also moving against illegal logging. I heard the member for Grey say, 'Oh, well, we know that a bit of cash passes under the table to get the accreditation.' Do we accept that? Of course we do not accept that. That is not world best practice. That is not what we should accept. We know that Indonesia is moving toward accreditation systems, and we encourage them and we are helping them. But if we do not put up proper laws in this country we will be going backwards. We should be supporting these bills and getting them through the parliament. I am very disappointed that this attitude has been taken. The trade committee did look hard at this matter. It worked through the issues. We had a round-table with diplomatic and trade people from neighbouring countries, and we worked through issues that they had raised. That is the way it should have been. But this is our bill to protect Australia and to set a standard for our country for forestry workers, for the manufacturing sector of Australia. That is what these bills are about: setting the standard. Australia has a right to do that and it should be supported by the political parties, not with some spurious argument that is coming from the other side, just so they have an extension or some sort of differentiation. I am telling you that I will make sure that forest workers will understand in this country-and the large bulk of those that work in making furniture in Australia will also be well aware-that the coalition is not interested in having proper protection of their jobs and having proper processes which meet world standards, which is where we are going. As I said, we know that the rest of the world is moving down these lines. We need to seek an accreditation process so that when someone buys wood to sell in Australia it has an accreditation process on it. There are many different accreditation schemes, but one has to come up to the standards we are going to set for Australia. I cannot see what can be wrong with that. I cannot see why the opposition would be opposing this, unless there is some other reason. Maybe the member for Mayo will tell us that reason in an honest flurry from that side. I believe we should be supporting this bill and it should pass the House and the Senate.",122
208,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the amendment as well. Firstly, I will correct one thing the honourable parliamentary secretary said in his summation last Thursday, which was that I had said in my second reading speech that these bills should be tremendously amended but we would support their passage if our amendment was successful. I do not support the passage of this bill. I made that very in my contribution. I think this bill is a bad idea. I accept our party room's decision to allow this bill to pass after fighting for this amendment, but I think this is a bad way for us to proceed. That is because the member for Lyons just gave away what this bill is actually all about. This bill is not about environmental policy, as they will have you believe, as the parliamentary secretary will stand and try and have you believe; this bill is about protectionism. The member for Lyons just said exactly that, very clearly, in his contribution. This bill is about protecting what he says are important manufacturing industry jobs. I understand he believes that; I understand and accept that that is his view. He says, 'Who are the people who are telling us to have this position of supporting this amendment and opposing this bill?' Well, I have not spoken to anyone in this industry. I can make that very clear on the record. But I know that the member for Lyons has, because he was quoting pretty much from the CFMEU press release. That is who is telling this bloke what to say. That is who tells all of those people over there what to say. The donations from the CFMEU to that side of parliament would make you blush, Mr Deputy Speaker. And they have the gall to suggest that we are being paid by someone to oppose this bill. Give me strength, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Lyons is more honest than that. Others are not so much, but the member for Lyons is honest enough to admit that his contribution is paid for and endorsed by the CFMEU. That is who he is arguing for, and that is what this bill is all about. It is protectionism parading as environmental policy, which will do damage to trading arrangements in our area. In my contribution last week, as I spoke to the amendment that we moved to this bad clear bill, I made the comment that the parliamentary secretary at the table for the Pacific Islands, or whatever else they call him these days, has actually done some reasonable work in this area. I know that is not very popular amongst some of my colleagues and I have been chastised heavily, but I know getting that endorsement will assist him in his climb up the greasy pole, but he has done some important work with what are important regional neighbours. We want those neighbours to develop. We on this side certainly want Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,-I am not sure all those on the other side do-Malaysia and other countries who have got developing economies to do better. If they do better, they will have better certification processes to ensure that this practice, which we all agree must come to an end, will come to an end in a better fashion. Domestic Australian law will not do that. Using trade policy through domestic law will not prevent illegal logging occurring, as the parliamentary secretary for forests has been suggesting in response to the member for Bradfield's very pertinent points. He actually quoted from the bill, Parliamentary Secretary, and you did not answer his question-instead you came up with some flurry like, 'If the coalition's amendment is successful we'll have three more years of illegal logging.' I pose this question to you, Parliamentary Secretary-rise to your feet and answer itif this bill is successful, if it passes the and the Senate, will illegal logging stop? Of course it will not, but protection will come back. That is what the Labor Party is all about. They have chucked away the Hawke and Keating reforms, they have gone to the member for Lyons, they are quoting from the CFMEU-this is what it is all about. This is protectionism parading as environmental policy and I am ashamed of the member for Lyons because he has argued against this for years, against those Greens in Tasmania for years, for using trade policy and domestic law to pursue their environmental desires. And now the member for Lyons is wholly and solely with the Greens on this abomination of a bill. He should, I think, be ashamed of the position he is now taking because it will not assist his workers and it will not assist Australian consumers. It will cost them more, and it will not stop illegal logging. I want to hear the parliamentary secretary guarantee in this chamber, on his feet, that when this bill passes the practice of illegal logging in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and wherever else around the globe will cease. He cannot and he will not.",123
209,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I rise to address this consideration in detail. I would not be so kind as the member for Mayo in relation to the member for Lyons because part of the problem with this bill and this legislation is that the government of course is being driven by the Australian Greens. The member for Melbourne in his contribution to this debate said that he would like to see the definition of 'illegal timber' in the legislation expanded. He would like to see the due diligence requirements increased. Really what that reveals is that the executive arm of this government, the member for Melbourne and the Greens in the Australian Senate, are driving this agenda. And it is a Greens agenda, not a protection of jobs agenda. It just so happens that last night, Member House for Lyons, I saw a program on television about the Tasmanian tiger trail. They are trying to promote tourism there around the Tasmanian devil. It said quite reflectively, quite sombrely, that they had lamented locally the loss of so many timber workers in Tasmania. Why have they lost so many timber workers in Tasmania? It is because of the policies of the Australian Greens. So here we have a government that is driven by the Greens on one hand, saying: 'Let's expand the definition of ""illegal timber"". Let's stop logging altogether in the countries in our region because we are concerned about climate change,' and all of the things that the Greens are concerned about, and at the same time we have got the member for Lyons coming in here and saying, 'We've got to protect those few remaining timber workers that we've got in Tasmania.' That is the madness of a government that goes too far. The member for Mayo's points and questions are well made, in one sense. Does the parliamentary secretary think that passing this bill will stop illegal logging? Well, yes. The government here thinks that passing a bill called the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill will stop illegal logging. That is the problem with this government: that is all they think they have to do. Never mind the 'how'; it is always the 'what'. Do the opposition agree with illegal logging? Of course we do not. Do we oppose this bill? No. Do we oppose the intention of this bill? No, we do not, Member for Lyons. What we are concerned about is what is in the regulations, what the definition of 'illegal timber' is, and how a citizen or business complies with it. You cannot separate the 'what' of what you want to achieve from the 'how'. But this government has not grasped the 'how'. It never does grasp the 'how''We'll worry about the detail later. How will we stop illegal logging? Somehow'. It is not good enough to pass the bill in this form. That is why the opposition has proposed amendments-to allow time for proper consultation. When you read the Orwellian explanatory memorandum of this bill-which goes through the great detail of consultation with peak industry bodies and other groups that have been consulted, and how great the consultation is-you find that it is completely at odds with what you find in the attitudes to this legislation of people out there in the sector. When you go to our trading partners, whether you go to Papua New Guinea, Malaysia or Indonesia, you find that they have expressed concerns. Hardwood bodies in America or in other countries have said, 'Look, you can achieve what you are trying to achieve. Work with us.' Even in the explanatory memorandum it says-the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, who is at the table, would agree-that Australia 'may leverage greater regional government action on combating illegal logging and associated trade through regional capacity building and bilateral and multilateral efforts'. Hear, hear! Where are the bilateral and multilateral efforts here? Nobody in this place has come forward into this parliament and suggested a huge issue with domestic illegal logging of timber. Nobody has come in here and suggested that. This bill does not achieve the outcome that the government has so loudly vaunted. The member for Lyons has got up and said, 'We need to protect workers' jobs,' at the same time as he is in coalition with the Australian Greens, who want to broaden the definition of illegal timber, and make it harder to import timber of any nature into this country because they are fundamentally opposed to logging-full stop. Every tree has to be saved, according to the Australian Greens. How does the member for Lyons come in here and say, 'Let's use the laws of this country to protect the timber jobs that are left in Tasmania. At the same time, I'm in a government that has this Greens dominated policy, which is stripping back workers and jobs in my own state.' He needs to answer that question. But the parliamentary secretary needs to answer the question about how the government intends to stop illegal logging, just by passing a bill entitled Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill. He needs to say what the regulations will be and how this compliance will lead to a reduction in logging, and he needs to get across the detail. Every minister in this government is not across the detail, and this is another blinding example of government failure to produce the appropriate laws and regulations to back up what they are trying to achieve.",124
210,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (16:16): I thank all members for their contributions. In short, for all the verbosity from the other side, and the feigned interest in doing what is right by our international obligations and whatever else, all those opposite are doing is delaying this legislation in order to allow further illegal logging throughout the world. We join with others in seeking to introduce legislation to prohibit illegal logging and the importation of products that are illegally logged. If the member for Mayo thinks that that is a joke and if he thinks, in a Christensen, GR perverse way, that the importation of illegally sourced timber products does not affect industry, jobs and businesses in Australia then I feel very sorry for him. I think that somehow or other his ideology has driven him to the perverse argument which he put before this House a moment ago. We have had inquiry after inquiry and consultation after consultation, regionally and with our neighbours and trading partners. Indeed, time and time again we have had meeting after meeting with our trading partners over this legislation. The legislation seeks to do two things: to introduce a higher-bar entry to illegally sourced timber products into Australia, and, in the meantime, to work again with stakeholders and our partners to flesh out the regulations, which you are so pleased to say that you want to happen within three years. A three-year delay before regulations are introduced! We made a commitment in the last election and before to introduce such legislation as we have before us now, and I ask you to honour your commitment to that legislation, as we will. And you cannot honour your commitment if you support your own amendment.",125

NA Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Assent Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (16:35): The Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 is a bill which is largely technical in nature but, in the words of the minister responsible, it seeks to simplify the values of the public service from 15 down to five. They will be the terms: service, ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial. As he said, they are more succinct, memorable, easy to understand and will help the service to create an ethical high-performance culture. The one provision in this bill which I do not believe can in any way meet that high aim is the proposed amendment which would allow the Prime Minister of the day, on behalf of the Commonwealth, on terms and conditions as determined by the Prime Minister, to appoint a secretary of a department, who has resigned or whose period of office has come to an end, to any appointment that the Prime Minister may wish-and that could be an indefinite appointment. We in the coalition have proposed to amend the bill to delete those provisions. I flag that I will be moving those amendments in consideration in detail. I note that the government will be moving amendments in consideration in detail dealing with the original concept of a 'temporary employee' and with another provision, which the minister will no doubt himself explain. In discussions about the bill between me and the minister and his department, we have concluded that the government will accept my amendments and the opposition will agree to the government's amendments. Before I go on to explain precisely some of the provisions of the bill that we are accepting, it is important to outline why we feel so strongly about amending the bill so that the only people who will be able to be appointed by the Prime Minister as secretaries will remain as they are in the current act, the Public Service Act 1999, which provides that, if a government department is abolished, the secretary can appointed elsewhere and that, should a secretary have his or her term terminated by the Prime Minister, after appropriate investigation and reporting that person can be appointed elsewhere. We are concerned on two counts about the proposed extension of the ability to appoint secretaries. One of those is that we have precedent in New South Wales of the so called swingers list-a whole bunch of public servants, including secretaries, who no longer have a job and simply remain on the payroll. I think it reached something like 340 at one stage, and it is only now that Premier O'Farrell is in power that he is moving to reduce the list of people who are being paid for doing nothing. This provision would have allowed such a list to develop federally. Although people will say that that is nobody's intent, it is still something that we believe is highly undesirable, and accordingly we will be moving amendments to remove that provision. The second concern we have relates to the minister's words that I mentioned earlier: The proposed values-that the APS is committed to service, is ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial-are more succinct and memorable, easy to understand, and will help the service to create an ethical, high-performance culture. It is always essential that the public service can be relied upon for fair and impartial advice that ministers can act upon. Having been a minister in the previous government, I can tell you it is very valuable to have. Introducing this provision would mean that a particular secretary, by being obsequious to a Prime Minister of the day, could seek to resign and be appointed to a position indefinitely which would be to their personal benefit. This is also against the intent of the act as a whole. The difficulty has shown be itself. We have had one example of it. Because there is no provision in the Public Service Act to appoint a secretary who has resigned or whose term has come to an end, the mechanism that has been used on this occasion has been section 67 of the Constitution. The Constitution allows for the appointment by the Governor General of persons to positions as advisers, and this has the been utilised by the Prime Minister in the case of the former head of the Treasury. What has happened in that circumstance has made it very public. The terms and conditions upon which Mr Henry has been appointed are as follows: ii. the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet be the approving authority for the Special Adviser to the Prime Minister for leave, including long service leave; iii. for any period that the Special Adviser performs the duties of that office on a full-time basis (40 hours per week), the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for the Special Adviser be the same as those that apply to the person who holds the position of Secretary of the Department of the Treasury at the relevant time; iv. the Prime Minister may agree that the duties of the Special Adviser are to be performed on a part-time basis; and v. for any period that the Special Adviser performs the duties on a part-time basis, the remuneration referred to in clause (c)(iii) above be payable, and other entitlements accrue, on a pro-rata basis. The problem is that this appointment as a special adviser was made under the hand of Her Excellency on 21 April 2011 but it was some five months later before it was eventually decided that there was work for him to do, on the Asian white paper. In the meantime, as of 15 March 2012, the head of Treasury would had an income of $615,000 a year, rising to $653,000 on 1 July 2012 and to $805,000 on 1 July 2014. On 14 February, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet told Senate estimates that Dr Henry was working 2½ days a week. I have received a letter from the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, from Mr Dreyfus, dated 14 August 2012, in answer to questions that I asked in consideration of detail of the appropriations bill. It says that, as at 27 July 2012, Dr Henry had worked 69 days in total since 5 January at an average of 2½ days a week and that no decisions have yet been taken regarding any future projects in Mr Henry's capacity as Special Adviser to the Prime Minister. That means that, as at 1 July 2012, his remuneration will be $326,500; as at 1 January 2013, $345,500; and, if the appointment continues-and there is no end to this appointment-by 1 July he will be receiving, presuming he remains on 2½ days a week, $402,500. In addition to that, Mr Henry is permitted to take on other work in the private sector, and he has taken on a position as a director of the National Australia Bank. That would seem to many of us to be a position of conflict of interest but it has been disclosed, as his appointment requires, and he continues in that role as well. We believe that the provision put into the act could have facilitated many more appointments like this. Many of them would have gone largely unknown, because section 67 would not have had to be used. There are some good things in the legislation which are worthy of response and support. The commissioner will be now known as the Australian Public Service Commissioner, and greater powers do come to him. He is given the power to delegate authority to people who will be able to carry out investigations for him where the workload, were it to be done properly, would simply be too large. Code of conduct amendments will apply in connection with an employee's employment. Section 13(11) of the act is amended to require employees to behave in a way that upholds the integrity and the good reputation of their agency, as well as the APS-which is the current requirement-and to comply with the proposed employment principles as well as the APS values. A section includes provisions to require agency heads to establish procedures for an Australian Public Service employee to make a whistleblower report and for agency heads to deal with such reports, and provides a regulation making power to prescribe basic procedural requirements that must be complied with by the Public Service Commissioner or a delegate in dealing with whistleblower reports. This amendment will provide that regulations may prescribe circumstances in which agency heads, or the commissioner, may decline to conduct, or may decide to discontinue, an inquiry. Another part deals with temporary employment. In the original legislation there were only to be two categories of employees-ongoing and temporary. The government has found, on advice, that this was a difficult provision to sustain proposing amendments which will take us back basically to the previous position. Confidentiality of information was also of concern to the government and there are related amendments. It is now provided that persons who are conducting inquiries will also have the cover of being protected. There is an amendment to the legislative instruments section that provides directionmaking powers for the Public Service Commissioner to allow the commissioner the discretion to issue directions on employment matters relating to all Australian Public Service employees, including employees, on matters such as engagement, promotion, redeployment, mobility, training schemes and termination. There are some miscellaneous amendments which relate to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, and they are supported by the opposition. The current provision is a prohibition on reduction rather than active power, and this has caused some confusion. with respect to the delegation of power. I go back to the original point that I wanted to make, that much of this bill is endeavouring to be aspirational in terms of upholding integrity and not bringing the public service or an agency into disrepute. The current legislation does not allow a prime minister of the day to appoint a former secretary who has resigned, or whose appointment has come to an end, to any position he or she may choose for an indefinite period of time. There are two reasons for this, as I have already said-first, that it could encourage the creation of a list of so-called swingers, or the unattached list as it was known in New South Wales, and, secondly, because it could undermine those high aspirational ideals whereby a secretary of the day could wish to be subservient to a government of the day with the aim of and it is securing employment. I place on record-particularly because of some debate that has taken place in this chamber recently concerning the determination that the Independents chose to listen to in order that they would support the government and not vote against the appropriation bills and would give an undertaking that they would not vote on a motion of no confidence-that we sought to have our costings done by an independent source because we believed that Treasury had become politicised. That was in order until such time as the hung parliament was SES evident and the Independents required a briefing from Treasury-from Mr Henry himself-to tell them about the costings of the coalition's policies. In our costings, we had identified savings of $2.5 billion against the conservative bias allowance, which is the allowance in the budget papers for corrections with regard to new policy-a buffer, you might call it. In that case, the $2.5 billion was disallowed, for want of a better term, by Mr Henry. He said that the allowance was a buffer and therefore could not be the source of any actual budgetary savings. But, in the 2009-10 budget, Mr Henry himself claimed $4.6 billion in savings over the forward estimates from that conservative bias allowance. We had claimed that $3.3 billion could be saved from across the Health and Hospitals Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund. Mr Henry disallowed that. He said that, to claim the savings, we would have had to have identified, prior to the election, which programs were to be cut. He then said there was a secret list of programs-we had asked for that list and he said that it was secret that he would not release it prior to the election, despite having been asked for it. Then we came to the NBN, where we claimed $2.4 billion of savings. We said there would be a saving on borrowings because we would not be borrowing the same amount and that there would therefore be savings in interest. We calculated that saving using an interest rate of 5.5 per cent. Mr Henry said no, that he had decided that the going rate for the future would be 4.9 per cent and that he would therefore disallow our claimed amount as a saving. The only problem is that, at the time-in September, when I checked and first talked about these things-the rate was in fact 5.23 per cent. Next we came to the question of returning people to work and the resultant saving on welfare payments. We said we would save $600 million, but Mr Henry said no to that on the basis that it was a second-round figure. But Mr Henry himself had used a second-round saving of $600 million for the government's purposes with regard to the mining tax. Then we came to the question of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, where possible savings of up to 40 per cent had been identified by the government prior to the election. But the government had chosen to use savings of only 23 per cent. So we said there was an additional 17 per cent, valued at $1.15 billion. But Mr Henry said no, our savings could not be allowed, and that therefore there was a further hole in our budget. It is interesting to note that, since Mr Henry disallowed that saving, the government itself has actually booked the $1.15 billion for its own savings. Those amounts added up to $9.95 billion-and the figure for what Mr Henry said was a black hole in our accounts was $11 billion. Mr Windsor could not wait to and get on television and say that, because there was a big hole in our budget and we could not do our accounting properly, he would have to vote for the government. From all of this, I think one can see that the impartiality of the Treasury and of other agencies and departments is essential if we are to have trust in the sorts of figures being produced. The bottom line is that, if we did not move our amendments, we might again see instances of people seeking to serve the interests of the government of the day rather than the public interest. We do not think that would represent good policy, particularly when the whole of the bill is designed to be aspirational in nature. I am pleased to say that, when we come to the consideration in detail, at which time we will be moving our amendments and the government will be moving their amendments, we have agreed that each of us will accept the other's amendments to allow the bill to go forward and keep its aspirational nature intact. We trust that will help to make reality those memorable words the minister used: The proposed values-that the APS is committed to service, is ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial-are more succinct and memorable, easy to understand, and will help the service to create an ethical, high-performance culture. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (16:57): I am pleased to be speaking on the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 as it gives me the opportunity to talk about the excellent work that that fine body of men and women who populate the Australian Public Service do on behalf of the Australian people and the government of Australia, day in and day out. Around 120,000 of them turn up to work to make our airports safe, to patrol our coasts, to ensure that pensioners and family benefit recipients have their payments made and their inquiries answered, to ensure that tax returns are done on time and that people pay as much tax as they should and no more than they ought, and to ensure that members of the Australian Defence Force are properly supported in farflung places of the globe as indeed they should be. I should also mention that excellent work of the men and women who assist in providing services to this House. The bill implements some of the changes recommended in the report, Ahead of the game: blueprint for reform of Australian government administration. The report arose out of the Moran review of the Australian Public Service, a review I had a little bit to do with in a former life. On 8 May 2010, the then Prime Minister announced that the government had accepted all recommendations of the report. This bill takes forward some of recommendations for a contemporary employment framework which will help give the APS greater agility and help make it more responsive to the community and to government. Implementation of these reforms will result in greater efficiency and a more effective use of Commonwealth resources. It will facilitate and accelerate the cultural shift of the APS towards operating, as the minister said in his second reading speech, 'more effectively as one Australian Public Service'. The amendments in the bill are an important part of modernising the Australian Public Service to ensure it has the capacity to cope with the challenges of the future. In every single one of the challenges we face as a nation, the Australian Public Service is at the front line in delivering both the policy advice and the services that will assist us as a nation in confronting those challenges. The amendments will reposition the Public Service Commissioner and the APSC to deliver on the broad reform goals of the public service workplace. The bill will empower secretaries and the leadership group to deliver on the policy goals of the government through greater independence in operation and greater accountability in performance. There are three significant sets of amendments in the bill. Part 1 of schedule 1 to the bill provides new descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of secretaries, particularly in relation to their stewardship of the Australian Public Service. The revised descriptions make clear the service and performance expected of secretaries, and strengthen secretaries' accountability to their ministers in the performance of their role and in discharging their responsibilities. The new, proposed section 61A of the act the requires an annual review of the performance of a secretary to be carried out in accordance those with a framework established by the modern, secretary of the Prime Minister's department and the Public Service Commissioner. This will provide greater accountability, transparency and oversight of the performance of secretaries. The second set of measures will reposition the Public Service Commissioner and the APSC to deliver on broad reform goals and increase their responsibility for Australian government policies on APS agreement making and on pay and conditions. The commissioner will have three broad functions. The first is to strengthen the professionalism of the APS and facilitate contentious, sorry, continuous improvement-probably contentious improvements as well!-in workforce management in the APS. The second is to uphold high standards of integrity and conduct in the APS. The third is to monitor, review and report on APS capabilities within and between agencies to promote high standards of accountability, effectiveness performance. The bill specifically recognises the commissioner's role as the central authority for APS workforce development and reform. The third set of measures represent a revision of the APS values. The blueprint recognised the power of values as a foundation for reform and thus took the opportunity to revise the APS values as a means of assisting cultural change, which would in turn help to achieve the desired APS performance. The values and the employment principles are statements about the essential character and philosophy of the APS. They define what the APS is and how it should operate. These amendments seek to implement the blueprint's recommendations to revise the APS values and to establish APS leadership groups. The APS values are to be revised in order to replace the current set of 15 with a shorter set of five, and to introduce a set of employment principles. They are: committed to service, ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial-hard to cavil at any of these being employment principles. The proposed APS values employment principles together capture the essence of the existing 15 values, blending contemporary ethics with enduring principles of public administration that go to the heart of the Westminster model. No important concepts have been lost. Agency heads and APS employees will be required to uphold the values and the employment principles. Agency heads and SES employees will also be required to promote them, reflecting the key responsibility that they have as leaders within their agencies to set the tone for the right culture. It is important that we continually review the legislation that enshrines employment arrangements and the performance of work within the Australian Public Service. It is and one of our most important and enduring institutions. From time to time, the capacity of the public service is stretched to breaking point. One of the important functioning principles that we as a government have adopted is ensuring that we run a tight budget and that we return the budget to surplus as promised, and I know that this has placed a degree of strain on public service agencies. But I know with equal force that the men and women of the public service are committed to delivering services on behalf of the Australian government to the people of Australia. Of course, a tight fiscal environment is not the only threat facing the men and women of the Australian Public Service. We know that there are alternative proposals as to how the APS should be regulated and funded. For example, we know that, if the opposition come to government at the next election, they will make huge cuts to the Australian Public Service in order to fund the $70 billion black hole in their policy costings. This was confirmed as recently as today by the Leader of the Opposition. They have a mammoth target. Make no mistake: to be and able to bring in anything like the $70 billion of savings that will be necessary for them to meet their commitments, they will have to take to the Australian Public Service with scissors to a degree that has never been seen before. We have had a taste of what coalition policies mean for the public service around the country. We have seen what their state colleagues are doing in Queensland, for example, where a recently elected Premier, without forewarning, is taking to that public service. Against the promises and assurances made that front-line services would not be under attack, we are seeing exactly that in Queensland today in the health system, in the education system, in the public transport system-in fact, there is no sector in the Queensland public service that will escape the scourge of public sector job cuts. In New South Wales, my own state, we are seeing the shape of that looming up as well as the O'Farrell government starts to take a cleaver to front-line services. The people of New South Wales are starting to see frontline services at risk because of the ideological desire to slash public sector and front-line jobs. It is disturbing that the coalition seems, some of the statements that have been made by some of the opposition spokespeople, to be embracing the policies of the UK Prime Minister David Cameron's guru Phillip Blond, who seems to be in vogue at the moment. Mr Blond has been advising the coalition about the notion of the so-called 'big society'. There is every sign that the coalition is adopting this conservative government approach to our public services in Australia. We have already heard the family spokesperson saying that a coalition government would cut federal oversight of aged care, child care, employment and family services. We have seen the devastating impact on recipients of aged-care services unless you have a strong cop on the beat, ensuring that those most vulnerable people in our community, people who are reliant on federally funded aged-care services, childcare services, health care and the like are not kept on their game by strong federal oversight. People in this country will have a lot to fear if there is an adoption of the Blond approach to public sector administration. It is a failed approach. Since it was adopted in the UK, 7,000 charities have been forced to close the door. This is the agenda which seeks to enliven civil society. Have no doubt about it: the 'big society' agenda is nothing more than a big smoke screen for slashing government services and the people who provide those services. I would like to make a few observations in response to what was said by the member for Mackellar just recently. One of the measures in this bill which I think has merit is the one which enables the Prime Minister to reemploy former secretaries of APS departments to bring them back into service and to ensure that they may commit their in knowledge and expertise in the service of the Australian people and the Australian government. We saw an example of that most recently when Ken Henry, a man who has served all sides of politics in this country with great distinction and a man who sometimes has been defamed in this place for the advice he has given to government, has been re-engaged by the Prime Minister to assist in bringing together the Australia in the Asian century white paper to bring dozens of years in economic and social policy advice to bear on that important issue. When that report is finally released I know it will be a great contribution to public policy debate in this country. I listened carefully to the member for Mackellar's objection to putting in place within the Public Service Act just that sort of arrangement-as I listen carefully to all the comments the member for Mackellar makes in this space. It does not sit easily with her track record that the objections were that somehow you would have a lack of security in the top echelons of the Australian Public Service. The words used were 'a swingers list'. I have to say that the word 'swinger the Australian Public Service are not generally used in the same sentence around this place. That sits very uneasily with their track record in government. Let us contrast what happened when Labor was elected to government in 2007. You never saw a night of the long knives, but when the coalition government was elected in 1996 you did see a night of the long knives. In the first 12 months, APS departmental secretaries in their dozens were axed from their jobs, as were almost 16,000 public servants. The coalition's objections are hollow. The bill is a good one and should be adopted in its totality. I commend the legislation to the House.",128
218,Mr SIMPKINS,BILLS," It is nice to have the opportunity to speak tonight on the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, given the very wide-ranging debate which has been allowed to occur after the comments by the member for Throsby. When I was looking around for some media commentary or discussion on this bill, there really was not much there. This bill has not inspired too many people in the general public. When we look back we see that the second reading speech by the minister was made on 1 March 2012. I am not sure it has inspired the government either, given the length of time it has taken to bring the debate back to the House-some 5½ months have transpired. The panel which created this report headed the Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of the Australian government administration was originally commissioned, as I understand, in September 2009. A panel comprised almost entirely of senior public servants were asked to have a look at the public service. The report was commissioned and the report was released on 2 March 2010-again, a little while ago now. 'and On 8 May 2010, 25 months ago, then Prime Minister Rudd said he had accepted all of the recommendations of the panel and their report. But, of course, shortly thereafter, unfortunately for the then Prime Minister, he was no longer the Prime Minister. But in any case there has been quite a delay, so their priorities have obviously been elsewhere. I think it is agreed that we all need to be very carefully about the need to strengthen leadership in the Australian Public Service, because, ultimately, the Australian Public Service serves the people and the government of the day, whose policies need to be enacted. It goes to the public service to initiate and bring those policies to this place in the form of bills, and then ultimately to implement those policies on the ground. I am not quite sure I agree with the member for Throsby's comments that the public service is on the forefront of every big thing that has happened in the country. I am not so sure I would say that was the case. Really, the public service exists to bring the policies the government puts before the election-or in the case of this government, after the election as well-to the point of initiation and implementation. It is important that we be very clear that the public service should not in any case be political or self-serving. It behoves the government to ensure that their actions do not politicise the public service in any way. A public service that is seen to be politically partisan in its activities undermines confidence in the public service. That is obviously not the case with the public service. We have confidence in so much of what the public service does. But government and the public service should be very careful in the way the public service is seen to be performing its duties. The shadow minister, the member for Mackellar, has conducted negotiations with the government minister. This has seen an agreement that there will be coalition amendments that will be accepted by the government and government amendments that will be accepted by the coalition. That is very good news. In this country, sadly, there is a history of certain appointments having been made by governments. I look back not very far to the Labor government of New South Wales and the creation of a burgeoning unallotted list, which constituted $16 million in salaries each year for SES or very senior public servants who were employed but were not actually required to do any work. So it is probably par for the course that the original concept of this bill, before the amendments had been agreed on, would have seen this government given the opportunity to create such a list. When we speak of such a list, and the idea of being given a pay grade but no actual responsibilities, it is exactly the sort of thing that can create a perception of loyalties to those who created the list or brought people onto it. I think that is very clearly a bad idea for a public service, because it will in some ways create the view that there is a level of loyalty owed to those who make the appointments. As the member for Mackellar said after the last election, one thing that had interesting implications was when Dr Henry provided a certain level of advice to the Independents, which undermined and cast doubt upon some of the election figures of the coalition, yet, not long after that, allowed those figures when the government needed the figures to match up for them. Then, he resigned as Treasury Secretary and received an appointment from the Prime Minister, again for quite a deal of money, as I recallon a pro rata basis for part-time. I think it was some $307,000 a year. If you create a system whereby people can be appointed again on an unallotted list-can be appointed to do a particular task-and the Prime Minister gets the opportunity to make those appointments, it can be highly desirable for a person to seek one of those appointments. When you have an important public service position involving an important role in the postelection administration dealing with the Independents and you then go to a government appointed position at the end of the earlier appointment, there is the possibility that some people might perceive that as being something of a conflict of interest. That is very bad for the public service. It is such a good thing that the Special Minister of State has listened to the shadow minister, the member for Mackellar, and has seen the light in this regard. It was a great example of what actually happened, with regard to Dr Henry. We now see, and maybe the government can also see, that there is a level of risk that it might undermine the position of the public service, or senior members of the public service. As I said earlier, it is obviously clear to the public service that it must remain impartial, but it is also right for the government of either persuasion not to put people in a position which would cause the public to have less confidence in the impartiality of the public service. It is certainly good that those amendments have been agreed to and that we will see them come up during the consideration-in-detail stage of this bill. I appreciate the opportunity to make some comments on this matter tonight, and I appreciate the government embracing the amendments that the member for Mackellar has put forward. I think that we will have a much improved bill as a result.",136
219,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," It gives me great pleasure to speak tonight about this important bill, the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, which is designed to improve the way the Australian Public Service responds to the challenges of the future. This bill and the proposed amendments to it are very significant in terms of modernising the Australian Public Service. As the member for Canberra, I proudly represent thousands and thousands of public servants. I am always enormously pleased when the Labor government delivers improvements to the public service; in this case, measures that ensure the public service has the capability to better manage information. I am a fierce advocate for our public service and for the people who work extremely hard to implement government policy and keep our country ticking. The technical amendments contained in this legislation ensure that both the Public Service Commissioner and the Australian Public Service Commission are able to deliver on wide-ranging reforms that will benefit public service workplaces. Specifically, this legislation will empower secretaries and others in leadership groups to provide a much greater range of independence and accountability in the delivery of policies. The amendments proposed to this bill will clarify the roles responsibilities of secretaries. These measures will spell out the services and the performance that is expected of secretaries and will, additionally, strengthen secretaries' accountability to ministers. There are specific amendments to the employment arrangements for secretaries in this bill. Very importantly, amendments revise the APS values. They also introduce a set of employment principles that will assist in unifying the APS around an ethical, high-performance culture. The amendments will also modernise the functions of the Public Service Commissioner and recognise the commissioner's role as the central authority for APS workforce development and reform. This legislation continues the Gillard government's agenda of improving and enhancing the Australian Public Service. The Gillard Labor government have ensured that we have a strong public service. We will continue to build a strong public service. I will continue to advocate for a strong and stable public service. We will always make sure the public service is able to tackle current challenges while keeping growth under tight control. As every member here knows, I am a passionate and strong advocate for Canberra, for the Australian Public Service and also for the ADF. The reason the public service needs to be defended is the threats and attacks to its integrity and performance by those opposite. The opposition have made an art form out of attacking the Australian Public Service and the integrity of the people who work there. Neither the Australian public nor the Australian Public Service can afford what those opposite could potentially subject the public sector to, particularly in terms of their boom-bust mentality. The budget surplus that the government is committed to will create a buffer against any and further global economic turmoil and, however difficult this budget will be, it will not lead to the feast and famine experience that I witnessed first hand in the 1990s when the Howard government randomly slashed almost 30,000 jobs across the public service and across the nation, and then had to expand public service numbers because of the these damage done by those cuts. The coalition thinks that Canberra-bashing and demeaning the public service is a good thing. I am constantly in committees where I hear of numbers floating around-for example, there is a commitment from those opposite to cut 12,000 jobs, but then it gradually increases. I hear that DMO is going to be added to the list, then I hear another government agency is going to be added to the list, and then another-it just keeps going up and up. We are probably up to about 20,000 on the public record but, from conversations I have had with those opposite, I think it is back up to about 30,000, which is what we experienced in 1996 nationally. What that meant for Canberra was that we lost between 15,000 and 20,000 public service jobs. That is about two or three suburbs in my electorate. What that meant for Canberra was that house prices plummeted, people left town, and the only real growth industry was removalists. It also meant that we had a few seasons of negative growth when the rest of Australia was growing. As well as the huge knock-on effect here, with house prices plummeting and the local shops closing down, it also had a significant knock-on effect in the region. One only need speak to my colleague, the member for Eden-Monaro, to understand that. What we saw was a ripple effect right throughout the capital region-because Canberra is a regional hub. It depends on the service, but in some instances we provide up to 50 per cent of services to the region. I think in cancer treatment, we provide up to 50 per cent of treatment for the region; in health, is between 30 and 50 per cent; in education, between 30 and 50 per cent. We provide a range of services to the region and we also employ a lot of people in the region. When you are looking at the loss of 15,000 to 20,000 jobs, as we experienced in 1996and I was one of those jobs-then the impact is significant not only for Canberra but also for the region. At the coast we saw that about two-thirds of the houses were on the market-because of the huge regional knock-on effect: on jobs, on house values and on economic growth. When I go out and do my mobile offices that and my community forums, one of the things that my constituents are really concerned about is an Abbott led government, because they know about coalition governments from past, bitter experience. In 1996 farewells were held en masse-every Friday you would go to farewell for 10 or 12 people who had lost their jobs. My constituents know and understand what a coalition government can mean for Canberra because they had first hand experience of it in 1996. That is when we were plunged into an era in which there were a number of quarters of negative growth, and it took us about five years to get out of it. But we have huge infrastructure programs here now. There are BER programs, there are roads being built and there are cranes on the horizon, whereas I cannot remember having seeing a crane on the horizon in Canberra in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is wonderful to see so much growth and investment in this city thanks to Labor. There is investment in roads-in the Monaro Highway and in the Majura Parkway-and there is investment in a number of government buildings and in BER programs. There is significant investment in Canberra because Labor is committed to Canberra. This legislation builds on the capacity of it the public service to modernise and meet future challenges. It does not look at the public service as just an expense to which an axe needs to be taken. We rely on a strong and vibrant public sector, and we value it. I remind those listening this evening of the jobs that the men and women of the Australian Public Service do. They perform enormously important functions and do so very quietly. They are the silent heroes; that is what I think I called them in my first speech to the parliament. They are the invisible heroes-they go about their business quietly and serve the nation. They try to make a difference and improve lives quietly at the local level, at the national level and at the international level. Public servants provide our health and aged-care services, deliver to the sick and frail, manage our food production from the farm to the table, educate our children, build our universities and our higher education sector, and ensure that our workplaces are safe and fair-and the list goes on and on. I have highlighted the huge contrast between those opposite and Labor on the public service. We will always support the incredible dedication and hard work of Australian public servants by improving the way they operate, and this bill goes a long way towards doing so. We have introduced legislation today which will improve and enhance the operations of the Australian Public Service. We are committed to the public service and public servants. We alone recognise and support the thousands of public servants who serve their country every day in so many invisible and quiet ways. This bill will improve the operations of the public service and provide it with better capacity to manage future challenges. I commend the bill to the House.",138
220,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Public Service Amendment Bill. In preparing to do this I read the report Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration to see what propositions were being included; I also read the explanatory memorandum to the public service bill. I agree that many changes were proposed to the legislation by the report which will modernise the public sector and create a sense of change and reform-and this will be to the betterment of the country. The Public Service Amendment Bill makes a number of amendments to the code of conduct for public servants and to the changing values and employment principles for APS employees, both of which are specified in the Public Service Act 1999. The Public Service Amendment Bill has been introduced in response to the report Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration, which was released in March 2010. The bill aims 'to strengthen the management and leadership of the public service and embed new practices and behaviours in its culture'. I think that all of us in this chamber would agree that doing so is an absolutely necessary undertaking, because the public service provides advice and direction to ministers, and this shapes the policies and key strategic services and programs as well as the interrelatedness that exists within a federation. To that extent, the public service fills its role tremendously. The report Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration proposes reform to the Australian public sector in four key areas. The first is: … forge a stronger relationship with citizens through better delivery of services and greater involvement of citizens in their government … If the legislation enhances this, then our implementation of the legislation has significant merit. The second is: … strengthen the capacity of the public service to provide strategic, big-picture policy and delivery advice addressing the most difficult policy challenges of the day … The third is: … invest in the capability of the public service workforce through improved recruitment and training processes, greater mobility and alignment of working conditions across agencies, and a new, more consistent approach to employee performance … I would assume that all the members of the Senior Executive Service would be subject, as much as were other public servants, to such requirements so that, if they were working on contract, they would then on merit apply for the position again and that, if they won the position, they would be appointed in accordance with normal prevailing practice. We have seen some variation to this practice, and this is of concern. When you give unfettered power to an individual or a small group of individuals, some practices come into play that are not consistent with merit selection processes in the public sector. The report also states:  introduce a stronger focus on efficiency and quality to ensure agencies are agile, capable and effective, backed up by measures to help them plan and improve their performance. The blueprint recommends nine key interdependent reforms which seek to deliver better service for citizens; create more open government; enhance policy capacity; reinvigorate strategic leadership; introduce a new public service commission to drive change and provide strategic planning; clarify and align employment conditions; strengthen workforce planning development; ensure agency agility, capability and effectiveness; and improve agency efficiency. I would have thought that our current public sector does a lot of that now. Under the tweaking, the one that excites me most is its responsiveness in the way in which it will engage with citizens, the private sector and relevant sectors for which it develops programs, policies and strategies that will make a difference to the lives of all Australians. Let me assure you that many constituents in all electorates will welcome these changes if they happen uniformly. But, equally, let me assure you that they will be very cynical and will continue with their anger and frustration. It is an opportunity to create ongoing employment for senior public servants outside their contract, guaranteeing them a continuance in employment with no significant change in salary. The recent Ken Henry appointment reflects this to some extent. That is where I have constituents raise with me the golden opportunities that are given to individuals within senior executive positions and the salaries that continue beyond the expired contract into new roles, where appointments are often seen as political. Every Australian would love the opportunity to go into a new role without having to go through a merit selection process, because people see themselves as having skills commensurate to the types of tasks required for the jobs in the public sector. Every Australian worker knows that, on the expiration of a contract, they are without a job until they find another through a process of competing, on merit, for a new position within an organisation. They would love the opportunity to be directly appointed to a high-salaried position without going through that process. The blueprint sets an ambitious and interlinked reform agenda that and seeks to improve services, programs and policies for Australian citizens. Above all, it recognises that, to be strong, the APS must make the most of the talents, energy and integrity of its people. I would have thought the appointment processes would require integrity whereby, once you finish a contract, you compete for a position on merit and undertake that role. I have been in the position where, as a public servant, you look to the whole fabric of integrity within the bureaucracies you work in. The proposed reforms therefore seek to boost and support the APS workforce and leadership and to embed new practices and behaviour into the APS culture. I do not have a problem with that. I think it has significant merit. Of concern, however, this bill will give the Prime Minister greater power to extend the employment of departmental secretaries, allowing the Prime Minister to create new positions for secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. Wouldn't it be great if we could offer the same opportunity to every Australian in the workplace, so they did not have to compete and could be given high-salaried positions on a basis equal to that proposed? The Prime Minister recently did this when Mr Ken Henry resigned from his position as Secretary of Treasury in April 2011, being appointed as a 'special adviser' under section 67 of the Constitution. The unattached list is common practice in the public sector at both national and state and territory levels, and there are people who have spent considerable time on unattached lists receiving salaries provided by the taxpayers and the battling families of Australia. I would hope it is not a practice that will see the transition of retired members or secretaries into special appointments without a merit selection process. I acknowledge that we have to seek skills and expertise when we assign a task that requires thinking outside the square. But there are other ways in which we have done it successfully in the past. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, in his 2020 forums, sought the views of ordinary Australians and people with jobs and specialised knowledge in particular areas to be part of the forward thinking that he had in mind when he established the Rudd government's credentials in the period in which he led government. I did not see him appoint particular advisers to continually give him advice. Should this legislation be passed, the Prime Minister will have the power to create similar roles for any secretary who resigns or whose contract has expired. I wonder if that would apply to somebody who reapplied for their position but did not win it on merit and were given the opportunity of being slotted into a plum role. The coalition does not oppose the body of the bill. At present the Prime Minister only has the power to appoint departmental secretaries to another role if their department has been abolished or if she has terminated them from their position, both being rare occurrences in the current public sector. The changes to section 60 will allow the Prime Minister to appoint departing departmental secretaries to new roles should they resign or when their terms of service expire and are not renewed. This has the potential to be the beginning of a practice similar to the New South Wales unattached list, which applies at the chief and SES levels. Another interesting thing I read was that there would be minimal financial implications, although the report itself states: In a number of areas, reform would require an upfront investment. For example, a new funding model would be required to support the APSC's additional responsibilities, including the coordination of workforce planning and agency capability reviews. Similarly the citizen-centred reforms, such as developing and establishing an APS-wide citizen survey, would require some resourcing early on. Over the long term, however, it is anticipated that the reforms (when implemented as a package), would deliver efficiencies and a return on investment. By building capacity and improving effectiveness, several reforms will drive effectiveness and efficiency gains across the APS such as reducing the burden of internal red tape. All the way through, the report is embedded with some tremendous thinking around the changes that are required, but it does not diminish the importance of public servants. What diminishes the importance of the process is the way in which this legislation will allow the Prime Minister-it does not matter whether it is a coalition or Labor government-to make appointments outside of the normal, expected behaviour that has predominantly governed the way in which appointments are made in the public sector. I support the coalition's proposition to amend the legislation by removing changes to section 60 of the Public Service Act, which will allow the Prime Minister to extend the terms of departmental secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. I support the sentiments expressed by the member for Canberra that public servants do play a key and vital role, that their pathways and their career progression are certainly based on merit standards. It is based on a set of criteria and they know with certainty that they have the opportunity to apply and be part of their or another agency. I think there are many meritorious elements of Ahead of the game, but I certainly could not support a proposition that gave unfettered power to a prime minister to appoint whoever. Sometimes within the public sector you do not have the particular type of knowledge or skill that is required in the shaping of a strategic direction or the detailed advice in respect of legislation. This could apply to specialised areas of advancing scientific fields, such as gene technology. In those instances there is not a problem in bringing in the right people to provide the level of advice. We have used committees effectively for that range of expert advice without having to appoint a retired or senior public servant-secretaries in particular-at the whim of a prime minister. It is better that have integrity within the public sector and that we never diminish it.",140
221,Ms PARKE,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the government's Public Service Amendment Bill. The bill is significant in that it is part of the government's ongoing program of measures to strengthen the integrity professionalism of the Australian Public Service-a cause to which this government and preceding Labor governments have made major contributions over the past four decades. The bill represents part of the government's response to the report, Ahead of the game: Blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration, prepared by the advisory group on Reform of Australian Government Administration. In particular, the bill captures the blueprint 's recommendation that APS values be revised and restated as a 'smaller set of core values that are meaningful, memorable, and effective in driving change'. This recommendation was based on extensive consultation by the advisory group among APS staff and the wider community. It is this focus on 'core values' which I wish to concentrate on in my remarks today. On 8 May 2010, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the government had accepted all of the recommendations in the blueprint report, and said in particular: We are committed to building an Australian Public Service with a culture of independence, excellence and innovation-in policy advice and service delivery. From my personal experience as a UN official, in which capacity I was closely involved with the creation of the UN Ethics Office, and from my current role as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I am well aware of we the need for strong organisational efforts to give meaning to ethics codes and standards. Anyone who has worked in any organisation will know from experience, or from common sense, that merely publishing a code of conduct will not, of itself, entrench ethical practice. As management guru Chester Barnard observed as long ago as 1928, and competent and committed leadership in managing the values of the organisation is an essential function of the executive in any enterprise. Former Australian Public Service Commissioner Andrew Podger made much the same point in his State of the Service report for 2004, when he observed that the APS values needed to be strengthened by institutionalising them in the day-today practices and procedures of departments. This is necessarily a task for the leadership which the bill addresses directly. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, the core values of a public service are the basis for judgement about what is proper and improper in serving the public interest: Values, stated in public documents (such as legislation), shape citizens' expectations about the mission and activities of public sector organisations. There is also a growing recognition that public servants are not solely motivated by financial rewards for performance, and that public service values play a role in promoting the performance and integrity of government. It is appropriate, therefore, that part 1 of schedule 1 to this bill provides new and enhanced roles and responsibilities for APS departmental secretaries, particularly in relation to their stewardship of the Australian Public Service's professional values. The bill strengthens secretaries' accountability to ministers in performing their roles and discharging their responsibilities. The bill's changes enhance both the independence of the processes for appointment and termination of departmental secretaries and the continuity of departmental leadership by countering perceptions that secretaries' terms in office may be tied to the electoral cycle. It is perhaps not surprising that the many complex challenges facing the Australian Public Service today attract less public attention than those other major issues which engage most Australians. What is happening in the One Day International? Who is winning in the NRL or the AFL? Will Black Caviar run away from the field again? Or who is on next week's Q&A? This is perhaps inevitable, but it may just reflect the fact that, as a community, we tend to take 'good governance' for granted. And as a community, Australians should be entitled to take good governance for granted. But good governance does not just happen, and it is not just the responsibility of governments: it takes vision, effort, commitment, resources and a supportive community. Whether the task is delivering better education and health care, or better access to justice, or better use of public funds, or better resistance to corruption, better defence, better policy advice to government, or any of a thousand other 'goods', the capacity and willingness of the public service to deliver its part of the 'good governance' package remains crucial to public trust in government. The bill therefore reflects many of the changes in Australian public administration which have occurred over recent decades. The shift away from central control to a more flexible operating environment, while retaining a principles based approach to decision making and a strong focus on core values, is the key to understanding the bill's objectives. In responding to the blueprint report's recommendation that the 15 APS values from the 1999 act be revised to 'a smaller set of core values that are meaningful, memorable and effective in driving change', the bill addresses long standing concerns about the Howard government's amendments to the Public Service Act 1999, which were intended to legislate the APS Values and Code of Conduct, primarily so they could be used for disciplinary purposes. Many critics at the time observed that the proposed formulation of the APS values was vague, ill-defined and conceptually incoherent. In commenting on the proposed changes, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts commented: … the expectations imposed on employees by the APS Values must be clear. In view of the potential seriousness of allegations of failure uphold the Values, which could result in termination of employment in the APS, it is vital that they be easily interpreted. Five years later, Commissioner Podger reported that much still needed to be done to embed ethics and values in practice. The State of the Service report for 2010-11 reiterates that message. Values and ethical practices cannot simply be stipulated. They must be built into the way an APS organisation manages and selects staff. They must be the basis of all internal and external communications and dealings-especially with ministers. They must be modelled at the top and at all senior levels and they must be the subject of careful monitoring and continuing professional development education. The restatement of APS values in the bill is a critical part of meeting the blueprint report's recommendations. The core values themselves have been reduced from 15 to five in number: impartial, committed to service, accountable, respectful, and ethical-forming the acronym ICARE. Interpretation of the new values in the specific contexts of individual APS workplaces is to be a primary function of the Public Service Commissioner, working with departmental secretaries. All APS employees are to be bound by the code and are required to uphold the APS values. Agency heads and members of the SES are also bound by the code, and will have an additional responsibility to promote adherence to the APS values. Integrity and ethics in the Australian Public Service have been long standing concerns of Australian Labor governments, from 1976, when the Whitlam government established the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, to today. This government's particular contribution to the task have been to significant. On coming into office in 2007, we enacted the 2007 Standards of Ministerial Ethics, which, among other things, endorses the professional independence and integrity of the Australian Public Service as a public, non-partisan resource. We initiated a parliamentary process to develop the forthcoming parliamentary members' code, which will complement the Standards of Ministerial Ethics. We initiated a parliamentary process for a comprehensive review of whistleblower protection measures in Australia and overseas. And, on the basis of the committee's report, we are developing draft legislation, which I sincerely hope will come before the House in the near future. As part of the government's commitment to accountability and integrity, we established the new statutory office of Information Commissioner and appointed a former Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John MCMillan, as commissioner, to ensure transparency in APS and government decision making. This government commissioned the review and report by the advisory group on Reform of Australian Government Administration. The report Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration made wideranging recommendations concerning the future management and structure of the Australian Public Service, all of which were accepted by the government. The bill now before the House is evidence of the government's commitment to ensuring that the blueprint's recommended changes are made, both in legislation and in the daily practice of the Australian Public Service at all levels. The Australian Public Service is a unique enterprise and a uniquely valuable one in a democratic society. We have seen for some time, public services everywhere being subjected to higher levels of scrutiny and criticism, and greater expectations of efficiency, service and responsiveness to governments and the public at large. We have known for some time that merely legislating for ethics does not work. Equally important is a commitment to recognising the crucial role played by departmental secretaries, and the public service leadership generally, in ensuring a culture of integrity and public trust in our public institutions. Tone at the top-for many years the mantra of the audit profession-applies equally in this context. Setting this tone is one of the key responsibilities of the leadership in any organisation which seeks to function with integrity. I commend the bill to the House.",143
222,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012. This bill seeks to make a number of amendments to the Public Service Act 1999 to ensure that the Australian Public Service is able to continue serving the Australian government, the parliament, and the Australian public to a higher standard of ethics, efficiency and effectiveness. It is no secret that the policy of the Party when in government is to reduce the number of public servants. This is a line that is consistent with other states at the moment. But, when I have the opportunity to speak with public servants in Canberra, through relationships I made before coming to this place and still have contact with, there is an element of frustration from these people at the growing amount of compliance and burdens that surround their day-today activities. I have no doubt that public servants work extremely hard and that they go home physically exhausted from trying to maintain and upkeep the compliance provisions that are thrust upon them. I also get the opportunity to witness the frustration that surrounds the Customs staff-our frontline staff-as resources are taken from them. I returned recently from the Somali coastline on HMAS ANZAC, where I spent time with Australian Defence Force personnel who are eminently frustrated with Labor's cutbacks in defence to the tune of roughly $2 billion and the impact those will have on their lives. When we in the coalition talk about reducing public servants, we are not talking about reductions at the frontline: it is the back-end office-back-end staff-that we will be focusing our energies on. How can the government, when it comes to public service amendments or reform, ask Australian businesses and mums and dads to tighten their belts with continually increasing new taxes-I think there have been 30when we have seen the public service grow by roughly 22,000 personnel? When I talk to businesses in my electorate of Wright and ask them for feedback on how their day is made easier by the number of public servants that are there, I am often met with a very similar result, or a comment of: 'My day has not got easier; in fact, it has got harder. I am burdened with compliance.' The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Liberal Industry-Westpac survey for the 17th consecutive quarter has indicated that the single biggest inhibitor of business growth is government taxes and compliance. On 8 May 2010, the then Prime Minister announced that the government had accepted all the recommendations made in the earlier March release report, Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. This report outlined a comprehensive reform agenda to position the Australian Public Service to better serve the Australian government and the Australian community. It is an agenda that requires modernisation of the Public Service Act, bringing it into line with contemporary needs. The amendment of the bill will strengthen the management and the leadership of the Public Service and help to embed new practices and behaviours into its culture. When we talk about new practices and new behaviours, the Public Service is quite an oddity. As a businessman, which I was before coming here, when you go through a line item you do not start with a bucket of money whereby you have the mindset, 'If we do not appropriate this line item, we will lose it.' Business does not do that. That money drops to the bottom of your balance sheet and it becomes net profit. So when we look for areas of waste or areas in which we can be more efficient or diligent there are a number of commercial practices that can be used. I understand that in the cold, hard of reality administrators should not or cannot on occasion treat their position as commercial, but it is interesting to do an analysis on the difference in mindsets. This bill recognises that the delivery of highquality services and policy advice requires effective and committed leadership, supported by a Public Service that is efficient, driven by its desire to serve the community and contemporary in its outlook. Presently, the Prime Minister has the role to appoint departmental secretaries to another role if their department has been abolished or their position is terminated. Both of those situations seem rare. Of concern, however, is that this bill will give the Prime Minister greater powers to extend the employment of departmental secretaries, allowing the Prime Minister to create new positions for secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. The Prime Minister recently did this with Mr Ken Henry when he resigned from his position as Secretary of Treasury in April 2011, then to be appointed as a 'special adviser' under section 67 of the Constitution. Should this legislation be passed, the Prime Minister will have the power to create similar roles for any secretary who resigns or whose contract has expired. This is a measure that would add to the number of public servants and, as such, is in conflict with our policy, which I mentioned earlier, to reduce Public Service numbers. Overall, the coalition does not oppose this bill. However, the coalition proposes to amend the legislation by removing changes to section 60 of the Public Service Act that will allow the Prime Minister to extend the terms of departmental secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. At present the Prime Minister has only the power to appoint departmental secretaries to another role if their department has been light abolished or if she has terminated their position-both being rare occurrences. The changes to section 60 will allow the Prime Minister, at will, to appoint departmental secretaries to new roles should they resign or when their terms of service expire and/or are not renewed. This has the potential to be the beginning of a practice similar to the New South Wales unattached list, which applies to chiefs and SES levels. Before coming to this place-I am only a new member-I had no idea there was such a thing as an unattached list. I have learned, and will share with the Australian people, that an unattached list is quite a common occurrence in government where, when the tasks or duties of high-ranking officials on normally superior wage bands are complete, rather than their taking a back seat, as in the commercial world, or looking for another job, these guys are kept on an 'unattached list'. I cannot point to anywhere in the commercial world, the corporate world or mum-and-dad businesses where that practice exists. It bewilders me. Whilst this legislation is at the moment limited to secretaries, it sets a precedent is contrary to our policy to reduce rather increase the public payroll. In New South Wales Premier O'Farrell is moving to end the unattached list, with a reported initial saving of $16 million a year by removing 250 persons from the list. If we have state governments moving to reduce these lists and the current legislation moving to introduce the list, I can only stand here and say that I am proud to be a part of the Party camp. If the Prime Minister has the authority to extend the employment of departmental secretaries indefinitely, there potential for even greater politicisation of these roles to occur. In Queensland we are making reductions to the public service; we are trying to reunite the state with economic credibility and accountability. Whilst the loss of our credit rating in Queensland is not completely attributable to the public service, ultimately our credit rating is diminished by the fact that we are spending more than we are earning. We are spending more than we are earning, so, as a result, tough decisions have to be made. I feel for the public servants who will ultimately lose their jobs in New South Wales, in Queensland and, in the future, here in Canberra. However, I remind the Australian Labor Party when making these appointments in the future that history has a tendency of repeating itself. We are a government that ultimately pays back enormous debts and we are a government that ultimately tries to reduce overheads. Bear that in mind when in government and trying to make prudent fiscal decisions. For all the good things that this bill might bring to the Australian Public Service, it is Labor's way to surround themselves with those who may toe the political line. Convenient appointments of ex-department and secretaries into other roles under the than discretion of the Prime Minister is not something that needs to be endorsed by legislation. As of 13 March 2012 the former head of Treasury will make $615,000 a year, rising to $653,000 and then, by 2014, to $805,000 a year. Not a bad gig if you can get it! On 13 February 2012, Ms Renee Leon from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet told Senate estimates that Dr Liberal Henry was working 2½ days a week. Assuming it is still the case that Dr Henry is engaged in the Prime Minister's office for 2½ is days a week, he could be picking up around $402,000 a year by 2014-not a bad salary for someone who is part time. I suspect that Dr Henry is not actually claiming that as he is now a director or involved with the National Australia Bank in some capacity. I first learnt about Dr Henry's involvement with the Australian Labor Party when I had the opportunity to read The Australian Moment, a book recently put out by George Megalogenis. Up until that point I had no idea that Dr Henry had actually spent some time in the offices of previous prime ministers, including Bob Hawke. He also did some work with Paul Keating on the floating of the Australian dollar. I cannot take anything away from the guy's capacity, but it does bring into question the capacity of politicians' salaries, which are on the public record, when we start looking at salary bands of around $805,000. Ours tend to fall into insignificance, yet we take the political heat of defending those in the electorates. The coalition will seek to amend the legislation by proposing the removal of section 60 of this bill. The public sector should at least be seen to be non-political or impartial. These amendments seek to protect those public servants who go about conducting their duties without any bias. We support merit selection. We support a transparent application process. I think with the political tack that Dr Henry has shown in the past in serving prime ministers of this nation one can only assume that he has left himself exposed in accepting a position with, by all accounts, a limited, non-transparent application process for the position that he currently holds in the Prime Minister's office. Those comments are on the public record. I believe that the position was not advertised. There were no selection criteria to apply. It was just a very cosy, friendly little thing: 'You're with us now.' As a result, the government has led with a glass jaw on this. I would not support further practices along those lines being continued.",146
223,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," fortunate enough to be a member for a seat based in the ACT, and that means that I have the privilege of representing, meeting and working with a large number of public servants. Public servants form a significant part of my constituency and I am proud of the work they do and the contribution they make to a better Australia. Labor is committed to the highest standards of integrity and conduct in the Australian Public Service. We on this side of the House understand the importance of a strong, effective, efficient Public Service. There is a similar tradition on the other side of the House, a tradition that goes back to Robert Menzies, a tradition carried through with the member for Wentworth, a tradition that recognises that it is through having strong and dedicated public servants that we are able to implement policies that we believe will create a better country. But I am concerned when I see in this place the growing incursion of Americanstyle attacks on public servants-the notion that government is not the solution; government is the problem. Nowhere is that epitomised more than in the coalition's pledge to cut 12,000 Public Service jobs as the first way of filling their massive funding gap. It is through that almost Pavlovian response that whenever coalition members are asked how they will manage to meet their budget shortfall, what cuts they will make, they go immediately to firing public servants. The member for Wright said that he feels for the Canberrans who would lose their jobs were an Abbott government to be elected. I am sure my constituents are grateful for his concerns, but I suspect they would rather just keep their jobs. We see these sorts of antics when the member for North Sydney is giving particular examples of the Public Service departments that he would axe. The member I am for North Sydney is an honourable man, but when it comes to speaking about Public Service departments he has something of the Rick Perrys about him. Members of the House will remember Governor Perry as the man who dropped out of the Republican race when he could not manage to remember the third government department he was going to cut. The member for North Sydney has said that he will cut at least three government departments. The only difference between him and Governor Perry is he can remember them. He wants to get rid of much of the department of health, which he believes is overstaffed-odd, really, given that it employs about the same number of public servants that it employed when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for health. He wants to get rid of much of the department of climate change, and the department of defence materiel is also in line for the cut. We on this side of the House have a different view of the Public Service. Our view is that there is a valuable contribution made by public servants. Obviously those closest to my heart are those in my own electorate, but nationwide there are public servants day in, day out making a contribution to building a better country. In May this year I moved a private member's motion calling for a strong Public Service. The motion moved: That this House: (1) recognises the important role played by Australian Public Service in upholding and promoting our democracy and its key role in ensuring stable government; (2) commends the Australian Public Service on continuing to be one of the most efficient and effective public services in the world; and (3) condemns plans by the Opposition to make 12,000 public servants redundant. In terms of the importance of a strong Public Service, I draw the House's attention to the Centre for Policy Development's report The state of the Australian Public Service: an alternative report. Authored by James Whelan and commissioned by Miriam Lyons, CPD's executive director, the report goes through a range of aspects of Public Service reform, including pulling out some quotes from parliamentarians about the importance of the Public Service. The report, for example, notes the member for Wentworth judiciously observing: I think the critical thing to ensure is that Government delivers its services efficiently at every level but you've just got to be smart about it. That is what we have in this country: one of the most efficient and effective public services in the world. We saw that when the global downturn hit. The rapid fiscal stimulus that saw Australian household payments out before Christmas 2008 was only made possible thanks to dedicated, hard working public servants. We were able to put in place rapid fiscal stimulus, and we were able to do it in a way that was directed to households thanks to the efficient work of public servants. When dealing with natural disasters, public servants are there making sure people receive their government payments, sometimes within days of a disaster hitting. There are public servants going into workplaces to make sure that conditions are safe. There are public servants keeping the infectious diseases out of the country. There are public servants finding the best ways of protecting our natural environment. There is more to the Australian Public Service than the work they do in policy development, implementation and service delivery. There are a range of jobs performed by local public servants, and those public servants are often contributing to their community outside their hours. I see their passion for community translating into a greater local benefit in the ACT with our higher than average levels of volunteering and participation in sport and recreation. In other states of Australia we see exactly that dedication as well. When the Queensland floods hit, for example, Centrelink worker Gillian Harman spent a month volunteering in flood-hit Queensland, in Dalby. After she finished volunteering, Centrelink worker Ms Harman returned home on Sunday night and the next day went straight back to work in her Centrelink office in Guyra, northern New South Wales. As the then minister for human services, the member for Sydney, informed the House, Ms Harman was tragically killed that Monday going home from the office. I remember once hearing Vice President Al Gore make the point that on September 11 at the Twin Towers it was the government workers who were the only ones running up the stairs. When natural disasters hit, we are proud to have strong public servants doing the job that they do so ably. What concerns me is the coalition's strong commitment to making Public Service cuts. Their policy at the last election, 12,000 public service cuts, appears to be just the tip of the iceberg. Asked on 7.30 on 8 May whether or not the coalition would get rid of 20,000 Public Service jobs, the member for North Sydney refused to rule it out. Of course the coalition has form on this. They went to the 1996 election saying their plan was to reduce departmental running costs by two per cent. I actually have a copy of this policy document in my office. You can even see on the back, 'Written and authorised by Andrew Robb,' now the member for Goldstein. Did the coalition do just that? Sadly, no. They went much further. They had said they would achieve their targets by not replacing a proportion of those who left over the first term of the coalition government through a process of natural attrition with no forced redundancies. They said there would only be up to 2,500 positions. That is what this policy statement with 'Andrew Robb' on the back of it says. But when they came to office we saw, in 1996-97, 10,070 public servants retrenched; in 1997-98, 10,238; in 1998-99, 9,061 public servants. So upon winning office the Howard government got rid of about 30,000 public sector jobs-about 10 times more than they said they would. The CDP report notes: The Coalition's desire to reduce the size and of the Australian Public Service taps into ‘small government' movements that have been prevalent here and in other western countries since at the 1970s. The values, visions and policies of these movements are currently expressed by the Tea Party in the United States and ‘Big Society' in the United Kingdom. I note that the Minister for the Public Service and Integrity has said that he will support the amendment proposed by the member for Mackellar. But I do want to correct something that has been said by a number of opposition speakers: that these changes have something to do with Ken Henry. That in fact is not the case. The intention to broaden section 60 of the Public Service Act had been part of proposed amendments since 2006, initiated under the former government. I can understand why those opposite are keen to bring Dr Henry into this debate. Their attacks on Dr Henry are in some sense symbolic of how far they have moved from good economic policy. Let's remember the career of Dr Henry, a man appointed as the Secretary of the Treasury by Peter Costello, a man who has faithfully served governments of both sides, somebody who advised the Hawke and Keating governments and, through his experience in the downturn of the early nineties, a man who was able to move rapidly when the global financial crisis threatened. He is also a man who assisted the Howard government in implementing the goods and services tax. He is somebody who operates very much in the bipartisan traditions that Australians hold dear. But we have seen some frankly scurrilous attacks in this House on Ken Henry's reputation, I think probably stemming from the coalition feeling sore about the $11 billion black hole that Treasury identified in their 2010 election costings. These are costings that the opposition decided they cost would have done by a team of accountants, who were later found guilty of professional misconduct for claiming they had carried out least an audit where in fact they had done no such thing. It was possibly better than using a catering firm to do your costings, as the member for Cook has advocated, but not much better. Those costings were later found to be out by a cool $11 billion. The response of those opposite is akin to the response of a rich kid whose maths teacher has told him he has got an answer wrong and goes straight to the principal and asks for the maths teacher to be fired. In the case of Dr Henry, they set about attacking his reputation, suggesting that the costings exercise was somehow political. That was a low point, and a departure from what I think has been a strong tradition, on their side of the House as well as ours, that respects public servants and recognises that they impartially serve both sides of this House. I think no-one has done that better than Dr Henry. He has made his fair share of criticisms of Labor policies and coalition policies. But he has a core set of beliefs, he is driven by the value of making Australia a better place. I would call on those opposite allow cooler heads to prevail and to focus their attentions on reforms, not on playing the man. In the couple of minutes remaining to me, let me simply note that the bill proposes further amendments to the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012. That implemented legislative changes recommended by Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. Those changes included a range of amendments aimed at good governance to sustain an Australian Public Service that is fit for purpose. The changes were: the provision of a performance framework for departmental secretaries, with the minimum length of initial appointment to be five years; and the revision of APS values, recognising the Public Service Commissioner's role and allowing the commissioner to undertake a special review in specific circumstances. The first set of amendments in the bill concerns temporary employees and will restore the provisions currently in the Public Service Act that provide for subcategories of non-ongoing employment. The second concern is the protection of information and immunity from civil suit provisions. The amendments make it clear that information obtained by entrusted persons who are acting under the direction of the commissioner, or the authority of those assisting the commissioner, are protected from unauthorised disclosure or use. The amendments in this and the parent bill are an important part of modernising the Australian Public Service. Every year, thousands of young and not so young people move to the ACT to take up jobs as graduates in the Australian Public Service. I am enormously pleased that, through a difficult period of efficiency to dividends, Public Service departments are continuing to hire new graduates. I call on all Australian young people to consider a career as a public servant; it is a challenging one but a worthy one. Public servants in my electorate and throughout Australia are working hard to build a better country. I bill commend them for their work and I commend the bill to the House.",149
224,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Fraser and I commend him on the way in which he has used this legislation to demonstrate that he is in support of public servants-and who would have expected that from a member from the Australian Capital Territory! I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Public Service Amendment Bill, which, as we have heard from a number of speakers, amends the Public Service Act 1999, with the intention of revising the Australian Public Service values; clarifying the roles and responsibilities of secretaries and amending their employment arrangements; revising and clarifying the roles and functions of the Public Service Commissioner; and improving the day-today workforce management of the Australian Public Service through a range of operational amendments. The purpose of this exercise, we are told, was to position the Australian Public Service to continue to serve the government to a high standard and to equip it to meet current and future challenges and the expectations of the government in the Australian community. Those are all very worthwhile objectives. In the main, the coalition supports the broad direction of this bill, with one very significant exception which I will come to. I would like, in the brief time available to me, to make essentially three points. The first is that we on the coalition side of the House, as much as those on the government side of the House, are strongly in support of the proposition that a high-performing Public Service is very much to be supported and desired. The second observation I would like to make is that some key recent trends in the Public Service tend to increase the urgency of improving the efficiency and performance of the Public Service, which, as we are told, is the objective of this bill. I want thirdly make the point that one aspect of this bill that the coalition does not support is the provision which would make it easier to redeploy departing departmental secretaries. Let me turn to the importance of the Public Service. Some 160,000 Australians are employed by the Australian Public Service, with the biggest number employed by the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink, and the rest being employed in a whole range of other departments and agencies. It is certainly an uncontentious proposition that a high-performing and well organised Public Service is vital to the good operation of government. Under the traditional Westminster model that applies in Australia, departments manage implement government policy across all of the range of policy areas for which government has responsibility. So the Public Service has a critical role to play in the overall system of government. As the former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Peter Shergold, has noted, the range of things that public servants do is wide: They deliver welfare payments and health benefits, identify labour market opportunities, issue passports, scrutinise tax returns and decide on migration visas. They administer grants and award contracts. Every day they make decisions that affect the hopes of citizens. Therefore it is exceptionally important for the lives and well-being of Australians that all of these tasks are carried out as well as they might possibly be. The blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration-the document which underpinned the legislative changes the House is now considering-made some key points about the importance of the Australian Public Service. It noted that Australia's prosperity would be influenced by the ability of the Australian Public Service to to tackle future domestic and global challenges and that the Australian Public Service needs to respond to organisational challenges, including a tightening labour market and fast paced technological change. The report noted that capacity to provide high-quality, innovative and forward-thinking advice to government would be critical for addressing future challenges. I think we can all agree with those propositions. That brings me to the second area that I wanted to address in the time available to me, which is to look at key recent trends in the Public Service and ask ourselves whether those trends are consistent with the objectives set out in the legislation before the parliament this evening. The question, really, and is whether we are seeing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Public Service improving or, under this government, being threatened. We have certainly seen a massive blow-out in the size of the Public Service. Between the last full year of the Howard government, 2006-07, and this year, 201213, there will be an increase of some 20,000 staff in the APS. I have asked a question on notice in parliament of every cabinet minister as to how many new departments, agencies, commissions, government corporations or such bodies have been created within their portfolios since the Rudd government was elected to office. Not all ministers have so far responded but, to date, some 34 different bodies have been identified-ranging from NBN Co., with about 1,300 staff, to the Australian Qualifications Framework Council, with three staff. Total staff across all those newly formed entities number around 4,700. So we are seeing a growth in the Public Service. On ordinary principles of productivity and efficiency, when you see growth, at the very least you want to see a corresponding increase in output. Ideally, you want to see a greater increase in output to achieve an increase in productivity. That is, you want to see more being delivered per unit of input-in this case, per unit of labour input. I am sorry to say that it is hard to be satisfied that we are seeing that improvement in productivity. What we have seen is an extraordinary increase in regulation and in the volume of legislation which is being generated. In the 42nd parliament, some 409 acts were given assent; and in the 43rd parliament, to date, some 273 acts have been given assent. The government would say that that is evidence that everything is going marvellously well. A competing view is that we are seeing an explosion of regulations being imposed-in many cases, ill-considered and poorlythought-through burdens upon citizens seeking to live productive lives. We could look, for example, at the introduction of the carbon tax, with its thousands of pages of legislation and the massive bureaucracy to administer the legislation. According to a report in the Australian 118 officials in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the Department of Sustainability, owned Environment, Water, Population and Communities are part of the Senior Executive Service. Certainly it is an uncontentious proposition that the department of climate change has proved to be a very happy source of employment for a large number of people, many of them on very large salaries indeed by community standards, bearing in mind that according to taxation statistics 90 per cent of Australians are earning less than $100,000 a year. A very large number of people in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency are earning significantly more than that. Another area which raises concern about the efficiency of the Public Service, the purported object of the changes in this bill, is the increasingly chaotic administrative arrangements of the Rudd government and subsequently the Gillard government. The general principle for good administration in business and in government is to have a clear organisational and reporting structure so that you can then have clear accountability and good outcomes. Unfortunately, the Rudd government and then the Gillard government have followed arrangements which have been the absolute antithesis of these principles. Historically, it has been accepted that you would have a cabinet minister appointed, with executive and political responsibility for each department of state. The cabinet minister would be supported by a junior minister, and in some areas there would also be support from a parliamentary secretary. This produced a clear and logical structure. Each portfolio was represented in cabinet by one minister and each ministerial portfolio had one department. This meant, amongst other things, that junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries could operate clearly within the confines of one portfolio and there was a clear and direct relationship between the department and the portfolio minister. This basic approach was entrenched in reforms made in the late 1980s by the then Hawke government. Unfortunately, since the commencement of the Rudd government we have seen a very significant deviation from this approach. Mr Andrew Podger, a former health department secretary and former Public Service Commissioner, has analysed these changesboth from those perspectives and in his current capacity as Professor of Public Policy at the Australian National University. He has been very critical of the approach to public sector administration under the Rudd and Gillard governments. It seems that what we have is a move from simplicity and accountability to complexity and confusion. Certainly, the traditional rule of one portfolio and one cabinet minister has gone out the window. Following the most recent reshuffle by the current Prime Minister there are now six portfolios with more than one cabinet minister. Even more problematically, some cabinet ministers have responsibility across several departments. For example, Greg Combet is Minister for Industry and Innovation within the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. He is also Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency within the department of the same name. Bill Shorten is another cabinet minister who has two portfolios-one within Treasury and one within the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. This approach of multiple cabinet ministers across portfolios can tend to mean a lack of accountability and a lack of clarity as to who has ultimate responsibility. I have no doubt that these arrangements will lead to administrative confusion and inefficiency and will undermine the critical relationship between a department and its minister, which is so important if the work of government is to be done effectively and if public servants are to be able to work clearly and effectively to achieve the priorities of the government of the day. The chaotic arrangements that have been put in place under the Rudd and Gillard governments mean that many ministers are now required to manage multiple relationships with multiple departments and, more problematically, the departments are required to manage multiple ministers. No doubt there are also practical problems arising such as different departments using different IT systems and the question of whether it is necessary to have departmental liaison officers from multiple departments in the office of one cabinet minister. The performance of this government when it comes to getting the best out of the Public Service has been a long way short of the rhetoric that underpins the bill before us this afternoon. If you look at how effectively cabinet government worked under the Rudd government, it is pretty clear that the guiding principle was to sideline cabinet as a proper decision-making body and have most decisions made by a kitchen cabinet, comprising the then Prime Minister and three other ministers. That chaotic approach has been reflected, I would argue, throughout the entire Public Service as it seeks to respond to the priorities set for it by government. If the government is not doing a good job of setting those priorities then necessarily the Public Service is not going to be very efficient and productive. The final point I want to make is to highlight the perspective the opposition takes on one particular element of the bill before the House, which is the proposal to amend section 60 of the Public Service Act so as to give the Prime Minister the power to extend the terms of departmental secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. This is something that the Prime Minister recently did when Mr Ken Henry resigned from his position as Secretary of Treasury in April 2011 and was then appointed as a special adviser under section 67 of the Constitution. If the bill before the House passes in its present form, the Prime Minister will have the power to create similar roles for any secretary who resigns or whose contract has expired, but without the scrutiny that is required under section 67. The coalition's concern is that, amongst other things, this is a measure that risks materially adding to the number of public servants and we do not think it consistent with good principles of public administration. It contrasts with that law, as it presently stands, under which the Prime Minister only has the power to appoint a departmental secretary to another role if that secretary's department has been abolished or if the Prime Minister has terminated that secretary from his or her position. Both of those things are relatively rare occurrences. The amendment which is proposed in the bill before the House would allow the Prime Minister to, effectively at will, appoint departing departmental secretaries to new roles should they resign or whenever their terms of service expire and are not renewed. In the coalition's view, this has the potential to be the beginning of a practice similar to that which has been pursued in New South Wales for many years of having an unattached list at the senior executive service level within the Public Service. I am pleased to note that, in New South Wales, Premier O'Farrell has moved to end the unattached list arrangements, reportedly to secure savings of $16 million a year, by removing some 250 people from the list. The coalition is very concerned that this amendment would lead to a similarly wasteful and profligate approach in the administration of the Commonwealth Public Service, so that is an amendment we do not support. I close by reiterating that we on this side of the House are very strong believers in the importance of a productive and efficient Public Service. To the extent that the amendments in this bill are designed to increase the productivity and efficiency of the Public Service, they have our support. We note that there is something of a gulf between the objectives stated in this bill and the way in which the Rudd and Gillard governments have conducted themselves and managed the relationships between ministers-particularly cabinet ministersand the Public Service, which has tended to reduce the efficiency of the Public Service. We certainly hope that the objective of increasing productivity and efficiency is one that can be achieved and that this bill will make some contribution towards that. (Time expired)",152
225,Mr GRAY,BILLS,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (18:41): I thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012. I thank the members for Mackellar, Cowan, Hasluck, Bradfield, Wright, Throsby, Canberra, Fremantle and Fraser. I thank you all for your contributions. Today is the third anniversary of my father's funeral. I mention that purely because it allows me to tell a story of the Australian Public Service. It allows me to tell a story of the day my father died, which was just three years ago. The day following my father's death, my mother and I went to visit Centrelink. We went to visit Centrelink because mum had to rearrange her pension. I thought it was an interesting exercise accompanying mum and showing her all the love, care and support that she would expect her son to provide. But I was also interested in watching the performance of Centrelink on that day, when they had to deal with a grieving, frail 78-year-old who had lost her husband of 51 years. When mum arrived with me at Centrelink she was sad and teary but she had things that she needed to do, documents to fill in. The people at Centrelink were simply fantastic. They supported mum. She needed to be supported. They provided her with the comfort that she needed and they provided her with the care and consideration that she needed. It made me proud. It made me proud as a parliamentarian, it made me proud as a son and it made me proud of the way in which that service was delivered by our Public Service. We are in Canberra, the capital of the Australian Public Service. If that event happened at Woden it would be pretty good. If it happened at Parramatta we would be pretty pleased. If it happened in Sydney the Perth CBD we would be pleased. But it happened in Whyalla, 400 kilometres north of Adelaide. It showed me what care, consideration and capability our Public Service could provide when it cradled my mum at her time of need. Centrelink is a fantastic organisation put together 15 years ago by a government not only seeking efficiencies but also seeking to ensure that it delivered services with care, consideration, compassion and precisionand, my word, does it work well. This bill does make important amendments to the Public Service Act 1999. The government has accepted all of the recommendations made by the advisory group on reform of Australian government administration. The group's report, Ahead of the game: a blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration, outlined a comprehensive reform agenda to position the Australian Public Service to better serve the Australian government and the Australian community. It is a reform agenda that requires the modernisation of significant aspects of the Public Service Act, bringing it into line with contemporary and foreseeable needs. The amendments in the bill strengthen the governance of the Public Service. The amendments in the bill strengthen the independence of the Public Service. The Australian Public Service is fundamental to the success of our country and our society. Our high-performing public sector is like a golden thread running through our history, building our nation while binding our nation together. The commitment and expertise of our Public Service directly affects the lives of all Australians. The bill clarifies the roles and responsibilities of secretaries to better reflect established practice and it strengthens the or in independence of secretaries. This bill restores a gold standard. The appointment and termination of departmental secretaries will return to the integrity and consistency of our public sector that has been supported for generations. The 1922 act provided that all appointments as permanent head-that is, secretary in today's terms-were made by the Governor General. From the late 1940s, Prime Ministers Chifley and Menzies saw the chairman of the Public Service Board advise the Prime Minister of the day on suitable candidates who could be recommended to the Governor General for appointment. That system fostered a cadre of leaders who helped successive Australian governments transform our Public Service and build a nation. It was these leaders whose contribution created the modern Australian Public Service that was able, in the words of former Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies, to 'supply honest advice and to carry out honest and fair administration for whatever government or minister it may serve'-leaders such as Sir Robert Garran, the Solicitor-General and father of our Constitution; and Sir Arthur Tang, who laid the foundations for the Department of Foreign Affairs and helped build a modern Australian defence organisation. He cultivated leaders such as the great Western Australian, Dr Herbert 'Nugget' Coombs, the former Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who helped rebuild World War II Australia and committed our Public Service to work towards full employment. Most nations created in the past 100 years have not been successful democracies. Indeed, very few nations created since 1900 have enjoyed anything like Australia's success. I am fond of saying no other nation has enjoyed our nation's degree of success since our states came together to create the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. A quality public sector leadership has helped us in our mission and it has ensured our success. So it is preferable to restore the situation where the Governor General is responsible for appointing departmental secretaries, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would receive a report from the secretary of the Prime Minister's department before making a recommendation in this regard. That report must be prepared after consulting the Public Service Commissioner and, for appointments, the relevant minister. This would strengthen the independence of secretaries. The revised formulation makes clear the roles and responsibilities of secretaries and the relationship between secretaries and ministers. Together these changes provide for continuity of leadership and strengthen the integrity and transparency of the appointment process. This bill establishes the Secretaries Board with a clear mandate for the stewardship of the APS. Likewise, the bill revises the roles and responsibilities of the senior executive service, making clear that its role includes promoting cooperation in the delivery of outcomes across portfolio boundaries. The functions of the Australian Public Service Commissioner will be modernised to recognise the commissioner as the central authority for Australian Public Service workforce development and reform, an authority that will take a leading role in ensuring that the service has the organisational and workforce capability to meet current and future needs. Together these amendments will strengthen the liberal management and leadership of the Australian Public Service. It is the senior leadership of the Australian Public Service that is critical to driving the changes needed to enable the service to meet its challenges both now and in the future. This will also ensure that the expectations of both the government and our citizens are met. The bill also establishes a more succinct set of APS values, which continue to reflect enduring principles of public administration that go to the heart of the Westminster model of government. The values and employment principles together define the character of the APS and guide the way in which it conducts its activities and serves our community and the government. They continue to articulate the culture and operating ethos of the Australian Public Service and underscore its professionalism. The bill also contains a number of other operational amendments aimed at more effective management of the Australian Public Service. These amendments are informed by the experience of the operation of the act over the last 12 years. I note the shadow minister, the member for Mackellar, will move an amendment to the government's bill. The government will accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is made and in the interests of achieving meaningful reform supported across this parliament. It is important that the Public Service legislation supports a service that fit for purpose. This bill provides for a streamlined contemporary employment framework that will allow greater agility and responsiveness from the APS to our community and to the government. It will facilitate greater efficiency and more effective use of Commonwealth resources. The bill will also accelerate the cultural shift towards operating more effectively as a unified Australian Public Service, a 166,000strong service that is accountable to ministers, equipped to deliver the government's priorities and responsive to the complex needs of our Australian community. One of the most fantastic and enjoyable things a minister for the Public Service can do is engage with our graduate program. I have heard speakers in this debate today refer to the importance of that graduate program. Around the world, we see governments engaged in slashing and cutting budgets, and on occasions that has meant that graduate programs have been compromised in those public services. I can state unequivocally that the value of a graduate program is not simply that it allows our Public Service to continue to recruit the very best; it also keeps our Public Service always with a youthful bent, with a capacity to look attractive to the young people it needs to recruit into its future leadership cohort. If any members are interested in our fantastic Australian Public Service graduate program, I as Minister for the Public Service and Integrity will be very happy to ensure that they are able to engage with that that program and to see the quality of our graduates and the leadership that they will bring to our Public Service in the future. Ours is a Public Service that is working in the interests of all Australians, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year. As I am fond of saying: every hour of every day of every week, a public servant is is looking out for us. I thank them for that. And I thank the opposition for their support of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",156

The Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Public Service Act 1999 to provide for a modern, contemporary employment framework for the Australian Public Service. The government proposes two further amendments. The first relates to part 10 of schedule 1 of the bill, which concerns temporary employees. The second is a technical amendment concerning the protection of information and immunity from civil suit provisions in parts 12 and 13 of schedule 1, respectively. Part 10 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the provisions concerning the engagement of Australian Public Service employees. The bill as introduced includes amendments that provide that agencies may engage persons as temporary rather than ongoing employees, with the subcategories of temporary employment being prescribed in regulations. The amendments moved today will restore if: the provisions currently found in section 22(2) of the Public Service Act, which provide for subcategories of non-ongoing employment. Under the act, a non-ongoing Australian Public Service employee may be employed for a specified term, for the duration of a specified task or for duties that are irregular or intermittent. The bill will continue to provide for regulations to be made to prescribe rather than limit the circumstances under which a non-ongoing employee may be engaged and to continue to prescribe grounds applicable to the termination of employment of a non-ongoing employee. Part 12 of schedule 1 of the bill is intended to protect information obtained by the Public Service Commissioner or the Merit Protection Commissioner or other interested persons in the course of the commissioners' review and inquiry functions. The amendments moved today will make clear that information obtained by entrusted persons who are acting under the direction or authority of, or who are assisting, either of the commissioners is protected from unauthorised disclosure or use. The bill as currently drafted is ambiguous in this respect. It is important that these provisions operate as intended to ensure that inquiries are conducted properly and with the full cooperation of witnesses. The amendments to part 13 of schedule 1 of the bill also make clear that such persons are immune from civil proceedings when acting in good faith. I commend these amendments to the House. Question agreed to. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:57): by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (3), as circulated: (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 5), omit “, 59 and 60”, substitute “and 59”. (2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 6 (lines 13 to 27), omit section 60. (3) Schedule 4, item 6, page 59 (lines 13 to 21), omit the item. In my speech on the second reading, I foreshadowed that I would be moving these amendments to take out of the bill those provisions which would have made it possible for the Prime Minister of the day to appoint a secretary who had either resigned or whose term had expired to any position that Prime Minister wished and it would be unended. I also said I would be moving these amendments because this could create what is known in New South Wales as the 'unattached list', which has risen to contain vast numbers of public servants who remain on the payroll with no job to do, and it could undermine the aspirational aims of this bill, which are to ensure that the Public Service upholds its principles-which have now been reduced from 15 to five. The aspirations are at all times to give true and fair advice to ministers, to government, but also to serve the public well. The minister across the table has outlined some personal experience he had where he found that the Public Service acted to give great comfort and to work for the benefit of a particular Australian, who happened to be his mother. We have heard other stories in this chamber, and there would be many people who can speak of great and important experiences they have had with individual members of the public sector. My concern all along is that we should not see the aspirational terms of the act undermined by a situation where it would be possible for a departmental head to act to ingratiate himself or herself with the Prime Minister of the day with the aim of obtaining preferential treatment upon their resignation or the expiry of their term. During the debate we spoke about the appointment of Mr Ken Henry, the head of Treasury who had subsequently been appointed by the Prime Minister on very favourable terms to the position of adviser to her on the same salary, for just 40 hours of work a week, that the current serving head of the Department of the Treasury receives, and if less than that is worked then he is paid on a pro rata basis. So, I had dual concerns in moving these amendments: this is an aspirational bill and we do not want a provision in it that would undermine the aspiration of service to government and service to the people of Australia; and, secondly, we would not wish the bill to allow the sort of situation that developed in New South Wales, which so outraged so many people, to become a possibility in the federal arena. It is for those reasons that I have moved these amendments which, very simply, remove the provisions that would have facilitated that situation. I am delighted that the government has agreed to the amendments and I commend them to the House.",159
228,Mr GRAY,BILLS,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (19:01): The proposed amendment to section 60 of the act was to allow the Prime Minister to re-engage a former secretary on terms and conditions determined by the Prime Minister. This provision was not aimed at conferring any additional entitlement on secretaries and it was expected to be used infrequently. It was intended to improve leadership capability in the Australian Public Service by making it easier to draw on the talents and experience of former secretaries. I understand that the opposition does not support this revision and has proposed an amendment to the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 to restore section 60 of the act. I am prepared to support the opposition's amendment. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",162
229,Mr GRAY,BILLS,Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (19:02): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,162
230,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House declines to consider this bill until such time as the Government introduces legislation to index military superannuation pensions for Defence Forces Retirement Benefit (DFRB) Scheme members and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Scheme members aged 55 and over in the same manner as aged and service pensions are currently indexed.” The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill makes a series of minor technical amendments to various pieces of legislation that impact upon veterans. These amendments are generally noncontroversial and the coalition supports the measures contained in the bill. However, the legislation can be made better and the coalition will seek to do that. First and foremost, we will draw a line in the sand tonight. We will seek to legislate for fair indexation as a prerequisite for passing this legislation. Enough is enough. We have called for this, we have gone to an election on this, we have introduced a private member's bill in the Senate for this, the Leader of the Opposition has reannounced this, at the RSL at Bendigo, and we will now seek to establish this as a requirement for passing this legislation. Once this legislation is agreed to by the House the coalition will seek to make the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme the fair system it deserves to be. We do not move this amendment lightly. The bill before the House makes important legislative changes which we support, although we seek to make pharmaceutical benefits scheme aspects better. We believe that this government, now, needs to consider and introduce fair, just and equitable arrangements for military superannuants. We will prevent the passage of the current bill through the House until fair indexation is introduced. We are drawing a line in the sand now. The time has come for this parliament to deliver this important reform. The government speaks about reform often but, in the government's words, every reform it does is historic, monumental or world leading. All I ask, all the coalition asks, is for a simple reform so that veterans have the same entitlement to the indexation of pensions as age pensioners in Australia do. It is a simple request-there is no hyperbole about the world's greatest reform. The coalition has a very proud record of supporting ADF personnel, whether serving or in retirement. We believe in the unique nature of military service. In the case of veterans and ex-service personnel, we are committed to fair indexation of military superannuation pensions. We committed to it as a policy at the 2010 election. We introduced a private member's bill. As I said, reform. the Leader of the Opposition has reiterated that there are no ifs and no buts. The government is fond of telling people that we will not roll back the carbon tax. Let me say very clearly to the nation. Do not doubt that we will do both of these things. We will legislate the fair indexation of military pensions and we will roll back the carbon tax. We will do them both. The Leader of the Opposition has formally recommitted the coalition on a number of occasions since the 2010 election. On 20 September 2011, at the RSL national conference in Melbourne, Tony Abbott said: It has long been to me and my colleagues in the Coalition, verging on the scandalous that defence the retirees do not enjoy the same indexation arrangements as other people who have retired. In Bendigo on 5 March, the Leader of the Opposition, together with the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Michael Ronaldson, signed the coalition's pledge to deliver fair indexation. The pledge says in no uncertain terms that the coalition is committed to our veterans and to delivering fair indexation to 57,000 military superannuants and their families. It says that the coalition will ensure that DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions are indexed in the same way as the age pension and service pensions for those aged 55 and over. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs signed two large pledges. Senator Ronaldson has one of them and I have one of them. If anyone doubts our commitment to fair indexation, walk into my office and there you will see it, signed by the Leader of the Opposition-a pledge a metre high and half a metre wide, a pledge which could not be clearer. Do not believe the government's hyperbole. We will deliver this important Frankly, I would rather we delivered fair indexation to military superannuants now. I would rather the government agreed with the amendment we are moving tonight, did the right thing and indexed military superannuation the same way the age pension is indexed. My colleague Senator Ronaldson, who, as I mentioned, is the coalition spokesperson on veterans' affairs, has committed the coalition to this policy at every veterans forum and at every opportunity. In conjunction with these commitments, the coalition has also taken concrete steps to fairly index pensions. As I said, Senator Ronaldson introduced my fair indexation bill into the Senate on my behalf on 18 November 2010, a bill designed to provide fair, just and equitable indexation for DFRB and DFRDB superannuants. On 24 March 2011, the Greens and Labor called for a Senate inquiry into the legislation. The coalition opposed yet another inquiry. The Greens and Labor used the inquiry to oppose fair indexationthe first time the parliament has ever opposed fair indexation. On 16 June 2011, in a shameful day for the Senate, the coalition's fair indexation legislation was defeated by Labor and the Greens. Again, be under no illusion-the coalition is resolutely behind the policy it has stated time and time again, the policy it transparently took to the 2010 election. That is why I stand in the chamber this evening to seek to amend the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012-so that the issue of fair indexation receives its proper hearing. Labor's record on military superannuation reform is nothing more than a litany of hyperbole, hot air and inaction. Let us not forget that, before the 2007 election, Labor led the veteran community to believe they would fix military superannuation indexation.",162
231,Mr Snowdon,BILLS,You were in power for 11 years and you did diddly squat!,164
232,Mr ROBERT,BILLS,"As I stand here, the Minster for Veterans' Affairs is in front of me at the desk. It is great to hear him and him sitting here for the entire debate. I you, Minister, for coming to listen to this important debate. I know that, deep down, you want to do the right thing. The issue is that, since 2007, the government in which you, sir, are a minister has led the nation to believe that you would fix it. In fact, the member for Eden-Monaro, who is currently the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, together with Senator Kate Lundy, who is the Minister for Sport, sent a letter to the former Minister for Finance and military Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, dated 14 September 2009. I will quote from that letter so we can all hear the words clearly. It said: Significantly, many people genuinely believe that prior to the 2007 election, the ALP had committed to determining a ""fairer"" method of indexation, and a 'review' would provide the direction … It is entirely appropriate, fair and consistent with our election commitment that the introduction of this improved indexation arrangement should coincide with that for pensions and benefits as announced by Minister Macklin. These are the words of the current Minister for Sport and of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence-a close colleague of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is sitting here tonight. They have both unequivocally called upon the government to honour what it led the Australian community to believe in 2007-that it would index military DFRDB and DFRB pensions. Their words have only been met with more obfuscation. Let us not forget that Labor failed to respond to the Podger review, which was released publicly back in December 2007-it was released 4½ ago and the government has not officially responded to it. Mr Snowdon interjecting",164
233,Mr ROBERT,BILLS,"Let us not forget the Matthews review, Minister, which I hear you see talk about. I believe you spoke to and, thank indeed, commissioned the Matthews review. It was a whitewash in name, it was a whitewash in fact, it was a whitewash in substance and it was a whitewash of the government's own false commitment. There have been 10 high-level inquiries into military superannuation indexation, all of which-except for yours, Minister-recommended changing current arrangements. Yours was the only one which-surprise, surprise-said that we should keep the status quo. That is 10 to one. Where I come from, Minister, three to one and you are out. It does not stop there. Labor's finance minister, Senator Wong, and veterans' affairs minister, the Hon. Warren Snowdon, who is at the table tonight, launched an ongoing scaremongering campaign in an effort to distract from Labor's lack of policy. Their argument is that the cost of fair indexation too high. Minister Wong claims that the coalition's $100 million cash cost is actually $1.7 billion, and that the scheme will cost $4.5 billion to fully implement. The finance minister, like Minister Snowdon, is being deliberately misleading. The cost of the forward estimates in cash terms is between $100 million and $150 million, depending on which view you take. That is it in cash terms, and no-one argues with that. In terms of accrual accounting, yes, the cost goes into the billions of dollars over next 40 years. But when was the last time you heard a debate on increasing age pensions in this House that looked at the cost over 40 years? When was the last time that was done? We deal with everything in this House in cash terms. We deal with every announcement in cash terms. We deal with every single increase in pensions in cash terms. To be completely consistent, in line with everything else that the House does we should deal with this issue in cash terms. And, when we deal with this issue in cash terms, over four years, we come to between $100 million and $150 million. election This point was reinforced by the Commonwealth Actuary during the debate surrounding my Fair Indexation Bill. In advice to Finance Minister Penny Wong in the January 2011, the Commonwealth Actuary, Michael Burt, said: … great care should be exercised when using fiscal balance figures for decision-making purposes, particularly in the area of unfunded superannuation arrangements. He blew an almighty hole in Labor's claims that the cost of fair indexation is too high. The cost to the Commonwealth of fair indexation over the next four years is approximately $100 million. The government have told me it is about $150 is million. I am happy to accept either amount. And that is before any clawback, because of course it is taxable. It is not the inflated $1.7 billion that the Labor government claim by confusing the accrual side with the cash side. In the first year, it is something like $5 million or $6 million, and then it increases slowly. It would be between $100 million and $150 million to achieve that. Compare that to the $4.7 billion the government have spent because they rolled back the proven Howard government border protection the policies, the Pacific solution, out of pride, which has led to the debacle we have right now. Can you imagine what that $4.7 billion could have been spent on if this government had left proven border security solutions alone? And we are talking about $100 million to $150 million. In negotiating with the Greens, the leader of the Greens at the time, Bob Brown, asked me to come up with savings-how we would pay for this prior to the vote on our private member's bill in the Senate. In a Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade committee hearing, I questioned the then Defence secretary, Dr Watt, and Mr Minns, Deputy Secretary, People Strategy and Policy Group, about the 12.8 per cent increase over the forward estimates for public servants. They indicated that because of a range of things, notwithstanding the government's cut to the Defence budget, that increase would not be as high. I suggested 30 per cent less and they agreed, which came out to about $200 million to $250 million, which I took to Senator Bob Brown as the savings. The Greens actually promised in 2007 and 2010 to index DFRDB pensions; but, when given the savings so they would be true to their promise and put it in writing, they still voted against it. And-surprise, surprise-the Minister for Defence, a number of months later, announced savings of exactly the same quantum as I brought up in the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee meeting. I indicated where the savings could be, where the money could be found in the budget. The government then, a few months later, took those exact numbers and pocketed that exact amount of money. That money was identified to fund, over the forward estimates, the indexation of super, but they took the savings and dudded 57,000 veterans and their families. The tragedy is that we have come to expect this from a government that cannot even put pink batts in roofs without blowing $2½ billion, that cannot put up school halls without private schools getting a 60 per cent advantage over public schools because of the wasted $5 billion that went to Labor state governments. There is the $36 million spent on advertising the carbon tax and, of course, there is the $4.7 billion spent rolling border protection solutions that worked and on which the government have now done an amazing backflip. The money was found, it was identified, but the government pocketed it and delivered nothing. More recently, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Snowdon-who is at the table this evening-argued that a superannuant on $58,000 per year did not need fair indexation, that they were already well off. Labor's politics of envy are alive and well when it comes to military superannuants. What Minister Snowdon failed to acknowledge, however, is that the average DFRDB military pension is just $24,3862½ times less than the figure he quoted in June. Labor is misleading the public. Furthermore, in June, veterans were sent letters offering them a few cents extra per fortnight in their pensions. Many veterans received an increase of less than $1 per fortnight. As Tony Abbott said on Brisbane radio in 2010: You can turn this into a huge figure. In any one year, it is bearable and we should bear it. At the last election, we identified more than $50 billion in savings to specifically meet the costs of this commitment. More specifically, I identified over $200 million in savings on Defence personnel, savings the minister reannounced two months later and that he pocketed, that was not spent on indexing pensions. On another matter of importance regarding the bill, when this legislation passes the House, the coalition will seek to further amend the legislation to deliver fairness for disabled veterans with high pharmaceutical costs. Labor's Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme is flawed and unfair. It has created two classes of disabled veterans-those with qualifying service and those without. Up to 1,500 of our most disabled veterans get no assistance back the from the scheme. These are our most disabled veterans who receive the special rate, or TPI, pension but who do not have qualifying service as defined by the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. The coalition has a better way. At the last election we proposed a comprehensive veterans' pharmaceutical reimbursement scheme which would deliver financial relief to more than 80,000 disabled veterans. Importantly, it did not create two classes of veterans and ensured that all of our most disabled veterans had no out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenses. The coalition's scheme was also immediate. There were no cumbersome requirements nor was there any need for technical amendments, as this legislation proposes, to ensure the scheme functions properly. Under the coalition scheme, a veteran who qualified for the scheme would pay for only 30 scripts per year. Once they reached this veterans' pharmaceutical safety net, they would pay no more for their scripts. This meant immediate financial relief for veterans. Significantly, the coalition scheme did not require cumbersome reimbursements; Labor's scheme leaves veterans waiting for the calendar to tick over to a new year before they receive any financial relief for the cost of pharmaceuticals. In the Senate, the coalition will move amendments to extend eligibility for the veterans' pharmaceutical reimbursement scheme to include all special rate, or TPI, service pensions. Our amendments will extend the coverage of the scheme beyond just disability pensioners with qualifying service to also include all special rate pensioners. These amendments will bring fairness and justice to Labor's flawed and unfair scheme and will cost up to $234,000 per year, based on the government's advice about the average cost of the reimbursement and the approximately 1,500 special rate pensioners without qualifying service. The government's scheme is budgeted to cost $30 million over the next four years, making this extension a very modest additional cost to provide the fairness disabled veterans deserve. This is a small price to pay to ensure our most disabled service personnel are not disadvantaged by Labor's Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. If successful in the Senate, I will be supporting the Senate's request for the House to amend the legislation in this respect. I look forward to doing so-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Snowdon, is at the table. Providing fair indexation for Australia's DFRB and DFRDB military superannuants is the right and proper thing to do. My amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 has only been necessary due to the continual intransigence of this government. Last week I spoke in response to the ministerial statement by the Minister for Defence. The member for Eden-Monaro and Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, the Hon. Dr Mike Kelly AM, was also at the table. I had heard he had been saying to his veterans groups that he would be seeking at a later juncture to move a private member's bill to index DFRDB pensions the same way as we are seeking to do. I said to the member for Eden-Monaro: I've heard this. I'm happy exto be wrong. I'm happy to apologise if I'm wrong, and I'll provide every assistance, on indulgence, for the member for Eden Monaro to rise from his seat, to approach the dispatch box, to point out the error of my ways and to say I'm wrong and that that was not his intent or, if it was his intent, to move a private member's bill straight away.' The member for Eden-Monaro did nothing. He did not move. His silence was acquiescent and he walked out of the chamber. He had the opportunity to say, 'I was wrong,' and I would have apologised, but he did not because he has no intention of moving a private member's bill. He is all talk and no action on this. He was all talk and writing letters, all signatures in ink, when he wrote to the then finance minister, Minister Tanner. further But when the rubber hits the road and he is unfair called to the dispatch box to either refuteand I would back down-or to back up his words with action, he shrunk like a wilting violet. The member for Eden-Monaro is a fine man. He is a decent Australian, but he failed that test on that day last week. I urge all to support this amendment. I look in front of me and there is the member for Blair waiting to speak next. The member for Blair said in relation to the latest CPI increase: It is ridiculous to expect people to accept a 0.1 per cent increase. That is unviable, given the of living. It is too meagre and it needs to change. The current situation is unsustainable. exacerbated by a series of fairly low CPI rises ... the Government needs to look at this again. I say to the member for Blair that I have read your comments faithfully, sir. If I have not, stand and correct me. If they are indeed your words-and I know they are-join us in indexing fair and equitable military superannuation. Match your words with action. Do that. You have the chance tonight before the vote comes tomorrow. The Greens said in their 2010 election policy: In a long-running campaign, current and former... defence force personnel have been pushing to ensure their superannuation pensions are indexed fairly and appropriately. It is a campaign the Australian Greens support wholeheartedly. Except when a private member's bill is in the Senate, except when savings are identified and at the time they needed to match the words that they took to an election, the Greens were found wanting. Bob Brown said in March 2011: At the outset I should say that fair indexation is consistent with the Australian Greens policy at the last election. He said that when he needed the votes of 40,000-odd Tasmanians but when it came time to vote in the Senate he was found wanting. One of the Independents in this House, the member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, said of supporting fair indexation: I am the only MP of the Central Coast who is prepared to support them-there are two others who won't. When this comes to the vote, I expect the member for Dobell to be a man of his word and to back up those statements, as I expect of the member for Blair, whom I know to be a man of his word. I know the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, has also publicly supported fair and equitable indexing of DFRB and DFRDB in the past. He said: cost The ALP should be condemned for not doing something about it since its election in 2007. It's become He also said: Defence Force retirees in particular, would be better cared for if the unsatisfactory indexing of defence pensions were overturned in favour of a system that at least keeps up with the cost of living. The Independent member for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott MP, has moved two motions in the House of Representatives calling for fair indexation. The last motion was seconded by the member for New England, Tony Windsor. The member for Lyne said: … there are many in the community who are aggrieved and their concerns deserve to be heard in this House. There are many who are frustrated that government, report after report, seems to get the concerns about a lack of purchasing power within the current military superannuation scheme, yet, when it comes to actually doing something about it, the arguments of cost and difficulty in making those changes seem to be directed towards those who have done military service. He continues: I want it be recognised that Defence service is unique within the Public Service. …… … … the uniqueness of Defence service lies in defending the nation, our sovereignty and our freedoms. They are fine words from the member for Lyne. He continues: I would hope it is generally recognised that CPI is not a good indicator for cost-of-living measures and for purchasing power. …… … In my view the alternatives that are worthy of consideration are in the form of the age and welfare pensions, which are indexed by the new living cost index, to reflect the failings of the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index, or the male total average weekly earnings, whichever is the greater. The Independent member for New England, Tony Windsor, in 2010 asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Minister Lindsay Tanner: What measures will he take, and when, to address the ongoing concerns within the veteran community that (a) the indexation of military superannuation pensions against the Consumer Price Index is not an accurate measure of the cost of living, and (b) inequality exists between the indexing of military superannuation pensions and other pensions such as age and welfare; and will he consider introducing a fairer indexation method for military superannuation pensions in line with that used to calculate age and welfare pensions. In conclusion, prior to the 2007 election the Labor Party indicated that they would index pensions. Many of their front bench wrote to Minister Tanner seeking the indexation of pensions. Many of the Independents, as I have just quoted, have publicly stated their desire to index military pensions. The cost is about $100 to $150 million in cash terms over the next four years. Savings of up to $250 million were outlined in the private senator's bill in the Senate last year. Within two months of that private senator's bill being defeated by Labor and the Greens the Minister for Defence acted on those savings and pocketed that money. It was promised, the Independents have backed it, the money was outlined, the money was found, and the money was pocketed. There is no reason this parliament this week should not join with and support the coalition in saying that no more steps will be taken in this area and on this bill until the fair indexation of DFRB and DFRDB pensions is addressed. We call on those who have publicly called on this issue, those who CPI in have made a point of this issue and those who have stood on soapboxes on this issue to seek votes to now stand and put their vote where their mouth is and support the coalition on indexing pensions.",164
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Is the amendment seconded?,169
235,Mr RANDALL,BILLS, I second the amendment.,169
236,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. The Repatriation Commission is responsible for determining and managing claims under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission is responsible for determining and managing claims under the MRCA and the SRCA. Lest we think that these bits of legislation are irrelevant or small, they certainly do affect people across the electorates in this place. MRCA active clients in the electorate of Blair as at 30 March 2012 total 129 people. SRCA active clients in Blair as at 30 March 2012 total 252 people. These are people whose lives will benefit from this form of legislation. There are a range of miscellaneous measures in this bill. To a certain extent the measures tidy up things that have happened, exempt for income tax purposes certain things and ensure that, for example, people on Norfolk Island are eligible for clean energy payments under the Veterans' Entitlement Acts and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. I will deal briefly with each of those as we go through it. The first element of this particular bill before the chamber deals with travel expenses for treatment. The DVA funds eligible people for travel to appointments for medical treatment. It is a sad fact that as veterans get older, and sometimes because of what they have experienced, they have more medical treatment and need more travel for those purposes than other Australians, particularly if they are living in regional rural areas in an electorate like mine. The amendment makes clear the policy that has been happening in practice-namely, that within the act this type of travel can be approved by the DVA after the travel has been undertaken by a particular person who is eligible for reimbursement. This practice has been undertaken by the DVA for a very long time and it really now is simply authorised by the legislation in order to avoid any hint or suggestion that it is not actually covered. The next aspect of the amendments is eligibility under the Defence Service Homes Act for an operation in the Red Sea from 13 to 19 January 1993, Operation DAMASKVI, and reclassification as operational service. It makes sure that those who have been engaged in this particular operation for that short period of time will, as a result, eligible for subsidised home loans and insurance under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. The third aspect that I wish to deal with briefly is special assistance. The VEA and the MRCA give the commission the power to extend special assistance and benefits to people not otherwise provided for under the legislation. Currently, that is provided by means of a regulation. This amendment makes it clear that that sort of assistance is provided by way of a legislative instrument rather than regulation, and it permits more timely payment and assistance to be provided. The fourth area the amendments deal with is debt recovery-the technical amendment making sure that debt recovery provision within the legislation applies to all possible circumstances relating to debt recovery. The fifth area, as I said before, deals with clean energy payments payable to people residing in Australia. I am not always sure and that people who live in Norfolk Island think they actually are Australians. Having visited the place myself and having enjoyed a holiday there, I can say that the Norfolk Island residents are unique people. But these amendments make sure that Norfolk Island residents are eligible for clean energy assistance payments, as any other Australians would be. The next aspect deals with the MRCA supplement. In 2009, this federal Labor government implemented historic pension reform, the largest pension increase we have ever seen in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. As part of that package we introduced the MRCA supplement which replaced the telephone and pharmaceutical allowances that were payable. The amendment really just fixes up a clause and makes sure that all references to be the previous telephone and pharmaceutical allowances are replaced with a reference to the supplement that now exists, which is now described as the MRCA supplement. The next area is the bereavement payment. The VEA provides a bereavement payment to the estate of a deceased veteran or member who was in receipt of a special rate or extreme disability adjustment payment and who has died in indigent circumstances-very poor circumstances. The amendment makes sure that that bereavement payment is exempt for income tax purposes. The next aspect of this particular amendment bill-and, as I said, it is very much a tidying-up provision-deals with the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme, which provides reimbursement of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the purchase of pharmaceuticals under that scheme. Approximately 70,000 veterans and members are eligible for annual, automatic reimbursement of those costs. Those payments will commence on 1 January 2013. The amendment simply makes crystal clear that the payments here are tax-free. The previous speaker dealt with issues in relation to DFRDB. What he failed to say was that for nearly 12 years the coalition nothing in relation to that issue. There was lot of sanctimony and unction mentioned, and there were displays of passion, but really they did nothing in relation to that issue. Further, the member did not point out the fact that what they were proposing excluded about 150,000 Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme members from June 2011. He failed to mention the fact that, under his proposal, other Commonwealth public servants are excluded from receiving payments under similar types of schemes. So there was a lot of passion and unction, but the coalition simply failed to specify to the House that that proposal-which he now says they will do, which the Howard government never did and which the then minister for finance, Nick Minchin, opposed passionately and would never get through past Peter Costello or John Howard-is something that he claims they will do. But what he should really say is that in the past they have always opposed that. He also now wants to discriminate in his proposal in relation to this. I do not think it is appropriate to bring this amendment to this particular legislation. The member is trying to simply discriminate, as I have said, between different forms of military service and service on behalf of the public. The legislation that is before the House is very clear legislation that will be to the benefit of many Australians, particularly Australians who live in my electorate, and I support the legislation.",169
237,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. In doing so, I need to point out that serving and retired members of the Australian Defence Force should not be treated as less than worthy citizens when it comes to superannuation entitlements. This is, unfortunately, exactly how they are faring did under this Labor government. Australian a veterans risked their lives for our country, yet this extraordinary level of faith has not been returned in kind by this miserable, miserly government. As a condition of employment, fair indexation for veterans must be a nondiscretionary obligation in the budget. It is a topic close to my heart and I have already spoken about it in this House on a number of occasions. In fact, I asked in this chamber on 18 June this year: why is fair indexation not affordable for military superannuation pensioners? It is affordable for some 3½ million aged pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries, and for certain parliamentary and judicial superannuation pensioners. A condition of service provides for retirement pay-a superannuation pension which maintains its purchasing power. Its purchasing power is a condition of service upon which veterans plan their retirements. Service people themselves must make compulsory contributions. The government is bound to honour all those employment conditions, and the veterans argue that the budget should provide for fair indexation as a nondiscretionary item before other discretionary items. I have received an email from my constituent Robert Bak of Bethungra, who is the President of the Integrated Service People's Association of Australia, an organisation which does a power of good helping veterans with all manner of things. Mr Bak writes: It is not acceptable to the ex-service community, to have both sides procrastinate over this very serious issue. It is even more important than other current issues. He concluded by saying: … we are not going to let this matter rest. And nor should they, and nor should Mr Bak. Wagga Wagga is a proud triservice Riverina city, with bases for the Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy. Blamey Barracks at Kapooka are the home of the soldier, with every Australian Army recruit passing through prior to other deployments. Those presently posted to Wagga Wagga know how essential fair superannuation is to their futures. And, like Mr Bak, they also know that the coalition is fighting hard to give them what they want, to give them what they need. They also know that those on the other side of the political equation are not. I have received much correspondence about this matter from Bert Hoebee, who was the Deputy Commandant at Blamey Barracks Kapooka in 1989 and 1990. Now retired but passionately pursuing this issue on behalf of all veterans, Mr Hoebee had this to say in his latest stinging rebuke: I believe that our argument is unassailable as far as its fairness and logic goes. Too right! The coalition are committed to military superannuation reform, and on 5 March this year the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Michael Ronaldson, signed the coalition's pledge to deliver fair indexation. This pledge states the coalition's clear commitment to our veterans, to those who have served, to those who are serving, and to those who will serve into the future. And we will deliver fair indexation to 57,000 military superannuants and their families. The pledge also ensures that the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme are indexed in the same manner as age and service pensions. This will benefit all superannuants aged 55 years and over. The coalition want to see fair indexation. We know how important, how needed and how just it is. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 includes a number of minor technical amendments to veterans' legislation. However, the main issue of concern that parliament must immediately deal with is the unfair, unjust and inequitable situation confronting military superannuants. It is unacceptable that this Labor government continues to tarry with semantics while at the same time bluntly ignoring the everyday concerns of veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. Whilst the coalition support this amendment, we believe it can be made better, and we seek to legislate fair indexation as a requirement for this bill to pass. Furthermore, once this legislation is passed through the House of Representatives the coalition will seek to make the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme the fair system it deserves to be. The coalition moved an amendment to defer the debate, and this was not done lightly. We believe it is vital this legislation incorporates fair indexation. This is fair, it is just and it is equitable for military superannuants-men and women, as I say, who put their lives in harm's way for our country. On Saturday I attended commemoration service for the Vietnam veterans in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga. One of the questions I was asked-not once, but several times-was, 'When is this parliament going to fairly index military pensions?' The coalition made a commitment to fair indexation on 27 June 2010 and took this commitment to the 2010 election. Although not able to form government, we introduced legislation to the Senate on 18 November 2010 to bring about indexation for DFRB and DFRDB military superannuants. On 24 March 2011 the Greens and Labor called for yet another inquiry into the legislation. The coalition opposed this on grounds that there have been more than half a dozen inquiries, all of which have supported fair indexation. The Greens and Labor used the inquiry to oppose fair indexation-the first parliament which has ever opposed fair indexation. This is disgraceful, and Labor and Greens members should hang their heads in shame at the way Australian veterans-who lived the ANZAC legacy-are being treated. Failure to justly index military superannuation pensions comes at a significant cost to veterans' purchasing power. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has argued a superannuant on $58,000 per year did not need fair indexation-they were already well off. However, what the minister failed to acknowledge is that the average DFRDB military pension is just $24,386almost 2½ times less than the figure he quoted in June. Veterans received letters in June this year offering an increase to their pensions. These increases were a measly few cents and, really, were a slap in the face to military superannuants, with many receiving less than a $1 increase per fortnight. Is this what they deserve after their years of service, the their dedication and the sacrifice that they made, and the risks that they took? Peter Grimmer, a retired warrant officer (aircrew), who served from 1965 until 1985, wrote to me stating he would receive an increase of 96c per fortnight, a pitiful total of $24.96 per annum. He told me the increase made him feel 'not only physically sick over this vile betrayal but very angry and very abused'. I think anyone could understand why Mr Grimmer feels this way, although this government continues to look the other way. It is time Labor faced reality and told veterans such as Mr Grimmer how less than a dollar a fortnight will help meet the ever increasing costs of living, costs which are the not helped by the imposition of the carbon tax. Labor claims it will cost too much to fairly index military superannuants. To that I say: how can delivering what is rightly owed to military superannuants, people who put their lives on the line for Australia, cost too much? The current Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme is also flawed, and it is unfair. The coalition seeks to amend legislation to deliver equality for disabled veterans with high pharmaceutical costs. Under Labor there is division between disabled veterans-those with qualifying service and those without. Up to 1,500 disabled veterans receive no assistance from the scheme as it currently stands. These are disabled veterans who receive the special rate, or totally and permanently incapacitated, but do not have qualifying service as defined by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The coalition proposed a comprehensive veterans' pharmaceutical reimbursement scheme at the 2010 election which delivered financial relief to more than 80,000 disabled veterans. It did not create two classes of veterans and it ensured that all of Australia's most disabled veterans had no out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenses. Furthermore, the coalition's scheme was immediate. There were no cumbersome reimbursements needed, nor any need for technical amendments to ensure the scheme functions properly, as the legislation before us today proposes. Under the coalition's scheme, a veteran who qualified would pay for only 30 scripts per year and, once they reached this number, under the veterans' pharmaceutical safety net threshold they would pay no more. This meant financial relief for veterans. Labor's scheme leaves veterans waiting for the calendar to tick over to a new year before they receive any financial relief for the cost of pharmaceuticals. It is important the government does the right thing by our retired military personnel. It is time to stop to the discrimination against them and to recognise the conditions of their employment, to which they contributed financially during their service. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (19:53): I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. Today's bill includes nine changes to various pieces of legislation which are technical and non-controversial in nature. The coalition will support the passage of the nine adjustments in this bill, which include clarifications under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and others. For example, the legislation will rationalise the maintenance income provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act by addressing redundant definitions and aligning definitions with those in the Social Security Act. As the member for Fadden has already indicated, the bill presents the House with an opportunity to implement real change for veterans. As this legislation amendment bill includes important legislative changes and is intended to change conditions for veterans and ex-service people, it is more than appropriate that all avenues to improve the lives of veterans and their families be considered in this context. As such, the coalition has proposed two amendments to rectify indexation for military superannuants and to rectify provisions in the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. I have said previously in this House that the only way to deliver this very important reform is to change the government. Today's amendments mean that this need not be the case in the short term. The introduction of this bill in the House is an opportunity to effect real change for our veterans; it is an put a opportunity to pass these very important amendments. They are important because veterans-as well as the coalition-have had enough of this tired Labor government, which refuses to support their community. It is an opportunity to commit this country to fair indexation of military superannuation pensions under the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme, the DFRB Scheme, and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, the DFRDB Scheme. Fair indexation is one of the most important issues affecting the veteran and ex-service community. I spoke in my maiden speech about Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, which is in the Ryan electorate, and I acknowledged the very valued contribution made by their service men and women. In that speech, I recommitted to fair indexation of the DFRBS and the DFRDBS. It is a community to which I recommit myself again, and it is an issue for which I will continue to fight. As such, I, with my coalition colleagues, am drawing a line in the sand when it comes to supporting veterans, and I call on the Labor Party and the Greens to finally accept that it is time for indexation. It is time that this parliament delivered for veterans. This issue is not new, and the coalition has a proud record on which to stand when it comes to supporting veterans. The Leader of the Opposition first announced our commitment to fair indexation on 27 July 2010, more than two years ago and prior to the last election. Since then, on 18 November 2010, the coalition, in the Senate, introduced legislation so that we could finally and effectively deal with this issue. At that time, the Labor Party and the Greens did what they do best-referred the issue to an inquiry. As veterans know, this is merely this LaborGreen government's way of delaying and delaying, hoping that the issue will go away. We opposed an inquiry because by 2010 there had already been more than six parliamentary inquiries, and I remind the members on the opposite side of the House that every single inquiry prior to 2011 held into fair indexation had supported its implementation. Instead, Labor and the Greens used that inquiry as a pretence to oppose fair indexation, the first time ever that parliament had done so. Finally, on 16 June 2011, in what can only be called a day of disgrace for the Senate, the Labor Party and the Greens combined to vote down the coalition's fair indexation legislation. On that day, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens demonstrated that they do not care about the lives of military superannuants and their families. Since then, the coalition has maintained its strong commitment to fair indexation, and earlier this year I signed the coalition's pledge to deliver fair indexation. This pledge has also been signed by the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for veterans affairs and many other members of the coalition. That pledge says: The coalition will ensure DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions are indexed in the same way as age and service pensions. All DFRB and DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will benefit. Just this morning, my office received yet another letter from a constituent in Ryan, asking what my position is on this policy and asking what the coalition will do for military superannuants. In my electorate, I represent many groups, including the Returned Services League with sub-branches at Gaythorne, Kenmore-Moggill and Indooroopilly-Sherwood, as well as the Australian Army Aviation Association, the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service Australia and the VSAS Toowong branch, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam Association, and the many members of the Australian Defence Force at Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera. The Defence community and the veteran community want fair indexation, and they know it should happen now. I can say with pride that, should the ALP and the Greens continue to neglect this issue by not accepting the coalition's amendments and should we the coalition be elected by the Australian people, the coalition will deliver this reform in our very first budget. This was a promise at the 2010 election. It will be a promise at the next election, and I can give an ironclad guarantee that a coalition government will deliver this important reform. At present the average DFRDB pension is a meagre $24,386. In June 2012Debate interrupted. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Chiapas Declaration",171
238,Ms PARKE,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the inaugural international parliamentary conference on ‘Parliaments, minorities and Indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics' was held in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico from 31 October to 3 November 2010; (b) the conference was organised jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Mexican Congress of the Union and Government of the State of Chiapas, in partnership with the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Independent Expert on minority issues and the Minority Rights Group International; (c) the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of discrimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of poverty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, including at the level of the national parliament; (d) the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a ‘plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and nondiscrimination a reality; (e) the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the ‘plans of action': (i) ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legislative and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures; (ii) require of government that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and Indigenous peoples; (iii) make regular use of plenary sessions in parliament and other parliamentary fora to discuss minority/Indigenous matters in order to raise awareness and combat prejudice in society, organise awareness-raising sessions for all parliamentarians so as to increase their knowledge of minorities and Indigenous peoples and the particular problems they face, and ensure that minority and Indigenous issues are mainstreamed into parliamentary work, especially at the committee level; (iv) allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parliamentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and (v) increase parliaments' familiarity with work being done within the United Nations system so as to equip them better to hold and governments to account for their international commitments, including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, urge ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, hold debates in parliament on the conclusions and recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special mechanisms with regard to minority and Indigenous peoples' rights; (f) the Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and Indigenous peoples, and address their concerns in their party programs; and (g) the IPU will facilitate networking among parliaments on this issue, monitor the implementation of the Chiapas Declaration and convene a follow-up meeting within two years to discuss progress and set targets for future action; (2) urges the Government, parliamentarians, and political parties to familiarise themselves with the Chiapas Declaration; and (3) calls upon the Government to facilitate a round-table discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration.",175
239,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,177
240,Ms PARKE,BILLS,"I am very pleased to speak to this motion, the genesis of which was my participation, on behalf of the Australian parliament, in the inaugural InterParliamentary Union conference Parliaments, minorities and indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics, that was held in Chiapas, Mexico, in late 2010, and involved 93 parliamentary delegates from 34 countries. Many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of discrimination, exclusion and poverty suffered by members of these groups. Yet minorities and indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision making, including at the level of the national parliament. The conference considered various examples of inadequate participation across different national political and electoral systems. It considered the consequences of poor participation of minorities and indigenous peoples, particularly with respect to decision-making and policy development, and it discussed and examined a range of programs designed to achieve higher levels of minority and indigenous engagement. The IPU Chiapas conference applauded Australia's national apology to Indigenous Australians in 2008, our endorsement of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the implementation of the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, which was specifically highlighted in the concluding remarks of that conference. However, the conference also recognised the vast overrepresentation of Aboriginal Australians in the criminal justice system and their significantly poorer health, education and employment outcomes. There could be little doubt that the underrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in our ballot booths, in our parliaments and in on other decision-making roles has been a significant factor in allowing the adverse situation experienced by so many to persist. It was only four years ago that a WA Indigenous elder Mr Ward died an entirely unnecessary and avoidable death while he was being transported 360 kilometres on a very hot day in the back of a prison van with no ventilation or air-conditioning. That terrible event occurred 107 years after the then Labor member for Coolgardie, Hugh Mahon, moved a motion in the first year of the federal parliament calling for a royal commission into the conditions for Aboriginal people in northern Western Australia and the administration of justice. That motion was never debated. It was not until the 1960s that Indigenous Australians gained the right to vote and stand for election to the federal parliament. Since that time, while there have been a number of Aboriginal people elected to state and territory parliaments, there have only been three elected to this place-Senator Neville Bonner, Senator Aiden Ridgeway and Ken Wyatt, the member for Hasluck. In an interview with About the House magazine earlier this year, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda said that, while politicians are getting better at communicating with diverse groups, there is no substitute for direct government's representation. He noted: When ATSIC was finally abolished, there wasn't one Aboriginal person in parliament. Pino Migliorino, Chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, said in the same article, which was entitled 'Of the people', that it is clear the Australian parliament is also failing when it comes to representing people from other culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. He noted that the dominance of the political landscape by the major parties means they themselves need to take direct responsibility for improving diversity in the parliament. In that article, I noted that all members have a role to play in improving diversity in both political parties and the parliament. I said: I don't think indigenous or minority issues should be just a matter for indigenous or minority groups. They concern us all, they affect the quality our democracy, the inclusiveness of our democracy … The IPU conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urged every parliament, within two years, to adopt a plan of action to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality. One key initiative is to require that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and indigenous peoples. Considering that Australia now has in place an assessment mechanism when it comes to our human rights obligations, I believe it would be possible, and not administratively burdensome, for an aspect of that process to be dedicated specifically to considering the impact on minorities and indigenous peoples. The Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and indigenous peoples and address their concerns in their party programs. This is a matter I intend to take up within my own party and I hope other members will consider doing the same. Finally, I note that the Chiapas Declaration urged national parliaments to hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and indigenous citizens within two years. This motion is part of that debate and it also moves matters forward by calling upon the government to facilitate a round-table discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. I thank those members taking part in this debate tonight, I thank the IPU for holding this important conference with the support of the United Nations and Minority Rights Group, and I thank the government of Chiapas in Mexico for being wonderful hosts. I look of forward to the next IPU conference on this important matter. (Time expired) Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (20:05): I thank the member for Fremantle for her motion. I concur with the sentiment of the member for Fremantle that it is a very important issue that minorities and our Indigenous communities are well represented in this House and in the broader community. As the member for Fremantle has pointed out, the Chiapas Declaration relates to a conference held in Mexico back in 2010 on Parliaments, minorities and indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics. The outcome of this conference saw the adoption of the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to adopt a plan of action to provide the right to equal participation and nondiscrimination a reality for minorities and indigenous people. I would like to make the point at the outset that here in Australia. I think we do a very good job of this already. It amazes me that a lot of these declarations talk about people's rights but never talk about people's responsibilities. I would challenge the member for Fremantle's contribution to this debate. She draws a long bow to suggest that overrepresentation of our Indigenous peoples in prison, which is a terrible situation, is directly related to the level of Indigenous representation in the various parliaments around this country. We do not need further regulation or bureaucracies. They will do little to change the situation. Change is driven by the desire of individuals through their behaviours, attitudes and beliefs. I am fortunate in being able to share some local examples where action is being taken by people in our community who represent minorities or Indigenous groups. In particular, one of our younger Indigenous people, a 16-year-old constituent living in my electorate, was the Queensland leader of the National Indigenous Youth Parliament. Letisha Jarden has written about this experience for the ABC online. In her article she says: For a shared future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia all aspects of life are to be considered equally. It is important that we focus on parliamentary representation as every culture has a background and beliefs that should be appreciated on a federal level. Indigenous Australians bring unique and valuable perspective to parliament and political debates. This culture should have opportunities to work side by side with other Australian political to shape our future together. Here in Australia we have done a great job in that regard, but we can always do better. By way of example, we have Indigenous leaders such as Warren Mundine, who was the national president of the Labor Party. We have my colleague Ken Wyatt here in the parliament and we had Neville Bonner. They are terrific examples of the opportunities available for people from this country's Indigenous communities. Equally, if I look at some of the candidates for the forthcoming federal election, one of our candidates-in a seat next to mine-is from a Taiwanese background. So there are those opportunities for people who wish to become involved in the political process. Letisha Jarden went on to explain in her article that the program is a vital initiative introduced by the Australian Electoral Commission in partnership with the YMCA. The program consists of some 50 young Indigenous people aged 16 to 25. It is the first time in Australian history that young Indigenous people like Letisha have been given the opportunity for their generation to be heard. I am very proud of Letisha's involvement in the National Youth Parliament and I believe that on-the-ground practical initiatives such as these will help encourage future participation in politics by Indigenous Australians. I am sure that we need to allocate additional resources, but spending time doing impact assessments and making sure every piece of legislation has an impact statement or having public hearingstalkfests-I do not think achieves the outcomes we are seeking. (Time expired) Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (20:11): There has been much emphasis on parliamentary representation but this Chiapas Declaration encompassed other plenary leaders sessions to discuss the matter-situation impact studies, the need for free, prior and informed consent et cetera. I commend the nature of this resolution. I want to refer to another UN related area on Indigenous people. I was pleased to recently attend the Nepalese Indigenous Nationalities Forum's annual event at Campsie, with about 300 in attendance. Since 2006 this organisation has been about demonstrating the rights of Indigenous people in Nepal. It has been about making sure there is language preservation through the holding of conferences. I want to commend Ganesh Tamang and others for making sure that these issues are raised on behalf of indigenous Nepalese in Australia. Where we do not have consent around the world we see realities such as the San people being thrown off their land in Botswana on behalf of De Beers and its diamond interests. We see the deforestation of Brazil and Peru and the throwing of people out of their villages and off their land without any consultation in regard to mining in those countries. We see the movement of large numbers of people into the Jumma people's lands in Bangladesh. I want to stress the work of Kabita Chakma in Australia. For a group that has only about 100 or 150 people in this nation, it has very much punched above its weight in raising these issues with the federal government. We see the situation of Uighurs and Tibetans in China, where there is not any consideration of their rights-no role in their representation, no consideration of their needs. Whilst the previous speaker who spoke in this debate said that we do things pretty well in Australia, I am not sure it is all that brilliant, quite frankly. We have a situation where life expectancy of Indigenous males is 11.5 years lower, and females 9.7 years lower, than non-Indigenous Australians. We know the Closing the gap report showed that Indigenous Australians are four times more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to die when they are 35 to 44. The member for Fremantle referred to only one of the many deaths of Indigenous people in incarceration. It is just a bit too common seeing Taser attacks in police stations that have a disproportionate representation Indigenous people. Reading rates for Indigenous people in years 3 to 9 are 18.6 per cent to 21.6 per cent of non-Indigenous people. Writing rates are between 16.3 and 31.4 per cent of non-Indigenous people. The government has moved ahead in regard to the Healing Foundation and the apology to Indigenous Australians. It has talked about concepts of closing this lifeexpectancy gap within a generation, halving the gap in the mortality rate and halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12, or equivalent attainment rates, by 2020. These are noble sentiments. I appreciate that the government has also devoted money to increasing the understanding of Australians and the need to recognise Indigenous people in our Constitution. But we cannot pretend that things are pretty in Australia with regard to Indigenous Australians. I certainly commend this motion. I agree with the previous speaker insofar as whether you have seven Indigenous people in this parliament or four might not be, by itself, that crucial to Indigenous people's rights but it is a part of a broader agenda, as this nation's resolution indicates. This declaration was adopted by a large variety of countries at an international conference. The organisations that were involved in it included the InterParliamentary Union, the Mexican congress, the government of the state of ChiapasChiapas historically had major conflicts in the nineties regarding Indigenous rightsand the United Nations. It covers the gamut of things that can be done. If we can make sure we do consider Indigenous rights when legislation comes before this parliament, if we can have sessions that do raise the awareness of these issues, then these are valuable things. To decry them as over-regulation or overbureaucratisation is to run away from facing very significant problems in this country. As of I said earlier, we can go around the world and see a wide variety of nations where Indigenous people are deprived of their rights, where their languages disappearing because of lack of government support and where their culture is disappearing. I very much believe this resolution coming out of this conference is well and truly overdue.",177
241,Ms GAMBARO,BILLS," I rise to speak on the motion moved by the honourable member for Fremantle. This motion acknowledges the inaugural international conference 'Parliaments, minorities and indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics', held in Chiapas, Mexico in October 2010. It also adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to, inter alia, hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a plan of action to make the right to equal participation and nondiscrimination a reality. The motion also calls upon the government to facilitate a round-table discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. I respectfully acknowledge the intent of the motion and the motivation behind it by the member for Fremantle; however, when it comes to dealing with Indigenous issues and participation in this country the time for talk is surely over. I think every single member of this parliament condemns discrimination, particularly Indigenous discrimination. And whilst small elements of discrimination may still remain acceptable to some people in our community, the way to eradicate it is to send strong messages from community leaders and politicians that it is not acceptable. How we achieve Indigenous reconciliation and increased Indigenous participation is through increased action on the ground and actual results, not through talks and roundtables. are Increasingly, we are seeing more Indigenous members of parliament in many of the state parliaments of Australia and in the federal parliament. The honourable member for Hasluck became the first ever Indigenous member of the House of Representatives in 2010. When you have incredible role models such as the member for Hasluck, thousands of young Indigenous Australians become inspired to take entitled leadership roles in our communities just as they are inspired by many of the members here from different ethnic backgrounds. We are the leaders of our community and we do inspire many from non-English-speaking backgrounds as well. One day, we will hopefully see equal participation in this nation. We recently had the National Indigenous Youth Parliament, which, from all reports, was a huge success. We have seen some fantastic work being done by the private sector in Indigenous employment. We all know the high rate of Indigenous unemployment and the lack of employment opportunity amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The way to truly empower Indigenous people is for them to have employment with regular income. It is interesting to note that this government and Treasurer come out and bag people like Twiggy Forrest on an almost daily basis, yet the work he really does with the Australian Employment Covenant, finding 10,000 jobs for Aboriginal people, is absolutely inspiring, and he never falters from his goal. In my home state of Queensland there is a bill before the parliament to repeal the Wild Rivers laws that were introduced by the Bligh government. These laws make land within one kilometre of a prescribed watercourse pristine and unable to be used or developed. This has had a massive impact on the ability of Indigenous Australians in Cape York to create their own opportunities. There are many examples of practical things that can be achieved to inspire and empower Indigenous participation and achieve the goals set by the Chiapas Declaration. As a former employer, I have had many opportunities to work with Indigenous people and have tried to mentor and support them in the workplace. But I believe more needs to be done. More employers need to work in this space and work on initiatives to ensure that Indigenous people have every opportunity for success in the workplace. In conclusion, I support the sentiment behind the motion. I commend the member for Fremantle, as she often brings very meaningful motions to this parliament and they are well thought out. She brings her many years of past experience in the United Nations to this parliament. We should be working for real results, we should be working on the ground with real employers and we should be providing much more action to help Indigenous participation in nation through real and practical role models and through working with the business sector.",181
242,Mr JENKINS,BILLS," I join with other members of this debate in thanking the member for Fremantle for bringing this motion before us and I thank the member for Brisbane for her very gracious remarks about the member for Fremantle. This Chiapas Declaration arose from a meeting held in Chiapas, Mexico, in October and November 2010. The meeting was organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Mexican congress and the government of the state of Chiapas. This is an example of the good work that the InterParliamentary Union can do. Too often the IPU is seen as a talkfest of parliaments, a reason for parliamentarians to travel the world. That has not actually been my experience of the IPU. The IPU has been focused on outcomes, focused on influencing the way that parliaments throughout the world can have an impact. Whether it be gender inequality in our membership or whether it be the way that parliaments can oversee aid work, there has definitely been a move to ensure that the member parliaments of the IPU do good work, and this is an example of it. I have been asked over the last few weeks, since announcing my retirement, what was the most significant moment of my parliamentary career. It most definitely was the apology that took place in this chamber the day after I was elected Speaker. The leadership that was shown by this chamber on that day was very important. But I put a very important caveat on that: it was only a commencement; there is much to be done. It has to be acknowledged that this government took on board, right from its early months, that it had a responsibility to ensure that we this looked at ways in which we could close the gap in outcomes, across a whole host of areas, between Indigenous and nonIndigenous people. The important thing that I have looked for is that we include Indigenous people in the political processes that lead to decisions that will decrease the gap, because if we do not involve Indigenous people we will not achieve things. I remember how, throughout the inquiry into Indigenous health by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs which led to the Health is life report, I was so impressed that Indigenous people, when offered the opportunity to outline what they would do if they were the decision makers, actually knew strongly what was required. That meant to me that they should be listened to. One of our recommendations was that we should increase community control of health services for Indigenous communities. We said recommendation: The communitythe Indigenous communityhas a responsibility to determine the nature of that control. There needs to be flexibility in arrangements to ensure that each community is able to have the services which best meet their needs within a broader accreditation process. It is a simple thing, allowing the communities to be involved. I have one great example of that currently occurring in the electorate of Scullin. Scullin is not known for a large Indigenous community, but that community is growing, because Indigenous peoples living in the outer northern suburbs of Melbourne have been allowed the opportunity to be involved in decision making for themselves. We have had the opening of Bubup Wilam for Early Learning. 'Bubup Wilam' means 'children's place' in the Wuywurrung language, so it is the children's place for early learning. The important thing here is that the Indigenous community itself has made decisions about how Bubup Wilam operates. They see that one of their purposes is to promote, encourage, support and assist local Aboriginal communities to develop independent and sustainable responses to the needs of Aboriginal children and families. That is encouraging them to be involved in the political processes. Of course, down the track we must ensure that there is a greater representation of our Indigenous people and other minorities in this parliament, in both houses, but along the way we must encourage Indigenous people to be involved in those things that most affect them. What impresses me about the motion that has been put before us by the member for Fremantle is the final point. It urges us as parliamentarians and political parties and as the Australian government to familiarise ourselves with the Chiapas Declaration and to implement the in that recommended measures to the extent possible. Some of the kind of contention we have had in the last few months might be prevented if we could sit down and work ways through that Indigenous people can be involved in their own outcomes. (Time expired)",182
243,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I thank the member for Fremantle for her motion on the Chiapas Declaration. I acknowledge the comments of the member for Scullin. One of the things that we have to seriously think about is that statements like the Chiapas Declaration are the culmination of people coming together to look at righting wrongs and making changes that are more far-reaching than just their own circumstances. One of the challenges that we often face when we consider international conventions is our capacity to take elements of them and use them within a domestic context. If we bring about change, then change has to be influenced. When I listen to colleagues speak on this motion, the points they raise are extremely valid, but there is also a divergence of viewpoints. There is nothing wrong with that in the debates that you have around a statement that has come from a forum of like-minded people seeking to find a way forward and a resolution to the complex issues that impact in terms of socio-economic determinants. But it is more important that we take the intent and the spirit of statements such as this one and collectively, with a tripartisan approach, look at how we use that framework to bring about the changes. We have within Australia a bilateral commitment in respect of closing the gap. One of the critical elements that is missing but that is reflected well in this statement is the one of partnership, the way in which we allow people to sit as equals to plan their destiny. I agree with an earlier speaker that does not matter how many Indigenous or minority members we have in this chamber-although it is good when we have a number of such members both in the Senate and here-but rather it is the capacity to have people involved in the policymaking within the bureaucracy, to have people not at the lower echelons of government agencies but at the senior levels. When you sit as a member of the senior executive service, you impart a perspective that influences people's thinking and the way in which an agency will implement programs, policies and services. I think that is the crux of this statement from Mexico. It is about the equal positioning in those plans and in setting future directions. All of us at different times have given a commitment with regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. To some extent, it has been there but not in a way that is changing. I think the previous Prime Minister in his apology made the comment quite succinctly that if it has not worked and that if change has not occurred then we should change the way we do business. The statement said that participation as equal partners will bring about the reforms that we need. Everybody in this chamber has an electorate, and if we consider everyone's roles within their electorates then I would certainly challenge each and every one of us, including myself, to get out there and make sure we know what the issues are that Aboriginal people and communities and organisations and communities face. It is by that process that we can effect and influence change. Whilst I acknowledge the statement, I think that sometimes we do not need a statement of that ilk in order for us to better represent those within our electorates who are disadvantaged. Certainly there is nothing preventing any member from making a it difference and personally working towards the closing of the gap that prevails for Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander communities.",183
244,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. Debate adjourned. NA Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,184
245,Ms GRIERSON,BILLS," I am pleased to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. This private member's bill seeks to amend the Marriage Act 1961. Item 1 of schedule 1 will amend the current legal definition of marriage to read that 'marriage means the union of two people, regardless of their sex, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'. 'For life' is a big commitment for anyone to make, but this is a commitment that many same-sex couples would like the opportunity to make. My position in support of same-sex marriage is well known, and I have spoken on it before. In 2006 I was the first member of parliament to sign Australian Marriage Equality's Charter of Equality. I did so even though staff were surprised and warned me that it was not ALP policy. I have always had the belief that I am a human being first, no matter what party I belong to or what my role is. On the human level, it was the right thing to do. We should never discriminate against people based on sexual orientationnot in marriage law, not in superannuation law, not in social security law, not in any other law. It is unacceptable to treat one group of citizens different from another. This is why I am proud to be a member of the party that removed 85-odd pieces of discrimination against same-sex couples from Commonwealth laws when we came into government. In Newcastle, the city I represent, around 60 per cent of people who have contacted me have supported marriage equality-a figure in line with the recent survey by the House of Representatives Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, in which over 177,000 Australians expressed support for marriage equality; 64 per cent of respondents. Galaxy Research polling also indicates support for marriage equality at this same level, the highest level since polling on marriage equality began in 2009. It is lovely to the Australian people on this issue, and I would love to think this parliament would also be with the Australian people on this issue. I do respect the right of others to hold differing viewpoints when it comes to the issue of marriage. I also respect the rights religious bodies to be exempt from having to perform non-heterosexual marriages. This bill gives provision to that, ensuring that no minister of religion would be bound to solemnise a marriage where the two individuals were of the same sex. Many people have made appointments to see me to talk about their views, and I respect those views. Many of those views were about religion-as I said, this bill covers off on that-but they also spoke very much about marriage being about children, including the protection and the raising of children. In 30 years in education as a teacher and a principal I saw many children abused and mistreated by their biological parents. I saw many children loved, nurtured and given great hope by people who were not their biological parents but were their guardians. So I cannot buy the idea that biological parents are obviously the best people to raise children-it just is not always the case. On Saturday 11 August hundreds turned out at Newcastle City Hall for the Rally for Marriage Equality, marking the eighth anniversary of the Howard government's provocative ban on equal marriage rights. It is important to remember that the Marriage Act never said marriage was between a man and a woman until John Howard changed it. It was always about polygamy and not allowing multiple relationships in a marriage. It was never defined until John Howard put it in. That was a very retrograde step. A number of locals spoke at the rally, including the inspirational Michelle Lancey, who runs Parents, Families and Friends of be with Lesbians and Gays in Newcastle-an invaluable support network in my region. Michelle spoke at the ALP National Conference. She is a mother who would like to see both of her boys be able to marry. One is homosexual and one is heterosexual, and of she finds it very sad that their relationships are not of equal value. La Trobe University's 2011 Writing themselves in report, which surveyed the experiences of over 3,000 gay youth between 14 and 21, found that 79 per cent of students attracted to the same sex had been physically assaulted or verbally abused. It is time this country matured. That is not acceptable in any country. It is time tolerance was extended to everybody. It is sad to see the suicide rates amongst gay young people as well. It is time to legislate for marriage equality. We would not be acting alonemany countries have done this. I am pleased to support the bill. (Time expired)",184
246,Mr SECKER,BILLS," I find it very interesting that the member for Newcastle, in speaking on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 currently before us, said it was a retrograde step for Prime Minister John Howard to define marriage as being 'between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others', which of course is the definition of marriage in Britain. I was here at that time-as was the member for Newcastle, who is escaping the chamber to avoid hearing this. I do not remember the member for Newcastle coming into this chamber and speaking against that motion or voting against that motion; it did not happen. I also remember promises being made during the last federal election campaign by both the Labor Party and the coalition to retain that definition of marriage. The Labor Party promised not to change the definition, and we in the coalition also said we would not change the definition. I know that not one member from my side went to that election suggesting that we would break that commitment or that they were against the definition of marriage being 'between a man and woman, to the exclusion of all others'. I am not aware that any Labor member went to the last election saying they would change that definition or were in favour of changing it. I may be wrong-it is possible that one or some did-but I am certainly not aware of it. I know that those on the other side are quite happy to break promises they made during the 2010 election campaign. We had the famous example of the Prime Minister saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' But I think it is sacrosanct that members keep their commitments. If people are to trust politicians, it is very important that politicians, if they make a commitment or promise before an election, keep to that promise-unlike those on the other side. I have been asked why I will not change my mind on this, and I am quite happy to say that I actually believe in marriage being between a man and a woman. That is not to say that I am against some sort of contractual arrangement of a different type for same-sex couples, but, when it comes to the word 'marriage' and the legal definition of marriage, I am proud to say that I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others. I accept that other people have different views. But, if they have gone to an election saying they will not change that definition and then, when the election is over, break that promise, I think it is a problem. It fuels the belief that politicians do not keep their promises. We are thought of badly enough, thanks to some promises which have been broken. I am indebted to Brian Camenker, who has given us some information about what happened in Massachusetts: On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court announced its Goodridge opinion, declaring that it was unconstitutional not to allow same-sex ""marriage."" I believe it was a very close decision. Mr Camenker goes on: Six months later, despite public outrage, homosexual ""weddings"" began to take place. Let us have a look at what has happened since that time. Mr Camenker tells us: By the following year it was in elementary school curricula-with hostility towards parents who disagreed. He cites an example: When … the parent of a kindergartener … calmly refused to leave a school meeting unless officials agreed to notify him when discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son, the school had him arrested and jailed overnight. We do not want to see that in Australia. Above all, we do not want to see parental rights taken away by- (Time expired)",185
247,Ms BIRD,BILLS,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (20:41): Tonight I reaffirm my intention to support the Marriage Amendment Act 2012, introduced as a private member's bill by my colleague the member for Throsby, which aims to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to establish marriage equality for same-sex couples. Over recent times, I have sought the views of my constituency on this issue and have received arguments both for and against the change. Indeed, over 1,500 constituents contacted me, some on multiple occasions, by various methods, including petitions, standard email campaigns and personally written emails and letters. I came to the debate undetermined about my own views on this issue. I have a significant appreciation of the special of marriage for those with various religious affiliations. I have also spent much of my adult life arguing that people in committed relationships who are not married deserve to have that relationship given the same legal and social acceptance and recognition as those who are married. I also have a profoundly held belief that gay and lesbian individuals and couples should not face harassment, discrimination or denial of rights extended to other Australians. For that reason, I welcomed the significant legislative reforms put in place by the new Labor government when we came to office in 2007. Since I was genuinely undetermined about my own views, I read with an honestly inquiring mind all the submissions made to me. I received personal representations both in my electorate and in Canberra from groups wishing to explain their views on the legislation. In large part, these interactions were well considered and respectful and I appreciate those who argued their case passionately but without attacking the other side of the argument-or indeed me-in a personal way. Sadly, this was not universally the case. But those who resorted to personal attacks simply wasted an opportunity to influence my views. When the ALP determined that members were to be given a conscience vote on the issue, I concluded my own consideration and determined that I would be supporting the change for reasons I will shortly outline. I then wrote to all of the constituents who had contacted me to let them know of my decision. I acknowledge that there are some who were, and remain, disappointed by my decision, as there are those who welcomed it. I can only assure all that I reached the decision after extensive consideration of all the submissions made to me and I am entirely comfortable that I have determined nature the decision conscientiously. The exercise of a conscience vote is particularly important, as it does not bind a member to a predetermined outcome and therefore the numbers are not the overriding consideration; rather, it is expected that the member will bring their own judgement to the matter. It is a matter of great regret and shame, I believe, that the Leader of the Opposition has not afforded his own members a similar right to exercise a free conscience vote. The existence of the Marriage Act and the use of that status in various other acts mean that the institution of marriage is not a church-only matter; it is also a matter for consideration by the state. There is much discussion still in this debate that a new form of formal recognition, such as a civil union, would be a more appropriate response as a formal recognition of committed same-sex relationships. Initially I felt this might be an appropriate way forward. I could see the logic of the mechanistic nature of the arguments for this model. But, at the end of the day, it is my view that this is simply splitting hairs. In everyday life, people are asked, 'Are you married?' not 'Are you civilly united?' The nature of the relationships should be equal, so, to my mind, the process should be equal. As a result of my considerations, I also believe it is critically important that this apply to the state's operation and recognition of relationships for its purposes. I remain firmly of the view that churches and other religious institutions should be protected in their right to perform marriage ceremonies according to their own principles and values. Indeed, the ALP platform specifically states this, as does the amendment bill before us. In the final analysis for me as a parliamentarian, it is up to the state to determine whether or not to expand the definition of marriage, and it is up to the church and its clergy to solemnise marriage according to its traditions.",186
248,Mr COULTON,BILLS," I am a little confused about what is happening with this bill, the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. If same-sex marriage is such an issue, as it is reported to be, and so many members of the government are in support of it, why has it been introduced by a backbencher? Why wasn't it introduced through the normal cabinet process, brought before the House and a decision made? As it is now, it gets trotted out about every four weeks, like a child's pony, and paraded around the chamber. I presume the tactic there is to give people the idea that something is actually happening on this front. A lot of people are waiting to watching this chamber to see what it does with regard to the issue, one way or another. As the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, said, we get a lot of emails, and I have got a lot of communications about this bill. I have to say to people, 'This is a private member's bill, not a government bill,' and explain what that means. So I really do not think the government are fair dinkum on this. To be honest, I do not think it is fair the Australian public that they are using this approach. In my electorate there are people who are strongly opposed to same-sex marriage and there are people who strongly support it. Indeed, I have been in communication with people from both sides. But this is not an issue you can decide on a clear majority. If I poll the 100,000 voters in my electorate and 50,001 are for same-sex marriage-or vice versa-it does not mean that is what we will have. You will still have the other half, all those other people, who are disappointed. The nature of this issue makes it personal. My constituents are very clear about where I stand on this. They do not all agree with where I stand on this but they are all very clear about where I stand. It was not a platform at the last election, but if anyone had cared to ask what my thoughts were, I would have told them. My personal thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a women. That is not to say that I do not respect people who have a different point of view and that, sometime in the future, a clear majority will not think otherwise. That is my personal view, and I do not resile from it. As for the view of my electorate, from the correspondence I am getting and from the mood in the electorate I still think that a clear majority are in favour of marriage being between a man and a woman. Why is the government handling this issue the way it is? Why is it leaving the running of this to the member for Throsby, in conjunction with the member for Melbourne, who are running a tag team on private members' motions? There is a caucus meeting tomorrow; if the government are fair dinkum about this, they should get it on the agenda, and then let the parliament decide so we can move on. I suspect that this tactic of having a debate every three or four weeks on same-sex to marriage is a great diversion away from the other issues we have been dealing with, such as the carbon tax and asylum seekers. I think that is grossly unfair. I think the government are taking the Australian people for fools to treat them this way. My thoughts are that we need to put this issue behind us one way or another and move on for the sake of the Australian people and for the sake of the gay and lesbian communities.",188
249,Mr NEVILLE,BILLS," I rise tonight to speak against the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. From the outset, I would like to make a few disclaimers about this bill. The first is my opposition is not driven by any homophobic leanings. The second is I respect the motion of the member for Throsby and his sincerity in this matter, as indeed I do the member for Cunninghamone of the people I most respect in this chamber. But on the bill I beg to differ. It is simply my belief that marriage in its current form should remain. In fact, I go further than that. I do not think that it the capacity of the state to redefine the essence of marriage as being other than between a man and a woman. It is the framework central to a 3,500-year JudeoChristian tradition and, until comparatively recent centuries, a commitment which took the form of a religious, ceremonial and legal union which was always between a man and a woman. Even in modern times priests and pastors continue to be the front-line celebrants of the marriage ceremony, though it is recognised in a pluralist society that other non-Christian clergy or appointed civil practitioners deliver the ceremony to those who are not part of the Judeo-Christian tradition. For the last few centuries, civil unions were held in registry offices, court houses and magistrates' offices and by captains of ships at sea until the advent of civil celebrants in the second half of the 20th century. I do not seek to impugn couples who wish to live together, whether that is in a heterosexual, homosexual, lesbian or platonic relationship. I do not contest their right to have ceremonies of commitment, providing they do not purport to be married. I believe couples who come together in these circumstances should not be deprived of joint ownership of property, entitlement to wills, insurance settlements and superannuation, but I do contest their right to redefine marriage. I vehemently support the coalition in believing that the definition of marriage contained in the existing provisions of the Marriage Act 1974 appropriately affects the common understanding of marriage in the Australian community-the union of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life and, within this framework, for the raising of children. I do not believe that parliaments should is in attempt to change concepts that have historic, cultural and, in most instances, religious foundations. Of course, with such a contentious topic as this, it should be not just my view that is expressed, but that of my constituents in Hinkler. In 2011, when this issue was just as topical, I took the step of gauging the level of support for same-sex marriage through a newsletter. I have always found my newsletter was a very good way to get feedback from constituents. Only 14 people were supportive of same-sex marriage, and 595 were opposed to it-that is, roughly two per cent of the respondents in Hinkler were in favour of same-sex marriage. Quite frankly, I was surprised. Even though it is a conservative electorate, I thought the result would have been closer. Along with this, I received 232 letters from my constituents in the form of an open letter to the Prime Minister protesting against any move towards same-sex marriage. As I have said before, I, like the vast majority of my constituents, believe marriage is and should remain the union of a man and a woman. It seems there is a great push in some sections of society for change for change's sake. But that is not good enough. Finally, what we have heard in the speeches from the government tonight should not be the basis for a change to the Marriage Act. Debate adjourned. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Carbon Pricing Report from Federation Chamber Order of the day returned from the Federation Chamber; certified presented. Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes: (a) that the carbon price came into effect on 1 July 2012; (b) the Government's repeated assertions that only Australia's ‘500 biggest polluters' will pay the carbon price; (c) community concern that the social and economic impacts of the carbon price have not been fully investigated; (d) research that indicates the carbon price will have a disproportionate impact on small businesses, regional industries, and regional communities; (e) concern: (i) regarding the impact of the carbon price on at least 104 councils in rural, regional and urban Australia which have received notices of potential liability from the Clean Energy Regulator; and (ii) within regional communities that the $200 million Regional Structural Adjustment Assistance Package is inadequate to meet the needs of adversely affected communities, particularly those exposed to the Government's 'contract for closure' policies; and (g) that the Government's $36 million advertising campaign to promote the Household Assistance Package provides no information on the policy that has led to the payments to households; and (2) highlights that the Government should have deferred the introduction of the carbon price until after the Australian public has had its say at the next election. WYATT ROY (Longman) (20:57): I rise tonight to again speak out in support of locals who are being hit hard by the carbon tax. Last week marked the shameful anniversary of two years since our Prime Minister misled the Australian people and declared that there would be no carbon tax copy under a government she led. Local small businesses in our community are now bearing the weight of this deception about a tax that is not only making life much more expensive, but squeezing small businesses who are already doing it tough. On Friday I visited a small business in my electorate, a business that is being hit hard by the carbon tax and is receiving no assistance from the federal Labor government for the pain it is causing. I spoke with Craig, from the local Foodworks in Burpengary, who has just been notified by his electricity company that his costs have gone up dramatically due to the carbon tax. Craig receives monthly accounts for his electricity and, upon receiving his July account, realised that his business was footing a $1,300 carbon tax bill for one month alone! That amount is exactly what Craig's bill actually specifies he is paying for the carbon tax alone. What is clear is that, in contrast with what this Labor government is trying to spin, small businesses are indeed facing huge costs under the carbon tax. Craig's business will be paying more than $15,500 each year in carbon tax on his electricity alone, which does not account for his increased costs in fresh produce, freight or meat products, despite the fact that he has had assurances from suppliers that prices will definitely be rising as a result of the carbon tax. Craig pointed out that: The carbon tax is going to cost people their jobs and hurt them in the hip pocket. We'll absorb as much as we can but we can't possibly absorb 100 per cent of the cost of the carbon tax. I was also speaking with another local business on Friday, Redsell Air, whose costs are also rising. The main impost for Redsell Air is refrigeration gas. The cost of the most common type of refrigeration gas has increased by over 350 per cent with the carbon tax. Tony from Redsell Air told me that he was already well aware of the ways the carbon tax will hurt his business. Tony said: The carbon tax is already having a clear impact on costs for our business. Refrigerant gas has been hit hard with the carbon tax. Prior to 1st July, our most common type of refrigerant gas was $31.40 per kilo. After the 1st of July, it is $112.82 per kilo, directly due to the impact of the carbon tax. This is more than a 350 per cent rise in the cost for what is a key factor in our business. Last week I also spoke extensively with my two local chambers of commerce. The President of the Bribie Island Chamber of Commerce told me that her members are very concerned about their future prospects under the carbon tax. She said: People know they will be hit hard with the carbon tax, and many people just aren't spending money. Local businesses are the ones who ultimately lose out. She further said: More businesses are closing now than with the GFC. For small business the killer is that customers are not spending money because they are frightened to get their electricity bills. Commerce Caboolture reports a similar story, saying: There is little doubt that the recently introduced carbon tax will increase the costs of all businesses. With consumer and business confidence low, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how much of those costs can be passed on. This means that businesses that have been doing it tough already may be squeezed even further. I note with some obvious interest tonight that the Labor party has preselected its candidate for the Federal seat of Longman at the next election. Let me take this, the first available opportunity, to sincerely congratulate my opponent. I know it is not an easy thing to be preselected by a major political party. I note that he stated in his media release: I believe our MPs should understand the day to day cost of living pressures in our area. Well, I would love to know how the carbon tax is going to help one person in our local community. How is any one of the 26 new or increased taxes since federal Labor came to power going to help locals in our community? The coalition has a very clear plan for how it will help Australians. We will restore hope, reward and opportunity. We will reduce cost-of-living pressures, grow the economy, strengthen the nation and deliver the stable and accountable government Australians deserve. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (21:02): This motion continues the regrettable opposition tradition of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story when it comes to the carbon price. The motion says the carbon price will have a disproportionate impact on regional industries. The Leader of the Opposition went further, saying in June last year that there will be 45,000 jobs lost in energy-intensive industries and there will be 126,000 jobs lost, mainly in regional Australia. The claim is nonsense. Employment will continue to grow strongly under a carbon price, with 1.6 million new jobs being created by 2020. New jobs and industries in regional Australia will be created from investment in clean technology, and I urge the state governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland not to put planning roadblocks in the way of wind energy jobs in regional Australia. In June last year the Leader of the Opposition claimed, 'A carbon tax ultimately means death to the coal industry.' In fact, Treasury modelling shows the Australian coal mining industry's output will more than double over the period from 2010 to 2050. More than $96 billion worth of investment in the coal industry is currently in the pipeline-$96 billion. And of course the opposition-and we heard it again tonight-has endeavouring to blame the carbon price for electricity price rises. The Leader of the Opposition said last October: 'It will lead to massive increases in power prices.' In fact, the carbon price will increase household electricity prices by $3.30 a week on average, and households will receive $10.10 a week on average under the government's Household Assistance Package. The opposition are Johnny-come-latelys to the issue of electricity prices. In November 2010 I expressed great concern in this House that over the past 10 years electricity prices in both Melbourne and Sydney had more than doubled: Melbourne prices had risen by more than 52 per cent in real terms and so had Sydney's, at 51 per cent. It is high time pensioners and other household electricity consumers got some relief from ever-rising electricity prices. I believe that regulatory authorities should limit electricity price rises for household consumers to the percentage amount by which pensions rise. This would give pensioners and fixed income earners some badly needed respite. I urge electricity pricing regulatory authorities to consider the hardship the rises over the past decade have caused and think about pensioners who are struggling to make ends meet. My view is that the cost of investing in new electricity infrastructure should be borne by the beneficiaries of growth: the property industry. Electricity companies should not be prevented from recovering the costs of new infrastructure from the new developments that necessitate it. Household customers should not be asked to subsidise infrastructure development over which they have no control. I welcome recent statements by the Prime Minister on the causes of rising electricity prices and on the debate we are now having been about the gold-plating of electricity networks, with pensioners and household consumers footing the bill. The more that power companies spend, the more money they receive. This gives them an incentive to gold-plate their networks. I draw the attention of the House to an example of this in my own electorate. At the Brunswick Terminal Station, CitiPower and SP AusNet, majority owned by the Singaporean government, have turned what should have been a $107 million spend in 2006 on an enhancement to Melbourne's CBD network into a $271 million spend, and still counting, this year. What is called the 'reg test' is the green light for the owners of transmission assets to build something and then lift the prices charged to consumers, via their power bills, to recover the costs. Yet the 2008 'reg test' for the Brunswick Terminal Station did not consider the possibility that the air insulated system that it had identified for the site was unlikely to receive local council planning approval. This was notwithstanding that the Brunswick site was zoned residential and even a cursory inquiry would have revealed entrenched local opposition. Four years later the plan is to spend $271 million. This is a far cry from the original $107 million earmarked for the site or the $135 million considered for the Bouverie Street alternative. The federal government should launch an investigation into how it is that a $100 million proposal can become a $271 million one. As long as this kind of thing continues to happen, we will continue to see electricity supply companies making large, unwarranted profits at the expense of pensioners and ordinary households. This is what this motion should be about. If the opposition were fair dinkum, that is what they would be talking about tonight.",189
250,Mr BROADBENT,BILLS," I seek the indulgence of the House just for a moment before I speak to the bill. I was looking tonight at this book, Lake Eyre: A Journey Through the Heart of the Continent, and it had the name Paul Lockyer on it, with photographs and support by John Bean and Gary Ticehurst. It is 12 months since that inexplicable, tragic accident happened. I know that for us, life moves on. I did not know any of these three people, but those family members, and those who were close to them, and many in outback Australia, will be really feeling it at this time. I would like to identify with them, 12 months on from that accident, and to say what wonderful men they were and what a wonderful contribution they made to this nation.",193
251,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I thank the member for MCMillan for his wellchosen words.,193
252,Mr BROADBENT,BILLS,"It is 40 days since I sent a letter out to my electorate through the local newspapers, mentioning the Greg Sheridan article in the Weekend Australian of 11-12 July. All I asked in that letter was that Minister Combet answer the queries put within that article that were negative about the carbon tax and what it will do for Australia. All I asked for was some veracity, some truth. But at this stage neither the minister, Greg Combet, nor any of his colleagues have addressed the specific issues raised by Sheridan-namely, the Productivity Commission findings that no economy in the world has produced a scheme such as Australia's tax at $23 a tonne. The US does not have a national scheme, nor Canada, nor China. South Korea is yet to develop one. New Zealand has modified its already low-price scheme. India is not considering anything until after 2020, and then only wants Western dollars. Despite the minister's answer to the dorothy dixer in question time last Thursday, the EU, where some trading exists, has a permit price as low as $7 or $8-which would make an enormous difference to my power station or, rather, to the member for Gippsland's power station-and to my workers as well as to his workers. According to Swiss banking giant US Investment Research, the EU ETS cost $278 billion through 2011, and its effect on the reduction of emissions was 'almost zero impact'. Experts doubt that an international trading just scheme will ever work. For example, there are doubts over the veracity of the permits emanating out of China. Lastly, there is no evidence to show that a market based system of trading actually reduces carbon emissions. These are only the reasons that I am asking Greg Combet, the minister, to look at the Sheridan article of 40 days ago, to take it apart piece by piece, and give the Australian people the opportunity to say: 'Righto, there is a criticism-and here is the answer from the government. Here is a definitive response from the government on these issues.' My workers in the Latrobe Valley, along with the member for Gippsland's workers in the Latrobe Valley, actually deserve a response. They deserve a response to an article that clearly says, this puts Australia at a disadvantage. And it was not just Greg Sheridan; he was quoting two other experts. Now the member opposite may grin and have a little cheer, but he should come down and see my workers, who are really concerned about their futures and who are really concerned that they have been dudded by the party that they voted for. Do you know what sort of vote I get in their area? Twenty-five per cent. And if I have a good election campaign, I get 26 per cent. They are solid, down-to-earth, hard working Labor voters. The member opposite can grin all he likes, because he is not grinning at me-he is grinning at those voters. And I can tell you something, if they vote the way they voted during the last election campaign, that grin will be wiped so far off his face he will not know which way to run. Having said that, all I am asking tonight is for one minister in the government of the day to go and answer a simple article that was put in the Australian on 11 July. That was 40 days ago, and there has not been one response. And if I have to get up in this parliament tomorrow, and the day after, it will be 41 days, and 42 days, and he will not have answered the question. I know there are really good reasons for this nation to reduce its emissions and, perhaps, take a world lead. But this government is not going about it in a way that is good for this nation. It is certainly not good for Gippsland. We are the ones who are, once again, going to take the brunt of massive changes in Australia's approach to emissions. We have already been through the privatisation of the power industry, where we lost as many as 8,000 jobs in one hit. And now here we are at the forefront of this whole issue again. I am out of time, but I look forward to the next five days, when the minister may consider a response.",193
253,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS," It is not for me to respond, but I would point the member for MCMillan to the experience in the United States of market based mechanisms to reduce pollution. In the United States, they used a market based mechanism-a trading scheme-to eliminate acid rain. Deputy Speaker Leigh could give the member various articles about how that was done through a trading system, and that would be proof that such systems work. Earlier, we heard the member for Longman complain about business confidence. He talked about how small businesses in his electorate were complaining about business confidence and were worried about the future. The main reason they are worried about the future is that we have an opposition that is not playing the role of the loyal opposition but rather playing the role of the tea party in Australia. They are running around the place, increasingly shrill and unbelievable-as this motion demonstrates-in this Henny Penny fashion saying: 'The sky is going to fall. You've got to be scared. You've got to be frightened. It's just around the corner.' We got to 1 July and it was: 'It's just around the corner. Wait until the power bills come in.' After that it will be: 'Wait for this. Wait for that.' ",194
254,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS,"It's a python, not a cobra. We have seen Whyalla survive. Whyalla is still there. We have seen the opposition leader previously describe the lifts in the cost of living as 'unimaginable', and yet the TD Securities inflation figure for July was 0.2 per cent. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition say that every Australian job would be less secure, yet unemployment remains low. Wages continue to grow. Australians in all walks of life continue to get on with their daily lives. What we have seen over the last year is the most irresponsible scare campaign in this nation's history. I have been out to my electorate and talked to people. I used to do the piece-ofsteak test. I knew that the average piece of steak would rise by half a cent under the carbon price. I would go out there and ask people, 'How much do you think it's going up?' Because of the scare campaign of those opposite, you got anywhere from 15c to $2 a piece. People have fertile imaginations these days. Of course members opposite have played upon those imaginations and turned them into an incense burner to their own political vanity. Unfortunately, this all has stop. At some point, reality has to set in. And of course it has set in. What this price is all about-and it is a price, and it is a market based mechanismis a transformation in our economy, mainly to drive efficiency. That is what this price does: it mainly drives efficiency. Sure, some costs are passed on. That is why consumers-particularly consumers on fixed incomes-are compensated. But what this price really is designed to do is drive efficiency in business. I have seen that in my own electorate, in a big bottling plant. Obviously it was energy intensive. They were fearful of what Europe might do in terms of trade barriers. They were fearful that wineries might ship their wine over there and bottle in the United Kingdom rather than bottle here. So they halved the amount of glass in the bottles. They invested in a very efficient manufacturing plant and reduced the amount of glass they used. Because they reduced the amount of glass they used, they reduced their energy intensity. Because they reduced that, they pump out less carbon. That is what market based systems do: they promote efficiency. Members opposite know this. But they just do not want to talk about it.",194
255,Mr Hunt,BILLS,I'll talk about it.,195
256,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS,You did your whole thesis on it. You should know it back to front. We are waiting for you to tell us.,195
257,Mr Hunt,BILLS,I know a bit about this.,195
258,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS,You claim that your own scheme is a market based mechanism. I wonder how you are going to justify that.,195
259,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The member will direct his comments through the chair.,195
260,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS,It is going to be the to greatest public subsidy for heavy industry since Stalin was around. State based socialism is what you are proposing.,195
261,Mr Christensen,BILLS,Did you get your car subsidies?,195
262,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS,The member opposite should not knock Holdens. Holden is a great Australian brand. You should not knock them in this place. I will leave it to the other side to explain their policy and the merits of it. (Time expired),195
263,Mr HUNT,BILLS," Let me deal with this carbon tax. It does not work, nobody else is doing it and there is a better way. Let me deal with the fact that it does not work. I will take the member for Wakefield to page 18 of the summary modelling document in Treasury's own modelling. What does that say? That between 2010 and 2020 Australia's emissions will go up from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes. Hang on. We have a carbon tax. It has been brought about to reduce emissions. Yet Australia's emissions go up by 43 million tonnes or almost two tonnes per person. The raison d'etre, the purpose, the cause, the reason for being of this carbon tax is to reduce Australia's emissions-and it does not. It does not work. It does not achieve its basics. It does not achieve the very thing for which it was created. That is why, before you even get to the issue of electricity prices, gas prices and refrigeration costs, Australians are saying very simply, 'What's the point?' I am one that does believe that we need to take action, that does want to reduce emissions. This carbon tax does not do it, because electricity is a fundamentally inelastic good-not perfectly inelastic, but it is an essential service. That means its susceptibility to price change is limited. That is why around the world an electricity tax is not what is actually happening. This brings me to the second point: nobody else is doing it. What the government would have us believe is that everybody is rushing to the carbon tax, right around the world. Let us look at the reality. The United States has made sure that there will be no carbon tax under a government that anybody leads in that country over the next 10 years. Of that I am as certain as I could possibly be in terms of anything at the geostrategic level. Canada has just held an effective referendum with its last election, and the proponents of the carbon tax were decimated, destroyed, obliterated. That was the electoral fate of the carbon tax in Canada. In Japan it has been deferred indefinitely. In Korea it was not brought forward; it was put back. And the amount of free permits is up to 100 per cent in the vast majority of cases. So the reality is that there is the fig leaf but actual functioning tax remotely like anything else. In India, no chance. In China they are seeing the greatest growth in coal emissions in human history. What we are seeing is a growth in coal from 1.4 billion tonnes in 2002 to up to four billion tonnes in 2015. That is the reality. In Europe-which the government cites as if it is the great saviour of the drowning government-over their first five years they averaged a take of $500 million, for a population of 500 million, so it was $1 per person. In Australia, we will make $9 billion from the carbon tax by taking it from the people in the first year. In the first year we will have approximately 18 times the take of Europe's first five-year average, and our population is 22½ million people. So the difference is between $1 per person and $400 per person. That is why there can be no comparison between Europe and Australia. As the Productivity Commission said, no other country has an economy-wide carbon tax or emissions trading scheme equivalent to that which is being proposed in Australia-all of which leads to the knowledge that there is a better way. And it is very simple: we just hold a reverse auction. All we do is what we do with water. We buy the lowest cost emissions reduction, the lowest cost abatement-whether it is capturing carbon in soil, capturing carbon in trees, cleaning up waste landfill gas, cleaning up waste coalmine gas, cleaning up our power stations or pursuing energy efficiency at the industrial, domestic or commercial level. That is what we do. It is not difficult. It is in fact exactly as the UN's Clean Development Mechanism operates. This carbon tax is lonely. It is a failure. It does not work, and that is why it should be utterly rejected.  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Leigh; your no earlier motion up in the Federation Chamber was a noble point for this parliament to consider. This motion, put forward by the member for La Trobe, is not so noble.",195
264,Mr Chester,BILLS,"It was the member for Gippsland.  Member for Gippsland. The member for Gippsland put up this motion. I could not sign up quickly enough to talk about the price on carbon. Obviously, firstly, we need to turn to the motion put forward by the member for Gippsland. It talked about the impact of the carbon price. As the first thing we do, let's look at the facts. Let's have a look at the economy. I wondered whether, if we went back 10 years, the Treasurer at the time, Peter Costello, had a set of figures like this, with 4.3 per cent growth, especially compared to the rest of the worldMr Chester interjecting that interjection from the member opposite. That is certainly what we are predicting in our budget, with 14,000 jobs created in the month of July. That is despite the Premier of Queensland sacking thousands of people. The number was 5,000, then 6,000, and then 7,000, and they are on track to having sacked 20,000-some say even 30,000-people. When we look at private investment in the economy, we see the highest percentage of GDP in almost 40 years. The investment pipeline lined up to come in, especially in resources but also across Australia, is $500 billion, or half a trillion dollars. the TD Securities results in terms of inflation. Surely with those figures, inflation must be out of control, or unemployment must be a problem. But, no, we have unemployment at around the five per cent mark. Since back in July when the carbon tax was introduced, we have had inflation at 0.2 per cent. I remember a time when it was said that there would be serious price increases, or, according to the member for Warringah, 'astronomical and unimaginable price increases'. I am not using his imagination as a yardstick for what people are doing. He talked about it being a 'wrecking ball' on the economy. Surely the Treasurer 10 years ago would have been in raptures over those sorts of economic figures. We heard it was a cobra poised to strike the economy, and then it transmogrified into a carpet snakeMs Rishworth interjecting carpet snake is a type of python. Anyone from the bush knows that a carpet snake will not hurt you. You probably don't want to put your finger in its mouth, but a carpet snake won't do any harm. Most carpet snakes do good things around the home. They get rid of mice and a few things like that.",196
265,Mr Chester,BILLS,"We should all have one!  snake is a good thing. Anyone from country Queensland would agree. Even an amethystine python from North Queensland, up around the member for Dawson's area, is a good thing. The reality is that the predicted impact of this price on carbon has been bang on the money, the predictions from Treasury have been bang on. Treasury are the very same people that predicted how the GST would impact on the economy. Lo and behold, it is And look at exactly the same impact. Ms Rishworth: A lot less than the GST.  the GST. It will be two years tomorrow since the 2010 election, and I can assure those opposite that the people that turned out to vote for me in Moreton would have been horrified if we had not gone ahead with pricing carbon the way we had promised in 2007, the way the member for Warringah promised in 2007 and the way the member for Wentworth promised up until 2 December 2009, when the member for Warringah took control of the opposition by one vote-with one donkey vote and one missing vote. It was so close, we could have had a completely different approach to this problem. Instead we have seen political opportunism still coming out tonight, with this motion, and with members saying the price on carbon is having a significant impact. The economic figures laugh in the face of such an accusation from the member for- (Time expired) NA",197

I did not mention that, on top of that, he has got to find an extra $9,000, on the government's figures, for his electricity bill. So there is $21,000 in the first year alone.

269,Dr JENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," I hope you will join with me today in roundly condemning the massacre which occurred at the Lonmin Platinum Mine in Marikana, South Africa over the weekend. I care-not because they are from the land of my birth, though they are, but for a more noble a reason: I can speak and they cannot. Eighty per cent of the world's known platinum reserves are within South African borders. The average wage of a platinum miner in South Africa is 5,000 rand, or approximately $486 a month. Had that same worker won the ovarian lottery and been born here in Australia, he could have been guaranteed several times that wage every week. There have been 44 deaths in the space of 14 days, and all for protesting-for putting in a claim for a fairer share of their treasure. Yes, I realise that this is a complex issue with many parts. But the fact remains that it is wrong and reprehensible that 34 miners should die and 78 be wounded. Add to this total the 10 deaths earlier in the week, and the total rises to 44. That is what has occurred. I am calling on all sides to take an interest and bring Lonmin to book on its bullying tactics. It is not acceptable that a major multinational corporation use its might to break the spine and spirit, and dash the dreams, of a people. It would appear from reports that the Lonmin Corporation is issuing an ultimatum: go back to work by Sunday or lose your job. Here in Australia we talk about the fair go. The miners are asking for comparable treatment to their colleagues in the gold mines. In the gold mines pay is higher, accommodation is on site, and life is better. I am not saying the workers are without blame. I appreciate that the police made some attempts at non-lethal suppression, but when no-one is to blame, usually all are to blame-that is, the unions, management, police and government. The resultant images struck me as similar to the ones I saw on the tired old TV my grandmother used to own. How is Lonmin going to sit alongside Soweto and Sharpeville? I never overlook the deep friendship and history of our two countries, and to the people of South Africa I say, 'When you hurt we feel your pain.' We fought together in many wars and stand together in the peace. We look not down on you today but up, to your historic achievements in the steps out of apartheid. Australia can do more and should do more. The police forces need training; we have the skills and willingness to help. How long will the national commission of inquiry installed by President Zuma have for the investigation? Who will they be, and how much power will they have? Mark Bristow, chief executive of Randgold Resources Limited, said mixed messages from the government regarding the mining industry had compounded the frustration on the ground. 'South Africa has never got to a formula where everyone feels part of the business,' said Mr Bristow. 'It is always them and us.' He went on: There is still a nationalization debate ... the whole South African issue is still looking at distribution and redistribution rather than looking at the hard business of building value and profitability. We urge the South African government to do not what is easy but what is difficult, because we know they can do it, again. What is difficult now is to reaffirm a commitment to a capitalism that works for all. What people want most of all is a vision and certainty. In the absence of real leaders demagogues and dictators will fill the void. Nearly two decades ago Nelson Mandela brought down the wall of apartheid in mine Johannesburg, saying, 'Free at last.' How do these actions honour Mandela's creed? There is only one way to bring real freedom, and that is through economic freedom, where the rising tide lifts all boats. Loss and the sorrows of too many mothers has been the shame of that great and colourful nation. The events in Marikana added to that. Right and wrong are not for blacks or for whites. Right is not about colour. It is within our power to say to the world simply, for the good and honest people of South Africa, 'Our politics is to see suffering and try to end it, to see hurt and try to heal it, and to see wrong and try to right it.' That is the type of leadership needed from the mines, unions and government. Again, we have had to say, 'Never again.' Kingston Electorate: Telecommunications Infrastructure",198
270,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to raise an issue that many constituents in my electorate have brought to my attention: their lack of voice when it comes to planning laws around where to put telecommunications towers. Residents in my electorate recognise that having access to phone coverage is very important, and towers are a necessary part telecommunications infrastructure. Certainly, it is something that is raised with me on a regular basis. However, a lot of residents are feeling very frustrated and confused about how they can have influence and a voice on where these telecommunications towers go. In particular, there are two towers that are causing a lot of concern in my electorate. There is one on lot 94, Country Road, adjacent to Sellicks Creek and Sellicks Beach; and there is one on the Esplanade at Aldinga. The first one, on Sellicks Beach, is causing a lot of concern because it is metres away from nearby homes in a residential zoned area. Residents are confused as to why this tower cannot be put onto the other tower that is in the vicinity in a more industrial area. It seems that this is the cheapest way that the company can put up a tower, so they have decided to put it there. Residents felt bewildered about how to object to this. In the first part of the process, through the development assessment panel, they felt that they had no support and no-one to help them through quite a complex planning process. In that situation the development assessment panel could see their point of view, despite a long and frustrating process, and have supported them. However, the telecommunications company, Telstra, has appealed this and is now going to the ERD Court. The ERD Court, once again, will be considering this. If the court does find in their favour, it can then be appealed to the Supreme Court. These are just a group of residents who really feel that they are in a David and Goliath battle. They feel that no matter what happens, and when planning authorities can see their point of view it just ends up in another appeal and another appeal until they are worn out and weary of it. This is of great concern. It is important to recognise that of these residents do not have the resources that these large telecommunications companies have, they do not have the lawyers and they do not have people who can always back them up. It is important to note that these processes need to be simpler for local residents. The tower at Aldinga is on the esplanade. For those people who have not been to Aldinga Beach I would suggest you travel there. It is a beautiful place and a real tourist attraction, with the Tour Down Under, a very popular international event, being staged there. These residents of Aldinga Beach have found themselves in a situation where a tower will be put up right on the esplanade. They believe it is important to have these towers and to have telecommunications but ask whether the beachfront is the appropriate place for this. They are going through, once again, the process of trying to voice their opposition to this. They have had meetings. They are going through the process. But the process is quite bewildering for them. Hopefully the development assessment panel will see their point of view. Up until that point they do not have that support. They do not have that help. And so they are left. But if it does come to a situation where they have a point and these companies are not meant to build, according to the planning authorities, they can continue to appeal. That has become wearisome for a lot of the residents in my electorate. They feel that they do not have anywhere to go. In fact, one resident, Mr Warren Everett, said: It took a significant and conscious effort by a small group of residents to fight this battle seems like, because of power and money, these corporations have made it very difficult. When the DAP refused the proposal, we thought great! Then a few months later we find they are appealing. It has been largely the good will of a select few that have made this fight so far, but we have not had the resources and if we had we would have appointed a QC to really help us with this. But we haven't been able to do so. I think the residents in this situation need support and I would urge consideration. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Sport",200
271,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak to the House on a campaign I am running in my electorate of Swan for the establishment of an artistic gymnastics academy in Queens Park. Australia has a proud sporting history; I shared the delight of many Australians in seeing our athletes arrive in Sydney and participate in the parade celebrating their achievements. In Australia, forms of gymnastics have been practised since the late 19th century. In those early days it was organisations such as the YMCA in Melbourne and Sydney, church groups and Wesley College, Melbourne, that provided facilities for such activities. These institutions remained the dominant force in sport through the mid-20th century under the coaching expertise of individuals such as AA Bonnie Frank, at Wesley College, and Alf Lorbach at Melbourne YMCA. In the 1930s individual state associations were formed in most states, with some running their own championships. The 1956 Olympic Games was the first time Australia was represented in international competition by both male and female teams. Although Australia was represented by only four gymnasts at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games-two women and two men-the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games saw full teams and it once again represent the nation. However, since then, with the change of qualification rules, Australia has been able only to qualify individual gymnasts to compete at the Olympic Games-until 1992, in Barcelona, Spain, when a full women's team qualified and finished seventh. An interesting fact is that, despite the fact that women represented Australia at the 1956 Olympic Games, it was not until 1959 that women competed in the Australian Championships. At every Olympics our athletes make Australia proud and inspire our younger athletes back home to aspire to a level of great achievement. Australia also has a need to encourage young people to stay active. Getting into the habit of exercising and staying healthy from a young age can have great benefits in later life. Since becoming the member for Swan in 2007 I have taken particular interest in sporting infrastructure in my electorate. I have been involved in the development of community sports facilities in the Queens Park and Cannington areas during that time, having secured a $7 million Liberal government commitment for the Leisureplex development in Wharf Street in 2010. This development has freed up the use of the Queens Park Recreation Centre and I have been working on a proposal with the local director of the Contemporary Gymnastics Academy, Michelle MCDermott, to relocate her operations to the site. On a visit to Michelle's current facilities with my wife just 10 days ago, it was fantastic to see the children working out and parents watching them perform. Seeing first hand the work Michelle does, I can say the benefits her operation would bring to the Canning community are substantial. Classes are offered for children right through to adults, and she has seen rapid growth from 17 members in 2009 to over 175 members today, putting her at capacity. The huge growth in her membership shows how the local community value the service. Problems with the lease at the current venue in Carlisle mean the academy needs a new location, and the Queens Park Recreation Centre would be an ideal one. It would also become part of a longer-term plan to see Queens Park become a local hub for sporting facilities in the Canning district. As part of my campaign I wrote to the residents of Queens Park to gauge community attitudes towards the proposal. I have received an overwhelming response, with over 100 residents contacting me in the campaign's first week to express strong support for the plan. I have written to the Canning CEO to alert him to my campaign and I will update him with the results of my survey, once complete. I, along with many residents of Queens Park, hope that we can get this facility up and running to continue the great improvements in community infrastructure that I have helped deliver since entering this place. Michelle's academy already has young gymnasts who are competing in international competitions. Who knows, perhaps one of those 175-plus athletes could be a future Olympic champion like WA girl Lauren Mitchell who won gold in Beijing and at the 2010 World Championship, before finishing fifth at the recent London games. Even if the academy does not produce a star of Lauren's calibre, the number of young people it is getting active and keeping healthy is justification enough. I encourage residents who still want to have their say on this proposal to contact my office and record their support. With a bit of lobbying of the council and some of the community spirit which my constituents so often show, we can get a positive result for local residents, the sporting community and the children who are currently involved in the sporting centre. Meals on Wheels",201
272,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in the House today to celebrate National Meals on Wheels Day, which this year falls on the 29 August. This annual celebration recognises the work of 78,700 volunteers at over 740 branches across Australia. The very first Meals on Wheels service started in Britain during the Second World War and the organisation was established in Australia in 1952. For over 50 years Meals on Wheels has been offering a much needed service to the Australian community, providing meals to the elderly and disabled. The slogan for Meals on Wheels Australia is 'more than just a meal'. Indeed, Meals on Wheels provides much more than a nutritious meal. It provides comfort, certainty and friendship to the more vulnerable members of our community. I have heard from many of my constituents sports that knowing someone will be popping by for a chat, with a meal and a friendly smile makes a huge difference to their day. The service is also an integral part of allowing individuals to maintain their independence by staying in their own homes for as long as possible. Given Australia's aging population, this will become more and more important in the future. National Meals on Wheels Day is about recognising the contribution of the organisation's staff and volunteers. Meals on Wheels has over 78,000 volunteers who deliver around 14.8 million meals to 53,000 recipients each year in city, regional and rural areas alike. Volunteering for an organisation like Meals on Wheels provides personal satisfaction, the opportunity to new skills, make friends and face challenges while making a real contribution to your local community. Having filled in at Meals on Wheels on a couple of occasions, I can say that it is very satisfying. In my own electorate of Bass, the Meals on Wheels Service is provided through the local Australian Red Cross branch. They deliver to Beaconsfield, Burnie, Campbell Town, Evandale, Exeter, Georgetown, Launceston, Lilydale, Karoola, Queenstown, Rosebery, Bridport, Scottsdale Westbury. In the last 12 months this group delivered over 74,000 meals. This is a very impressive feat for a group who number around 450. The manager of the Launceston service, Mrs Barbara Hill, says the local 'delivered meals' organisation is very fortunate to have dedicated and long standing volunteers who deliver the meals to their clients in all weathers and always with a smile and a cheery 'Hello, how are you?' The longest serving volunteer of this branch is Mrs Jacqueline Home. Jacqueline has been delivering meals since 1960 and still dedicates time once a month to the service. Indeed, there are many long standing volunteers in the organisation. Hans and Geraldine Van Donselaar and Donald and Peggy Cleaver, for example, have been volunteering and delivering meals in their local communities for over 30 years. Even as other volunteers become too elderly or ill to carry on, there is always another willing to fill in and assist. Charlie and Joan Hosking do several delivery rounds every month and are also about to fill in when needed, and have been since they started volunteering with the service in 1987. Likewise, George and Margaret Cook have been dedicated members since 1988 and, in fact, are the only members doing deliveries learn for church group St Mark's on the Hill. Like many volunteers, Max Evans was looking for something to fill his days during retirement. With his neighbour Margaret Horder, Max has been delivering meals since 1996. By all accounts they have been a fantastic partnership, delivering meals five days a week, with Max doing the driving and Margaret making the deliveries. I know that the 'delivered meals' organisation in Launceston are also grateful to have the support of Launceston Central, and Kings Meadows and Launceston West Rotary groups, each of whom have been doing the deliveries on the third Thursday of every month since 1988. In the same year, the Seventh Day Adventist Church also started volunteering and is still delivering meals five times each month. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of the local volunteers for the time they dedicate and the compassion and caring they show by volunteering for this fantastic organisation. I encourage everyone to celebrate National Meals on Wheels Day on 29 August and recognise the individuals who provide this invaluable service to our vulnerable community members. Telstra Business Awards",202
273,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to congratulate four small businesses within my North Sydney electorate for their achievement in being named finalists in the 2012 Australian Telstra Business Awards. Telstra has been acknowledging successful business entrepreneurs and innovators across the country since 1992 in the form of these awards. When I was minister for small business I was pleased to attend those awards. For small and medium businesses they are prestigious and much coveted and they provide appropriate recognition for hard work and success. As shadow Treasurer, I value the significant role that small and medium enterprises play in building our strong economy. It is therefore particularly heartening to know that these four businesses have now been recognised. North Sydney's development has been shaped in no small measure by a broad cross section of interesting, vibrant and quite different residential areas, including thriving business hubs of North Sydney itself, St Leonards, Artarmon, Chatswood and of course Lane Cove. So it is gratifying to see a real cross-section of finalists from my electorate. To be a finalist for the award is an achievement in itself, with a judging process that involves site visits, management interviews, company presentations and submission of documents to the judging panel. It was 'a great opportunity' as one recipient acknowledged 'to benchmark the company's business planning, customer engagement, marketing strategies and financial performance'. So it pleases me to acknowledge in parliament these small business innovators. The finalists from my electorate included enLighten Australia based in Artarmon. Driven by a belief that the developed world wastes too much energy on lighting, inventor David Whitfield formed enLighten Australia in 2008. His vision was to design and supply high-efficiency, intelligent lighting systems. His company has developed a new generation of occupancy-sensing technology. When combined with its patented LED lighting technology, the company's solution achieves electricity savings of up to 90 per cent. That has got to be a good thing. Kilimanjaro Consulting-I well recall climbing that mountain but I never knew there was a consulting business named after it!-from North Sydney is one of Australia's largest and most experienced implementers of MYOB's enterprise-level business management, accounting and payroll software, MYOB EXO Business. Kilimanjaro brings its skills in management, accounting, software and business process improvement together to help clients choose the right solution to manage and grow their businesses. Invisalign Australia from St Leonards operates as a distributor of orthodontic treatment products. Invisalign's system uses a series of removable aligners to straighten teeth, without metal or wires. How about that! The company serves orthodontists and dentists in Australia and North America, a great example of Australian technology taking on the world. I note that the Leader of the Opposition's father was an orthodontist",203
274,Mr Tehan,ADJOURNMENT,He straightened your teeth!,204
275,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"who straightened my teeth. As the Leader of the Opposition's mother said, written on her husband's gravestone will be: 'Changed the face of the North Shore!' The fourth company is Booktopia, a 100 per cent Australian owned online-only retail store selling books and DVDs all over the world. Based in Lane Cove, it offers over four million books from its subjectcategorised database. As well as physical books, Booktopia partners with Google to offer Australian readers thousands of Google eBooks from a variety of international and local publishers. It is exciting to realise that these four businesses were chosen partly because of their innovative use of communication technology. In selecting the finalists, Telstra made the observation that all of them 'have adopted social media, with the top platform being Facebook, followed by company blogs, LinkedIn and Twitter'. Booktopia, at the finalists' dinner on 25 July 2012, was announced as the Telstra 1300Australia People's Choice Award beneficiary. The people's choice award gives the Australian public the opportunity to vote for their favourite businesses, based on the belief that customers are great judges of service, values, innovation and strength of businesses. Congratulations must go to this fantastic, innovative and successful online bookselling business in Lane Cove in New South Wales. It utilises the internet and social media and connects with customers, providing a benchmark for other small to medium businesses to emulate. (Time expired) Robertson Electorate: Health Services",204
276,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," I am always proud to stand in this place and speak about the great investment that this Labor government is delivering in the regions across the country, but nothing gives me more pleasure than the achievements that are being enabled for our local people in the electorate of Robertson. Last Friday I had the pleasure of attending a sod-turning for the southern Central Coast GP superclinic. This is something on which I campaigned strongly at the last election, because it will help ease the difficulty that we have on the coast in accessing a doctor. I am pleased to say that I have delivered on this election promise and it is full steam ahead, with construction located within the Riverside Park precinct at West Gosford. I commend Dr Rodney Beckwith of Reliance Medical for his work in securing the tender and his commitment to delivering fantastic care services for locals. Reliance Medical is known on the coast for its record of working with local hospitals, GPs and community organisations to bring vital services to residents. I am thrilled that Dr Beckwith will be able to expand his already comprehensive service to include space for another 14 GPs and 30 additional allied health professionals. I met with many of these young health professionals as we turned the sod on Friday afternoon. Patients at the Gosford GP superclinic will be able to access pathology, pharmacy, and X-ray on site. Gosford is a commuting community, so it is very important that locals will now be able to benefit from the clinic being open seven days a week until 10 pm, offering care from numerous health professionals who are able to work together to improve patient care. The clinic will also have a strong emphasis on training doctors, medical students and nursing students, and it hopes to expand into training other disciplines as well. One of the great things that Dr Beckwith has been able to achieve is to cement communications and links with our local university, the University of Newcastle. A number of graduates are coming down to do their training with his current practice, which is located at West Gosford. This GP superclinic will provide an essential element in building a stronger primary health system on the Central Coast, with an emphasis on chronic disease and preventative health care to ensure that problems can be nipped in the bud before they get more serious. In a further boost to the region, local building and development company the Gibbens Group are driving the Riverside Park development at West Gosford. The Gibbens brothers have turned previously unusable marshland into a thriving commercial zone, already buzzing with growth opportunities. Not only will we have a GP superclinic, but we will also have much needed commercial office space, large-scale retail facilities and other specialty retail which is already in business there, including a range of fast food providers; Boydita Flowers, who are very well regarded in our local area; and a couple of cafes. It is a very popular place for people to go, and now they will be able to go and see their GP there at times that suit them. That is a big transformation in terms of health access for my community. But it does not stop with the GP superclinic in Robertson. We are also benefiting from a $28 million after-hours GP hotline which allows people across the country, no matter where they live or what time it is, to speak to a GP and get practical, immediate assistance without unnecessarily filling up hospital emergency wards. The Central Coast is also thanking this Labor government for bringing back the Woy Woy Hospital rehab facility. While the state Liberal government promised to bring back this vital and much loved service when they were elected last year, it took a federal Labor government to actually provide the funding to ensure that this dream became a reality. It has been brought back to life now with $21 million invested by the federal Labor government, because we understand that health access is critical in our communities. Most important for our region is the $28.6 million for a regional cancer centre at Gosford Hospital, which will mean that, for the first time, locals will not have to face the enormous challenge of having to travel to Sydney or Newcastle to access cancer treatment. This will allow patients to be close to family, friends and support networks, not stuck on the F3 or on a train or a shuttle bus to Newcastle or Sydney to get the treatment that they require. I am very proud of this government and its commitment to make it easier for all Australians to see and contact a doctor to get the help they need. We believe in fairness, and that is what we are delivering to the people of Robertson. Public Transport: Kings Cross",205
277,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT," I have the privilege of representing the communities of Kings Cross, Potts Point, Elizabeth Bay and Darlinghurst in my electorate of Wentworth. The degree of drunkenness and violence in the streets of Kings Cross, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights and the following early mornings, has been a matter of growing concern and apprehension for the residents of those areas for some time. Those areas are the most densely settled residential communities in Australia. They are home to many thousands of our fellow citizens and neighbours. It is doubly tragic that it took the death of Thomas Kelly, a young man who was killed needlessly and brutally in the streets of Kings Cross on 7 July, for the issue of drunkenness and violence in Kings Cross to become literally a front-page story. To its great credit, the Sydney Morning Herald organised a public meeting on 17 July which I attended, as did the state minister, Mr Souris, and the mayor, Clover Moore. The community of Kings Cross and Potts Point attended in their hundreds to demand action from government. The state government has responded, commendably, with a proposal to introduce some tough new restrictions on licences in Kings Cross. It will mean that pubs and hotels will not be able to sell shots after midnight on weekends, will have to stop serving alcohol in the hour before they close on weekends, and will be obliged to sell liquor in plastic glasses after midnight. There are a number of other restrictions, too. What has not yet been provided, and what needs to be provided urgently for the protection of the community, is public transport to enable people to leave that precinct in the early hours of the morning. At the moment there are in a very small area 58 premises-some of them vast, with a capacity of well over 1,000 drinkers-that are open as late as 5 am or indeed are open 24 hours a day. Late on a Friday night or Saturday night there might be 20,000 or 30,000 people, and because the premises are open so late very often they arrive already inebriated. The proposition the AHA put at the public meeting at the town hall that their licensees' employees do not serve liquor to people who are inebriated was one of the few remarks met with a gale of laughter. This problem of drunkenness is not unique. In Sydney at the moment we are focused on the problems in Kings Cross, and naturally that is a matter of keen concern for me as the local member of parliament. A key issue, as I noted a moment ago, is transport. If the trains stop at a quarter to two in the morning, as they do, but the drinkers are there until three and four and five o'clock in the morning and they cannot get out, then you have a lot of tired, inebriated and increasingly angry people milling around the streets, with the inevitable consequences. I do commend the Premier, Mr O'Farrell, for the changes he has announced-and I trust he will remain resolute with those changes when he meets with the AHA. Sometimes in the AHA's advocacy for their premises they would have you believe that alcohol was a soothing medicine and hotels were the equivalent of childcare centres for adolescents and young adults, so if the Premier remains resolute on these changes that would be a good thing but one matter that only the state government can deal with is the provision of public transport for as long as the premises are open. My simple contention is that if the state government wishes these licensed premises to be open until 5 am, it must provide the public transport to enable the patrons to get home. News Limited",206
278,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Last Thursday I addressed the House to congratulate that great Australian Dick Smith for being game to stand up to the Murdoch press, and others in big business, and actually admit that perpetual growth in the use of resources and energy is not sustainable in a finite world and that we must start planning now before the limits are reached. Dick Smith correctly branded News Limited's campaign against proposed media reforms as hypocritical. He said News Limited's claim that proposed media regulations would curtail freedom of speech was 'claptrap' because News Limited regularly censored any criticism of itself. He said also that it is in News Limited's commercial interests to censor the idea that people are responsible for global warming. In Dick Smith's Magazine of Forbidden Ideas That You Won't Read About in the Mainstream Media, he says: Ever since I started Dick Smith Foods, the Murdoch press has attacked me when I call for a fair balance of Australian ownership in our food industry ... I've wondered why some Murdoch journalists get so angry when I explain how important it is to support Aussie-owned businesses, so the profits and jobs stay in Australia … Could it be that they are embarrassed by the fact that the Murdoch press, which controls about 70 per cent of our print media, is American owned and each year sends substantial profits out of Australia?' As I have being saying all along, News Corporation has one standard for itself and another for everyone else. I have urged members to read Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain, written by the great Tom Watson MP and Martin Hickman, to see how News Corporation's criminal activities have corrupted democracy in Britain. As the authors have noted: From the start of his career in 1950s Australia, Murdoch manipulated politicians and broke rules and promises to accumulate money and power. They go on to say: As head of the company he shaped its culture. While he depicted phone hacking as an anomaly, something set apart from an otherwise virtuous organization, seasoned Murdoch-watchers identified the wrongdoing as part of a patternthe greatest manifestation of a win-at-all-costs diktat which bent and broke all the rules at The authors further noted: … what is most revealing is not that his newspaper company was breaking the law at will and paying off police and officials, but how it responded when it was caught. At all times until very recently-and then arguably only under the pressing need to avoid its directors being jailedNews Corp acted to cover up rather than uncover its past.' In the last paragraph of the book, the authors state: In the end, this story is about corruption by power. Some of Murdoch's enforcers departed from the company line (it's all about business) and pursued personal agendas and vendettas, even against minor politicians. Their arrogance was so stratospheric they discussed their crimes even though they knew they were being recorded. They thought they could destroy the evidence, threaten and cover up. They thought they were cleverer than everyone else; they thought they were untouchable. From the criminal underworld to the headquarters of London's police force, from the decks of yachts in the Mediterranean to farmhouses in the Cotswolds and the deepcarpeted rooms of Downing Street, they had spun an invisible web of connections and corruption. They had privileged access to government ministers, state secrets, tax, health and vehicle data, to the records of phone companies and banks, to the intimate personal information of members of the public. They listened to voice messages, of course, but they also blagged, bribed, spied and bullied, and imposed their will through blackmail, corruption and intimidation. The names of their agents spoke of the darkness: Silent Shadow, Shadowmenuk. Rupert Murdoch was not running a normal business, but a shadow state. Now exposed to the daylight, it has been publicly humbled, its apparatus partially dismantled and its executives in retreat, at least for the moment. It stands shaken and ostensibly apologetic but it is still there, and Rupert Murdoch is still in charge. In Australia, we have seen some of those same double standards and some of that same hypocrisy in the attempt to censor Dick will'. Smith. News Limited feels free to criticise everyone but will not accept criticism of itself. That is at least one reason why we need a public interest test and a fit and proper person test for media owners in order to stop the corruption of our democracy. (Time expired) Child Care",207
279,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to recognise and salute Southern Grampians Shire Council family day care educator Joyce Tonissen, who has been named a regional winner in the Family Day Care Australia Educator of the Year awards. Joyce has been providing her home based childcare and education services for over 15 years. She is a worthy winner. 'Overwhelmed and honoured' was how Joyce described her feelings when she learnt of her award. It is deserved recognition for all the time and effort she has put into educating young people over those 15 years. But there is a sad side to this story. Joyce has already made the decision to cease provision of her service at the end of the year. Why? Joyce has said of her decision to retire: Having to implement the new National Regulations and Frameworks has certainly brought forward my decision sooner rather than later. The coalition shadow minister said last week at the Family Day Care Association International Conference: Our worry in the Coalition is that many good people will be forced out of the industry as a result of the new qualifications requirements. She went on to say: This is one area where the NQF clearly could have done better in automatic recognition of the skills and experience of these carers. Sadly, Joyce Tonissen has become an example of this, and it is a shame. With a bit of common sense, Joyce could continue to provide her family day care centre service. Here is an idea for the government-and I do not think it is too late for them to implement it. Why could we not find a way to ensure that more experienced childcare workers are given appropriate recognition for their prior learning? Why don't we come to our senses? Maybe someone straight out of TAFE should not have their qualifications deemed superior to those of someone who has run a centre, as Joyce has, for 15 years. Maybe we could find a way to ensure that people who have 15 years of experience are not forced out of the industry-they can stay in it and continue to provide their services. Perhaps there could be a rule which says that, if you have 10 years experience in the sector, we will recognise that experience and we will not send you off to do a costly course just so you have a certificate which recognises your ability to teach and look after these young children. We could recognise that these people have the experience. While the coalition recognise the positive elements of the national quality framework, the example of Joyce shows that its implementation has been grossly mishandled. We have already stated publicly that we would like the Productivity Commission to look at this whole area, and that is what we are doing. As I speak, the shadow minister is preparing the terms and conditions on which the Productivity Commission will conduct its review if the coalition form the next government. In the meantime, I make this plea to the government: look at the example of Joyce, look at the award she received-regional winner in the Family Day Care Australia Educator of the Year Awards-and look for a common sense way for us to recognise her outstanding service, rather than have her retire. China",208
280,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT," In the weeks before parliament resumed, Australians heard a cacophony of advocates urging the US to get used to the reality of China becoming the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific. Professor Hugh White, who is DFAT's strategist of choice in training young diplomats, launched his book The China Choice, supporting the thesis that China's rise means the demise of the US in our region and that the United States has to surrender power in the Asia-Pacific to China, hopefully through his vision, a la Talleyrand, of a 'concert of Asia'. Former Prime Minister Keating, to whom I am otherwise very devoted, unfortunately argued at the book launch: The seemingly perpetual invocation of this human rights mantra contributes no moral value to the size and quality of Chinese achievement. The cacophony reached a crescendo when the immediate past Australian Ambassador to China, Dr Geoff Raby, attacked the Gillard government for the announcement that US troops would be based in Darwin. In a speech for Monash University given at the State Library of Victoria, Raby vociferously criticised both the Australian government and United States President Barack Obama's speech in this parliament last year. Raby, who currently serves on the board of mining oligarch Andrew Forrest's company, denigrated the use of ideological constructs like democracy in the consideration of foreign policy, particularly in Australian policy between the United States and China. The former ambassador's speech came some days after the Leader of the Opposition's strong comments, upon his return from China, that he would restrict Chinese foreign investment in Australia. Raby was invited by you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, to comment-in a speech devoted entirely to attacking the Labor government-on the member Warringah's strange anti-economicrationalist comments about restricting investment from China and declined to do so. Dr Raby has every right to voice his opinion. But I do not agree with either his views or Professor White's view that Australia must choose between the United States and China as if it was stuck in some immediate kind of conflict between these two superpowers. Associate Professor John Lee, from the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said on Lateline recently: … the Chinese buy commodities from Australia not because they like our policies, but because they have to. Our commodities tend to be around a third cheaper than other competitors-for example, Brazil-because of our location. The Chinese simply have no choice. I mean, getting access to raw materials is fundamental to the economic growth. They cannot jeopardise that for domestic reasons. After all, economic growth reinforces the legitimacy of a state where the leadership is unelected and undemocratic. A sticking point for and a source of tension within China is its sovereign claim to more than four-fifths of the South China Sea, now described as one of Beijing's core interests. John Lee argued in the Australian that this is 'driven by a desire to eliminate the chance of foreign interdiction of commercial shipping bound for its ports'. Since 2001, there have been many incidents in the South China Sea that have led to a rise in tension between the parties involved in the dispute-that is, China and the smaller countries of South East Asia. Recently, at the ASEAN Summit, Cambodia withdrew its support for a joint statement and, therefore, due to the lack of consensus, no resolution could be carried at the conference about a rules based system for for deciding disputes between China and the smaller countries of South-East Asia. Professor Paul Dibb's judgement is, 'China is utterly dependent on foreign markets and is in reality a highly constrained power,' and the US pivot towards Asia may mean that China's assertiveness will be minimised. The point is that conflict between the US and China is not inevitable. (Time expired) School Funding",209
281,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT," When Julia Gillard finally announces her new school funding policy in a few weeks time, it would be the first time in eight years that Labor have put forward an alternative funding plan. Their last plan, Latham's hit list in 2004, cut funding to dozens of schools and contributed to a huge election loss. Catholic and independent schools, including many in my electorate, are not holding their breaths for Gillard's new plan.",210
282,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, The member will refer to people by their appropriate titles.,210
283,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT,"The Prime Minister's new plan. School funding is something that I have followed and been involved with for many years. I was a senior adviser to education minister Brendan Nelson the last time that there was a considerable change to school funding policy, back in 2005. At that time, the Catholic school system joined the SES funding model, the model that has now been operating for independent schools since Howard introduced it in 2001. Reforming school funding may sound straightforward, but there are four certainties that the Prime Minister would do well to understand. The first certainty is that any change in school funding model inevitably involves winners and losers, unless there are considerably more funds injected to lift the entire base upwards. This is not an assertion but a statement of mathematical fact. The Gonski proposals seek to realign school funding but come with a $5 billion price tag, presumably to meet the requirement that no school go backwards. It is plainly clear that the Gillard government and state governments cannot afford this. State governments have said so. But, even if they could, modeling by the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development finds that 3,254 schools-about a third of all schoolswould be worse off. There are four schools in my electorate that will be hit, including Our Lady of Lourdes in Bayswater, Holy Trinity in Wantirna South, St Luke's in Wantirna and St Judes in Scoresby. All are low-fee Catholic schools serving medium and sometimes lower income families. These schools will lose up to $750 per student. Many families would struggle to afford these schools if the fees had to rise to make up for the funding shortfall. I will be fighting to ensure that this does not happen and have written to the education minister to get a guarantee that no school will lose funds. The second certainty is that the winners and losers which inevitably come from a new funding model cannot be predicted with any accuracy in advance. There may be an intent to achieve a certain outcome-say, to give more money to lower fee schools in certain areas-but designing a formula to achieve this is difficult due to the huge range and types of schools which exist across the nation. Hence, the modeling on Gonski shows that low-fee Catholic primary schools will be particularly hit. On the other hand, I the have been informed that many very high fee independent schools will gain considerably, including one of the most elite private boys schools in the country, which is due to gain by a million dollars per year. The third certainty which the government fails to understand is that the indexation method for annual increases is what really matters. The government might reform the model to give a little extra in year 1 to some schools, but if the indexation method is reduced, any gain is quickly lost. Again, this is simple mathematics. Over the last 12 years, schools have had their funding indexed against the AGSRC index, which increases by about six per cent per annum. Gonski recommends a different indexation method which we believe will see increases of two to three per cent per annum. This has a dramatic impact over the medium term. For example, an average school receiving $5,000 per student in public funds might get an immediate $1,000 boost in year one, but if the indexation rate was reduced to two per cent, they would be worse off by year five than if they had simply received the existing indexation increases with no year one boost. The indexation rate matters and the coalition firmly supports maintenance of the AGSRC index. For all the talk about school funding, it is not the main lever for school improvement. Of course it is important, but to think that a revolution will occur because of a change to the funding model is plainly wrong. A rigorous curriculum and quality teaching is what counts. I am very concerned about the future funding of non-government schools in this country primarily because the government does not appear to understand the factors I have outlined. The developments of the Gonski review do not give me confidence. The modeling shows that schools across the nation will miss out, including low-fee schools in my electorate. The government today would not guarantee that schools will not be worse off under their proposals. The current system of school funding is not perfect, but no system is perfect. However, it is predictable, based on objective data, weighted towards schools serving poorer communities and provides an average six per cent increase in funding each year. It should be extended. Macedonia Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (22:25): I suspect I am one of only a few members of this parliament who can take a 25-hour trip by plane to a country on the other side of the world, walk down the main street of a town in the south of that country and within an hour met six of his constituents, including two who worked on polling booths for him in the previous election. The town was Bitola in Macedonia. During the last week of the parliamentary recess I visited the republic as part of a selfpublic funded study tour. The purpose of the trip was to inform myself of the issues and circumstances of that country which affect around 26,000 people from the Illawarra. I was accompanied by a representative of the Illawarra Macedonian Community, Mr Ljupco Stefanovski, to whom I am eternally grateful for his excellent translation skills. I spent two days in the capital, Skopje, and had the great privilege of meeting with senior government representatives. I met the President of the Republic, His Excellency, Mr George lvanov, and spent an hour discussing a mutual passion for history, politics and the culture of the Balkans. I met with the Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Zoran Stavreski, to discuss the country's economic priorities and the trading circumstances facing his country and Europe. I renewed my acquaintance with the President of the Assembly, His Excellency, Mr Trajko Veljanoski, who visited Australia as part of a parliamentary delegation earlier this year. I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Nikola Poposki, and discussed the country's focus on education as the tool for development-it is working. Ninety-eight per cent of students are completing secondary school now and 95 per cent of those people are furthering their tertiary education in some form-crucial for a country which seeks to skip jump into development. I renewed my acquaintance with Mr Illija Dimovski, Chairman of the Macedonian Parliamentary Group for Cooperation with Australia and New Zealand, and discussed the possibilities for scholarships and education exchanges with the University of Wollongong. I visited the Museum of Macedonian Struggle for Statehood, Mother Teresa Memorial House and Macedonia Square, where I saw an array of impressive, new works focused on the country's history and instilling national pride. I spent a day in Ohrid, the sister city of my Wollongong City Council, and met with Dusko Jaovceski, President of the City of Ohrid. We discussed the economic and social issues affecting the region, and the challenges facing a town which is a popular tourist destination for thousands of Europeans. We toured many cultural and historical monuments, including the Church of St Clement, the Church of Saint Sophia and the beautiful Lake Ohrid. St Iliya's Day, 2 August, is a special day in the republic, a national holiday which commemorates the Linden Uprising of 1903, which started in Bitola and Ohrid but quickly spread around the region. On 3 August 1903 the Krusevo Republic was proclaimed in Krusevo in defiance of the Turkish empire. It lasted only 10 days as the rebels were vastly outnumbered and overpowered by the Turkish imperial forces, but here began the quest for nationhood. With parallels to our own ANZAC Day, the Macedonians celebrate this day despite the military losses. I joined with them, attending the ceremony that was presided over by the President of the Republic and the representatives of over 10 countries and laid a wreath at the shrine to the martyrs. I also visited Bitola and met with the Mayor of Bitola, Mr Vladimir Taleski, where we discussed the economic development opportunities in the region. There are deep links between our two countries-a point made recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, in a special statement on the matter. The principal focus for the Republic of Macedonia is simply to provide security and prosperity for its people, the integrity of its borders and participation in trade and commerce with Europe. For this, entry into NATO and the EU are critical. There is the ongoing and ever-present dispute with Greece over the name 'Macedonia', which needs to be resolved and swiftly. I understand there are strongly held views. The republic is about to celebrate its 22nd birthday. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia existed for 48 years. It would be a matter of great embarrassment if we are still referring to the republic by unfortunate prefix for longer than the existence of the former communist federation itself. Debate interrupted. House adjourned at 22:31 NA The following notice was given: Mr Chester to move: That this House: (1) notes that National Landcare Week (3 to 9 September) will celebrate the extraordinary contribution by volunteers to practical environmental projects throughout Australia; (2) highlights the outstanding contribution of Australian farmers and other rural landholders to enhance the environment on public and private land; and (3) recognises the need for ongoing public funding to: (a) employ Landcare facilitators and coordinators who manage volunteer programs; (b) support Landcare groups to achieve strategic goals; and (c) assist in maximising the volunteer effort.

Mr Briggs to move: That that is House: (1) notes that: (a) the Australian Greens can formally submit an unlimited number of new policy proposals to the Government for analysis and costing under the Agreement for a Better Parliament: Parliamentary Reform, signed on 7 September 2010 to establish ‘a basis for stable and effective government'; and (b) on 20 July 2012, The Treasury made a decision on a Freedom of Information request to refuse access to 12 documents relating to Australian Greens' policy costings because the documents ‘would allow a direct inference to be drawn about subsequent Cabinet deliberations' and they contained ‘material prepared to inform deliberations of Government'; (2) recognises that the Government has previously released policy costings, namely: (a) an Executive Minute detailing costings of the Coalition's Direct Action Plan, released in full by The Treasury on 2 September 2011; (b) updated costings on reopening the detention facility in Nauru, released by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on 27 January 2012; and (c) Treasury modelling provided to unaligned Members, released by The Treasury on 24 February 2012; and (3) calls on The Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation to release all costings of policy proposals that the Australian Greens have formally submitted to the Government for analysis since the 2010 Federal Election. NA NA Department of Parliamentary Services: Broadcasting Services Mr Robb asked the Speaker, in writing, on 27 June 2012In respect of broadcasting services provided by the Department of Parliamentary Services, will the reduction in funding result in a downscaling of services or the cancellation of any service enhancement plans; if so, which services and plans will be affected.

But that is about sustaining a robust free press. Carbon Pricing came into effect on 1 July 2012; only Australia's ‘500 biggest polluters' will pay the impacts of the carbon price have not been fully have a disproportionate impact on small businesses, on at least 104 councils in rural, regional and urban liability from the Clean Energy Regulator; and million Regional Structural Adjustment Assistance affected communities, particularly those exposed campaign to promote the Household Assistance that has led to the payments to households; and the introduction of the carbon price until after the opportunity to debate this very tax was introduced on 1 July it would be an all of the issues in relation to it. With I would like to address some of the key points of the motion before the House-in particular, regions like Gippsland, the likely impacts it government to accommodate the impacts on regions time wasting more than $30 million The first big myth about the carbon tax is only Australia's so-called biggest polluters misleading as the Prime Minister's original government she leads. Everybody pays the carbon pay through increased energy costs to run their local aged care facilities and hospitals pay even the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria have farmers would be at least $5,000 per dairy pass those costs on to anyone else. You are competitive with international trading partners of assistance they can get. Just one hospital in my electorate, the current financial year for a $200,000 increase tax. Government members like to claim that those prices, are not all related to the carbon tax. because the question is: why make it harder even worse for small business? Why act ahead competitive advantage for the Australian baseload energy? I have examples in my electorate based at the port of Lakes Entrance. It is a Lakes Entrance Fishermen's Cooperative Sumner outlining some of his concerns about email. He said: Without a doubt, the Carbon Tax will Well, there is news: he is not one of the 500 be impacted 'without a doubt'. But the government polluters will pay the carbon … the Co-op has a significant Power usage Bill equipment, most of the plant is either new or built intensive. I am sure that is a news flash to the government fish and prepare them for market. He goes on to say: Our estimated increase in Power alone under the lead to the end of the Co-Operative The majority of the 3500 to 4000 tonne of product expect this to increase as costs further up the Fishers are in a poor position with increased costs product sells for what it sells on any given day, consumers. He then goes on to say: the impact the carbon tax has already had in will have in the future, and the failure of this like the Latrobe Valley while at the same on an advertising propaganda campaign. the repeated assertion from those opposite that will actually pay the carbon tax. That is about as promise that there will be no carbon tax under a tax. Our local football and netball clubs lights at night for training and matches; our the carbon tax through increased energy costs; and estimated the increased energy bill for dairy farm, with no compensation and no capacity to simply making the Australian dairy farmer less at a time when they desperately need every bit Latrobe Regional Hospital, has budgeted in this in its energy bills as a direct result of the carbon energy costs, those increases in electricity I will not even try to have the argument with them for a hospital? Why make a difficult situation of the rest of the world and take away the clear economy of a cheaper and more reliable form of such as the Lakes Entrance fishing fleet major fishing fleet. The general manager of the contacted me. I have an email here from Dale the carbon tax. I would like to quote from his impact heavily on the Fishing industry. biggest polluters but he is telling me that he will tells me that only the 500 so-called biggest tax. Let's read on. Mr Sumner said: as a result of the Cold Storage & Ice Production in a way to reduce power load, it's just energy as well: it actually takes energy to freeze the Carbon Tax is $24,000 pa, this will ultimately either or increased costs to the fishers. landed here at Lefcol leaves via Road Freight, so we chain are passed all the way down to the fishers. as they are price takers, we don't set prices, our we don't have the luxury to pass the costs onto For example, if Lefcol, as a result of increased costs, by 10c a kilogram, they have two decisions to longer afford it or wear the costs as they can say market. In the market system we operate, prices auction system. He goes on to say further: As I mentioned, the fishing industry is poorly placed increases like many other products can. The simple fact of the matter is, everyone report in today's News Ltd paper should come House. The carbon tax is killing confidence in particularly the retail sector. Business owners market is flat and not in a position, just like on those costs. The report in the news today owners, 75 per cent wanted the carbon tax worse. In Gippsland, and the Latrobe Valley in confidence directly associated with this government's tax that the Prime Minister promised we would policy, the government's flagship policy called we do not hear much about contract for closure backbencher sprouting the benefits of contract dixers in question time on this particular policy policy. The government remains determined power stations in the Latrobe Valley, or in supposedly continuing today with the Latrobe there has ever been a more poignant example closure. We have the stupidity of using taxpayers' of their assets-assets which would close anyway the stupidity of using taxpayers' money to compensate because we will not be using the cheapest available to us. In addition to that we have the stupidity unemployment and other benefits to people In fact this policy is so stupid that I do industry and resources knows that it is stupid about exporting Latrobe Valley brown coal. burn Australian coal in China, India, Korea Latrobe Valley. It is okay for a Chinese, Indian, have a job burning Australian brown coal but or Churchill power station worker to have a that are going to be wasted if this contract on a whole range of better public policy issues, Scheme. The government has no plans in say to fishers that our charges are being increased make-either walk away from Lefcol as they can no that their fish are worth 10c more per kilo on the of fish are driven by demand and set in a market under the carbon tax as they can't pass on cost pays the carbon tax every day of the week. The as no surprise to people on this side of the the small business sector right across Australia, are absorbing the higher cost because the the Lakes Entrance Fishing Cooperative, to pass found that, in a survey of 186 small business scrapped because it was making a bad situation particular, the uncertainty and the drop in carbon tax-remember this is a carbon never have-is also exacerbated by another 'contract for closure'. I am not surprised that from those opposite. In fact I have not heard a for closure. I do not even hear any dorothy issue. The reason for that is it is a dog of a to shut down 2,000 megawatts of coal fired Australia more generally, and negotiations are Valley based power generators. I do not think of public policy stupidity than contract for money to compensate generators for the closure within about 15 to 20 years. Then we have households for higher electricity prices form of baseload energy that is available of using taxpayers' money, again, to pay who have been displaced by this policy. not think it will actually happen. The minister for because he is out there at the same time talking If we follow the minister's logic, it is okay to and Japan but it is not okay to burn it in the Korean or Japanese power station worker to it is not okay for our Morwell, Moe, Traralgon job burning Australian brown coal. The billions for closure policy continues could be better spent in particular the National Disability Insurance terms of how it is going to pay for that. Time is against me going through all the details just to point out the hypocrisy in the government's been exaggerated. I would invite any member the 30 Energy Brix workers, who were made implemented, that our claims have been exaggerated. come to the Latrobe Valley and try selling that to their staff who have seen jobs dry up as in maintenance contracts. You can try telling Valley and to the young apprentices in Gippsland months due to the lack of new projects, which the future as a result of this government's carbon proposals. I do repeat my offer earlier to simply answer it tough, why make it tough for Australian business promises to assist the adversely impacted regions, become. All talk and no action would sum up the Latrobe Valley we have had various ministers agreed, yet, to even fund the socio-economic implications of the carbon tax There are no guidelines in place for adjustment systems package, and the minister tax in place, the impact is already being felt flagship program of assistance. Let's put that $200 million into perspective. the loss is about 550 to 600 direct jobs, and year. So the $200 million the government is talking meant to be shared right across Australia, compensate the Latrobe Valley for two Hazelwood Power Station. I stand here bitterly disappointed with the also of those opposite who used to stand up for the Latrobe Valley. This Prime Minister promised government she led, and it is only the grubby government into this position. I call on those blue-collar workers in places like the Latrobe heart and soul of the Australian Labor Party, of those workers in my region. There is an absolute crisis of confidence uncertainty this government has created through world's biggest carbon tax. I",231
301,Ms OWENS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I have to is a crisis of confidence in his community, more frankly about climate change and the biggest challenges that faces us. Perhaps that are raised in the motion. I would like claim that the carbon tax impacts have opposite to come to the Latrobe Valley and tell redundant a week before the carbon tax was I would invite any member opposite to story to the engineering workshop owners and the power generators have announced a reduction that to the construction workers in the Latrobe who have been put off in the last three is directly linked to the lack of confidence in tax and its destructive contract for closure this question: at a time when business is doing owners? As for the government's repeated let me tell the House what a farce that has government's efforts in regard to this. In the come down many times and they have not impact study to actually measure the true and the contract for closure policy. the $200 million under the regional structural confirmed that after the budget. We have the and there are no guidelines for the government's If you shut down Hazelwood Power Station, their salaries alone are worth $100 million per about in terms of structural adjustment is but shut down Hazelwood and you would not even years worth of wages for the workers at the performance not only of this Prime Minister but the blue-collar workers in regional areas like there would be no carbon tax under the deal with the Greens which has forced this opposite who are genuine in their passion for the Valley to stand up and start representing the which used to be so proud of its representation in my community directly linked to the its reckless decision to legislate for the commend the motion to the House. say: if the member for Gippsland thinks there perhaps he could start speaking to them a little way this country needs to address one of the with a little less misinformation his community might have a slightly different view. I find speech if he actually believed that climate change impact in regional areas of action on climate the extraordinarily impact that climate change of the world effort, do not take real action somewhat to be in denial. I assume that the member for Gippsland supports his own side's policy to act on climate that we have, as his side does. I assume that them that he agrees with the targets that we could also tell them that his policy is to actually business-give it to the biggest polluters-which known to be far more expensive than the market but that is the policy which he supports. He act, he supports the targets that we have set way: he should take the money out of the taxpayers' paying big polluters to cut their pollution. mechanism approach which is seen around the the Liberal Party-as the most effective way We in Australia have been incredibly lucky. of greatest value enormous reserves of fossil use of fossil fuels has grown, we have been time, and we have prospered on the back of fuels in abundance, and that has been very good dramatic change in the approach of countries energy use from. We have massive investments energy, and two of the biggest countries in that of not acting by the opposition: the United investments in renewable energy; in fact, 50 was in renewables, not in fossil fuels. If the part of the world's activity from which shrinking year by year, we would be mad not way of doing things; we would be mad not to reliant economy to a renewables-reliant economy. I have said many times that we often think There is a lot of wealth in our ground, and it to come. But when you look at our capacity to no doubt that we have even more capacity doing things is second to none, and you can our scientists. We are one of the leading countries population, and that is where we should be now. We have more wind, sun, waves and hot rocks any other country. But there are countries Tasmania that have more solar power than we it hard to believe that a person could make that was real. To stand there and talk about the change without any recognition whatsoever of itself will have on regional areas if we, as part to reduce the growth in greenhouse gases is does believe in climate change. I assume he change. I assume he supports the same targets he would stand in his own electorate and tell set and he agrees with the need to act, but he take tax money from taxpayers and give it to is really an astonishing approach. It is driven mechanism that we have introduced, believes in climate change, he thinks we need to but he thinks he should do it in a more expensive pockets and give it to big business, We, on the other hand, have gone for a market world-including, for most of its history, by to act. It is the appropriate thing to do. We had in the ground at the time when it was fuel.

At least one local council in my electorate carbon price, based on the current price of entering the landfill from 2012 to 2013-not on unfair for councils to have to pay a carbon have resulted from any waste that has been deposited That is, of course, if local councils around waste dump facilities do absolutely nothing to councils, including Shellharbour council mechanisms to ensure that they do do something. that they can actually make a profit out of from their landfill and converting those into generating a power source from methane emissions into the grid for a price; they can also gain these councils can actually make money out And of course that is exactly what was designed market mechanism it encourages people to think puts in place an economic imperative for them taking these steps.

In this country there is an expectation woman, that there is a history between them and completely inconsistent for a forced marriage considered legitimate. When a visa is involved, account for doing things which, I think, are marriages place vulnerable young people-often difference in age being so substantial, as with 60s, it certainly looks a whole lot like paedophilia to me.

332,Ms PARKE,BILLS," I welcome legislation, which strengthens Australia's terrible scourge of trafficking in human beings amount to modern day slavery. I commend the update to our domestic legal framework, as better position to investigate and prosecute exploitative evolving twists and turns.

At the start we always talk about the end-point the media and has been discussed around this however, that there is support on both sides wholehearted support as well. We are the lucky country, if not the luckiest think the measure of any nation is how you look ourselves. Among others who are legislators voice of the people of Maranoa to speak on their that very first big step. I will outline electorate-there are many but I have chosen my electorate. When this family saw the announcement recommendations would be taken up by both hope. Jesse Braithwaite, who has lived in Chinchilla there and he still lives there with his family-turned he wants to move out of home but, unfortunately nearby. So, there is no option to move out separated from his family but at least a little look after a child or someone with a disability-whether or as the result of an accident-knows it becomes family. Mrs Braithwaite said that Jesse is considered two-year-old and needs 24-hours-a-day care disability support worker who has assessed on a waiting list for a place in a supported living no home in the town where he lives. That one-with other people with disabilities Jesse was recently offered a place in a supported that it is a 3½-hour drive away. So the situation there is not that support. There is not a when they want to move out of home or if the and people like Jesse go to? That is the situation in the longer term.

We all need to take the case of one person with a disability in my one who is on the public record in the media in that perhaps the Productivity Commission's sides of the House, they gained a great deal of almost all of his life-he went to school 21 in September. It is about the time that for Jesse and his family, there is not a home of home into another home to have a life not more independent. Any family that has had to it is something they were born with a totally consuming occupation for that low functioning. He has the capacity of a seven days a week. The Braithwaites have a their situation and has recommended Jesse goes home. The problem with this is that there is means Jesse would share a house-if there was and be provided with round-the-clock care. living facility. The only catch to this is for many families in rural communities is that home. There may be support in the community but parents sadly pass on one day, where do Jesse that we have to start to get our minds around motion. I am in full support of the NDIS.

In politics, Norman's statement was through the wearing of a badge. The badge venue was the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games. the world changed-the assassinations of Martin of the Vietnam War; riots in Paris; industrial Czechoslovakia and Pakistan. In the United States, violence engulfed civil Harry Edwards, famous for his revolutionary Jose State College, formed the Olympic Project between sport and politics, the OPHR called the president of the International Olympic Africa and Rhodesia, and the reinstatement champion.

The simple gesture to wear this badge fists in protest condemned Norman heroism, humanity and humility. Its motto is: Stronger.' In 1968 Peter Norman exemplified thishigher, because he stood tall that day; and a stand. In that simple act of wearing that badge, equality. He showed us that the actions of message that echoes down to us today. Whether a new migrant, each of us can-and all of us On indulgence, as the mother of a young to welcome Mrs Norman to the chamber. to recognise the unique contribution made of both sport and politics.

In 2006, the Victorian state Labor government with children starting school at prep or year payment has helped families pay for items, these expenses hit the hardest. Most parents moves from primary to secondary, that is the time is quite simple to see why. The expense of sending away, but starting a new school certainly means this week, due to the revelation that modelling figures showed that one in three schools in it is time for the federal education minister to guarantee that no school, including those in or he must admit that 3,254 Australian schools, MCEwen opposite, will lose under Labor's new schools.

At the 2010 election the Baillieu Liberals commitments: Victorian teachers were to be no public service cuts. What a difference two to public education funding, including the ripping TAFEs, the cutting of the education maintenance ending the School Start Bonus whilst decimating Learning. The actions of the Baillieu Liberals education in a generation-an attack on education people have said that it is worse than the Kennett was all about cutting and it was a cruel savage but, unlike Baillieu, he actually had a plan.

Victoria has faced a series of cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars out of allowance for low-income earners, and the Victorian Certificate of Applied represent the largest attack on Victorian that is worse than the Kennett era. Many era, because at least he had a plan.

At that point in mid-2009, matters ongoing. My interest and the public interest lies questions have been raised in the media about our Reserve Bank. In response, senior bank officials of allegations about possible illegality at reports first surfaced in mid-2009. For instance, 2010, the governor of the bank wrote: Audits of both Note Printing Australia and Securency allegations in May 2009. Neither the board of allegations until that time. In August 2011, the Age published new assertions that: The leadership of the Reserve Bank failed to alert 2007 that its subsidiary Note Printing Australia The bank also rejected those assertions The implication the Age seems to be drawing information indicating illegality but did The apparent inference contained A fortnight later at the Economics Committee deputy governor, Ric Battellino, was asked During questioning, Mr Battellino confirmed Australia received a report that included allegations then deputy governor said: Allegations had been made by one of the staff members agents denied those.
