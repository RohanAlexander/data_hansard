Petition received and read.",13
1,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,I wish . to know from the Minister of Home Affairs whether the Government have decided to amend the Lands Acquisition Bill to meet the objection of the petitioners?,13
2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have already intimated that there is no justification for the anxiety expressed in the petition, because the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act does not confer upon the Commonwealth any power beyond that given in the Constitution, and the Bill will not db so; but lo put the matter beyond doubt, I yesterday had prepared an amendment which I think will give satisfaction. TELEPHONE ADMINISTRATION. Sir JOHN QUlCK - i-Is the Postmaster General yet in a position to inform the House what action is being taken to improve the telephonic appliances in use in Bendigo and other country centres?",13
3,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The action promised some little time back, in roplv to a question by the honourable and learned member, is being taken, tenders having been invited for the supply of new instruments. These will be substituted as quickly as that can be managed, for the old instruments which are now complained of.",13
4,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I notice that the extension of the 3d - in-the-slot bureaux has been a great success in New South Wales. When will the Minister make the charge id., in fulfilment of a promise given some weeks ago?",13

6,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster, General sec that in substituting Ericcson for Adet-Berthon instruments, preference is given to those' who have for many years been subscribers to exchanges, and have frequently to speak over long-distance lines? At the present time the improved instruments are being given only to new subscribers.",13
7,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In the sub, stitution now taking place, preference is being given to subscribers who have to speak over long-distance lines, because the old instruments are very inconvenient for such conversations.

Sir JOHN FORREST laid upon the table the following papers :Statement showing the saving which could be .made up to iq.52, assuming that the Commonwealth could float loans at i per cent, less interest than that charged to the States, and that this i per cent, were accumulated at 3 per cent, per annum compound interest.

10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Yesterday the honourable member for Kalgoorlie asked these questions:x. Is it a fact that a higher travelling allowance is paid to officers of the Commonwealth when travelling in Western Australia than when travelling in the other States? 2. Is it a fact that an additional 25 per cent, over Perth rates is paid to such officers when they are travelling on the paid-fields? 3. If the reply to the foregoing questions is in the affirmative, will he make some corresponding provision for officers who are employed permanently in those localities-wher e living is so costly ? The Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information :1. Yes. a. Yes. 3. Officers permanently employed in these localities receive district allowances to compen' sate them for the higher cost of living. Travelling allowances are fixed on a different scale to meet incidental expenditure for short periods, which is not incurred by officers permanently stationed in remote localities. TUMBY BAY POST OFFICE. TAILEM BEND-PINNAROO MAIL",13
11,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown," the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is he aware that the post and telegraph office at Tumby Bay, South Australia, by reason of activity in the newly opened farming lands in the district, returns about Z500 per FORRESTannum to the Commonwealth, although its cost, inclusive of salaries and all charges, is only £100 per annum? 2. If so, does he not consider that the Department can afford to pay more for the mail seris vice between Tailem Bend add Pinnaroo the exact amount of the revenue derived, seeing that the country is ncwlv settled, and that farmers who have isolated themselves from regular mail routes, are engaged in clearing and cultivating land which must eventually ments. prove profitable to the State and the Commonwealth ?' 3. Will he make such arrangements with State Kailway Department as will establish the present temporary mail service to Pinnaroo and the intervening stations on a permanent - States. basis, even although the cost mav be greater than the immediate revenue returns?",14
12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The anwithstanding swers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- x. Yes. 2. This question has evidently been framed under a misapprehension, as the Department has been maintaining a mail service to naroo since December last, at a cost considerCommonwealth ably in excess of the amount of revenue derived. 3. When the railway was opened to Pinnaroo recently, the South Australian Railway Commiswith sioner refused to carry the mails by train unless a payment pf £250 per annum were there for. This payment has accordingly been call authorized temporarily pending negotiations the South Australian Government, whose atdifficulties as tention has been drawn to the excessive nnd disproportionate amount of the charge as comframers of the pared with the revenue derived from the service.

Whether he is aware that, in spite of his promise that the employment of boys as letter carriers in and around Sydney should be discontinued, some fifty-four of these boys are at present so engaged? 2. Will he take immediate steps to put an ' end to this practice ?",14
14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's questions is as follows:1. and 2. Action has not yet been completed to enable messengers in and around Sydney, whose time .is wholly or principally employed in delivering letters, to be replaced by assistants (letter carriers). A scheme has, however, been upproved which will enable this to be done as early as possible, and application is being made to the Treasurer for the necessary funds. SERVICE. NA (STATE DEBTS) BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 6th September (vide page 4224)1 on motion by Sir JOHN That the Bill be now read a second time.",14
15,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) [2.41] - There more justification for the proposed alterathan tion of the Constitution to allow of the the taking over by the Commonwealth of all the the debts of the States than there is for the other two proposed constitutional amendI t is unfortunate that any alteration is needed so early in our his tor v, but the . I admit that it is neeessaiy to provide for some solution of the financial problems which concern the Commonwealth and the I have always considered that the framers of the Constitution deserve great credit for their work, which, notsome depreciation of late, was fittingly characterized by a distinguished politician as a monument of legislative ability. But they seem to have been unable to provide satisfactorily for the adPinjustment of the financial relations of the and the States, and particularly for the transfer of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth. I agree the Treasurer that the arbitrary dismade tinction drawn between what I might pre-Federation arid post-Federawith tion debts is unnecessary, and creates time goes on. The Constitution perhaps thought that the financial question would be solved very rapidly by the exercise of the powers conferred upon this Parliament, but the reasons for distinguishing between debts incurred prior to, arid those incurred after, Federation, will become less and less apparent as State loans are renewed. The Commonwealth should have power to deal with the whole or any part of the debts of the States as they mature. It is important that the limitation imposed by section 105 of the Constitution should not be lost sight of. Provision is made for equality of treatment in connection .with the transfer of the debts of the various States. No doubt it was believed that we should ultimately have to fall back upon a transfer of responsibility upon a per capita basis. It is conceivable that the Commonwealth Parliament might have wished to take over the whole or part of the indebtedness of a single State. Section 105, as now proposed to be amended, would impose no restriction in that respect, arid I would suggest to the Treasurer that the enlarged power which he is now seeking should be accompanied by a provision that equal treatment shall be meted out to the various States by the Commonwealth.",14
16,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parliament , and not the Government, will exercise the power conferred by the section.",15
17,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I quite recognise that; I am pointing out that under the section whole as it is proposed to be amended, the Commonwealth. monwealth Parliament would be empowered to take over the debts of one State without dealing with those of the other States. For necessary. instance, it might decide to take over the debts of New South Wales and ignore those lishing of Victoria. I am quite sure something in the point which I am asking the Treasurer to consider. Whilst should probably be justified in trusting Parliament not to make an invidious tinction between one State and another, is only right that the attention of the Treaanalysis surer should be drawn to the fact that is proposed to remove the qualification contained in the section.",15
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no restricattention tion in the case of our taking over the whole of the debts.,15
19,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is proposed to omit words""As existing at the establishment of the monwealth, or .1 prooortio.i thereof, according to the numbers of their people, as shown by latest statistics of the Commonwealth.",15
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But we could not take over the whole of the debts of any one State.,15
21,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I wish to show that it is proposed to remove the qualification which now exists.,15
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The qualification does not exist if you take over the whole of the debts.,15
23,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But power is being taken to enable the Commonwealth to take over a part or the whole of the debts of the States. I think that we are quite justified in taking that power.,15
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The words "" or any part thereof "" are intended to relate to the debts as they mature. t",15
25,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My point is that power is being taken which would be capable of being used to differentiate between the States. However, I shall now pass to another point. I have consulted Mr. Speaker, and I find that it will not be possible for me to embody in the measure now before us a proposal which I made some time ago in another form. I should like to insert a provision to the following effect:That a Convention Or Royal Commission, to include members of the Commonwealth Parliament ancl of the States Parliaments, be apbut pointed for the purposes following :1. To draft a scheme for the transfer of the or part of the State debts to the Com2. To make recommendations as to what constitutional amendments and statutory powers are 3. To advise as to the desirability of estaba permanent Financial Council or Commission to undertake the future management of that there is the public debts. we Mr Speaker informs me that it would not to be practicable to introduce such an amenddisment in this measure. To mv mind, it is it urgently necessary that there should be an of the debts which it is proposed it to take over, and that can only be satisnow factorily done by such, a body as I suggest. I do not think that the framers of the Constitution paid sufficient to the purposes for which the various debts were incurred. Whilst they strove to equalize the conditions as between - the various States, they should have paid the some regard to the manner in which loan moneys had been expended. I have had a Comseries of statements prepared, and, by the courtesy of the Treasurer, have had them the subjected to the revision of his able acfing secretary. I do not wish to trouble the House by reading these statements in detail, but I should like to hand them to Hansard for publication. Perhaps you, sir, will inform me whether I may adopt that course?",15
26,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are the very long?,16
27,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but they are very important.",16
28,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The ber may, of. course, read the whole or any portion of the statements. I should not like to give a formal ruling that anv matter which has not been read in the House should be included in Hansard.",16
29,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What I wish speciallv to emphasize is that, in taking over the debts N e w South Wales * Victoria Queensland t South Australia + Western Australia Tasmania * Includes £10,416,833 to Metropolitan Boards of Water t Includes £2,601,6S5 loans to Municipalities, } Includes Northern Territory, £3,641,505. I merely desire to emphasize the fact that when the debts of the various States are taken over-in order to insure a just distribution of advantage or disadvantage-som e regard should be paid to the purposes to which those funds have been applied. ' For instance, as I have already pointed out, there is a municipal debt in New South Wales of only £2,941,000, whereas Victoria, has a municipal debt of ,£13,1827000. The reason for this disparity, is to be found in the fact that in Victoria we had a very complete local Government organization that of the various States, we should differentiate between debts which are payable in Australia, and debts which are payable in London. I find that the public debts of New South Wales, which have been incurred in London, aggregate £64,000,000, statements and those which have been incurred in Australia £18,000,000, and the municipal debt of that State is only ,£2^41,000. Victoria has incurred in London debts amountin? to ,£44,710,000 and in Australia debts honourable mem- totalling ,£12,105,000, in addition to municipal debts aggregating £13,182,000. I do not wish to trouble the House with similar details in. respect of .Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, but they are set out in the following statement, which speaks for itself :STATES PUBLIC DEBTS, 30TH JUNE, 1905.

In Queensland, for example, the Government have advanced large sums to sugar refineriesThe mere arbitrary taking over of the ""debts of the States at any fixed period demands that we should go a considerable distance further",16
30,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are no municipal debts in Queensland, apart from those which have been incurred by the Government.",16
31,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . . The Government of that State shouldered the responsibility of providing the necessary funds for municipal purposes. I have no doubt whatever that the electors of Australia will up to 1920 :sanction the proposed amendment of the Constitution, because it is so manifestly necessary in order to permit of an equitable arrangement being arrived at as between the States and the Commonwealth. So far as Victoria is concerned, I claim that unless her municipal indebtedness is allowed to participate in any advantages which may flow from the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth a great injustice will be done.",17
32,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Probably some of those debts could not be taken over without the consent of the parties concerned.,17
33,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who are responsible for them ?,17
34,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not the Government of Victoria.,17
35,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government have never paid the interest out of the revenue.,17
36,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is perfectly true.,17
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Eac h State has pay interest upon its own indebtedness.,17
38,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the time will arrive when the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Mernda will, in essence, c6me into operation, and therefore it would be wise for us now to establish the principle for which I am contending. I mantain that we shall require to make an analytical examination of the debts of the various States, and of the purposes to which those funds were devoted, in addition to deciding upon an arbitrary adjustment of the amounts which may be transferred. If honourable members will do me the favour to read my remarks in Hansard, I think they will recognise that there is considerable force in my contention. I venture to think that Victoria has a right to participate in any advantage which may ultimately attach to the imprimatur of the Commonwealth being placed upon the States indebtedness.",17
39,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We can only equalize matters by a process of exclusion.,17
40,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I quite agree that we may arrive at an equitable basis by that iprocess.

Nevertheless, have endeavoured to show what be the effect of allowing the whole of the debts which mature in London to be transferred to the and permitting those incurred Mr Knox. to remain under the control of the States.

His desire is that deral Parliament shall be given power to take over all debts, whether incurred prior or subsequent to the establishment of the Commonwealth. That is a highly laudable object. The most important feature of the amendment, from my staind-point, is that it will enable the Commonwealth Parliament, probably through the Treasurer, to take over loans as they mature, without being compelled, at the same time, to take over-perhap s without making any profit- a similar proportion of the loans of every State.

The interjection of the Prime Minister is in consonance with the view which, at different times, he has expressed throughout Ausis the tralia, that the Commonwealth should have a controlling voice in regard to the raising of money outside Australia. The Treasurer bas given utterance to similar opinions, and he has just told us that the Premiers of the States have agreed that if the debts are taken over under reasonable conditions, there should be some limitation of competition.",20

We must eliminate the provisions which now crib, cabin, and confine us at every turn. I cordially agree with the"" proposal of the Treasurer to seek enlarged powers, and I should not think very much trouble would be experienced in obtaining the approval of the States. The statement which has been circulated by the Treasurer is, of course, a purely hypothetical one. It assumes that we shall make for ourselves better credit than the .States now possess; but whether the improvement will be such as is indicated remains to be seen. No one can forecast the effect of Federal legislation upon our credit in the London market. I notice one fact which is very gratifying, namely,, that the States in their separate relationships have been able to borrow a very large sum at the low rate of 3 per cent. I presume that the price of these stocks was something below par, and that in reality a little more than 3 per cent, has to be paid for them.",22

In consequence of the Canadian Government, having had little or nothing to do with internal services, such as we possess; in other words, by reason of the greater extent to which what is called States Socialism has operated in Australia as compared with Canada, we shall always appear to be much more heavily indebted. We know that in the London money market even appearances go for something. At any rate, if we rival Canada's credit, and I hope we may, we cannot hope to make any orofit upon the present 3 per cent, stock. Therefore, the Treasurer's assumption that we shall be able to ultimately make a saving over the whole of the existing debts of 4 per cent, means",23

The Treasurer's statement is hypothetical, and I am not sure that he was wise to issue a forecast covering fifty years.

114,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"If I had counted on a larger saving, I should have been told and one debt. that my estimate was - excessive. It was better to be moderate.",23
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"Yes, but the moderation of the Treasurer does not place his proposal in the most attractive light, functions. particularly in the eyes of those whom we are most anxious to propitiate. I heard what the honourable member - for Kooyong had to say concerning the difference between the indebtedness of Victoria and that of New South Wales. It is quite true that a. great proportion of the indebtedness of the latter State has been incurred for municipal purposes, and is not really part and parcel of the national debt. That is why the indebtedness of that State always appears so large compared with that of Victoria. On the other hand, while there are differences between New South Wales and Victoria, there are considerable divergences between the debts of the other States. There are large differences in the per capita amounts, and the task of unifying the debts and placing them upon a per capita basis will be no light one. It will tax the ingenuity of any Treasurer who may have to deal with it. The problem will have to be dealt with upon a general give-and-take plan. It will be impossible to scrutinise every figure, dot every "" i , "" and reckon every halfpenny and farthing in assimilating' the debts of the States. Therefore, while the honourable member for Kooyong was right in mentioning that Victoria would labour under some disability as compared with New South Wales, it should be remembered that the latter State will stand in just the same relation to other States. I ' have not been able to follow the doings of the Conventions which resulted in fettering limitations being embodied in the financial clauses of the Constitution. I suppose that consideration for States rights caused a compromise to be brought about. Whatever may have been the initial cause, we can see, even after this short lapse of time, that the continuance of the limitations will be detrimental to all the States as such as well as to the Commonwealth. After all, what affects the Commonwealth credit must necessarily affect the States' credit. The two things are really inseparable, because the indebtedness of one is the indebtedness of the other. Therefore, whatever mav affect their credit in one relationship must certainly react upon them in their other relationship.",23

119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"I quite agree with the Prime Minister. That seems to be a condition precedent to any successful financial operations on the part of the Commonwealth. My own view is that we might very well begin with a tentative scheme. The amount of our indebtedness upon the London register today corresponds with the amount of the loans upon which the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which we are now returning to the States would pay interest. quently we could at once determine the present financial relationship between the States and the Commonwealth by the simple method of ""cutting the connection "" as between the States and. London, and by monopolizing the London, market for our Federal credit. In my judgment, many of the objections which have been urged against the details of schemes for the conversion of the States debts will solve themselves the moment we begin to establish a better credit for the States. The' latter will be only too glad to come to us, and ask for that better credit. But we cannot hope to begin at that point until the Constitution is amended in the direction now sought by the Treasurer, because the amount of our indebtedness to the London market is subject to those limitations to which reference has alreadv been made. I therefore think that the Treasurer is acting wisely in asking for the additional grant qf power which will be conferred by the Bill.",24
120,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"Wilmot) [4.5] - Of tourse, every honourable member must view the proposal embodied in this measure from the stand-point of the way in which it will affect the State of which he is a representative. Before Federation was accomplished the Customs revenue of Tasmania was considerably in excess of the amount necessary to pay her annual interest charges. 'Unfortunately, since the Union was consummated-owin g to the establishment of Inter-State free-trade-it has very considerably declined. The result is that if the proposal of the Treasurer be accepted by the people of the Commonwealth the Tasmanian Customs revenue will be insufficient to pay interest upon the English portion of her indebtedness. When honourable members are called upon-as they will be very shortly-to address their constituents, they will naturally be expected to have the fullest information in respect to this question. Consequently, I desire to call the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that up to date he has made no suggestion as to how any deficiency in the interest charges for which the States are liable will be met. For instance, will he be prepared .to accept the assurance of the Tasmanian Treasurer that he will provide for any such deficiency?",24
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,We propose that the States should pass an Act indemnifying the Commonwealth for any deficiency. Conse- Mr CAMERON - I understood that the right honourable gentleman desired tc obtain the railway revenue of the States as security.,24

123,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,Then the proposal of the Treasurer appears to be a fair one. At the same time. I do not for a moment believe that the credit of the Commonwealth! will be very much better than that of some of the States.,24

125,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"When we talk about the Commonwealth being able to obtain money , at cheaper rates than the States, it seems to me that we neglect to consider the liabilities of the latter in their individual capacities.

126,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,But the Commonwealth possesses exclusive powers of Customs and Excise taxation.,24
127,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,I admit that. At the same time the Treasurer must not forget that the States have power to levy taxation in every other form.,24
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,It is not easy to obtain revenue.,24
129,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"It is easy to get it up to a certain point.' Need I remind the Treasurer that the legislation which has been enacted by this Parliament has not tended to enhance the value of the Commonwealth security in the eyes of those who control the London money market. This Parliament consists of two Houses which are elected practically upon the same franchise. But the members of our Legislative Councils are usually elected upon a property qualification, and there is no doubt in my mind that the existence of these .bodies is calculated to induce the London money lenders to look with a more favourable eye upon the security of the States than upon the security of the Commonwealth', whose legislation is largely tinged with Socialism. Consequently, it seems to me that the Treasurer is taking altogether too sanguine a view in respect of the flotation of future loans. At the same time, I recognise that it is advisable to consolidate the debts of the States if it is possible to do so. Under these circumstances, I do not propose to offer any opposition to this Bill. There is, however, one point to which I should like to direct attention. Some honourable members, have urged that the States Governments should in future be prevented from borrowing upon the London market. But, assuming that some such restriction is imposed upon them, what will be the position of a State which may desire to raise several millions sterling for the purpose of constructing a railway or of carrying out some other very important public worx? Would it be dependent upon the sweet will of a majority of this Parliament?",24
130,Mr HARPER,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,No .,25
131,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,How can we guard against that?,25
132,Mr WATSON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"The States Governments would not require to spend several millions each year, and, therefore, small loans raised upon the local market would be sufficient to meet their requirements.",25
133,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"But let us suppose that the Victorian Government found it necessary to construct an important railway at a cost of £7,000,000 . If it were obliged to raise that sum, what would the Federal Treasurer do? Again, let us as^ sume that two of the States required to raise a substantial sum to undertake important public works.",25
134,Mr WATSON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"If those works were absolutely necessary, fjhe Treasurer would probably give them authority to raise the money.",25
135,Mr CAMERON,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,Does the honourable member suggest that the people of the States are willing to allow the Federal Treasurer to decide whether the construction of a railway or any other public work is necessary ?

The question is a very difficult one to determine. Is the Treasurer prepared to take the - responsibility of saying that the States shall not borrow in the London market? Would he say to a State that desired to raise money for urgent public works, of which the people approved, "" You shall not be allowed to raise a loan for that purpose ""? I do not know whether he has given consideration to that phase of the question; but I am sure that he will do so when we are dealing with the Bill in Committee.",25
138,Sir JOHN QUICK,SYNOPSIS OF TOTALS SHOWINC RATES OF,"Bendigo) [4-17]-I desire to congratulate the Treasurer upon the very clear, masterly, and adequate manner in which he has placed this question before the House. (He is entitled to our warmest praise for the great attention he has evidently given to the question, of the conversion of the States debts, and to the framing of a scheme to be substituted for the Braddon section, which will shortly expire. I take it that the two questions of the disposition of the surplus and the transfer and consolidation of the States debts are inseparably associated, and must form part of one common scheme. The right honourable gentleman has placed before us the whole of the data and the various phases of this question in a way that will enable the House and the country to grasp the situation. One of the disappointments of Federation is that the questions of the consolidation of the States debts and the means of effecting the savings that were anticipated to flow from the Union have not been properly tackled by the Parliament. We were led. to expect that substantial financial savings would be Secured. It was said that' Federation would lead to savings by the centralization of certain Government institutions in the Commonwealth, permitting of a corresponding reduction of expenses in the State governing institutions, whilst we were also promised that economies would be effected by the conversion and consolidation of the States loans into one national debt. This inaction on the part of the Federal Parliament has been a source of great disappointment to the warmest friends of Federation, and we should not be doing'' justice to ourselves or to the Parliament if we allowed the forthcoming general election to pass without giving the people opportunity to express a definite opinion upon the question. I am glad that, although we are not agreed in matters of detail, there is a consensus of opinion upon the general question. Whilst, no doubt, Federal Parliament has power, under secing tion 105 of the Constitution, to take over the loans existing at the establishment the Commonwealth, I am of opinion that the Government should not . undertake to deal with such a great and delicate finanbodied cial operation, without the cordial co-operastitution tion of the States, and before arriving at some common plan of action. We need years not rely merely upon our legal right. That being so, I think that the Government and wise its predecessors acted wisely, in consulting tional the States Treasurers upon this important matter. The result may be the formulacise, tion of a plan which will eventually be found to work well. I do not think that the States will stand in the way provision of the execution of this great nasection. tional scheme, provided that their they right to receive the surplus revenue contemplated by the 'Braddon section is adequately guaranteed and secured. When the States handed over to the Comupon monwealth that vast source of revenuethe power to impose Customs and Excise taxation-it was never anticipated that they would ever cease to be a partner in that plus. When the Braddon' clause was passed by the Convention, it was unlimited in its operation. The ten years' restriction was imposed by the Conference of Premiers in Melbourne upon the suggestion and at request, I believe, of the Government and Parliament of New South Wales. the clause left the Convention, the States were treated as having a permanent inceived terest in the Federal surplus. How could we contemplate .their being left saddled with the enormous debt of £202,000,000 existing at the inception of Federation, whilst they were deprived at the same of one of their principal means of securing the revenue necessary to enable them to earn on the work of government and to the 7 pay the ' interest - on their national The Convention never contemplated the nihilation of the right of the States to share in the surplus, either by a direct grant or by the Commonwealth taking over a cerrendered. tain proportion of their indebtedness, interest upon which would be paid out of that surplus. I notice that at the Conmate ference held at Hobart on the 15th by Sir John Quick. an February, 1905, the Premiers of the States did not assume an attitude antagonistic to the Commonwealth taking - over the management of their debts. They merely desired to be secured after the expiration the of the Braddon guarantee. The followparagraph from the Treasurer's summary of the history of the negotiations' of gives the views of the States Treasurers:That pending a better provision being emin the Constitution to secure the States against deficiency, the 87th section of the ConAct should be amended by the omission of the words, "" during a period of ten after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until Parliament otherprovides,"" in order to secure the constituright of the return to each of the States of three-fourths of the net revenue of the 'Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Exas provided by that section. All the States' demanded was an adequate to take the place of the Braddon In default of a better scheme, desired that the section should be continued in perpetuity. I take it that this shows that they were willing to consider any proposal that would be an improvement the present system of returning to them threef-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. That amount is a fluctuating one, dependent upon the results of the Fesurderal Tariff for the time being. The Treasurer has come forward with a provision equally as good as, if not better than, the Braddon section. His proposal is evidently a well-considered one. It is in the direction the of a guaranteed fixed annual payment for ten years to each of the States on the As basis of the three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which they reduring the five years preceding the 31st December, 1910. That is a fair and adequate solution of the problem. It is based upon constitutional principle, and also upon the precedent to be found in the time Canadian Constitution. Upon the adoption of the Confederation and the surrender to it of the smaller sources of revenue of provinces, the latter received fixed sums debts. guaranteed by the Constitution. These anfixed sums were arrived at by approximate estimates of the value of the revenue surThe Treasurer has proposed a the scheme of arriving approximately at the value of the revenue surrendered-a n estibased upon the net revenue received the several States from Customs and Excise under the Federal system during the last five years. His scheme goes an provide that If three-fourths of the total net revenue Customs and Excise in any year (not marked) exceeds the aggregate of the guaranteed fixed payments to all the States a-percapita return of such excess shall take place. The amount to be refar turned therefore is to be determined partly upon the basis of the five years' receipts and partly upon the fer cafita principle. That is a very fair substitute for the BradAll don guarantee, and will admit of certain variations based upon a fer cafita allowis ance. It is founded upon principle and precedent, and as such I think it ought be taken into fair consideration by presentatives of the States. - Sir JOHN FORREST - Ne w South Wales States, has accepted it.

Assuming it to be deemed satisfactory by the States, have the assurance that they will offer objection, but, on the contrary, will facilihibited tate, the taking over of the whole of their debts by the Commonwealth as soon arrangements can be made.

I realise the importance .of limiting the borrowing powers of the and much is to be said in favour of it. But the Commonwealth should not assume a stand and deliver attitude. The States have heavy and serious obligations to meet, and there should be no conflict between Commonwealth and State interests.",27
143,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All public expenditure comes out of the same purse.,27
144,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is all provided for by the people. I am resolved to do all that I can for the cultivation and maintenance of friendly relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and to give no support to the unnecessary invasion of State rights; because it would be a most unfortunate thing if the 'Governments of States were fighting the Commonwealth Government. Therefore I see no objection to the forthcoming Conference of State Premiers. I hope that they will give favourable consideration to the Treasurer's scheme, and will facilitate the proposed alteration of the Constitution to bring about the consolidation of their debts, and the establishment of Australian consols having a standard value both here and on the reLondon money market. The profits flowof ing from the conversion or redemption of old loans and the flotation of new ones, as the result of borrowing at a lower rate of interest) than the average of that now paid, will go, not to the Commonwealth, but to a the States, which are therefore interested in bringing about a satisfactory arrangewe ment. I protest most strongly against the no suggestion that the States should be proby a provision in the Constitution from floating loans without the consent of as the Commonwealth. The Treasurer has the given a great deal of consideration and attention to this matter, and is of opinion that the Commonwealth should be empowered to raise loans for the States upon terms and conditions mutually agreed upon. I concur in that suggestion. He . goes on to say that he thinks it inadvisable to ask the States to undertake for all time not to borrow on the London money market except through the Commonwealth. To do that would be to ask the States to tie their hands most unjustifiably, and no self-respecting State Government would consent to such an arrangement. But, as the result of friendly discussion and negotiation, the States may be expected to enter voluntarily into an undertaking not to borrow on the London money market during a certain limited period, except through the Commonwealth. The period fixed upon by the Treasurer would expire on the 31st December, 1920, which is the date when the period during which fixed returns will be made to the States would expire. But it would be a mistake to enter upon any plan smacking of finality, because we cannot anticipate the changes which may occur ten or twenty years hence. Consequently, the Treasurer is wise in proposing a period of temporary duration. He suggests that a fixed sum should be returnable to the States during a period of ten years. That would give the Government of the Commonwealth and of the States an opportunity to study the working of the arrangement. I heartily approve of the Treasurer's scheme. There is nothing absolutely new in it, its principles being a development of proposals considered by the Finance Committee of the Convention. These .proposals were not embodied in the Constitution!, the Braddon provision being adopted in their place, but they might have been worked out to produce similar results. I hope that the Government and the Treasurer will persevere in this matter. According to the figuies given in a return laid upon the table by the Treasurer last night, if the saving of interest is only J per cent., by 1952 New South Wales will have saved £5,548,604; Victoria, £3,506,711 ; Oueensland, £2,674,915; South Australia, £1,975,302; Western £ »i79»37°; 1 Tasmania, £161,114; or a total of £15,646,016. That is a solid and substantial result worth realizing. Personally, I am under great obligation to the Treasurer for the clear, able, comprehensive, and practical manner in which Sir John Quick. he has launched his scheme, and I have no doubt that the verdict of the country will be in favour of its adoption. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through Committee without amendment. Report adopted. NA (SENATE ELECTIONS). BILL. SECOND READING.",27
145,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs) [4.44]. - I move That the Biil be now read a second lime. It has frequently been pointed out in this Chamber that it would be more convenient to the electors, especially in agricultural districts, if the Commonwealth elections were held in March or April instead of in November or December, and the Bill provides for an alteration of the Constitution which would enable the change to be made. It is proposed to alter the date for the commencement of the term of senators. The desire of both Houses seems to be to hold the elections for the House of Representatives and for the Senate simultaneously. It is not possible to have simultaneous elections in the month of March, unless the period for which senators are elected is extended. The Bill provides that section 13 of the Constitution shall be altered(a.) by omitting the words "" the third year,"" and inserting in iieu thereof the words ""three years""; (i) by omitting the words "" the sixth year,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words "" six years "" ; (c) by omitting the words "" in the year at the expiration of which,"" and inserting in lieu thereof "" within one year before "" ; (d) by omitting the word "" January"" wherever it occurs, and inserting in lieu thereof the word "" July."" The term of office of senators whose period will not expire until the end of .the year 1909, and those senators who are returned at the forthcoming elections, will be extended for six months. Therefore, they will"" hold office for six years and six Australia, months. All senators subsequently elected will hold office only for the usual term of six years. The proposed amendment will have the additional effect of enabling the members who are returned to this House at the next elections to continue in office for the full period of three years. The Constitution provides for triennial Parliaments; but, in order to permit of simultaneous elections, the term of office of members of this House has been cut down by a certain number of months before the end of the three years from the date of meeting. The next House will be the first to expire by effluxion of time, and the elections will probably take place in March or April.",28
146,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will not the next House of Representatives be elected for a term of more than three years?,29
147,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parliamen t begins from the day on which it assembles, and continues for a period of three years from that date. As a matter of fact, this Parliament will be dissolved, as was the last Parliament, several months before the proper term has expired.",29
148,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The members' are elected from the date of the declaration of the-poll, and therefore the members of the next House will represent the people for more than three years.",29
149,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes. Assuming that the elections are held in the first week of December, and the Parliament assembles in February, they will hold office until February three years after. Parliament expires by effluxion of time, the term of office of members will be exactly three years from the date of meeting. Of course, they may be thrown out by a penal dissolution. Even in such a case, it is quite possible that the conditions may be harmonized subsequently, to enable simultaneous elections to take place. By making the termi for which senators are elected begin on, the ist July, instead of on the ist January, we shall be able to hold the elections at a time which is 'considered most convenient for the majority of the electors.",29
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tranklin) [4.50]. - I think there can be no possible objection to the Bill . There is a general consensus of opinion that the period of the year at which elections have to be held under present conditions is about the most inconvenient that could be selected. It is very undesirable that elections should take place just after the close of a session, because, as our experience has shown, very important business has to be postponed indefinitely or rushed through without due consideration. that no finality can be secured because this House can be dissolved at any time would apply to any arrangement that might be made. So long as this House is subject to penal dissolution it would not be possible to make any provision by which the two Houses would always go to the country at the same time. I think, however, that the occasions upon which the House will be penally dissolved will be very rare indeed. I know that the opinion is gaining ground that the period of three years for which honourable members are elected to this House is altogether too short, owing to the fact that the whole of Australia has to be canvassed and the elections are very expensive. I know that if the term for which members are returned were extended to four years it might be necessary to elect senators for eight years, and that would be too long a period. Perhaps, however, even that difficulty might be overcome.",29
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [4.53] - I think that the provisions of the Bill are in accordance with the general feeling of honourable members in both Chambers. My only regret is that so many proposals for the amendment of the Constitution should be remitted to the electors at one and the same time. I am afraid If the next that under the circumstances there will be a large number ofi informal votes. I think that we are all agreed that the maximum of convenience would be achieved if we selected an earlier period of the year for holding the elections. Every one knows that harvesting operations are being pursued in December, and that that season of the year is a busy one for most classes of producers. Under the varying conditions of the Australian climate, with a season beginning in one part of the Continent and closing in another at the same time of the year, it is impossible to choose a date for the elections that will suit the convenience of every one. All we can do is to con-' fer the greatest good on the greatest number, and I think that the Bill will serve that end. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through Committee without amendment. Report adopted. REFERENDUM (CONSTITUTION ALTERATION) BILL. Motion (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThe objection That the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering clause 6, and forms A, B, ancl c of the schedule, and also with a view to inserting a new clause, 31A. In Committee: (Recommittal). Clause 6The Governor General may oause to he attached to the writ a copv of the proposed law, or a copy of a statement certified to be correct by a Justice of the High Court setting out(a) the text of the proposed law, (b) the material parts of the Constitution proposed to be altered by the proposed law, and (c) .the material parts of the Constitution as they would be if the proposed law were passed and assented to.",29
152,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [4.59] - I move That the words "" certified to be correct by a Justice of the High Court"" be left out. The feeling of the Committee was adverse to a Justice of the High' Court being askpd to certify to the mere textual alterations of the proposed law, or to give what might appear to be an opinion upon the proposed alteration. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Governor General shall simply publish a statement setting forth the text and textual alterations proposed. referendum was taken, the vote on the Constitution itself.",30
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do I understand the' Minister to say that he proposes to passed. leave this matter in the hands of the Governor General ?,30
154,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The proposal is to enrestriction able the whole of the section of the Coneliminate stitution which it is proposed to alter, be printed together with the textual alterasubmit tions which it is desired to make.",30
155,Mr MCCAY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Is the amendment framed upon the lines that were suggested upon a previous occasion ?,30
156,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,30
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who is to certify to the proposed alterations? Air. GROOM - The Crown Law offithe cers will prepare it.,30
158,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would not the probe posal of the Minister make the ballota paper a very complicated one?,30
159,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The proposal does not relate to the ballot-paper. It is proposed that a copy of the section of the Conaccompany stitution which it is desired to alter shall be issued when the writ is issued. In addition, the textual proposed to be made will be printed for the information of the electors. amendment is designed to make the meanable ing of the clause perfectly clear. It is further intended to advertise the alterations desired to be made in the Constitution in certain newspapers of the different States, so that the fullest publicity may be given to them.",30
160,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the Minister mean by "" c e r t a in "" newspapers?",30
161,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,At the present time the Commonwealth electoral officers in the various States have authority to advertise electoral information in at least two newspapers circulating in those States.,30
162,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister's proposal will mean that the advertisements will appear in the two metropolitan newspapers in every State?,30
163,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not necessarily. It is quite possible that in a State like Western Australia it may be found necessary to insert one advertisement in a metropolitan journal and another in a provincial newspaper.,30
164,Mr WHTKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it not possible to When - the advertise the alterations proposed in more, was taken than two newspapers ?",30
165,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That matter is dealt with in a clause which we have already,30
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [5.7] - I understood that the object of the imposed by this clause was to all extraneous influences from the to plain statement which it is proposed to to the electors regarding the effect of any proposed amendment of the Constitution. It was considered that the High Court Justices should be kept out of the political cauldron, and that their opinions should riot be subjected to the ordinary rough-and-tumble criticisms of our political - conditions. I think that that is a very proper thing to do. On the other hand,, Minister suggests that a mere statement of the law proposed to be amended shall submitted to the electors, together with further statement showing the nature of the proposed amendment. I presume that some sort of explanation showing how the two things would dove-tail or read should those statements. We all know that in this Chamber it is the almost invariable practice to read any clause of a alterations Bil l which it is desired to amend in the form in which it would appear if the The amendment were adopted, so that honormembers may get a grip of it. Does not that indicate the necessity for some amendment which would make the whole position understandableby the electors quite apart from the statement of the textual alterations proposed to be made? For instance, will section 105 of the Constitution be printed upon a separate paper, and with it the eliminations and the additions proposed by the Treasurer?",30
167,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The section itself will be printed, and it mav also be printed in the form in which it would appear if amended in the direction proposed.",31
168,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All I have to say is that a great many votes, both for and against the proposal to amend the Constitution, will be recorded without much idea on. the part of the electors of the nature of the amendment proposed to be effected. Would it not be better for us to authorize the issue of a short statement by the Clerk of the Parliaments?",31
169,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exceptio n wastaken to any officer issuing such a statement.,31
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exceptio n was taken to anybody issuing it to whom political bias might attach Sir JOHN . QUICK - Would Clerk of the Parliaments naturally consult the Law officers of the Crown in a matter of this sort?,31
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,31
172,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why not leave it to the Attorney-General ? ,31
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because he is - a party politician.,31
174,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He is a law officer.,31
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tak e the case of the present Attorney-General. Is there a keener party, politician in this Chamber?",31
176,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He is not a party man upon questions which involve an amendment of the Constitution.,31
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not sugcharge gesting that any conscious bias would taint his statement. I know he endeavour to keep that as far removed from him as possible. But I doubt whether he is more superhuman in that spect than the rest of us. All these dangers would be obviated if we authorized the ment. Clerk of the Parliaments to issue a short statement such as I have suggested.,31
178,Mr JOHNS ON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Lang) [5.13] - Perhaps the Minister will explain how it is in[174] tended to enlighten the voter as to the purpose and character of any proposed amendment of the Constitution.,31
179,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is dealt with in paragraph a ,31
180,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But if we strike out the words "" Justice of the High Court"" there will be no .provision as to who shall certify to the statement to be submitted to the electors.",31
181,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Governor General will issue it.,31
182,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that that is the best way of dealing with the matter, because the preparation of the statement issued would be within the control of the Cabinet.",31
183,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not partake of a party character.,31
184,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be issued by the Governor General acting upon the advioe of the Cabinet.,31
185,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Probably there would be not the a consultation with the Electoral Department and Crown Law officers.,31
186,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Electoral Department were consulted perhaps so much objection could not be urged against the Government proposal. But if the statement were issued by the Governor General acting upon the advice of the Cabinet, it might be more or less coloured by the opinions of the Ministry.",31
187,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have considered the matter very carefully, and the amendment represents the best means of submitting an explanatory statement to the electors.",31
188,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am rather inclined to approve of the suggestion that the Clerk of the Parliaments might be deputed to disthis duty. Under the amendment the matter is left in a very vague form. would I have no amendment to suggest, but it seems to me that there is a difficulty to be overcome. All that I desire to do is reto insure that there shall be put before the electors an absolutely unbiased state",31

Many electors, if an authoritative and unprejudiced statement of the purpose of a proposed alteration were placed before them, would act on their own discretion, and the value of the referendum will be enormously reduced if the people have to depend wholly upon the views instilled into their minds Commonby political parties and the press.",33

219,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kalgoorlie) [5.42] - I understood from the Minister last night that he would agree to a recommittal of the item relating to ammunition, in order to give honourable members an opportunity to obtain information as to the use of explosives in mining districts; but as we did not get away until 7 o'clock this morning, and then had to go home to obtain much-needed rest, it has been impossible for me to find out, in the interval, what I want to know. I have telegraphed to competent authorities in my constituency, but I do not expect to receive a reply from them until tomorrow morning. In the absence of authoritative information, if the Government proceed now ,with the item, I shall feel compelled, in order to be on the safe side, to vote against the duties on explosives. As I stated last night, the safety of hundreds of men who use explosives in conducting mining operations depends largely upon our determination in this matter.",34
220,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In what way ?,34
221,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It may be that the proposed taxation would fall too heavily upon mining communities, and it might also have the effect of preventing the importation of safe ammunition.",34

228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [5.46] - I understood last night that the Minister agreed to make an inquiry into these items. Indeed, as to powder, the Minister said that he would very likely make the concession asked for, but that he would like, first of all, to look into the matter.",34
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did not say that I would make the concession, but I consented to recommit the item ""Explosives,"" and one or two others.

Paris green is one of the most effective spraying materials that can be used for the destruction of the codlin moth and other orchard pests, and if the price were increased it would certainly be most inimical to the best interests of the Commonwealth.

231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.56] - There was a considerable debate upon the subject of explosives, last night, and although I have not had much time to obtain information upon the subject, I am able to furnish honourable members with some particulars with reference, more particularly, to explosives used for blasting purposes. The following, information has been supplied to me:Explosives, n.e.i., being explosives for blasting, are made chiefly by Nobels, Glasgow. There are also the National Explosives Company, of Cornwall j Kynochs, Essex; British Explosives Company, Glasgow; Curtiss and Harvey and Chilworth, England. makers include the Hamburg Dynamite 'Company and the Phoenix Explosives Company. Detonators are made both in England and on the Continent. Mr Hake, the Chief Inspector of Explosives, could not say offhand as to respective proportions, but believes that the larger quantity comes from England. Fuse known as safety fuse, is all of British manufacture, and is made by 'he followina firms :-Messrs . Bickford, Smith and Company, Cornwall; Nobels, in the attached schedule, duties of Customs shall from the 30th day of August, 1906, at 4.30 p.m., Victorian time, be imposed as follows :IMPOR I DUTIES.

Mr Hake states that all the above explosives (which include gelignite, .gelatine, dynamite, Ate), are ustd exclusively Dy miners, and none of them are made exclusively on the Continent. There are no American explosives or fuse. Of the explosives for blasting imported into the Commonwealth 75 per cent, are of British manufacture; 75 per cent, of the detonators are of British manufacture; and all the fuse is of British manufacture. Mr Hake says that he is quite sure Great Britain can supply all the explosives required in mining, & c , in Australia. Re complaint of Perry Company, as to non-supply of fuse powder, I am assured that British manufacturers can and will supply such powder. If there is any attempt to operate injuriously against any Australian inForeign dustry in this respect, we could probably deal with such under the Anti-Trust Act. I mentioned to the Comptroller-General the cases which were prominently brought forward by the honourable member for Newcastle and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie respectivel_v, and asked him .to obtain all the information he possibly could. The following return has teen compiled :RETUKN of Explosives (English and Foreign) imported into Victoria during period 1st July, 1905, to 31st August, 1906. - Manufacture. Manufacture.

He has not so, but there is some person or persons",36
234,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the Minister speaking of explosives or of fuse?,36

238,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Newcastle) [6.3] - In view of the statement of the Minister, appears to me that if we remit the profrom posed duty of 10 per cent, upon foreign explosives, we shall not improve matters from a local stand-point. Concerning other subject mentioned by the Minister, I cannot say of my own knowledge that a powder combination exists in the old country, but the general impression in New South Wales is that the supply of that article is controlled by a trust. Certainly English Foreign the price which the miners are called upon to pay for it is very high. I trust that the Minister will make further inquiries with tons. tons. a view to ascertaining whether its manufacture is controlled by any such combina544 180 tion. If a combine exist, it is in a posi129J 33 tion to raise the price of powder under any 90 124 58 Nil circumstances.

242,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bendigo) [6.8] the I am very much interested in this item not of fuse powder. Only today a represent done tative of Nobel waited upon me and informed me that it is a fact that an English firm of fuse makers- I do not wish to mention their name so as to unnecessarily prejudice them-wh o are large competitors in the Victorian market, having his had a dispute with a local manufacturer of fuse, have induced the powder combine in England not to sell any powder to him. To my mind, their action a most unjust conspiracy against the local manufacturer. I hope that which the Minister has said can be accepted as an indication that he sympaconthizes with such a combination. I desire to know whether he is still determined to reimpose a duty of 10 Der cent, upon Continental fuse powder? As a, matter of law, I am absolutely convinced that if we agree to the item "" Explosives, n.e.i., ad valorem, it .10 per cent.,"" it will cover fuse powder the Continent, and that the Victorian firm to which I have alluded will have to pay that duty unon the supplies of the powder which it obtains from there.",36
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot see the logic of that position at all. If what has been told me be true, the local manufacturer deserves the treatment to which he has been subjected. . Sir JOHN QUICK - But it is not true. In addition, the dispute which arose was settled by means of litigation. Further, both firms appeared before the Tariff Commission, and asked for the imposition of a duty - of i d . per coil upon imported fuse, The Minister should not assume that his information is true until' he has heard the statements of Messrs. Perry and Company, of Footscray.",37

254,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not blame the Nobel trust in this matter.

260,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) [6.16] - No one having any knowledge of this question can to doubt that much of these explosives are controlled by large trusts. I would point out,' however, that most of those imported alinto Australia come from the Glasgow branch of Nobel and Company, and consethat quently would not pay the hitrher duty. No doubt the Minister has before him in formation beiaring out my statement. There as is a powerful 'German combination, a combination, and also, I think, a French combination, and all are practically under the same patent; but I reBripeat that most of these explosives come chieflv from the Glasgow branch of Nobel and Company.",37
261,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is speaking of dynamite and gelignite, not",37
262,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nobe l and Company all sorts of explosives. I am strongly of opinion that the Minister would be justified in resisting any attempt to bring the Australian manufacturer into a position in which he would be able to co-operate with the big trusts in the old world who control prices; but my experience leads me to believe that it is incorrect to say that all comthese explosives come from the Continent.,37
263,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"North Sydney) [6.19] - The discussion which has taken place upon this item shows how absurd it is to speak of it as being a real preto Great Britain. We find on inquiry that nearly all the explosives used in our mines are manufactured in Great Britain, so that she already holds the bulk of the trade. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that something has led to a serious quarrel between two manufacturers of explosives in Victoria, and that each of them is trying to secure an advantage over - the other. understand that a local manufacturer's business was acquired by a well-known firm of British fuse-makers, subject to the condition that the vendor should not resume operations here. We are toldalthough I cannot sav whether or not the statement' is correct-that through the agency of some of his relatives, the latter once more set up in business, with the result that the British firm, which had established its business here, and which is a large user of fuse powder, induced the sellers of that explosive in Great Britain to refrain from accepting any further orders from their local opponent. was a, wrong position to take up. but the peculiar feature of these proceedings is that as soon as the Tariff Commission was appointed, the two firms sank their differences and united in an effort to secure an increased duty of i d . per coil. This serves to show what takes place in connection with a proposal of this kind, and how necessary it is to make caref u l inquiries before taking action. So far as mining explosives are concerned, it is immaterial whether we grant or refuse a preference to Great Britain, since the bulk of our imports are already drawn. from that quarter.",37
264,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Robertson) [6.23] - When I left the Chamber early this morning this item was under consideration, and the futility of all-night sittings is demonstrated by the fact that it has not yet been disposed of. The Minister promised last night to consider a request made by me that rifle cartridges, which are used very largely for the destruction of vermin, and are included in this schedule, should be dealt with on the existing Tariff basis. I wish to know whether he is prepared to make that concession.",38
265,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot. not a big item, but if I agreed to the honourable member's proposal, I should practically destrov the whole compact. I think that a certain class of cartridges are on the free-list, while others are not. A very considerable proportion of our imports of cartridges come from Great Britain.",38
266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. I do not think that a strong case has been made out on behalf of the miners who object to this item. The honourable member for Newcastle has told us that he considers this schedule has been introduced I not to give a preference to Great Britain, but to grant increased protection to certain local industries. If the sole object which the Government have in view is that of granting more protection to certainindustries, while exempting the honourable member's constituents from some taxation, then this cannot be said to be a proposal to grant preference to Great Britain.",38
267,Mr WATKIN S,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member describe it as a preferential scheme ?,38
268,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On the face of it, it is, but the preference is to be granted That by penalizing the foreigner and not by reducing our duties as against British imports. The honourable member wishes high duties to be imposed, not for the purpose of inducing Great Britain to enter into a reciprocal agreement, but to establish Australian industries which will reduce our trade with the old country. That is not the treatment which England expected from her Colonies when she asked us to do something for the cause of Empire.",38
269,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Grea t Britain' never asked us to grant her a preference.,38
270,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Preferentia l trade was favoured by the late Prime Minister, who, as the result of its advocacy, lost his seat. His first lieutenant, Mr . Chamberlain', also left the Cabinet to go forth, as he said, as a missionary in the interests of Empire, and did his best to popularize the policy.",38

I reiterate the request I made this afternoon, that the matter shall not be pressed until we have an opportunitv to learn from those who use explosives in their daily work what effect the proposed duties will have. The lives of men depend upon the nature of the blasting materialwhich they use, and we shall not be justified, in order to gain additional revenue, in jeopardizing their safety by compelling them to use explosives which may not be thoroughly suitable for the which they are doing.

The Senate would also have to meet in March, or within thirty days of the return of the writs. The newly elected senators would not be able to take their seats until July, and therefore their places would have to be filled in the meantime by senators who might have been rejected at the polls. I do not think it is desirable that we should be called upon to rely upon the services of senators rejected at the polls to assist in transacting the business of the country. My view of this matter is endorsed by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs. I appeal to the Prime Minister to say whether senators elected in March, 1.910, could take their seats before July.",39

Mr MCCAY - That could be done under the Constitution as it stands. - Mr Frazer - The only method by which it could be done at present would be by extending the time for the return ""of the writs, and I do not think that that is a desirable course to adopt. We should not leave it to the Ministry to do as they please in a matter of that kind. Suppose that the members of the Government were rejected at the general election.

It is therein provided that the House of Representatives shall exist for three years from the date of its first meeting. If we met next March we should continue to exist for three years. If the House were dissolved in March, 1910, there would be ample time under the Electoral Act to do all that was required.",40

In my opinion, he is already qualified for the leadership of the Opposition, and, so .far as I am concerned, I am ready to abdicate my position immediately he can see his way to take up the role. I do not at all de- subscribe to his constitutional theory",40
296,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is because the honourable member has not looked into it.,40
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not subscribe to his constitutional theory that the they only function of the Opposition is to put right the wretched proposals of an incompetent Government.

My honourable friend has adopted quite a novel reading of the posifore tion. He is now suggesting that instead of exposing ourselves to the risk of having to rely upon rejected senators to carry the business of the country, we should tend the term of office of men who ought to be rejected.

The honourable member for Corinella, on with Els splendid intellect, has pointed exout that if we proceed to the last extremity of ov.r constitutional powers we may keep within the four corners of the Constitution itself. That ought not to be the object of a Parliament or the aim of a a democratic Government. Nobody knows better than does the honourable and learned member, that under the most favoured conditions, the Government will be at their wits' ends to keep within the Constitution.

This Bill, I contend, gives effect to the desire of honourable members. Under it , if Parliament be convened during the first week of March next year-that was the month in which the present Parliament was convened-it will expire by effluxion of time three years later. If the measure be passed into law, senators who are elected during the present year will continue to hold office until the 30th of June, 1913, and the members of the Senate who were returned at the last election will continue to hold office for six months longer than they otherwise would have done-that is to say, until the 30th of June, 1910.

Within ten days thereafter the writ for the holding of the elections must issue. That writ fixes the date of nomination, which must be not less than seven nor more than twenty-one days after the date of the writ. most be not less than seven, nor more than thirty, days after the nomination. the declaration of the poll the candidates are duly elected, and upon their election they are de facto members of Parliament.",41
312,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister is referring to members of this House only.,42
313,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would point out to the honourable member that candidates for the Senate will also be returned at that election, because the idea is that we should have simultaneous elections. The writ must be returned within sixty days of its issue, and the Constitution requires that, within thirty days of its return,' Parliament must assemble. But we have power under the Electoral ' Act to extend the period fon the return of (he writ. order to avert what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie regards as' a possible calamity-the fact that one or two months may elapse during which it would be possible for the old representatives to take part in the deliberation of Parliament",42
314,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be grossly improper if they did take part in its deliberations.,42
315,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No . The same thing is done in the United States.,42
316,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For good and sufficient reasons. A Government might be in power which has been absolutely defeated at the polls.,42
317,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The contingency to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie refers could only arise once, namely, after the election which is to be held three years hence.",42
318,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am of that opinion myself.,42
319,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Surely there is no need for us to go through all the processes of introducing another Bill,42
320,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the Minister say that my proposal would necessitate anything of the (kind ?,42
321,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This measure has already passed through the Senate, and if we agree to it now, it is ready for submission to the electors. The matter to which the honourable member refers has been most carefully considered, and I am sorry that he was not present this afternoon, because it is most desirable that these questions should be full y discussed.",42
322,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Probably I should have been present if I had not been obliged to The polling sit up all last night.,42
323,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I recognise that the honUpon orable member gives very close attention to the business which comes before this House. But the position to which he has referred does not constitute a serious anomaly.,42
324,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,When does the Minister say that it will be possible to hold the elections after those which are now pending?,42
325,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The v could be held at any time in March, or during the first fortnight of April. After the first election under the amended Constitution they could be held at any time in May if desired. This matter has been carefully considered by the Government. Mr Frazer. - rW ill the honourable In member give us an assurance that he will see that the anomaly of rejected senators taking part in the proceedings of the Parliament is not permitted?",42
326,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can assure the honourable member that if I am still in office I shall be prepared to take action if I think that any evil is likely to arise. I can say no more than that.,42
327,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wentworth) [8.31] - I would point out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that if it were provided that the next Parliament should not expire until 1910 the result would be that even in the event of our failing to secure a workable Legislature a dissolution could not take place before then. We should then find ourselves in a more curious quandary than that to which he has referred. This ought (Senate Elections) to be sufficient to convince him that he ought net to proceed with his proposal.,42
328,Mr BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Canobolas) [8.32] - B y way of personal explanation, Mr Speaker, I desire to say that when the bells rang for the division on the motion for the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (States Debts) Bill , I was engaged in writing in the Opposition corner, and was in the act of crossing the floor when I was nominated as ateller for the noes. As a matter of fact, I am not opposed to the Bill , and had, intended to vote for reading.",43
329,Mr MCDONA LD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kennedy) [8.33] - ! should have liked the Minister of Home Affairs to intimate when it is proposed to hold the next general election under this measure. When it was first mooted that the general elections should be held in March, I pointed out to him both privately and in the House that such an alteration would seriously affect the position of candidates for election as representatives of Queensland.",43
330,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The point has been overlocked, and the Government know it.",43
331,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Give n an ordinary season, during the months of February and March and well into April, the country in the north-west of Queensland is practical ly impassable. It is a common thing at that time of the year to see mails stacked up on both sides of rivers for weeks at a stretch, and to find sheets of water 20 or 30 miles in width.",43
332,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But if the elections were held in the middle of April?,43
333,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r ordinary circumstances, the next Parliament will expire in the month of March, and if the elections do not take place until May, there will be an interval of six or eight weeks. the last occasion only four weeks elapsed - between the dissolution and the date of the elections.",43
334,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If Parliament expired in March, only six weeks would elapse before the holding of the general elections in the middle of April.",43
335,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"During that time the Commonwealth would be without a Parliament. That would be a very undesirable state of affairs. The facts which have been brought to light during this debate show how unwise it is to attempt to hurriedly pass legislation in the closing hours of a dying Parliament. In such circumstances it is not possible for honourable members to [20 SEPTEMEER, 1906.] Bill. 5061 give proper attention to the various measures submitted to them. It seems to me that there has been a desire on the part of the Government to overcome the difficulty without introducing a second Bill relating to the Senate. I did not rise to argue the constitutional point. My only desire was to 'show that if a general election be held in March or April, fully one-half of the electors in the north-west of Queensland will be disfranchised.",43
336,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Gwydir) [8.36] - Bot h its third the Minister of Home Affairs and the deputy-leader of the Opposition admit that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out an anomaly.,43
337,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said that an anomalymight arise if it were necessary to convene Parliament before a certain time, but that I did not think it would be.",43
338,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The deputy-leader of the Opposition, who is an authority on constitutional law, distinctly stated that an anomaly had been brought to light by the honourable member. The honourable and learned member for Angas indicated that he held a similar view, but urged that the condition of affairs described by the honourable member for Kaligoorlie was not uncommon in the United States. Is it to be said that we should agree to an anomaly simplv because it is tolerated in another country ? The difficulty could be overcome without running the risk, as suggested by the Minister, of having to extend the time for the return of the writs. The honourable and learned gentleman admits that if the Constitution be amended as proposed, it may be necessary to extend the time for the return of the writs for a month or more in order that the elections for the two Houses mav take On place simultaneously. That being so, it must be recognised that there is a flaw in this Bill . The incident serves to show how undesirable it is to have all-night sittings. When honourable members have to attend here dav and night they cannot be expected to prpperlv discharge their duties. Such a procedure undermines the work of the Parliament, and usually results in the passing of ill-considered legislation. Some of the worse laws on the statute-book of New South Wales were passed in. the small hours of the morning when honourable members were so fatigued as to be unfit to discharge their parliamentary duties. I regret that as I had to attend to a large volume of correspondence from my constituents I was unable to be present this afternoon. Had I been in attendance I should have endeavoured to secure the amendment of this Bill.",43
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member would have found it almost impossible to amend it.,44
340,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think the Opposition are to be blamed for not securing an amendment providing for an extension of the life of this Parliament for another two years. They frequently claim credit for having improved what they describe as the ill-considered measures introduced by the Government.,44
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On the contrary, we say that the honourable member and others have insistently frustrated our efforts in that direction.",44
342,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Opposition, provide should have endeavoured to amend the Bill in the way I have indicated, and at the same time to secure the insertion of a provision for an increased allowance to honourable members.

344,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hindmarsh) [8.44]. - Althoug h opposed to the raising of special duties of Customs to provide a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, I recognise that a large number of honourable members, who, I hope, will be returned at the forthcoming election, are not, as are the members of the party to which I belong, in. favour of direct taxation for this purpose, and, as the Bill provides for the amendment of the Constitution, and must therefore be passed by an absolute majority of the House, I intend to vote for the motion. While opposed to the raising of duties to a pensions fund, which I shall not advocate when before the country, I intend to give an opportunity to the electors to say whether the course proposed shall be taken. If the poor are willing, in order to secure a Commonwealth old-age pension system, to allow the revenue necessary for its establishment to be taken out of their pockets, .for I cannot prevent that being done.",44
345,Mr BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Canobolas) [8.51] - Like in the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I am not in favour of imposing special those duties-probabl y on tea and kerosene-to provide a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund. I should have been glad to have the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie carried. That would have made - it necessary to provide the money out of the general revenue. I recognise, however, that the Braddon section, which now prevents the Commonwealth from spending more than one-fourth of the receipts from Customs and Excise, will shortly cease to have effect, so that next Parliament, or its successor, will have power to say exactly' how the money so raised shall be expended. It is, however, highly desirable that we should have a workable system of Commonwealth old-age pensions, and remove the anomalies which exist under the New South Wales, and, I understand, the Victorian old-age pensions ' law. To bring that about, I intend to record my vote for the third reading.",44
346,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kennedy) [8.52] As I intend to record my vote against the Bill, I wish to put my views on record. I opthe measure, because I know that the Government have power to raise the money necessary for the establishment of an old age pensions fun d by means of direct taxation. I object to obtaining revenue for this purpose from duties on tea and kerosene, which are the chief articles it is proposed to tax. If the Bil l is passed, I shall try to persuade those electors with whom 1 come into contact to vote against the proposal which it embodies. The Government could raise by direct taxation the funds necessary for the payment of old-age pensions, and it is from this source that the money should be obtained. The reason why most persons are obliged to come to the State for assistance is that the wealth now enjoyed by the rich has been extorted from them, leaving them without means in their declining years. Therefore the rich should be called upon to bear the taxation necessary to provide for the aged poor. As I feel strongly that the money required should be obtained only by direct taxation, I shall vote.against the measure.",44
347,Mr WEBST ER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gwydir) [8.53] - Iju n opposed !to (the (proposal that unlimited power shall be given to the Government to raise revenue for purposes which are not specifically stated in the measure. We are told that power is being sought to enable the Government to establish a Commonwealth old-age pensions system; but we have only a bald statement on that point, and it is probable that the power when obtained, will be used to raise revenue for other purposes.",45
348,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nothin g can be done until Parliament passes an Act.,45
349,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am aware of that If . there had been no'other, or no more equitable, proposal than that put forward, it might be necessary to support the Bill as a means to an end; but I hold that a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund should be provided out of the revenue returned by the Commonwealth, to the States. New South Wales has practically paid her old-age pensions out of the surplus given to her by the Commonwealth over and above her three-fourths of the Customs, and Excise revenue. Therefore, more equitable arrangement would be to allow the Parliament to deduct from the sums returnable to the States under the Braddon provision enough to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pensions system. The States obtain a large amount of revenue from the Commonwealth compared with what they got prior to Federation.",45
350,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y some of them.,45
351,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Most of them have done very well. Trouble has arisen because some of the States have neglected their duty to the old and infirm, and, being less advanced than the other States, have no provision for the payment of old-age pensions. They cannot be expected to be ready to agree to a deduction being made from the three-fourths returnable to them by the Commonwealth. But in objecting to this method they are not showing a Federal spirit. A parochial spirit seems to permeate some honourable members. New South Wales paid old-age pensions to her people before receiving any of the large benefits which she has since received from Federation.  smalt States did not look after their interests, they would receive very little consideration from the honourable member.",45
352,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The State represented by the honourable member for Maranoa has received more support in this Parliament from the representatives of New South Wales than from any others. It ill-becomes the honourable member, who is always bursting out in fresh places, to chide a representative of New South Wales. No State has had so much consideration as has been received by Queensland in-connection with the action taken by the Commonwealth to obliterate the black blots' with which the legislation of that State has disgraced Australia.",45
353,Mr CULPIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Queenslan d does not receive even the full amount of her three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue.,45

356,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know what a would become of Queensland were it not for the duty on bananas. In my opinion, the Government proposal is'- inequitable, and it would have been fairer to create an old-age pensions fund by making deductions from the monev returnable to the States under the Braddon section. But Governments never like to lose revenue, and the consequence is that whenever a new piece of legislation is placed on the statute book it is made an excuse for increasing taxation. I shall not vote for the Bill .",45

I am in their duty to assist us in making, such favour of the establishment of a Commonfinancial wealth old-age pension system, and I shall not oppose the measure, because it vides for bringing that about. The Go the vernment have gone about this business a left-handed way. If they had desired to adopt a straightforward method, they might have proposed to repeal the Braddon poorer classes. section, and have provided for old-age pensions out of the present Customs reof venue, and perhaps by also imposing special duties upon tea and kerosene. If they adopted this course, the smaller States would not have felt the strain of the extra vious. taxation. The system of ear-marking special revenue is primitive and unsatisfactory. But I suppose that 'the Government have adopted the only course that was open to them, in view of their refractoryfollowing. I am strongly in favour of old-age pensions, and, failing ai. better scheme, I shall vote for that proposed by Bamford, F. W. the Government. I know of a man who Batchelor, E.

I have been assured by the . representative of a firm in this city, whose name I am not at liberty to disclose, that the statement recently made by the honourable and learned member ""for Bendigo that the supply of explosives is controlled by a huge trust is not quite correct. told that in Great Britain there are six separate firms which compete keenly for the trade of the world, and that on the continent there are other firms Which compete with the British manufacturers.

These men provide all their own materials, and if those materials are taxed in the manner proposed they will be placed in a very serious predicament. The preference which it is proposed to extend to the goods of the mother country under this heading is scarcely worthy of consideration.

ORDER OF BUSINESS : PATENT MAGAZINE ventor continuesATTACHMENT FOR RIFLES : AGREEMENT : NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT;",47
371,Mr DEAKI N,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [9.28] - In movingTnat the House do now adjourn, I do so at this early hour in consideration of the protracted period which honourable members were good enough to devote to their duties last night, and of the progress which has been made today. My honourable colleague, the Minister'of Trade and Customs, will tomorrow proceed with the Harvester Duties Bill and schedule, and the Bill covering the schedule which we have just been considering.  to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a patent magazine for rifles which will fit the Lee-Enfield, the Lee-Metford, and the new service rifles which are now being used by the Commonwealth Defence Forces. The advantages gained by the use of the new magazine arethat a rifle can be charged with eight cartridges almost as quickly as single loading one cartridge by drawing back the spring to its full extent and pouring the eight cartridges into the magazine. The inventor, who is an Australian, residing in Melbourne, writesWhen starting firing one has only to release the spring and it will force the cartridges into the breech. By working the magazine in the way described, fifty shots a minute can be fired, and no time is lost in re-charging the magazine, in addition to which cartridges can always be held in reserve when desired without using the cut off. I may explain that on the side of the weapon there is an appliance by which the magazine can be cut off, so that it may be used as an ordinary rifle, and the supply retained in the magazine for an emergency. The inventor points out in his letter that I have also a sight which can be fitted to the rifles with my magazine, which would make the LYNE) rifles at present in use equal to the new Service rifles. The ladder, when fitted, can be placed at any elevation, and cannot be knocked down if at an elevation of 1,800 yards. It has the vonier and wind-gauge, which can be simply worked and adjusted. In the ordinary rifle the ladder has to be do turned up, and it often happens that the the forerung which marks the number of yards falls down, with the result that the accuracy of the sight is interfered with. The inNAVAL I am prepared to allow the Defence DepartTARIFF ment to fix the patent on a number of rifles to give it a fair trial (which includes the magazine), and to give them any test they may think fit. Appended is a report received from the Commandant of Victoria, also replies to some objections raised. Trusting the report to be explicit in all detail. Yours obediently, JOHN H . MATTHEWS, Sgt., "" Z "" Co. 5th A.I.R. This is a remarkable invention.by a member of the Defence Force. I have seen it myself, so that I am able to express an opinion as to its value. Sergeant Matthews has already offered his patent to the Commonwealth Government, but has been told by the Minister of Defence that it cannot be accepted unless the British Government approve of it.",48
372,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"The militarv authorities have never done anything with inventions offered to them.  to the Imperial Government for our rifles, and I fail to see why we should not avail ourselves of any Australian invention calculated to improve them.

373,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"The authorities will give an inventor every chance to prove the effectiveness of his patent, but they invariably declare that he has not proved that it is of any value.  Prime Minister and the Ministry generally, I am confident that this man will be given a fair show.",48

My contention is that any man who claims that he has invented something that will make our weapons more effective than they are ought to receive every encouragement from the Department. Sergeant Matthews submitted his invention to the Commonwealth military authorities and ultimately received the following letter from Mr. S. A. Pethebridge, Acting Secretary of Defence:With reference to your letter of the 3rd of May last, relative to an improved magazine for Lee-Enfield rifle, I beg to inform you that the Commandant, Victoria, reports as follows :(1) After testing, it has been found that the magazine can be rapidly and simply discharged. (2) The drawback to this magazine is that it will only hold six cartridges, as against ten of the present pattern. (3) It was found, when loading after charging, the platform did not on all sions work up to enable the cartridges to be placed in the chamber, the form catch not working freely enough. (4) Special side pieces would have to be brazed or affixed to all magazines, which would be costlvIs it not absurd to say that the brazing of a piece of steel on to the magazine would be a costly process. The inventor says that it would cost only a few penceI consider that if the magazine would take ten or at least eight cartridges with the same method of charging, it would be a great improvement on the present pattern. Sergeant Matthews makes the following reply to the objections contained in this letter:2nd clause, re number of cartridges-The improved magazine is charged with eight cartridges. 3rd clause, re platform-The fault found in the platform not working freely has been overcome in present pattern. 4th clause, re build of magazine in reference to the brazed side pieces-It was not intended that the magazine would be made with brazed side .pieces, but could be stamped out in the required shape and size, and at a very low cost. This man has patented his magazine and sight in every country except Japan.

377,Mr SOLMON,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"Laanecoorie) [9.37] During the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa, I referred by way of interjection to the attitude taken up, not by the Ministry, but by the military authorities in respect to matters of this kind. I have had a very bitter experience in connection with an invention of a somewhat similar character which was submitted to the Department. A captain of one of our rifle clubs who had given a great deal of attention to the subject, invented a method of loading magazines which was reported by those who had had actual experience of it to be of very great value. The military authorities, howeve^ received it very coolly. Under instructions from the Minister of Defence occa- facilities were given the inventor to bring his patent under their notice, but the replat- ports in each case were against its adoption. I understand from the statement made by the honourable member for Maranoa that an invention that may prove of inestimable value has been submitted to the Department, but that the inventor, as usual, has received but scant encouragement. We all know that the inventor of the Brennan torpedo had to leave the country to achieve success elsewhere, and notwithstanding that, owing to the crass stupidity of responsible officers in our military organization, all kinds of inventions have been lost to us. I hope that the representative of the Minister of Defence will see that this invention is submitted to a fair trial.",49
378,Mr THOMA S,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"Barrier) [9.39] - I should like the Prime Minister to intimate when the reciprocity agreement with New Zealand is to be further considered. One of the items in the schedule-that relating to timber-ha s an, important bearing on the mining industry, and if steps are to be taken to ratify it we ought to be so informed. I hope that it will not be agreed to.",49
379,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,The Committee to which the agreement was referred by the New Zealand Legislature has not yet reported upon it.,49
380,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"I shall be very glad to know whether the Prime Minister intends to proceed further with the matter, and, if so, when?",49
381,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"Corio) [9.41]should like to again direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a matter which I brought under his notice some time ago. I have not yet received a reply to the inquiry I made on the occasion in question, and perhaps the honourable and learned gentleman has not had time to consider it. I refer to the question which I put to him as to the employment of Australians upon the subsidized war ships.",50
382,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,I have given consideration to that question.,50
383,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"On 16th August last I asked the Prime Minister1. What number of Australian officers and sailors were to be engaged in the Imperial subsidized Navy in Australia under the Naval Agreement ? 2. How many officers and men are engaged on such ships? 3. How many Australian officers and men are engaged on such ships? In reply; I was informed that the complement of these ships would be about 1,200, and Australia's proportion about 1,000. It was also stated that no Australian officers, but that 408 men, were engaged upon them. At this rate something like ten years will elapse before we shall obtain our proper complement. I was also informed by the Prime Minister thatThe Naval Commander in Chief has stated that "" the recruiting of Australian seamen is, of necessity, very gradual, and it is not possible to at once fill up to the full numbers authorized till those already serving have received sufficient training to allow of them replacing home-trained men."" One would think that a training extending over three years would be sufficient to enable them to replace the home-trained men. The Naval Agreement is only for ten years, and my desire is that the Prime Minister shall take action to protect the interests of Australians in connection with this matter. I am afraid that our efforts in this direction are being reduced to a farce, and that, as a matter of fact, the Imperial authorities do not desire Australians to be placed upon these vessels. About twelve months ago 160 men submitted themselves for examination. of them had been a fisherman for three years, and another, the son of a lighthouse keeper, who had lived by the seaside from his childhood, was anxious to enter upon a seafaring career. I can supply the Prime Minister with the names of four men who on the occasion in question submitted 1 themselves for examination. As a matter of fact 'the examination was of a purely perfunctory nature. The men simply were stripped to the waist and their chest measurements, as well as their height and age, taken. The chest measurement of men whose names I can supply, was, apparently, sufficient to comply with the regulations, but as yet they have not been engaged. I do not know whether it was due to the action taken by the Prime Minister that the following advertisement was published in the Age of Monday last:ROYAL NAVY. The following will be required by HMS. Psyche on arrival on Monday, the T7th inst. :13 Seamen. 0 6 Stokers, 2nd Class. 1 Engine-room Artificer, 4th Class. Applications should be made personally on board HMS. Psyche, at Port Melbourne. Further particulars may be obtained on application to Registrar, Royal Naval Reserve, Williamstown. W. R. CRESWELL, Captain, Registrar R.N.R. Among those who responded to this advertisement was a man who has been engaged as a fisherman for three years, and who knows as much about boats as a man who has not been to sea could be expected to know. As soon as he was handed over to the recruiting officer he was asked, "" Why don't you join the Naval Brigade?"" He was not submitted to any medical examination, but was simply asked his name, address, and occupation, and was told that he would be communicated with in due course. Was the advertisement a farce, or is the Prime Minister going to take action to see that the agreement is properly carried out, so that the expenditure now being incurred in this direction by the Commonwealth and New Zealand may result in the training of men who will form the nucleus of an Australian naval force? I* am glad to have been able to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister facts which deserve, and, I am sure, will receive, his attention. So far as the man's One attendance today is concerned, I am speaking only from his information supplied to me; but my knowledge of him leads me to believe that information. Inquiries should be made, and reasons should be furnished why his ambition, and that of many other Australians to serve in the Australian Navy cannot be gratified.",50
384,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"Wentworth) [9.46] Every one who supports the idea of an Australian Navy, and is anxious for the extension of Australian national sentiment in that regard, will regret that an honorget able and learned member, under the guise of trying to push ahead this, in some ways, very laudable ambition, has made insinuaExternal tions as to the integrity of a people and a Government to whom ' we owe much, and as to the honesty of the British naval officers on this stacharge tion. The bona fides of an advertisement in the daily press has, on the honourable and learned member's own admission, called into question merely on hearsay dence,, ancl the benefits accruing to tralia from - the Naval Agreement and the Agreement itself, have been dragged through the mud on the mere statebefore ment of "" a man who is said to know something about boats."" I do not that conduct of this kind will benefit Australian Navy agitation or the honourable try, and learned member for Corio. We have petty to on many occasions been told that efforts are being made by Great Britain to evade duty. the responsibilities and ignore the principles underlying the Agreement; but any one who cares to examine the facts himself will see that the statements will not bear investigation.  such charges.",51
385,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"No ; and no sane man portunities would believe them. The making of these charges over and over again does not flect credit upon the honourable and learned member for Corio or the cause which he and others espouse. In view of the statements which have been made, I recomothers mend the Prime Minister to ascertain many Australians are serving as officers, not only under the Naval Agreement, but in the Imperial Navy generally. A large number of men of my own acquaintance are doing so, the service being one of most honourable in which anv man could serve. The information which I suggest should be procured would be easily obtainshall able from the Admiralty, and its publication will do good. I have never looked at the Agreement from the narrow, selfish point of view, trying to determine the exact value of the monetary quid fro quo; but those who care to do so, and wish to know prenoa cisely the advantages which Australia obtains under it, should be interested to hear that, while our contribution is only about ,£200,000 a year, the British authorities spend £700,000 per annum, or three times as much, in Australia, and, in addition, we a large number of men trained in the finest naval service in .the world.",51
386,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"Ballarat-Minister of Affairs [9.50] - I have recently looked through the figures relating to the 'employment of Australian seamen under' the Naval Agreement, though I cannot my memory with the exact number now employed upon the training ships. It is true that there are a number of vacanbeen cies on board, but most of them are evinot for ordinary A.B.'s. but artisans Ausand others whom it is almost impossible to obtain in Australian ports. I hope to inform honourable members the end of the session of a proposal now under .consideration, which thinkwill allow Australians now serving the under the Naval Agreement to go through the technical schools in the mother counfit themselves for the duties of officers, and procure advancement according to their abilities and devotion to  for great value to Australia.",51
387,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"I think so. The men who go Home will do so voluntarily, and will greatly benefit both themselves and Australia by taking advantage of the opoffered. If the honourable and learned member for Corio has not received' rea reply to his request for information, there has been some oversight. The figures to which I have referred were not prepared in response to his inquiry, but came before me which, speaking how from memory, were intended for him. As to the New Zealand preferential proposals, the Committee of Trade and In- dustry is to report to the House of Representatives to-night, andprobably to the morrow's newspapers will contain telegrams showing how the agreement is regarded by its members. If approved, I expect to receive very shortly an inti-"" mation from the Government of the Colony as to the date when the treaty will probably, be assented to by them. I shall have pleasure in looking into the matter to' which the honourable member for Marahas called attention. The hesitancy: of the local military authorities to adopt innovations, no matter how promising, is due to the fact that we are continually receiving supplies of arms from Great Britain.  an attachment to the present rifle.",51
388,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ANDUNITE D,"We cannot, of course, afford to lose touch with the improvements made at Home from time to time, but, no doubt, the attachment to which the honourable member refers is especially worthy of consideration. He asks, not for its universal adoption, but for a fair test, to encourage men of ability to use and give us the benefit of their brains. In all attempts at mechanical invention, more failures than successes must be expected; but every likely invention should be thoroughly tested. If the testing costs a few pounds, the money will be well spent, because of the possibility of an occasional brilliant discovery. I shall ask my Honourable colleague to view the matter in this light, and am sure that he will be pleased to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at g.54 p.m.",52
