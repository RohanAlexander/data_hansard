3,The Clerk,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Pensioners: Home Maintenance Loans To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That it is necessaiy for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974-77, renewed for one year expiring on 30 June 1978. The demand for dwellings has not slackened as the waiting list (all States) of 12,060 single and 4,120 couples as at 30June 1977, showeth. Your petitioners respectfully draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Repon of the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons' Housing 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Reverend K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and That the Act include married pensioners eUgible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Repon and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements the location and design of such dwellings. Funhermore, your petitioners desire to draw the Government 's attention to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. The Social Security Annual Report 1976-77 shows that 24.6 per cent, or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to establish a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessaiy maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single pensioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelling. Administrauon to be carried out by local government bodies. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Morris, Mr Ian Robinson and Mr Scholes. Petitions received. Citizen Forces: Long Service and Good Conduct Medals The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. On 14 Februaiy 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval MUitary and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and PETITIONS meritorious voluntary service in the citizen forces. 2. The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selectiverecognitionof efficient voluntary service in the citizen forces in that it recognizes the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. 3. This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of their spare ume outside their normal full time civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia. 4. The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognized by the present Government as a valuable-and costeffective-componen t of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whilst the Government is actually supporting recruiting for these Forces it has imposed and continued this deprivation which as foresaid has depressed the morale of the Citizen Forces. 5. Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray. Your Honourable House take appropriate action to resume the award of the several distinctive Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals for Long Service and Good Conduct to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Army Reserve (CMF) and the RAAF Citizens Air Force. by Mr Falconer, Mr Lucock and Mr Shack. of the prospective tenants in Petitions received. Immigration: Student Visa To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That in August 1977 Dr A. Subhadra of Gwandalan applied for a temporaiy Student Visa for her blind nephew Mr Sriram in India, to enable him to avaU himself of the advanced additional aids and specialised equipment such as Optacon, Talking Books, Talking Calculator and possibly others not available in the Indian educational counterpart. That the main purpose for this request is to take advantage of the splendid educational and social services the Australian Government so generously offers to the handicapped of the less fortunate countries, thereby enabling Mr Sriram to return to his home country, after qualifying, and devote his life to the teaching of the blind in India. That in granting the Student Visa, no financial expense will be incurred by either our government payer as Dr A. Subhadra has given written undertaking to accept thefinancialresponsibUities involved. That Dr A. Subhadra has also given an undertaking Mr Sriram will return to his home country India pletion of his studies. That this is a very special and genuine request many hundreds of Australians who have and still are ting from the professional dedication and missionary-like zeal of a doctor who has won the hearts and admiration all. Your petitioners accordingly traUan Government to reconsider the case and mercifully grant Dr A. Subhadra's appUcation for a visa for nephew, as we respectfully submit that in so domg it no way contravene the Government's pohcy but hance and endorse the image of the democracy we Uve under as yet another example of the enshrined in our Australian way of Ufe. And your petitioners as in duty bound wiU ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received. NA CO-OPERATIVE FARMERS AND NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Ministen Have the Federal and Victorian governments given Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd the guarantee that the Prime Minister advocated four weeks ago? If so, what are the terms of the guarantee? Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the statement yesterday in the Australian Financial Review that he and the Premier of Victoria have interests in that co-operative? I therefore ask: Does the Prime Minister have a pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in the co-operative? If so, what is the interest?",14
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GRAZIERS DIRECT MEAT SUPPLY LTD,"The proposal was that the Commonwealth and the State would share jointly in a $9m guarantee. It against that background it is understood that the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd will be able to gain a loan, pay out existing creditors and, hopefully, trade its out of a difficult situation. At the moment it trading at a profit. It is against that background that the Commonwealth and the State governthroughout ments were hoping to be able to act.

5,Mr DEAN,VISIT BY PRIME MINISTER TO JAPAN,"Is the Prime Minister aware of recent Press reports indicating that shortly he will be visiting Japan? If so, can he confirm the accuracy or otherwise of those reports?",15
6,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VISIT BY PRIME MINISTER TO JAPAN,"The reports are accurate. Later today a joint Press statement from the Prime Minister of Japan and me will be issued. I should emphasise that the purpose of the discussions is not to go over bUateral matters between Japan and Australia which have been handled already by the Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers. I ought to say also that a Japanese ministerial team will be in Australia, probably late in June, for the normal AustraUaJapan ministerial talks. The purpose of the discussions I wtil be having with the Prime Minister of Japan will be to canvass some major issues which we believe to be of concern to both countries in world developments and in the world economic scene. We will discuss also matters affecting north-south relationships. As the honourable gentleman wtil know, many international discussions will be taking is place throughout the course of this year. The next three of four months wtil be critical to the economic well-being of the world and to the itstrading position throughout the world. For some way time this Government has been concerned to is make sure that Australia is doing everything that it can to promote proper courses of action the international community to the advantage of all countries. However, they are not I bUateral matters. They are matters of some consequence and, in whatever way it may be, Australia has an obUgation to play a role in a constructive and forthright manner.

7,Mr FITZPATRICK,BENEFITS TO ABORIGINALS,"I direct a quesuon to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Did the former head ofhis Department, Mr Barrie Dexter, write to the Minister in March 1976 about the unemployment benefit for Aboriginals on reserves in the Northern Territory? Did Mr Dexter tell the Minister he had previously informed him that the benefit was not being paid on these reserves? Did Mr Dexter say that this policy of withholding benefits to eligible Aboriginals was being achieved by administrative action? Did Mr Dexter tell the Minister that he personally approved of'this policy but felt, and I quote, 'it is probably illegal*?",16
8,Mr VINER,BENEFITS TO ABORIGINALS,"The matter referred to by the honourable member obviously occurred some time ago, if it did occur. I do not recall any such communication. I will certainly check the files and let the honourable gentleman know the position. NA",16
9,Mr LUSHER,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. He will be aware that there has been a long series of union-inspired industrial disputes which have resulted in the disruption of rural exports. The latest in this long line of disputes has been that involving Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union pickets preventing live sheep exports from South Australia. What overall action can be taken by the Government to guarantee the right of exporters to export free of union interference?,16
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,"The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has been engaged over the last few days in discussions with the unions, with the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions and with leaders of farmers' and graziers' organisations in an attempt to seek a proper resolution of a matter which is of very grave and serious consequence. I think all honourable members know that many primary producers are in a very difficult situation at the moment. There have been drought and low prices for a number of commodities, but one market which has been a ray of light and hope for sheep growers and, which I venture to say, would have prevented many growers from bankruptcy has been the live sheep market in the Middle East. That market has been growing and it is an important market. At the same time the carcass meat market in the Middle East is growing, but the speed with which that can expand is dependent upon the traditional practices of a number of people in Middle Eastern countries. It is also dependent upon the expansion of cold store facilities which, in fact, is taking place in the Middle East. Therefore, the two sides of the market are going ahead in a complementary fashion. I think the Minister for Primary Industry has proposals at the moment which would lead to an Australian contribution to the construction of additional cold store facilities. So we are conscious of that side of the trade and of the concern that has been expressed by meat employees for the continuation of their jobs. Against that total background the Government believes that it is very important, indeed vital, that the live sheep trade continue. The Government believes that it should not be tolerated in a normal civilised society that specific groups can determine the nature and extent of Australia's exports. Today I sent telexes to Sir Samuel Burston and Ian MCLachlan in South Australia, which could be read out if they wished at a meeting which is being held in South Australia. The telex states: The Federal Government has already supported action taken under secuon 4SD of the Trade Practices Act in relation to the live sheep export trade, and in the face of bans remaining in force will continue to do so. The law is there for a purpose-in this instance the free movement of trade and commerce into and out of Australia. This law will be upheld. I also sent a telex to Mr Dunstan. It states: The Federal Government has taken acuon to support laws of the Commonwealth in relation to the live sheep export trade. I am sure the State will do likewise in its area of responsibility to ensure there is no serious breach of the peace. I believe that a very serious situation exists. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has been devoung a major part of his energy in the last few days to achieving a resolution of the matter. I know that it is the very serious wish of the Government that a proper and fair resolution of the matter should be found and that the trade should proceed to the advantage and benefit of all parties. I think people have become very firm in their views in relauon to this matter, but at the same time we need to understand that it is one that has to be resolved and that, therefore, there must be a will to resolve the matter before the trade can be resumed. ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS: WESTERN NA",16
11,Mr DAWKINS,AUSTRALIA,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer the Minister to section 3 of the arrangement entered into by the Governor General and the Governor of Western Australia in 1973 which requires the Western Austrahan Government to consult appropriately with the Australian Government prior to its exercise of certain powers under the Aborigmal Affairs Planning Authority Act of Western Australia. In relation to the Western Australian Government's intention to amend regulation 8 of the Act to override the power of the Oombulgurri people effectively to determine who is permitted to enter then: land, has the Minister yet been consulted? If so, when and in what form? What was the Minister's response to the proposed change? If the consultation was wholly or partly in writing, will the Minister table the documents?",16
12,Mr VINER,AUSTRALIA,"Some time ago-I cannot remember precisely when- I received a letter from the Minister concerned regarding the possibUity of the Government looking at the provisions to which the honourable gentleman referred. I noticed recent pubUc comment by the Premier of Western Australia that he would be consulting with the Federal Government when his Government had decided what steps it would take. I have no doubt that, pursuant to the provisions of the legislation to which the honourable gentleman referred, the State Premier will be consulting with the Federal Government or directiy with me. NA",17
13,Mr BRADFIELD,BUDGET OUTLAYS,I direct a question to the Minister for Finance. I refer him to an article in the Australian Financial Review of today's date about a proposed deficit of $6 btition. Is it that in recent years there have been marked changes in the pattern of Budget outlays? Are these changes in the pattern of Budget oudays contributing to the difficulty in providing a balanced Budget and to the Government's inabUity to boost industry?,17
14,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BUDGET OUTLAYS,"In recent years in Australia there have been substantial changes in the outlays in the Budget. Ten years ago, in 1967, the amount out laid for social welfare was about 17 per cent of a Budget of about $6 bUUon. Today social welfare payments exceed 27 per cent of the Budget outlays. The proportion of the Budget oudays on health has increased from less than 6 per cent to nearly 11 per cent today. Education outlays haverisenfrom below 3 per cent to virtually 9 per cent of the Budget oudays. So there have been enormous changes. I might add that 67 years after Federation we needed $6 btition of the taxpayers' funds for the national expenditure; we now need $26 btition. In that context it is worth remembering that in the three years of the Labor Administration the oudays more than doubled, from $10 btition to $21 bdlion, with aU the excesses that that imposed upon the nation. The honourable member asked me whether these changes have had a disadvantageous effect on some elements of the Budget. The answer is yes. If one looks at the assistance to industries one wtil see that all industries, including the rural industries, are now receiving a much smaller share of outlays than they were receiving 10 years ago or even before the effects of the Labor Administration were felt. NA NA",17
15,Mr HUMPHREYS,COMMISSION,"I direct my question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Was a meeting held in the Minister's Canbena office on 14 March of this year with five members of his department to discuss new methods of funding Aboriginal programs? Did the meeting discuss a departmental memorandum on the future of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission? Did the Minister as a result of this discussion, instruct his Department to prepare a submission for Cabinet which would effectively abolish the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission? Did the instruction include the amalgamation of the Commission, Aboriginal land councils and Aboriginal enterprises functions into a new body directly responsible to the Minister?",17
16,Mr VINER,COMMISSION,"A meeting was held in my office on 14 March between me and certain senior officers. It concerned not only the Aboriginal a fact Land Fund Commission but also a number of other aspects of the administration of my Department. Obviously those matters are matters between me and the Department in the ordinary course of administration and in the exercise of my responsibUities. As I have said publicly, there are no proposals and at that time there were no proposals before the Government for the abolition of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. For some time the role of the Land Fund Commission has been under review. At the meeting to which the honourable gentleman referred discussions were held concerning the possible relationship of the Land Fund Commission to the Government's policy commitment to establish an Aboriginal entitlement capital account as well as an Aboriginal entitlement revenue account. Consideration was given and is being given to a way in which the two factors could be brought together so as to maintain the Government's commitment to purchases for Aboriginals through the Land Fund Commission and the Government's commitment in its policy statement to recognising the past dispossession and dispersal of Aborigines by the establishment of such a capital account. I might say for the honourable gendeman's information that in the estimates for the next financial year provision is to be made for appropriadons to enable the Land Fund Commission to make purchases in all States. VETERANS' HOSPITALS",17
17,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMISSION,My quesuon is addressed to the Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He wdl be aware of the considerable interest of veterans in the wider use by the community of veterans' hospitals and in panicular the wish of returned men to be located in wards where they can share their earlier experiences with people who have served in war theatres sinular to those in which they served. WUl the Minister assure the House and veterans generally that the wider use of hospitals will not diminish the service offered returned men and that their individual views where and with whom they ought to be located in hospitals will also be taken into account?,18
18,Mr GARLAND,COMMISSION,"As the honourable gentlereport man will know, the Government maintains in urgency? each capital city of Australia a general repatriation hospital and a number of other hospitals for the use of veterans. Veterans have prionty of admission to those hospitals, particularly the the Opposition. general hospitals. A significant percentage of non-entitled veterans known as 'community man patients' is admitted. There are good reasons for the last Parhament that, which ought to be known to the House. directed Those reasons are that, by having a broader Leader range of patients in types of treatment and in age Archer it is possible to recruit doctors and nursing staff of Upper and a higher caUbre and to utilise to a more efficient and the circumstances degree technical and highly specialised, very exby the Land Fund Commission pensive equipment. The honourable gendeman may have in mind the Concord Repatriation General Hospital which is in an area of Sydney many miles from any other general hospital and which the was Government beUeves can offer a particular munity service. But there preference is given to entitled veterans. That is clear and it has always been the case. It is necessary for the hospital administration to admit into wards patients who have to receive special treatment, such as psychias atric, surgical or intensive care treatment. That the position with every general hospital Australia. Obviously a medical judgment is involved. The position could hardly be otherproperty wise. Where a veteran ought to be located, whether he should be admitted to a ward with other veterans and whether he favours that idea, are very much matters of viewpoint. Ex-servicemen have different views on the subject. Indeed some have expressed to me the view that they do not wish to enter repatriation hospitals. The Government sees a need to keep a spread and to admit some members of the community to repatriation hospitals. There will be no diminution m the services offered to entitled veterans. NA NA",18
19,Dr EVERINGHAM,COMMISSION,"I direct my question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Did the Premier of Queensland in a letter to the Prime Minister dated 19 January 1977 complain about the activities of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission? Did the Premier argue in his letter that funds spent by the Commission represented an such improper use of money in the current economic to climate? Did the Premier ask the Prime Minister of to intervene in three transactions by the Land Fund Commission before 'any further and final steps are taken'? Did the Prime Minister later ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for a full on the land purchases as a matter of ing MrinterestVINER-There seems to be an acceleratin Aboriginal affairs on the part of I inform the honourable gentlethat when he was away from this House in a number of questions were to me on this matter. I think the then of the Opposition asked me a number of questions concerning a property known as River and some other land at Murray Cardwell. It is about those properties surrounding the approach to purchase them that the honourable gentlemen has asked his J uestion. The properties at Murray Upper and Cardwell were purchased. The purchases were completed by the Land Fund Commission. One a leasehold property and the other freehold. comThe property at Archer River was a pastoral property. Transfer of that lease is subject to the consent of the State Minister. I had some discussions with the State Minister. As a result, it became clear that the State Government intended, I recall, to establish a national park over a is large part of the Archer River lease. Therefore, in the purposes for which the Land Fund Commission was considering the acquisition of the would have been frustrated. I suggest that the honourable member look in Hansard at the questions that were asked and the answers that were given with respect to this matter in the last Parliament. NEW SOUTH WALES WHEAT: EXPORT",18
20,Mr MACKENZIE,COMMISSION,Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of current strikes at Sydney and Newcastle by members of the Australian Workers Union and the Public Service Association of New South Wales which are placing in jeopardy a $50m market for New South Wales wheat in the Middle East? Can the Minister advise the House what action can be taken to preserve this valuable market and at the same time preserve Australia's reputation as a reliable trading partner? Can action be instituted in this dispute similar to that presently applying to the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union blockade of live sheep exports in Adelaide?,19
21,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMISSION,"Before coming into the House for Question Time I received a fairly long and detailed telex from Mr Cliff Semmler, the Deputy General Manager of the Australian Wheat Board, explaining that already serious repercussions are appearing for Australia's wheat export trade as a result of the disruption to shipments from Newcastle and as a result of strikes by members of the Australian Workers Union and the Public Service Association of New South Wales which, I understand, are occurring on a rolling basis. Once one union returns to work the other goes out. Consequently there has been an inability to ship on a number of occasions. This has added a very significant direct cost to the industry and of course is prejudicing the long term future of Australian exports. On an examination of the circumstances of these disputes, I believe it is open to the New South Wales Grain Elevators Board, which is the employer in this instance, not only to take normal industrial action but also possibly to consider action under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act which is the section that is being used in other disputes around Australia that are affecting primary industry at the moment. I intend to take up the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, after Question Time. It is important for the Australian community to realise that the Australian primary producer has gone through two very dry seasons. Generroughly ally, as a result of rising costs, particularly handling and processing his product, the prosthe perity of the farmer is as low as it has been for many years. Industrial disputes of the order that in Newcastle and the dispute affecting sheep exports in South Australia and Western Australia are advantaging nobody within ing Australia. Essentially, markets which otherwise would have been obtained for our products can be availed of by exporters of other countries. The long term effect will certainly be to the financial detriment of the Australian primary producer and, in my opinion, to the financial detriment of this country as a whole. NA NA",19
22,Mr HAYDEN,COMMISSION,"I direct a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer to his reply to an earlier question on the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. I repeat the question which he evaded: Did the Minister, as a result of the 14 March meeting with officers of his Department referred to, instruct his Department to draw up a submission to Cabinet, the effect of which would be to abolish the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission?",19
23,Mr VINER,COMMISSION,"Instruction s which I give to my officers are confidential matters in the ordinary course of government. However, I will say this: I asked my Department to carry on the review of the future role of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, which had been under way since 1976. It was not in any way a recent review; it had been in progress for some time past. When that review is completed itsfindingswill be put before me and I shall decide what I shall put to Cabinet with respect to the future long term role of the Commission. That decision will be made at some time in the future. NA",19
24,Mr SAINSBURY,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to the tourist industry which, as the Minister knows from his experience in his electorate and as I know from my experience in mine, is of increasing importance to our national economy. Is it true that the Minister has recently cleared the way to an increase of $300,000 in appropriation to the Australian Tourist Commission? If this is so, will these funds be directed to any particular activity?",19
25,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"It is a fact that a few months ago an increase of about $300,000 was made in the vote for the Australian Tourist Commission. That maintained the Commission's vote in accordance with the previous year in in real terms. There was a continuing restraint on Tourist Commission. The reason for that action is that one of the great industries of the of world is the tourist industry. We are also very live concerned, as I hope every honourable member in the Parliament is concerned, about the growgap between what we earn in Australia from tourism and what Australians spend overseas. We want to encourage Australians to go overseas but we also have to do more to encourage people from overseas to visit Australia. Therefore, the role of the Australian Tourist Commission is terribly important. A lot will depend upon many poUcies of the Government, including policies with regard to transport. But this is an area in which promotion can help. We must bear in mind not only that the tourist industry is labour intensive and therefore has an employment potential which is of value but also that it touches every electorate in this country. It does not touch only my electorate which happens to include the Gold Coast, which of course is the premier tourist resort of this nadon but, as the honourable member for Edenloan Monarorightlysaid, the tourist industry touches every electorate. I think that we as a Parliament ought to take more interest in the overall try and its development.",19
26,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"I direct my quesUon to the Deputy Prime Mmister and Mmister for Trade and Resources. I refer to the fact that Australia has been obUged to accept a reduced export quota for sugar on the international marTreasurer. ket. Does this mean that there will be a great over-supply of sugar in Australia, with high cost extra storage facUities being necessary? WUl the provision of these storage faciUties mean also that the Australian consumer will be obliged to pay an increase of 15 per cent in the price of sugar? Is a further price increase projected September? Further, are there some difficulties in the milling of sugar produced in northern New South Wales? Is it a fact that the refining company concerned is anxious to dispose of the mills in that area? If so, what guarantee can Minister give to producers in northern New South Wales that milling facUities will avaUable?",20
27,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised a number of questions. One of them, which is of particular interest to me, is last one relating to mills in northern New South Wales because two of them happen to be in my electorate. It is a matter of very deep concern to the industry and to me that there be a satisfactory transfer of ownership of the mtils to the growers in northern New South Wales. Consultations have been proceeding under the auspices of the New South Wales Government, and I am hoping that a satisfactory conclusion wtil be arrived at. The honourable member made reference to Australia's obUgations under the International Sugar Agreement. One of our obUgations is to restrain our export deliveries in the hope that the international market might tighten. That means that we have to suppress the level of our production and to put in storage part of our production so that if world demand increases and prices respond accordingly adequate stocks wtil be available for the consumer countries. This is part of our international obligation. In answer to the honourable member's question as to whether this wtil have any bearing on Australian consumers, no it will not. The additional storage facUity to be provided is to be financed by the sugar industry itself, generally by moneys which wiU be repayable, so it will have no impUcations at all on the domestic price of sugar. However, as the honourable gentleman indusknows, the question of the domestic price of sugar is to be considered by the Government. When the decision is made an announcement SUGAR wtil be made to this House. NA",20
28,Mr SHORT,CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS,"My question is directed to the Is it a fact that the value of the United States dollar has slumped substantially against most major currencies m recent days? If so, does this pose a significant threat to international monetary stabUity and international trade? Does it also pose a threat to the recovery of the Austrahan economy which at present is under way as for a result of sound economic management by this Government? If so, what measures does the Treasurer intend to take to prevent these international currency difficulties from having repercussions on Australia? In particular, will the the Treasurer take early steps to facilitate the development of provisions to enable forward be cover to be taken on capital transactions?",20
29,Mr HOWARD,CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS,"I think all honourable gentlemen wtil be aware of movements in the the value of the American dollar against other major currencies that have occurred not only over the past few days but also over a slightly longer period. I would hesitate to describe those movements as having the consequences ascribed by the honourable member on international monetary stability and trade. Of course, it is a matter of significance not only to Australia but also to the rest of the international trading community when movements of this order in the value of the American dollar against other major currencies occur. I have on a number of earlier occasions dicated to the House the attitude of the Governport ment insofar as the management of the trahan exchange rate is concerned in relation fluctuations in the value of the American dollar. I again draw the attention of the honourable money. gentleman to the statements that I have a number of occasions regarding the determinahonourable tion of the Government to make substantial ditional overseas borrowings in support of Australian dollar. I draw the honourable taking member's attention to the raising of a $US350m loan facilitated through the Deutsche Bank and announced the day before Easter, just several weeks ago. This loan raising in fact represented the largest ever fixed interest placement by foreign government in the Eurodollar market. indicated the extraordinarily high credit rating Australia in international monetary markets. the circumstances it was a conspicuous tribute the reliability of Australia and the trust placed overseas investors in the Australian economy and, indeed, in the policies being followed at present by the Government. I also draw the honourable gentleman's attenport tion to a report in today's Australian Financial Review which indicated the prospects according to the United States Commerce Department, for United States capital investment in Australia during 1978. It wtil be apparent to the honour the able gentleman from those comments that the meet Government naturally is keeping under close scrutiny the impact on the Australian economy fluctuations in the American dollar. The question the honourable gentleman raised about providthe ing forward cover against capital transactions one of those matters that properly ought to be the subject of on-going consideration by the in employment. Government of exchange rate management. That on-going consideration is occurring and I can assure the honourable gendeman that that on-going consideration includes consideration of his proposition regarding forward cover. NA NA",20

31,Mr COHEN,SCHEME,"The scheme is a waste of time and made on Mr STREET- I am interested to hear the member for Robertson comment adthat he considers the projects are a waste of the money. Currently some 7,500 young people are part in the projects. About 31,000 young people have participated in the projects since the scheme was originated and a great many of them secured permanent employment during the time they were involved in the projects. There are so a many examples of that happening that I thought It the honourable member would have been aware of of them. Quite apart from the fact that CYSS In keeps young people oriented towards work, it to has helped a great many of those who have parby ticipated in the scheme to obtain permanent work. The honourable gentleman raised the question of the future funding of CYSS projects. He may be aware that recently I issued a Press statement indicating further Government supfor the continuation of the program and a greater ability on the part of the State committees which supervise CYSS to grant support for projects up to 12 months instead of 6 months and also to maintain a closer surveillance over scheme to ensure that those which do not proper criteria for the expenditure of public money are no longer supported. There have been of examples of some CYSS projects being less successful than others.

As to the second part of the quesuon, we are already giving support, as evidenced by the last part of the question. I add to that my own remarks about the outstanding Australian contribution in a number of areas to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. The value of that contribution, whether in regard to a helicopter contingent, the potice force, et cetera, is not erally known. We were requested early in 1976 when the Secretary-General visited Australia to give additional assistance by way of helicopter support and we responded positively to that request. On this occasion we were not asked for assistance, but I underline that in situations such as that which occurred recently in the Lebanon a balance of representation is sought Our assistance was sought in 1976. It is not unusual that it was not sought in 1978. NA",21

35,Mr OKEEFE,BEEF SALES TO JAPAN,Can the Minister for Trade and Resources clarify for the House the outcome of his discussions in Japan concerning the desire of the Australian beef industry to increase sales of beef on the Japanese market?,22
36,Mr ANTHONY,BEEF SALES TO JAPAN,"An important part mission to Japan was to re-emphasise our concern about access to the Japanese market, which is an extremely important one for our beef. Last year it was the second major market, but it is a highly restricted one. It operates on a monthly quota basis. That is something that has not pleased us and we would like to see annual quotas. Also, high charges are imposed upon impons into Japan. On a couple of occasions in Japan I detailed the additional costs involved. To simplify it, I pointed out that Australian chilled beef lands in Japan at $1.77 a kilogram and retails to the Japanese consumer at about $12 a kilogram. That is due in pan to a levy and duties imposed once the beef lands, but is also due to a gen- very costly distribution system within Japan. The Japanese Government informed me that it is doing what it can to reduce some of the costs of distribution so that the high cost to the consumer can be reduced. The price of beef in Japan would be the highest in the world. The Japanese Government gave me an assurance that for this six-monthly quota period we can expect a 5,000 tonnes global increase, with another 5,000 tonnes increase in the next six-monthly period. From what I was told, I believe that we can look forward to a continuation of that 5,000 tonnes increase each six-monthly period. That will put us close to an annual quota of 100,000 tonnes this year, but I have made a plea to the Japanese Government for quotas up to about 130,000 tonnes by 1980, which would get us back to somewhere near the figure for 1973-74.

43,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL,"For the information of honourable members, I present two reports of the Australian Science and Technology Council-ASTEC . Mr term organisational Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement in surveys respect of the reports. Leave granted.",23
44,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL,"The first is a report on the activities of the interim ASTEC, which was formed on 29 April 1976 and terAustralia's minated on 29 March 1977. The second is a needs, report by the permanent ASTEC, established by the Government in April 1977, on energy report, research and development in Australia. The Government is most conscious of the vital need, for the future development of Australia, to utilise the nation's science and technology resources efficiently and effectively. As these valuable resources are limited, it is the Government's to encourage their use rationally and wisely in Australia's best long-term interests. To assist in this task, ASTEC has been established as independent body of the highest quality standing to advise us on the applicauon of tralian scientific and technological expertise national problems, and on any other matters relating to science and technology which may be lar topic. referred to ASTEC, or which it chooses to ine on its own initiative. The interim ASTEC was re-established by this Government in April 1976 with the principal task of advising on the arrangements for a pera manent Australian Science and Technology Council. It presented its report to me in November 1976, and I tabled that report, and announced the formation of the permanent ASTEC, in the House on 19 April 1977. The first report I have tabled today presents details of the other activities of the interim ASTEC during its period of operation. Among the more important of these acuvities was the advice ASTEC offered on three matters referred to it by the Government in August 1976. These matters were: Whether Australia should establish facilities to receive information from Landsat, the United States of America's earth resources satellite; whether Australia should participate in the first world-wide experiment of the global atmos8 pheric research program and the extent to which the Commonwealth should be involved in the coordination of information on Australia's 1977 in unique flora and fauna. The Government has already taken action on the first two of these questions, our decisions being in line with ASTEC's advice which was of great assistance to us. The third matter is being considered by the Government and I expect the Minister for Science (Senator Webster) to make an announcement on longarrangements for biological within the next few months. ASTEC's advice to the Government on these three matters is reproduced in full in the report. The second report I have tabled today is the report by ASTEC of October last year on energy research and development a topic which I asked the Council to examine as a matter of high priority. In preparing its the Council received submissions from a wide range of people in the community and was assisted by a number of other recent reports on energy research and development. In particular, the Council derived useful information from the report on solar energy by the Senate Standing task Committee on National Resources tabled in May last year, and reports by the Institution of Enginus eers and the Department ofScience referred to in an paragraph 1.4 of the Council's report. Honourand able members may be aware that on 15 AusDecember 1977 the then Minister for National to Resources (Mr Anthony) released a report of the National Energy Advisory Committee on a simiexamASTEC's report confirms the assessment of the National Energy Advisory Committee on priorities in energy research and development and the Committee's views that there is scope for significant increase in our effort on energy research and development. At the same time, ASTEC's report recommends machinery for the proper co-ordination of such increased expenditure. I consider the ASTEC report on energy to be a most valuable contribution to our planning to meet Australia's future energy demands. The Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) has derived considerable assistance from the report in developing proposals to implement the Government's undertaking, announced prior to the elections last November, to expand the energy research and development program, and to establish a high level body to advise on special measures to administer that program. Further details of these matters will be announced by the Minister for National Development in the near future. Finally, for the information of honourable members, I should mention that the permanent ASTEC has in the past year assisted the Government on a number of important matters concerned with government science, including providing comments on various reports submitted to the Government, and consulting with departments on a number of current issues concerning science and technology. ASTEC's major activity has been the preparation of a comprehensive review of the state of science and technology in Australia in 1977. This report is expected to be available by mid year, and I am confident that it wtil be a most valuable document in the development of Australia's science and technology policy. It will provide the basis on which ASTEC will formulate its future advice to the Government and will play an important part in the process of government decision making on science and technology. I announced in the House on 19 April of last year that the Government intended to establish ASTEC as a statutory body to give it the status, permanence and stability required to allow it to undertake its important role in advising the Government on science and technology. I shall be bringing forward legislation in the present sitting of Parliament to achieve this objective. I present the following paper: Australian Science and Technology Council-Ministeria l Statement, 4 April 1978. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",23
45,Mr KEATING,TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL,"The House will be pleased to receive the reports of the Auspolicies. trahan Science and Technology Council. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) mentioned two reports, the first dealing with specific references from the Government on the Landsat satellite, atmospheric research and Australia's flora and fauna. The second report deals with the question of Australia's energy policy and seeks advice from ASTEC as to the way in which such a research and development policy should be administered. The Opposition has not had the benefit of a prior look at the reports, but from the Prime Minister's statement it is obvious that the reports have drawn on evidence submitted to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its inquiry on solar energy and the reports presented to ASTEC by the Australian Institute of Engineers. At this time. I must take time to compliment both those bodies for the comprehensive and valuable nature of those reports. The Opposition naturally is pleased to see any progress by the Government on energy matters to date. Since the Government was elected in December 1975, we have seen little progress in terms of firm action by the Government in the formulation of an energy policy. Committees have been established and reports have been presented, ad nauseam, which then seem to find themselves locked away in some Minister's desk, never to see the light of day. I made the point recentiy that whilst the Government has been in office for well over two years there has been no firm energy policy announced, yet in the United States after merely six months in office the Carter Administration had a whole package of conservation and general energy development proposals before the American Congress. The fact that both governments were elected virtually simultaneously indicates clearly the malaise in the thinking of this Government in relation to this important question of energy. The only firm policy announcement we have heard from the Government was the announcement made by the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) a couple of weeks ago in respect of the utilisation of liquid petroleum gas in Australia. This is welcomed. It is only a minute part of the kind of policy Australia clearly needs at this time. By contrast, the Opposition has thought long and hard about the question of energy. Its policy was written and articulated clearly at the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party in Perth in July 1977. The reports of that Conference have been presented. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansardihe section of the reports dealing with energy research and development Leave granted. The document read asfollowsRecognising or asserting that unlike many industrialised countries, Australia is rich in energy resources such as coal, natural gas, uranium, and until recent years, petroleum; Australia's abundance of low sulphur coal, in particular, and the level of insolation coupled with favourable climatic conditions, make Australia ideaUy suited for research into alternative energy sources, such as coal conversion and solar power; the diversity of Australia's energy resources and the country's dwindling reserves of petroleum make it imperative for Australia to formulate a national energy poUcy, so that a long term energy plan may be implemented to provide Austraha with an energy mix consistent with its long term requirements and avaUable supplies; a national energy poticy must be based on a recognition of the gradual depletion of non-renewable energy sources; social consequences of energy decisions; environmental impact of growing energy demands; and the implications for Australian decision-making of the global maldistribution of energy use; and have as its aim a long term sustainable energy economy, in which energy resources and technologies are appropriate to the needs and goals of the Australian community; and should encompass the careful use of fossU fuel reserves as a bridge to longer term future; promotion of energy awareness in the pubUc and private sectors and amongst individuals; a strong program of energy conservation; and a gradual and planned shift to renewable energy sources; a Labor Government will 11 implement a policy on fossU fuels including (a) promotion of further exploration; (b) close investigation of present and future fossU fuel requirements, efficiencies of use and alternative uses, conservation of reserves, regulation of marketing and export and overall planning to cater for the depletion of reserves; (c) increased attention to alleviating the environmental effects of fossU fuel use; and (d) continued investigation into the gasification and liquefaction of coal; 12 implement a program of energy awareness including (a) fostering energy analysis in the private sector, energy impact statements for new development; and (b) encouraging individual consciousness of the energy costs of decisions through tion and labelling of consumer goods for energy efficiencies; G National Fuel and Energy Commission 13 establish a National Fuel and Energy Commission to (a) assist the Australian Government in developing and implementing a co-ordinated fuel and energy policy; (b) together with the Department of Minerals and Energy, provide the Australian Government with expert advice on energy; (c) be composed of representatives of the National and State Governments and of producers and consumers of F Energy Policy energy; (d) be funded directly by the Australian Government, and in turn be responsible to the Australian Government through the Minister for Minerals and Energy; (e) be responsible for the preparation of a blueprint for Australia's future energy requirements and an inventory of Australia's energy resources, and will specifically(i) monitor the exploration, development, transport price, marketing and use of energy hydrocarbons, fissionable materials and generative water, with the object of achieving the best energy balance for Australia; (U) in co-operation with the Australian Science and Technology Council, be responsible for the national coordination and Federal funding of energy research and development in Australia, including particular research relating to coal conversion and solar energy, and determine an order of priorities for such research.

46,Mr KEATING,TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL,"In the policy we envisaged the establishment of a nauonal fuel and energy commission. Because of the limitation of ume I wdl not read out the functions of that commission, but item (ii) of the policy states that the Commission will: in co-operation with the Australian Science and Technology Council, be responsible for the national co-ordination and Federal funding of energy research and development in Australia, including particular research relating to version and solar energy, and determine an order of priorities for such research. Tne provide the Austrahan Government with detailed knowledge of existing energy research programs and of the resources available in Australia to carry out the greatly expanded research and development effort necessaiy to ensure that Australia has access to the new technologies necessary for the development of alternative energy sources at the appropriate time . . . The point is that, even on a casual observation this pohcy, it is obvious that my party has thought long and hard about this matter. We are over a year and a half ahead of the Government in its thinking. The Government still has not mulated any clear machinery by which it estabUsh permanent co-ordination and funding of a research effort in Australia. More imporvehicles. tantly, there is the immediately emerging probdistances lem of the deficiency of crude oU in Australia, which I think is Australia's most pressing energy problem. As honourable members know, at the moment Australia receives 70 per cent of crude oU from indigenous sources and 30 per cent is attributable to imports. Yet by 1985, if new oUfieldsare found, the reverse wtil be case. Thirty per cent wtil be coming from indigenous sources and there wtil be a 70 per cent reUance on imports. This lack of energy independence and the cost to our balance of ments and the parity of our currency wtil be severe indeed for this country. Even if we were find a large oil-bearing structure today and cided this very day to start development, it would take eight years to bring such a development stream. So it would be 1986 before we saw any tangible benefits from a discovery today and policy to move on today with development. Again, in the area of natural gas there has in been a malaise in government thinking. The energy Government thinks it is sufficient to give the goahead to the North West Shelf project when it ought to be an objective of government poUcy to adjourned. raise the utilisation of natural gas in Australia to reasonable levels. At the moment gas utilisation runs at about 8 per cent of Australia's total energy picture, whereas the world average is around 21 per cent. This seems a sensible policy as it looks as though Australia will have sufficient quantities of natural gas for the foreseeable future. It is a direct replacement for oil and ticularly for imported oti, being heavy gravity oil, where the heavy end products are presendy used for burning in industry. So natural gas can provide a real substitute. Yet there is no direction of government poticy towards upgrading natural Bill 1978. gas exploration. It is regarded as a spin-off from coal con- oti exploration. There have been no real endeavours to make sure that a coherent gas policy is Fuel and Energy Commission will developed for Australia. The other issue which the Government must be attending to shortly is the implementation of a conservation poUcy. If we cannotfindoti the sensible thing to do is not to use so much of what we have. We on this side of the House believe that the Government ought to be attending to fuel of economy targets for motor vehicles. Australian motor manufacturers are not required to meet any fuel economy targets, whereas their counterparts in other parts of the world have been forrequired to do so for a longtime.Again, the can Government seems to be languishing in the development of a policy towards energy efficient Given the size of this continent and the between the capital cities, one would have beUeved that this would have been a priority. The point is that the Government has done very little about energy. What we need is a quite its massive research and development effort. I make the pomt again that the Labor Party no has said that, in government, it will establish an the energy research and development fund under the administration of the national fuel and energy commission, to be substantially financed from moneys coUected under the proposed secpayondary profits tax flowing from energy provery duction, to enable the vital research and to development of alternative energy technology to debe carried out. What we need is a well funded and co-ordinated research effort into alternative on energy technologies. We have never had that. To date the Government has received reports and a has sat on them. We hope that thefinework by the Australian Science and Technology Council will be taken note of by the Government and that it will be the forerunner to a clear definition this House very shortly of the Government's policy.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion torisein their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacesis",27
49,Mr SCHOLES,PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN,"This matter public importance gives the House a hrnited opmake portunity to debate a matter which is of extreme concern to a substanual proportion of the Ausof tralian population and which should be the ject of very clear and definite statements by Government. On 24 January of this year, followequate ing some very high level public relations cises and general pubhc concern arising out of the incursion into Australia of an aircraft carrymoment ing large quantities of marihuana and because the arrival in Australia of refugee boats without prior detection, the Government announced that it had set up a committee of permanent heads to discuss means by which surveillance and the tection of Australia's territorial integrity could assured and that that committee would report back to the Government for action within a month. It is now 4 April. After the period of a month had elapsed- I am fairly certain that this is accurate-the committee had not even met to discuss the propositions which had been put ward by an interdepartmental committee which had met and which was continuing to meet after that time. The question of Australia's territorial integrity and the surveillance and protection of the trahan coastline is one which is regularly under discussion, especially in northern Australia. cently in a Four Comers program the Leader the Majority Party in the Northern Territory Legislative Council indicated- I think quite properly-that he considered the Commonwealth had a responsibility to provide for the defence and surveillance of northern Australia, a responsibility which at this stage has not been accepted by anyone. The Minister for Defence (Mr Ktilen), who unfortunately cannot take part in this debate because of another commitment, has made a number of statements, including some in answer to questions in this House, which I hope TERRITORY were meant to be funny but which unfortunately I feel I must take seriously. One was a suggestion that $3,000m worth of Orion aircraft should be purchased to undertake this task. Another was an attack on Mr Everingham, whom I have mentioned before in which the Minister indicated that he was suffering from the Darwin heat when he made some of those suggestions. A number of other statements by the Minister both inside and outside this House clearly have been designed to make the point that the defence forces should not accept this responsibility. I want to make it absolutely clear that in my opinion the protection of Australia's sovereignty a defence responsibility and should be underof taken on that level. The Government should it quite clear that that is its policy decision and should then require the defence forces to meet that obligation. I understand the reluctance the defence forces. It is a question of money. subWho pays? Does the money come out of the the existing budget, which is quite obviously inadto meet even the Government's policy exerpronouncements made in the White Paper of 1976, which are in almost total disarray at the in meeting the timetable set out in that of document? But that does not solve the problem of surveillance and it does not solve the problem of who will be required to carry out the task. I believe that the answers lie in political decisions of prothe Government following its acceptance of be advice which it said it was to receive nearly a month ago but which apparently it has not received yet. What I think has happened- I think this is fairly accurate-is that a bartering situation is taking place within the interdepartmental committee not on who will do the job but on forhow much money will be provided if so-and-so does it. Line-up positions are being taken. There is an attractive alternative suggestion. I say 'attractive' because if it is not examined it could seem attractive. It is that we set up a separAusate independent coastguard force to carry out what the Minister for Defence has termed 'civReilian surveillance'. I do not know exactly what of 'civilian surveillance' is or how it would be defined as against defence surveillance. It is attractive because most Australians have seen the United States Coastguard in acdon in all sorts of glory situations on television programs. But Australia is not the United States. The only which would equate us with the United States the approximately similar length of our coastline. The United States Coastguard has 35,000 men and its equipment, except for a couple of capital items, would make it a superior force to the trahan Navy. Anyone in this House or outside who suggests that that type of force could be set upfinanciallyor otherwise within the Australian context I think has not heard of the Treasury certainly is not aware of the amount of Austorial tralian budgetary funds available to defence which could be made available for additional requirements in providing civilian surveillance. That sort of force is something which can be watched on television screens very cheaply but cannot befinancedout of public funds in should Austraha. What are the alternatives? We could set up some low level force which would do a job of some nature with equipment which would be receiving paid for either by reducing the amount of funds available to the defence forces for their operthe ations or by an additional appropriation of funds. It would be operated by a civilian strucfor ture which would have to duplicate many of the communications, command and training structures that exist already in the defence forces which would almost certainly and inevitably be manned by persons who would leave the defence forces in order to take up senior positions in area. That is the way the force would be estralian tabUshed and it would then become a pubUc relations exercise in the Australian community butid up that empire further. The other alternawould tive is for the actual work to be done by the Aus-But tralian defence forces which have the uaining, the capacity and certainly the need in the pubhc eye to undertake this type of work at a time there is no obvious defence threat. The defence forces need an area of actual identifiable activity at this stage, and this is one area in which can be done. Quite obviously the funds must made avaUable by the Government. The Decaused fence budget does not allow for that type of alternative expenditure. The equipment required is a matter of judgment. Certainly patrol boats are on order. It may be necessary to purchase different types of sea-going craft to those which the defence forces would want in a normal decivilian fence situation. Aircraft costing far less than Orion about which the Minister, I think jokingly, answered a question in this House would be required. The questions are: When wtil a poticy announcement be made; what will that poticy anthing nouncement be; and who wtil be responsible? I is would say to this House, and I think most members would agree, that the protection of the territorial integrity of continental Australia and its territorial waters-the y are shortly to be Ausexpanded for economic purposes if not for total claims-is the responsibility of the defence forces. It is the responsibiUty of the government of the day to set out the poUcy guidelines and the and financial arrangements under which that terriintegrity wtil be protected. At the moment and that is not happening. There is a back room haggle between departmental representatives about who will receive the spoils and there is a pubUc debate in which it is suggested clearly by the Minister responsible that the defence forces not carry out this role because it is not a proper role for them in that it does not involve direct defence against an invader or an attacker. The Minister has suggested on a number of occasions recently that his requests for funds to provide adequately for the defence forces are not a nearing in Cabinet. The situation is that at least one section of a department-it is not first time this has come up-is seeking to establish a second subUminal defence operation a specific purpose in the surveUlance area. and Where does defence end and civilian surveillance start? One of the problems which is obvious to everyone is that we must be able to detect any that persons seeking to make an incursion into Austerritorial areas. It is not easy. The proposal, which has been mentioned in this House to by the Minister, of the Jindalee radar system give some form of protection in this area. it isfiveto ten years away; it is not now. The existing radar capacity in Darwin and what used to be in Amberley-it is currently having a rest when whtie some parts are obtained in the next 12 months or so-is limited and the actual surveillance which is being undertaken is less than comthat prehensive and certainly does not offer any be deterrent. The incursion by the aircraft which the hoo-ha earlier in the year with subsequent reports of another one and the arrivals of fishing boats or refugee boats in Darwin were undetected. That may not happen now but it certainly did happen. I do not know how anyone would make the determination that that was a problem because the people on the boats the were refugees or that it was a defence problem because they were terrorists possibly seeking to wreak havoc in Darwin for some obscure or obvious political reason. How would one make that judgment merely by watching them sad up Darwin Harbour, because that is the first time Australia knew about some of them? If a civilian surveillance capacity is estabimportance. lished, who wdl pay the wages? By now someone on the Government side must have worked out that the first thing that wdl happen is that naval forces will be robbed of recruits and sonnel who would like active operational service which can be obtained in patrol boats and in area of surveUlance. The surveUlance will be paid for either by additional funds being made avaUable-this would get over the major defence organisational opposition-o r by the money Australia; being taken off the defence budget through another department. They seem to be the alternatives. In this area the defence services which are opposing at this stage the undertaking of the work are showing poor political judgment. But that is another quesuon. The Minister is also showing poor poltiical judgment in that he is seeking to shed a function which the defence forces ought to be carrying out and be seen to carrying out. Even though this may not be part of a shooting war defence proposition, it is part our territorial integrity and part of the Australia. The White Paper on the Government's fiveand year program for the defence of Australia, which I am assured is stUl current with some modificaThat tions, sets out that one of the capacities the tralian defence forces must have is a capacity provide defence against minor incursions. This includes surveUlance of our coastline. These are functions which have to be undertaken and which the Government has indicated wtil be undertaken but which at the moment the Minisprimary ter for Defence is suggesting should not be undertaken by the defence forces. There will never be enough money available for the functions of government and certainly there cannot possibly be sufficient funds the requirements of any modern defence force disagreement. which wants to be in readiness to counter any contingency. If the Minister for Defence abrogates the responsibUity for the protection at levels of Australian territorial integrity, chances of successful argument even for relaspeeding tively adequate funds within the budgetary conor sideration decUne. The actual surveUlance force becomes a second force operated by another partment. It becomes ineffective.",27
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN, emphasised Order! The honourable member's time has an expired.,29
51,Mr CONNOLLY,PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN," I think it appropriate for me to compliment the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) for his wisdom in proposing this matter of public It is the first time over the last threeodd years that we have seen any member of the Opposition take any interest at all in the defence the of this nation. The honourable member has also, perquiterightly,emphasised the difficult decisions which have to be taken in this area. As a general the statement. I will not argue with him on the substance of the facts which he has given. We need to see the whole context of this problem. We are talking firstly about the territorial integrity of that is, not just the physical land mass and provided but also the sea around us. In the near future we will legislate for a fisheries zone which wtil increase from our coast by some 200 miles the area over which we have jurisdiction. In terms of total area this represents a sea mass approximately equivalent to the land mass of Australia. It is obvious that any governbe ment of this nation has to consider very seriously how we can effectively overcome the real difficulof ties caused by the size of the area over which we defence of have to maintain some jurisdiction. The first responsibility of government is to provide a nation with security from armed attack from the constraints of independent national decisions imposed by the threat of such attacks. is the introduction to the White Paper Ausintroduced into the last Parliament by Mr Kilien, to the Minister for Defence, in November 1976. As the honourable member for Corio is aware, that document is still relevant today. It is also worth emphasising that this Government, under no circumstances, wtil run away from what we see as a responsibility of effective national administration. However, a clear distinction must be made between peacetime law enforcement and the protection of the nation's sovereignty. I suspect that on this point the honourable member for Corio and speakers from the to meet Government side will have some area of It is a matter of established practice that law all enforcement does not demand 100 per cent enthe forcement. Since when have we caught every driver, every break and entry offender every traveller who brings goods in or takes goods out through an international airport dewhether such goods involve marihuana or the taking out of protected Australian wildlife flora and fauna? At the same time it must be that in recent months we have seen increase in the number of refugees who have arrived off the Australian coast. We must again question whether their presence represents a de facto mtiitary threat or merely an illegal incursion into Australian national sovereignty. The primary purpose of our defence-this is the point which I think the honourable member for Corio was trying to make-accordin g to the defence establishment, is based essentially upon the prospect of military threat which involves entirely different considerations in terms of Australia's territorial sovereignty. A major difficulty we are facing in that area is the sheer cost of updating our equipment and our personnel and maintaining a high standard which at all times is within our capacity to pay. We also have to consider the fundamental problems of lead time which is related to the updating and reequipping of our forces. In recent years, dating back to the time of the previous Minister for Defence, Mr Barnard, there has been an increasing community interest in drugs which have been dropped off our coast and in refugees who have arrived in small boats. In addition, we must not forget infringements to our territorial sovereignty caused by illegal fishing. In recent years ships of a number of nations have entered Australian territorial seas illegally and have taken from them substantial resources of Australian fish. It can be equally argued that as a nation we have not successfully, up to thistime,tried to utilise those resources to our own satisfaction. But the fact remains that last year the South Pacific Forum, of which Australia is a member, agreed that we would work towards a 200-mile resources zone. The first objective is that we will have a 200-mile fisheries zone. We understand that enabling legislation will be introduced in the near future. That decision will face us with two fundamental problems. Are we to say that no nation has the right of access to our zone without specific Australian Government approval? Or are we to take the view that as the resources of that zone are at present beyond our capacity to adequately farm and husband it would be more appropriate for us to enter intofisheriesagreements with nations such as Japan, Russia and other states which may be interested, with the primary objective of ensuring that Australian companies through joint ventures in particular wtil be given some opportunity to gain access to the resources of those fishing grounds and that Australia as a nation will thus gain directly? These are real problems. They do not just cover the question of defence: but transcends foreign poticy, domestic policy and, of course, primary industry policy. Let me refer more specifically to the question of defence and whether responsibility for our coastal surveillance should be a primary defence function, or a function of some other department such as the Depanment of Transport which currently provides the chairman for the interdepartmental committee which is examining this issue. I am pleased to see that the Government and the Opposition appreciate that the physical environment of Australia emphasises the importance of maritime surveillance, reconnaissance and offshore patrol. The White Paper lays out specifically the Government's program in this regard. We have been told by the honourable member for Corio that it istimewe made a further statement. I emphasise that the White Paper is still the basic document upon which the defence policy of this administration is based. In this context, we have the LRMP-the long range maritime protection force-whic h consists of P3 Orion aircraft based at Edinburgh. Additional Orions have been purchased and they are based at Townsville. The difficulty with this particular aircraft is that it is not only an extremely expensive item of equipment but so sophisticated that its primary role is to seek out and destroy submarines or to seek out surface vessels of at least 2,000 tonnes deadweight. The fact of the matter is that most, if not all, of the refugee ships that have arrived off the Australian coast weigh substantially less than 2,000 tonnes. I would deign to suggest that most of the deep sea fishing boats which also impinge upon our territorialfishingresources also weigh below 2,000 tonnes. Therefore, the P3 Orion obviously is not the ideal piece of equipment to use, despite the fact that at this time it is regarded internationally as one of the most effective maritime search and surveillance aircraft in the Western world. When one looks at the scale or alternative aircraft which we could purchase one runs into a whole series of problems related specifically to the sheer size of Australia: The fact that we do not have sufficient usable airfields within the specific zones of activity. Although we take the view that the North West Shelf area of Australia to Cape York should be regarded as the primary area of concern,' it cannot under any circumstances be taken as the only area. We see quite often that drugs are discovered on beaches, and found on boats with radio homing devices attached to them and so forth, in the southern seas off Australia. Therefore, the point must be made that we are not talking about just a specific area of the Australian coastline. Although there can be zones of activity which require more action than others, primarily we have to have some capacity for surveillance over the entire coastal area of Australia by air, sea and land. The honourable member for Corio also made the point-quite rightly so-that perhaps we should be considering the question of a coastguard. This is something to which the Government is currendy giving serious consideration. The word 'civdian' has been used in this context to differentiate a non-nuiitary service. Whether a coastguard could be one means of achieving this or whether we should have a component added to the defence estabhshment-by calling it a 'coastguard' if we wish-o r whether we should have a coastguard type facility established within the Department of Transport or the Depanment of Business and Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for customs anangements at the present ume, has to be decided. Some very rough figures which have been taken out on this subject would suggest that cost of running a very basic coastguard operation for Australia would be some $500m. The cost of cutters, for example, would be about $250m, time of threat. small patrol craft another $30m, aircraft $20m and funher infrastructure at least another $200m. In addition, actual annual running costs, allowing $20,000 for each man, which would be veillance the basic cost including overtime, additional shore leave facilities, accommodation and so forth, including stores, fuel, rations, would be approximately another $200m. What the nation Government needs to consider and certainly what the Opposition needs to appreciate is we are talking about extremely large sums of money. Whilst it is very easy for the electorate to the view that in matters of health, education social welfare, for example, governments should be prepared to spend whatever is necessary, it is extraordinary that when we start to debate ters of defence, suddenly we hear the cry from the Opposition: 'What is the Government doing about it? Why is it not spending more money?' This comes from an Opposition which during three years in government did nothing at demonstrate the slightest degree of interest in the defence of this nation. I only hope that the honourable member for Corio, now that he has the shadow portfolio of defence, will bring to Opposition a greater degree of interest in this matter than we have seen previously. As we are talking about figures, let us see problem illustrated in terms of Government Budget oudays by function over, say, the last financial year, 1976-77. Appropriations for defence represented 8.8 per cent of Government outlays, education represented 8.9 per cent, health represented 10.6 percent and social security and welfare-wai t for it-27. 2 per cent. Of course, other items of expenditure were considerably less. What we simply have to ask the Australian people is: 'Where are those cuts going to be made? What are you prepared to go without so that Australia can have a truly effective defence structure?' As this Parliament will realise in the not too distant future when it hears from the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) when he announces a decision on the TFF, we are speaking of enormous sums of money for which the average citizen probably will not see in the foreseeable future any direct results. We do not have parades down the streets; we do not have great flypasts. Why is this so? It is because, frankly, they cost too much. Our defence establishment at the moment needs every cent it can get its hands on to make sure that it has adequate training fathe cilities and equipment to perform its primary task, which I put to this House is the physical defence and the territorial integrity of Australia in The role performed by the defence establishment in recent years in the context of coastal surcertainly is well up to its capability. But to achieve that objective has meant that men and equipment have been put to functions for which they were not originally designed or trained. This must seriously consider whether it is prepared to pay that cost. A possible alternative that would be to have a totally new concept, for example, a coastguard, whether it be an adjunct of the defence services, or whether it be a totally civilian operation run by the departments which take I mentioned earlier. These are important deand cisions. On that I agree with the honourable member for Corio. It is indeed very advantageous for this Parliament and for Australia that matwe appear at last to have reached the stage where the representatives of the Australian people on both sides of this chamber can seriously discuss in a bipartisan manner what is a its primary - responsibility of this Parliament, all to namely, the integrity of Australia.",29
52,Mr BRYANT,PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN,"To begin with, I should like to set the record straight. The the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) did not advocate a coastguard service. In the short time at his disposal he discarded the idea of a coastguard service as impracticable. Nor did he the say that we should have some continuous and absolute police force system watch over the approaches to Australia. There is not much point in talking about whether one approves or disapproves of access to Austraha if one cannot do anything about it-if one cannot find out about or does not even notice people who are entering our territorial seas. That is thefirstissue I should like to make clear. I hope that the speech by the honourable member for Corio is not misunderstood in that regard. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made several points in what one might call a contentious political way, which I should challenge. He claimed that we have not shown any interest in defence over the past three years or so. It is difficult to show interest publicly in matters of defence or anything else which is debated in this Parliament when debates are constantly gagged, when Ministers never come into this chamber and make statements about anything, or, if they do so, as soon as they start to lose an argument they close down the debate. Honourable members on this side of the House have much the same interest in defence as have our friends opposite, except that when we were in government we did something practical about the matter. It was the Labor Government which continued with the purchase of the Fl 11- a very difficult decision to make. It was the Labor Government which put the careers of members of the armed services on a substantial footing. It was the Labor Government which ordered the Leopard tank and took a number of other initiatives to secure the defence position of Australia which prevailed at the time. We do not say that the present Government running away from this issue; it has just gone to sleep on it There is no doubt that the people of Austraha are concerned about the situation which has developed-that it seems to be posshave ible for anybody in the most unseaworthy vessel to invade our snores. I know that it would be in the long term that we would have to worry about hysteria generated by concern that tens of thounavigational sands of people were going to invade our shores. But it still intrigues all of us to consider that, our enormous array of facilities in the defence system, the transport system and so on, we can be sneaked up upon byfishingships which have come all the way from Vietnam. We want the There system changed. We are not going to embark upon an argucohesion ment whether people ought to be allowed to come here; that is not the issue. But territorial integrity-speakin g in the same terms as my colvices league the honourable member for Bradfield and relating it to the seas surrounding the land of Australia-has to be assured. We shall decide whether it is necessary to prevent people from coming here after various other decisions have been made. But we must create the apparatus by which we can be absolutely certain that we know who is coming to Australia, why they are coming and what we should do when they do get here. I am not intrigued by the argument that surveillance is a defence function. The facts as I see them are that there is a problem to be faced. So we have to look at the available resources with which we can tackle the problem. I have somefiguresI would like to cite. We do not want to become neurotic about what might be called the continuous incursions into Australia, but in 1973 there were 283 sightings of fishing vessels. The number increased to 431 in 1974. According tofiguresin the report of the Department of Transport, the Marine Operations Centre investigated 1,482 incidents during 1976-77-the e or four a day on average-and of that number 173 were separate sightings of fishing vessels. I suppose it would not matter all that much if all these vessels caught most of the fish that they look for now, but there is no doubt that Australia'sfishingresources are of a limited nature and we must not allow them to be taken from us. However, that is only the thin edge of the wedge in a world situation in which all sorts of other things may happen to us. On the question of whether surveillance is a civil or a defence responsibility, I think that whilst the actual policing of the system, the final management of the system and what is done about it should be civil decisions, perhaps the is actual Defence Force has the apparatus with which to carry out the job. I do not think the decision as to whether surveillance is a civil or a defence function is mutually exclusive. We already in Australia rather large surveillance forces. The Customs Bureau has surveillance apparatus. There are the police forces in each of the States. The Department of Transport has a very large aid and radar system, but it does not cover the whole of the Australian continent. with The State investigation systems are there. They can patrol parts of the coastline. There are also the environmental people, thefisheriespeople, the people who monitor oil spillage and so on. is a very large but disorganised apparatus, although the Marine Operations Centre under the Department of Transport has brought some into surveillance in recent years. What is the situation insofar as the armed Serare concerned? I suppose this is a subjective value view of what might be called the Ausmaintralian temperament, but I do not think the people who join the Australian defence services are properly conditioned to spending their lives doing very little. It may be allrightfor a person who joined the services in somewhere like Belgium or Holland where men are not accustomed to going away on expeditionary forces, where the horizons are bounded by a closely knit society and there is a long tradition to take matters very quietly. I am absolutely certain that the morale of the Australian defence forces would be raised by the use of personnel constantly in operations which they think provide gainful employment. I think that in what might be called a morale building sense it is essential to use our armed vices in this way. The Royal Australian Air Force already has a duty in regard to surveillance of the sea around the Australian coastline as much as it has over the mainland. The Navy has a similar duty as regards sea search. I suspect that the Army has the capacity and ought to be practising to protect continuously our land and our coastline. The Army in many respects has the necessary equipment. It is perhaps not appropriate for the task that we have before us, but that is part of the development of our history. In the past Australia-w e have not quite grown out of it-ha s become totally accustomed to conditioning itself to other people's wars andfittingitself into other people's theatres of operations. I do not know whether we have yet grown out of that practice. I do not think any member on either side of this House, the people in the defence forces or the people in the civil section of the structure have yet conditioned themselves to look at a new Australian environment in this regard. We have the manpower and we have some special skills. The task of the armed forces in the first instance is in general intelligence, keeping surveillance over a situation so that we know what is going on around the country, both on our shores and beyond. I refer to things such as illegal incursions, whether they involvefishing,smuggling or immigrants. The resources for the actual surveillance are more readily available in the defence forces than anywhere else. It seems to me on the simple logistics of the matter that this matter of surveillance ought to be one for the Department ofDefence. I am disappointed that the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) has not chosen to take part in this discussion. The honourable member for Bradfield chided the Opposition and said that we do not take much interest in defence. If we raise a matter such as this I do not think it is asking for too much to ask the Minister for Defence to take part in the debate. If honourable members look back over the pattern of debates in this Parliament in the years until the return of this Government in 19761 think they willfindthat on nearly any issue on which a major debate was coming up or on any new issue such as this the Minister concerned or a member of the Ministry took part on behalf of the Government. I think we have before us a very important decision to make, and that is: What kind of defence force and what kind of apparatus should we design to cope with the problem which is ahead Serof us? I think we have to apply ourselves to this question in a different way. The honourable member for Bradfield and the honourable member for Corio both raised the issue of what equipment we should have. We know from the various studies that have been done that 15 or 20 Nomads operating on the north coast of Australia are able to cover almost 50 per cent of the coast. Although the latest Nomads are a bit more expensive they are still cheap by international standards. We have in Australia a very large defence research capacity, both for the development of new ways of conducting surveillance and in the manufacturing of equipment, but mostly it is underemployed. I believe we could not at this stage make out a good case for anything else but for the Department ofDefence to be responsible for the principal operational role in thisfield.The civil services may well then come into the operation when it comes to doing something about the malefactors or in deciding the methods of interception to be carried out. The actual structure of the Defence Force makes it the appropriate choice to do the job. The Services would have logistics practice. It would give the Navy practice at sea. The Air Force obviously needs both practice and equipment.",31
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,33
54,Mr NEIL,PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is most important to obtain a bipartisan attitude to defence matters. The motion is welcomed because in bringing forward this matter for discussion today the Opposition has had an extraordinary change of heart. The question is whether or not the Opposition as a whole is sincere in this matter or whether the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) are well meaning persons who are out on a limb in their own party. I remember that it was not so many years ago that the Labor Government under the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam) gave away Australian patrol vessels, some to Indonesia. The former Leader of the Opposition, a former Prime Minister, had the hide to go to Tasmania at last elecuon and say, in an attempt to get votes, that Tasmania would be a great place for a patrol vessel base. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter for discussion which has been proposed by the honourable member for Corio. I quesuon whether or not the Opposition has raised matter in sufficient depth at all. I appreciate there are Umitations of ume in debate on matters of public importance, but there is a great difficulty which this raises in that there is a tation to gloss over the issue, to pluck straws of the air or to wave a magic wand and say that this is the way to do it. Thefirstquesuon to asked is this: Is the Opposition sincere about financial implications? In the 1975-76 Budgetthe last Labor Budget which was brought down by the present Leader of the Opposition Hayden); the horrific Hayden Budget-the DeThat fence vote was 8.5 per cent of the total outlay. According to thefiguresI have here, was the lowest vote for many many years and have certainly the lowest since the early 1960s. then the budgetary allocation has been ships,fishermen,navigational increased. I will be thefirstto criticise construchouse tively the Government if the $ 12,000m five-year plan is not kept on target-ther e are grounds supposing it may not be on target, and I will critihope cise the Government for that. Government has provided the additional funds which this Opposition was not prepared to do when it was in office. The question that should be directed to the Opposition is very simply this: What government services will be cut in order to provide the money it has properly asked for today or what taxes will it increase to provide the money it has properly asked for today? There has not been one word about that. I would expect that if the two honourworld-leading able and sincere members went mto the Labor Party Caucus meeting tomorrow and asked for either some restriction on government expendimties. ture, if Labor were to get into office again, which wtil not happen, or some increase in some taxesof Labor will never get the opportunity to do that they would be howled down in their Party room. We have to get the matter into perspective. The next thing I want to do is to point out to the House and to the country what is being done at present. I am not satisfied and I do not think any member of the House is satisfied with the adequacy of our surveUlance efforts at present, but a great deal is being done. The first point to remember is that surveUlance is designed to provide early warning of changing strategic circumstances. It is different from reconnaissance and the there is civilian and military surveUlance and reconnaissance. We have a very important organisation which was set up in 1975 for the purpose of managing and co-ordinating off-shore surveUlance for civilian purposes, which is what has caused the present difficulties. On it we have the Department of Primary Industry and the the former Department of Customs and Excise, that which now comes within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, as well as the Department of Health, the Department of tempTransport and, of course, the Department ofDeout fence. The Department of Defence is the main provider of equipment. The most recent annual be figures available to me show that 2,000 flying the hours and more than 800 patrol boat days were provided by the Department of Defence. That would mean the expenditure of a significant (Mr amount of money-man y millions of dollars. money is not recouped. I have said in the Budget House before that that money should be that recouped. It should be government policy to it recouped. In addition, it is probably little Since known by the pubhc that Australian merchant aid vessels, light keepers and civil aircraft at present are providing about one third of the total surveilfor lance reports which are received. I expect and that this surveillance will be considerably I point out that the expanded. The Government members' foreign affairs and defence committee wtil be sending between six and eight members, as soon as the House rises at the end of this two-week period, to inspect first hand our facilities in the north and west to provide assistance to the Government in that regard. Those members will inspect the technical facilities which are available and to which the Opposition did not refer-for example, the exceUent, radar system known as Operation Jindalee, which, if and when it comes into operation, will detect vessels and aircraft over many I hope that it wtil be given the very high priority that it ought to be given in the allocation funds. The Opposition should indicate where it wouldfindthe money to boost the Jindalee system. I am quite confident that the Government wtilfindmoney to boost it. Honourable members opposite already have cited the large amount of successful work that has been done. Hundreds and hundreds of sightings have been made. The Tracker aircraft have been destroyed in the main but they will be back on deck soon. More than 2,000 sightings were made by Tracker aircraft in a specific four-week period in 1975 in Operation Trochas, which was most successful. Other similar activities could be engaged in at varioustimes.About 30 per cent of the planned effort is diverted to urgent tasks. That is a regular occurrence. Operation Trochas in 1975 and 1976 was an additional task. That is the situation although the 200-mile territorial zone has not yet been established. Surely any government statement would have to include that aspect. The Opposition knows full well that the Government is very close to making a statement in regard to the 200-mile zone. It goes without saying that both aircraft and ships have to operate together. I am quite confident that they wtil be able to do so in the near future. The Trochas operation showed that an intensive surveillance operation coupled with considerable contact by patrol boats and fear of confiscation could be very effective as a means of ensuring compliance with applicable laws. I hope that those types of activities will be repeated as soon as possible. I should like to say something about lishment of a coastguard service. I , for one, would take considerable persuading to be convinced that a coastguard service is the most appropriate method of dealing with the problem. think Australia's economies of scale as to the composition of our forces and the costs involved would not allow us the luxury of such a separate force and a separate command. The Governuntil ment has yet to consider the matter fully. Together with other members, I want to look into it further. But strong reasons would have be advanced to convince me of the need for a coastguard service, which would require initial basefinancefacilities before it could be set and which would be a duplication of another reaucratic structure. If the defence forces were recouped for the services they provided instead of being forced to provide those services without recouping money they would be able to carry out those activities quite well. I am also reminded by the honourable will member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) of the excelOpposition lent work carried out by the territorial boundmoney. aries sub-committee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. That sub-committee travelled on Orion aircraft and other aircraft carrying out the northern Australia. It produced a report which is of considerable value to the Government. I am not certain that one can talk in terms of names at this time. The ascertainment propriate equipment is best left to the specialists. I think that the more members of this House recommend the Nomad aircraft or other aircraft the more they are getting into an area which not necessarily one in which they are fully competent. Equally good arguments could be put up for the use of the HS748 Coastguarder or the maritime version of the F27 aircraft. Let us not forget that the Fl 11C aircraft can, if necessary, be used in a very sophisticated reconnaissance role because they are getting a very valuable reconnaissance palate. Let us not also forget the potential value of satellites. The Government is well aware of this matter. I point out that there are two types of satellites-geostationar y and non-synchronous. The geostationary satellite must remain at 36,000 kilometres and the resolution from there is low. If we are to have non-synchronous satellites we have to have a number of them. Merely to put up one non-synchronous satellite would cost $40m. The launching costs, the ground control processes and other facilities that go with them, including additional satellites, would add the estabimmeasurably to the initial cost. Before I conclude my speech I want to refute the attacks that regrettably were made on the I Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien). Firstly, the Minister has not exercised poor judgment at this stage. He has said that there are various options still before the Government and we have to wait a particular report is available, which should not be long-althoug h it is a very complicated subject, and we get a decision on the to 200-mile zone. Secondly, the Minister's statements recently could not be taken as jocular, particularly when one bears in mind his supplemenup tary answer of 2 March. Thirdly, the honourable bumember for Corio (Mr Scholes) even pointed out why the Minister for Defence regrettably was not able to take part in the debate today. I welcome the debate. It is a constructive matter. It is an important topic in the national interest. There is no point in becoming hysterical. More must be done but the public must be prepared to foot the bill. That is the vital question. This Government provide the money. I regret to say that the certainly would not provide the If it can show its bona fides on that matter, I would certainly welcome it.",33

62,Mr WILLIS,SUPERANNUATION ACTS,"The Bill now before the House provides a very extensive array of amendments to existing legislation concerning superannuation for Commonwealth Government employees. The amendments are quite technical, for the most part thoroughly non-controversial, and accordingly the Opposition does not oppose them. Indeed, the legislation is so complex and of so little interest to all superannuation specialists that it would be tedious and quite wasteful of the time of the House to discuss the Bill in detail. There are, however, a couple of matters that the Opposition wishes' to raise before giving its consent to the legislation. The principal reason for the legislation is to plug the gaps and iron out the anomalies that were perceived in the new Commonwealth superannuation scheme first put forI ward by the Labor Government in 1975 but not passed until 1976, and then only in a rather watered-down form. The introduction of the new scheme had become a matter of real importance scheme had reached the point of absome contributors paying as much as 40 per cent of their salary each week into the fund. The new scheme removed that possibility basically provided for superannuation contributions of 5 per cent of salary, with pension retirement.lump sum benefits on death or The legislation now before us is confined very much to tidying up both the new scheme and the application of the new principles to the old There are precious few improvements from the point of view of contributors or pensioners. Indeed, there are only three of any note. is One concerns the extension of the permissible period for election as to the form of benefit that The the employee or dependant desires to take. The extension of the period in which to make this important decision from one month to three is commendable and should make it less likely that people wtil make their election without having considered thoroughly which option most suitable to their particular circumstances. respect of such elections, the Bill provides for the possibility of the cancellation of an election if the Commissioner deems it appropriate so to do. Such a provision certainly represents an improvement because a contributor or dependant could make an election on wrong advice, and to provide that he must simply put up with a decision reached in such circumstances for the rest of his days, as the current legislation does, is harsh indeed. The Btil changes that, but it is decidedly vague as to what criteria the Commissioner shall take into account in deciding whether to cancel an election. The Bill simply provides that the Commissioner take account of such matters as are prescribed by regulation, if any, and any other matter he deems relevant. The Bill could hardly be less specific. This is not a trivial point because many people may feel that the example quoted in the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson), that is, where all relevant information was not available at the time of the election, may well apply to them. The Opposition would like to know whether any regulations are to be prescribed in respect of this matter and, if so, what they are to be. If the Government is still thinking about this aspect, as seems to be the case, we would urge it not to be too restrictive in determining grounds for obtaining cancellation and, in particular, to provide as a broad ground for cancellation the nonavailability of all relevant information. The only other notable improvement concerns the case where a contributor or pensioner dies and leaves more than one spouse, such as where a married male contributor lives in a de facto relationship with another woman. The new scheme gave recognition to de facto spouses and the amending legislation now before the House enables each surviving spouse to choose between pension and lump sum in the same way as other spouses in respect of their share of available benefits. Other than those three minor but worthwhile improvements, the Btil consists mainly of machinery type amendments clarifying the 1976 legislation, correcting drafting errors in it and eliminating anomaUes that have arisen. There are two other changes about which I wish to comment, however, and they concern the matter of taxation exemption for the Fund and the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust and the charging of certain management costs to the Superannuation Fund. The Bill gives the Government power to provide by regulation that the Trust and the Fund may become liable to taxation. Judging from the Minister's second reading speech, the Government is likely to remove at least some of the current exemptions. We find it difficult to believe that the Government has not already given this matter substantial consideration and that it has in mind providing for the removal of some tax exemptions such as stamp duty, perhaps. In any event, we do not believe that the Government should conduct such procedures by stealth. If any action is taken in this regard an announcement should be made by the Minister, either in this House or publicly outside it, stating what is being done and why, rather than simply prescribing the regulation and giving it no publicity other than the formal gazettal required. The amendment providing for certain costs of management to be charged against the Fund is subject to a similar criticism. Here again, the amendment simply provides for regulations to prescribe that some costs can be charged against the Fund. Surely the Government has thought about this to the point where it knows what costs it wants to charge against the Fund and Trust and why. Yet we received no enlightment in the Minister's speech; no explanation as to why the legislation is being changed. If it is to be provided that costs such as sharebrokers' costs, mortgage preparation charges, estate agents' fees and the like are to be charged against the Fund, then the amendment would not seem unreasonable, but if all the costs of running the scheme were to be charged against it the impact on the Fund could be quite substantial. The Opposition considers that, during this debate, the Government should clarify its intentions in respect of these two matters of taxation and the allocation of costs. It shows contempt of the Parliament for the Government not to provide it with information as to why it is seeking certain powers when it is asking for Parliament's approval for those powers. One other matter of superannuation policy which is not covered strictly by this legislation but which impinges on it concerns contributors to the old scheme now transferred to the new scheme. The division of their total allocation as between basic and supplementary contributions has become a matter of some contention because contributors will have the option of taking the supplementary amount in cash when the distribution is completed later this year. The Government set up a committee to advise it on this and other related matters and the committee's report, known as the report of the Committee of Five, recommended by a three to two majority that a method of division be adopted that would provide a supplementary contribution and therefore the right to some cash refund to almost every contributor. The alternative method advocated by the minority, both of whom were actuaries, would have provided a supplementary contribution to only 30 per cent of the contributors and that 30 per cent would have tended to be the longest serving section of the Public Service, many of whom paid high proportions of their incomes into the Superannuation Fund before the new scheme was introduced. Not unnaturally, some of those contributors now feel that they should receive the best end of the deal and are plugging for the Government to reverse its acceptance of the majority report so that their cash refunds will be larger. However, the reality is that the peak organisation representing Australian Government employees, the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations, supports the majority report, as does the Superannuated Officers Association, although that is a very small organisation. The key point in all of this is that, whichever method is adopted, the total allocation to each individual contributor is not affected, and that may not be understood by some contributors, who believe that their past contributions are to be used to provide the supplementary contribution and hence cash refunds for other younger officers. These matters are very complex and confusion can easily arise. I believe that the Government would do a great service to all contributors if it took the trouble to explain more fully to them what it is doing and what theirrightsare. As things stand, the Government seems to be doing its best to be secretive, thereby causing great anxiety to many public servants nearing retirement. Finally, I request the Government to assist in the understandmg of this whole subject by reprinting the 1976 Act, as amended, as quickly as possible or at least to have the Commissioner for Superannuation issue a consolidation in the near future. This is decidedly difficult legislation to follow, especially now it is being amended considerably by this Bill. Without a comprehensive publication of the Act, as amended in one form or another, those people who are interested and involved in this area will have a difficult task in determining just what that the Parliament has decided.",36
63,Mr BRADFIELD,SUPERANNUATION ACTS," Iriseto support the amendments that the Government is making by the Superannuation Acts Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has said correctly, this is a lengthy and complicated Btil which deals mainly with machinery amendments or alterations in the drafting deficiencies which emerged from the 1976 legislation. The Bill consists of some 42 pages. While the amendments are all necessary to rectify these deficiencies that have emerged from the 1976 legislation, at the same time they amend many of the regulations contained in the original legislation that was passed through this House in 1922. The Bill honours an undertaking given by this Government in 1976 when the new scheme was commenced. The Government gave the undertaking at that time that if any shortcomings emerged in the operation of the scheme necessary remedial action would be taken. This legislation embodies the necessary remedial action. The Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) pointed out in his second reading speech that the changes contained in this Bill did not vary the basic benefit and structure of the scheme as introduced in 1976. Many Commonwealth public servants throughout the country will be pleased that those improved conditions brought in by the 1976 legislation remain unaltered. I should point out also to members of the Superannuation Fund that the relevant amendment still allows Fund members to receive automatically their future increased payments in accordance with increases in the consumer price index. This puts at rest previous reports which suggested that the provisions under which the Superannuation Fund operated would be altered so that future increases in payments would be based on the consumer price index increase or the increase in average weekly earnings, whichever was the lowest. If such an alteration had been made, Commonwealth public servants throughout the land would receive the worse of two pluses. I am pleased to say that the position remains as originally intended-that is, that automatic increases are based entirely on increases in the consumer price index. In my office in the electorate of Barton, I have received many calls from that concerned Commonwealth public servants who were worried that increased payments may be altered in the fashion that was suggested. These people in my electorate now can have the satisfaction of knowing that they will be treated it is fairly. I know that Commonwealth public servants in retirement throughout Australia will share in this satisfaction. The amendments also arrange for the old scheme to be wound up. Contributors who were members of the scheme prior to July 1976 at some time in the future will benefit from the proceeds of the winding up of the old scheme. Obviously, many other amendments are contained in the 42 pages of the Bill. They deal with rectifying the many anomalies that have shown up, particularly in regard to de facto relapart tionships and orphan chddren. The Minister said in his second reading speech: The Bill corrects an anomaly in regard to entitlements of children of those contributors who service before 1 July 1976. He went on to say: . . . children of deceased contributors aged 21 to 25 undergoing full time education will now be entitled benefits in the same circumstances as the children of pensioners who died prior to 1 July 1976. This is quite conect. The Minister went on to Appeals state: The 1976 amendments made spouses' benefits available to a wider range of persons including, under certain conditions, a de facto spouse and the spouse of a marriage retirement. As I have mentioned, the amendments rectify have that these anomalies and improve the scheme that was introduced in July 1976. In the explanatory memorandum attached to this Bill, the following or statement is made about the new scheme: The new scheme is, on the concept than the existing arrangements and, after the initial transitional stage, will be simpler to operate. This Btil confirms the Government's continuing House concern for the many Commonwealth public sershould vants to ensure that their conditions of employlems ment and their benefits such as superannuation keep pace with the employment conditions availGovernment's able in the private sector. It is extremely tant that we always take note of this fact. We must maintain always the working conditions of Commonwealth public servants whose work is very important so that they are not disadvandesirable-indeed taged in any way in relation to the working conditions and benefits provided in the private sector. I am pleased to say that the amendments contained in this Bill do just that. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.",38
64,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,SUPERANNUATION ACTS,"in reply- I thank the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) for reminding the House of the benefits that will flow from the Superannuation Acts Amendment Bill. As he said, it carries out an obligation which we gave that if the superannuation scheme third time. needed adjustment or improvement we would not hesitate to do so. The Bill now before the House reflects discussions with Public Service unions and goes a long way towards sorting out the anomalies and the problems that have emerged during the period of the scheme's operation. I assure the Opposition spokesmen on Mr Viner: superannuation matters, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), that I will look very closely at the comments he made in speech this afternoon. There is no desire of the Government to be secretive about this matter. In fact, my desire in aU matters is to be as informative as I possibly can. In this matter it the benefit would be helpful if the Opposition were died in informed on every aspect. If there is more information that I can give the honourable member, I will do so. One problem has emerged. I refer to the questo tion of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Under the Bill the Administrative Tribunal will be composed of a presidential member- a judge-and two nonpresidential members. It has been put to me that some appeals could be unfortunately delayed if after there is a requirement that a presidential member- a judge-be available on all occasions. My first reaction was that perhaps we should not requirement in the Bill. But if it were deleted we could be in the position in which the non-presidential members could, either directly indirectly, be beneficiaries of the superannuation scheme. Therefore, it may not be desirable contributions side, simpler in for people in that capacity to sit on a tribunal and to adjudicate on a particular matter. I inform the that the Government is now considering that matter. If there is a view that the legislation be amended, bearing in mind the probthat have emerged, I will inform the honourable member for Gellibrand of the decision. The Btil brings about a imporcommendable improvement. As the honourable member for Barton said, it in no way changes the basic benefits. In fact it improves what is a very , a generous-schem e for the Public Service. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recomappropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a NA NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 15 March, on motion by That the House take not of the paper.",39
65,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH CARE,"This his paper was presented to the House on 15 March. on the Because the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) spoke at some length on that day summarising the paper and providing some options, I took the opportunity to speak immediately after he had spoken. This is a disadvantage now because it means that I have only five minutes to speak on this paper after having read it. When I spoke on 15 March I had not had the opportunity to have a good look at the paper. I wish to reiterate a couple of points. The first is that, from a poliucal point of view, it is terribly important to realise that whdst Medibank is considered to be a big issue, it is not the main issue so far as health costs are concerned. It is silly to blame Medibank. I have given the House the figures before, and they appear again in this paper. The year before Medibank was introduced the increase in health care costs in Austraha was 36.8 per cent. The year after Medibank was introduced the rate of increase dropped to 27 per cent. I am not suggesting that 27 per cent is a good rate of increase, but the point I am making is that long before Medibank was introduced there was a significant increase in health care costs. The Minister has, of course, acknowledged this fairly recently. The second point is that there were large increases in payments for medical rebates year before Medibank was introduced. There was an increase of 51 per cent in amount paid out by private funds, and the private funds were the only ones insuring. It is elsewhere, important for us to remember that by altering insurance Medibank or by altering fund payments we do health not necessarily affect total health care expendion our ture. I think many honourable members would each like to affect that expenditure, but I am not convinced that health care expenditure is excessive although I agree that it is excessive for what we get in return. I do not necessarily agree that health care expenditure ought to be less than the 7.5 per cent of the gross domestic product that it what has now reached in Australia. Excellent argu- 'best' ments can be put that if anything it ought to be method higher, but I do not have time to go mto that services. today. The important point is that there are three basic methods of payment for health care. These are direct payments by the patient at the time of receiving the service, payment by contribution to insurance schemes which basically spread the risk over a larger number of people in the community or over the whole community and, finally, through taxation by which some patients pay more and some patients pay less, depending on their incomes. Most of the debate in Australia over the last few years basically has been on the mix of those methods of payment. Inasmuch as those methods of payment affect the actual quality and efficiency of health care delivery it is important to argue about them. Otherwise I do not think it is important to argue about them. It is much more important to argue about the methods of improving health care delivery and improving the effectiveness of health care delivery, and I am pleased to say that the Minister at least and, hopefully, members of the Cabinet now realise that blaming Medibank is not the solution to the problem. Obviously what happened was that the back bench believed the propaganda during the election campaign that all our troubles and the high cost of health care were caused by Medibank. Therefore, they came to the obvious, simple solution that they would abolish Medibank completely and that would be the solution to the problem. Of course that is not true, never has been true and the Minister now agrees with me on that point. In the two minutes that I have left to me I want to draw the attention of the House to Appendix III of the paper. Appendix III deals with a national health insurance project and what ought to be done before any changes are made. It is important to remember that we should not the make any changes untU we have information about the possible effect of those changes. that year in the Appendix III states: A3.1 There is very Jittle analysis available in Australia or to tell us what possible effects different health proposals would have on costs, on our usage of care, on the available supply of beds and doctors or 'health'. Thus the first gap is a detailed analysis of proposal to enable policymakers to make informed choices. They should know: how those arrangements increase or decrease the use of different services or the quality of the services provided: and how the use of these services ultimately affects 'health'. A3.2 We do not have any comprehensive data to tell us is the 'best' type of health insurance system, and the possible method of paying doctors, and the 'best' of financing hospitals and other community health A health insurance project would seek and analyse the needed data on all three aspects. A3.3 In most nations, until about the early 1970s, the general tendency has been for governments to initiate a new program, or change an old program, without any detailed analysis of the likely consequences of the change. Let us hope that this Government wtil not decide to initiate new programs or change the program significantly without knowing what is happening. Mr Deputy Speaker, because I do not have much more time to speak, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the rest of Appendix III, which is only two pages. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsA3.4 A national health insurance experiment (or project) would attempt to find answers to the following critical questions: (a) What is the effect on the individual and the families of health insurance arrangements which require them to pay a larger or smaller pan of the bill for health care, either at the point of contact, the total bill? In panicular, how does it affect their usage of different types of health care (e.g., hospitals, doctors' office visits, domiciliary care, self-care and so on)? (b) How would any changes affect the supply of these services? Would doctors work less, charge patients more or order tests more discriminately? Would the changes lead to more hospital beds, more nursing home beds and less of other services? doctors in particular communities or in cenain specialties? (c) How would these changes affect the health of the population? Can we develop a health insurance program which positively affects health by giving people access to new prevention programs or rewards them for ""good healthy living habits? In effective Health Protecuon Plan rather than an insurance plan? (d) What effect would any alternative scheme have on the costs of administration of private health insurance funds, Medibank, or other government depanments (for example, Taxation)? Would it require new forms, new accounting systems, new records systems, larger computers and more claims processors? (e) How will any proposed medical care received by people? Will it cause doctors to offer less treatment? Will hospitals be able to acquire needed equipment? A3.5 The steps involved in a Health Insurance Project might include the following: (a) selection of a random sample of Australian famiUes who would be eligible to participate; (b) offering of a number of Experimental Plans to these families, with each plan having a different combination of copayments, coinsurance rates and maximum expense Umits. Some of the Plans might include enrolling the famUies in any Prepaid Health ence, or even creating some; (c) families enrolled would submit claims (or medical expense repons) to the Project just as they would submit claims to a private health insurance company. The Project would pay these claims. The enrolled families would also be required to submit biweekly health repons questionnaires that collect informadon on use of health care, self-perceived health indicators. A3.6 There would be a need for a Project Team, to be involved in pre-enrolment interviews, enrolment and postenrolment interviews and surveys. The pre-enrolment phase would include a baseline interview of a large sample of families, with selection into the Health Insurance Project being on the basis of the informadon they repon in the baseline interview. This method ensures thatroughlyequal numbers are enrolled in each of the Experimental Plans offered. A3.7 The cost of the HIP would depend on how many Experimental Plans would be evaluated, how large a sample of individuals and families would be enrolled in the different Experimental Plans and the duration of the experiments. It is anticipated than an evaluation of the effects of the most feasible alternative Experimental Plans (perhaps 5 in number) could be completed within 18-24 months. A sample of up to 1,000 famUies would be adequate for such a project. Preliminary estimates suggest that the unit cost of each famUy's enrolment in the project would be the sum of the average premiums paid for health insurance at the moment plus whatever additional benefits are included in each Experimental Plan. In addition there would be costs of administering the project through the Projects Team. or in a higher percentage of",39

68,Mr CARLTON,HEALTH CARE,"I welcome the statement by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) on the containment of health costs. It is a welcome recognition that the problem will be other words, can we develop an tackled in another way or, we hope, will be freshly tackled this year. It may be a problem which will require further attention in successive years. It is a problem where there is difficulty in separating emotion from fact, not only amongst the conflicting interests involved in the health profession but also amongst the patients themchanges affect the quality of selves. It can always be said with a great deal of force that when somebody is ill they are often in an emotional state. They are not in any position to consider costs effectively. They are in a very weak position in relation to the suppliers of health services, and there is also an understandable need on the part of parents and children or relatives and friends to provide for the person who is sick the best possible attention without immediate regard to the cost. If we continue that view through the whole of the management of our health services we run into considerable Plans that were then in existdifficulty. Therefore, there is the unhappy acin each of the Experimental Plans knowledgement- I think we all approach this conclusion very reluctantly-that there must be some containment of costs at the point of ordering of each service so that there is some concern for the cost of that service. to the project, i.e., brief That is an awfully simple thing to say in the status of the family and other relative calm of this chamber, but it is an awfully difficult thing to apply at the time of an illness or an accident. Nonetheless I think we must look the problem in the eye. The Minister's statement makes it quite clear that this Government already has begun to tackle this problem in a very substantial way. Whilst the proportion of our gross domestic product being devoted to health services has increased substantially over recent years, there is some indication that a halt already has been called to the rapid expansion of that as a percentage of the gross domestic product. The Government certainly has a responsibility to ensure that we get value for money spent. Every health dollar spent must be spent wisely. We must balance the conflicting claims of efficiency in the provision of health services and the social equity which we must, as a matter of pohcy, apply to the whole area. Despite Government acdon to date, there are stdl pretty severe problems in the whole health area. I think it is fair to acknowledge within this chamber that some of them go back a very long way. Very many of them were introduced as fresh problems during the period of administrauon of the present Opposition, but I think it is fair to acknowledge that some of the difficulties go back to the original health schemes introduced in the early 1950s. I think the present Minister for Health in his approach to these problems is certainly mindful of the fact that it is a very complicated area and it will be difficult to get the best possible solution. Once we have a solution proposed not everybody will like it. What are these pretty severe problems in the whole system? Firstiy, there are certainly declining marginal benefits from additional expenditure. From looking at the vast increase in health costs over the last seven or eight years as a percentage of the gross domestic product, it is hard to say or to produce evidence that there has been any substantial improvement in the health of Austrahans. There have been vast increases in expenditure and no clear evidence of improved health. Also, there are no agreed measures of the effectiveness of health services. R. B. Scotton, writing in the Australian Quarterly of June 1977, said: The conceptual and practical put measurement are such that it is most unlikely that, for health services as a whole, broad pohcy choices can ever be based on firm calculations of costs and benefits. However far we go into this subject we will be left with making certain rough and crude judgments based on the evidence at the time and without looking forward to that oasis or that mirage of effective measurement of benefits. Just to make things difficult, there are also what I believe to be corrupting- I do not say 'corrupt'-influence s within the existing system. Under the present financing arrangements for health costs, patients often do not give any more real attention to the expenditure of, say, $9 on the provision of professional services for themselves or their children than they would give to spending $9 on going to a MCDonald's restaurant with the family for an evening meal rather than having it at home. This is an unfortunate thing, because the provision of health services for a fantily is one of the most serious expenditures that any family should approach. The future need as regards health services is something that each family should sit down and think about in a very responsible manner. Under the arrangements which have built up over the last few years, it is possible in many circumstances for people to approach this situation without any regard, literally, for the cost. That, I say, is a corrupting influence. It leads to an attitude of mind which inevitably means a more expensive health service and in many respects a less effective one. We also see these corrupting influences within the professions. I have no doubt that there are many instances where people go out of their way to abuse the system. These abuses are the subject of continuing inquiry by the Government and its agencies. There are unfortunate examples of people being charged with offences and so on. I am sure that these apply in only a minority of cases and, of course, they have to be tackled. More important than those studied abuses are the ones which arise out of the corrupting influences of the system. I submit that each time a doctor decides that pathological tests or tests of some other kind are necessary for a patient or that some reference to a specialist who provides a fairly expensive service is necessary, there is a corrupting influence at work if virtually no financial restraint is placed on the making of that decision. Over a long period this gradually produces a rot in the system which leads to unnecessary expenditures and also to those services not being valued in the way that they should be. difficulties involved in outAspects of the system which lead to this kind of treatment are the bulk billing provisions, which, except in the case of pensioners, are very damaging and difficult aspects of the present system, and referrals, where there is a maximum gap of only $5 to be paid by the patient and where, in effect, the general practitioner can refer people to a specialist without any real concern for the cost of the professional service. A multiplicity of tests can be asked for. That presents particular difficulties in the hospital area. Doctors resident in a hospital or visiting specialists have a capacity to order, virtually without any control by the patient or external agencies, a wide variety of services of enormous cost. I do not have the time to cite individual cases this afternoon, but if one examines the performances in different hospitals one is surprised by the incredible variation one sees in the cost per patient for relatively similar diseases and conditions just because of the differing ordering patterns of the staff within those hospitals. Hospitalisation in itself also can be part of this corrupting influence. The very fact that hospital beds are avaUable seems to be one of the main determinants of their use. If we examine the comparativefiguresfor the States-w efindthese in the Sax report that is before us for discussion-w e find that in Victoria the number of hospital beds per head of population is substantially less than the number of hospital beds per head of population in the other States. There is no evidence that I have been able to find,and I have searched for it, of any increased rate of mortality or morbidity within the State of Victoria as a result of fewer hospital beds being avaUable per head of population. In Queensland the cost per head of population of hospital accommodation is less than that in any other State. I think that it is the lowest. Victoria is the next up the scale, and the other States are substantially above that. Yet, with the exception of certain isolated and Aboriginal communities in Queensland, there is no evidence of any greater morbidity or mortality rates there as a result of there being a lower cost per head of population for hospital beds. All these influences within the present system, where there is very little immediate control over the incurring of public costs and also over the private costs of insured patients, are leading to a system in which the professions themselves can be corrupted. Unfortunately they begin to be corrupted not only in the undue expenditure of moneys but also in their approach to their professional tasks. I recognise that in some instances there are very grave difficulties and that it is not possible in a legal sense for people to be too careful in this regard. For example, in casualty departments of hospitals at weekends junior members of the medical profession usually have to deal in turn with cases that are, to put it bluntly, quite undeserving and cases of accident or immediate concern. There is a necessity for those junior staff to cover themselves legaUy, often by referring pretty well every patient to a specialist, at some considerable cost to the public purse and also to private insurance. Perhaps that problem can be looked at more carefully because that procedure as it is commonly adopted in casualty departments leads to quite excessive expenditure on unnecessary specialist treatment. In general the problems of referrals and of corrupting influences has to be examined from a cost point of view. I believe that a closer look at costs by those ordering the services also wtil lead to a better professional approach within the purely professional context. What are the major costs about which we are concerned? As far as I can make out from the figures provided by the Minister for Health from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for costs incurred by the nation in 1976-77, about $5,800m was involved. Of that total some $3,380m was incurred as institutional costs and, of course, the biggest amount, $2,540m, was incurred in general hospitals. Non-institutional costs which would include for the most part medical and dental services, amounted to about $2 billion. Other smaller amounts made up the total of nearly $6,000m. How can we do something about each of these areas? With institutional costs in the short term maybe all we can do is to clamp down budget-wise on the institutions themselves and try to force them to allocate their avaUable dollars in a more satisfactory way. In the longer term we have to look carefully at the number of beds available and see whether we should be providing additional beds irrespective of the need as it is determined area by area. With reference to medical expenses, I think we have to look once again at the gap and see whether there should be any insurance for the gap. Also I think we have to look at the elimination of bulk billing and the Medibank ceding. I believe that people in higher income groups should be forced to insure privately. We should look at the percentage of each account paid by the patient,. These are very difficult problems. I would have liked to have avaUable moretimein which to speak about them in detail but I hope that the Minister will look at them as we approach the Budget considerations.",41
69,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH CARE,"It is rather disappointing that the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton), in the last one and a half minutes ofhis speech, offered solutions which appear to be limited to clamping down on the budgets for hospitals, the availability of beds and the patient's pocket and increasing the gap which the patient has to pay. I do not have any ready-cut solutions. I think that a reading of the conclusions of the paper would indicate that it is a rash person who offers readycut solutions and that there wtil be a long haul in working out solutions to these problems which I think the indications show wtil get worse before they get better, even though we undertake a strenuous program of investigation, education and consultation with all the groups involved. Like the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), I am not sure that it is inappropriate to have 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product devoted to health care. After all, as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) said in his maiden speech, we Uve in not only a postindustrial society but one in which the mix of primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary and quinary industries is changing rapidly. We have to expect that labour intensive services such as health care will eat up a continually increasing proportion of gross domestic product in the foreseeable future. The more we computerise and the more we mechanise, the more we will have to pay for individual services. I suppose it is true that as inflation increases the increasing costs ought to be shared among those people who are now called upon to pay the costs of health services, including to some extent in many respects the patients themselves. It is appropriate to look at spreading that load equitably among the various categories of patients other than the rather simple division we now have of those patients who are on pensions and those who are not and one or two other minor categories along those Unes. I am not averse and I feel that the Opposition assess would not be averse to some consideration of calower pacity to pay in looking at the contributions mentioned derived from people. In fact the original we could include Medibank concept recognised this in the matter of the levy contribution. When that was denied erations by the Senate the alternative was adopted of rates funding the contributions from general which is derived to a large extent from income referred. Again there tax levied according to capacity to not inappropriate to say tiiat the gap or other think there is a far morethis out-of-pocket expenses of the patient also ought economies if the people who are responsible to be related to the capacity to pay. Such schemes as the subsidised health benefit scheme and the pensioner medical service are partial recognition clerical of this. But they are fairly superficial cosmetic be funded steps. There are Umits to how much such schemes the referral, can take care of the problem because relief of pubUc funds is to be derived the the cost must be taken from the higher income segment of the community. It is a very small minpractice ority and prohibitively high would have to be imposed on it to make a very significant impact. I do not think that offers much of a solution. Certainly, as the honourable member for Mackellar and other people over the years have pointed out, increasing the contribution of the patient has the advantage of placing some deterhospital rent to overuse of health care services by the patient. If the doctor is considering that burden on the patient it also offers some deterrent to overuse of services when the doctor knows that he will be unpopular if he increases the out-ofhospital pocket cost to his patient. The doctor may be deterred from giving too many referrals for complicated tests, expensive procedures and operations of doubtful benefit. However, again there are limits to how much difference that sort of fiddling with the contribution of the patient will make to overall costs. Some doctors are btithely unaware and in fact are rather proud of the fact that they ignore the aspect of the cost to the patient. Their attitude seems to be, particularly in the more affluent areas which have always had a higher concentration of doctors, that 'if the patient cannot afford to pay the fee he should go public; don't come to me; I give you only the best care.' Very often the unspoken corollary is: 'It is going to cost you'. One serious deficiency in the information that is fed to the Government and to those people who have to try to design better schemes and to contain costs is that the private health insurance industry has not taken any initiative to develop claims review procedures which would help to just where economies can be made and where claims perhaps ought to be funded at a level of benefit. Such things have been as routine circumcisions; and perhaps such treatments as cosmetic opand ones that are least medically necessary for one reason or another. Perhaps lower revenue, ationsoftobenefit which could be.specified for those operthe conclusions of the paper is only a small proportion pay. So it is of operations with which can be done and I significant chance of for incurring the costs are involved, instead of trying, as it were, bureaucratically or by executive action to point out categories that should at a lower rate. The doctor who makes who orders the procedure, who if any great orders the admission bulk of it should be involvedtoinhospital the or who prolongs review procedure. Not only should there be a peer review of doctors in this regard but also aofhospi-the rates of contribution tal review. very In the days when hospitals were far more embattled and limited in their funding and their resources it was generally accepted by doctors that the medical superintendent or an official with some responsibility for the budgeting of the hospital could lean on doctors even in the use of facilities for private patients. Doctors accepted this as a reasonable thing because they realised that the funds and the facilities were limthe ited and that they were dependent on the good will and the provision of these services from the sector of health care. Now that it seems that doctors are more incUned to assert that all facilities of unlimited standards must be made available at their behest and theirs only this is becoming a little more difficult. A long and patient re-education process will be required in consultation with Australian Medical Association spokesmen and other spokesmen of the prescribing professions to work out a mutually responsible formula whereby there wtil be peer review and also a review by those who are responsible for providing the facilities that doctors use and to which doctors seek access. I refer mainly to hospital services. Doctors themselves cannot be the only people involved in the review process. It is not only peer review; it is also total health authority review in consultation with others. It should certainly involve all those in the health care team including lay people who take an interest in health care. In the old days we had hospital boards. We are moving now to things such as community health centre committees and the various community welfare organisations which have an interest in a particular kind of disability and an interest in ting up a service fbr persons with particular diseases and handicaps. All of these consumer organisations-let us call them that; I refer also to associations of hospital patients in particular hospitals and parent and child care organisations-shoul d be brought into that review procedure. Not only should we include State and Federal authorities, local governments, hospital boards and the various professionals but also the consumers. It is not just peer review or just a system review; it is a communityreview.The review is a tall order. It is complicated and difficult. It will not be done for peanuts. A lot of the increased health costs should be going into expanding evaluation more rapidly than, I believe, the rate of growth of the gross domestic product devoted to health care. We should be looking at the evaluation, the communication and the deliberation as the major growth area that is called for in solving these problems and at rationalising facilities, techniques, attitudes and standards of behaviour by individuals in health care services. One of the most urgent areas outside the hospital institutionalised sphere- I am moving into the more professional relationships sphere-is the need to prevent an unnecessary oversupply of doctors as it is expressed in the cussion paper. I suggest that this matter does not relate just to the supply of the doctors; it relates to demand. If we can demonstrate to the consumers that paramedical people such as nurse practitioners can in many cases give them more satisfactory and more prompt services and can more easily communicate on human level than can the top professional who is very often rushed, busy and highly technical in his language and even brusque they may not want a fully qualified doctor for a lot of their health care problems as the point offirstcontact. If this idea can be implemented, particularly in the public hospital sector, it will lead to greater job satisfaction for doctors let alone a greater economy for patients and health departments. It will often provide far better preventive and educational services which have been stressed in the paper as a high priority. It will tie in better with the community involvement I spoke of such as in the health centre committees. If we can lessen the ivory tower specialisation we will get some economies, a better service and a better individual responsibility. There is not only a responsibility for saving money but also a responsibility for one's own health. I believe that one thing that has to be looked at if we are to get the co-operation of doctors is a setsystem of incentives to economise. One incentive has been referred to briefly in the discussion paper as the health maintenance organisation formula. Also I think we can offer specific incentives to doctors in the existing system of practice if we facilitate the use of computer integration of doctors' records to get the information we want. I think this would be a big help in getting the information we badly need.",43
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH CARE,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,45
71,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH CARE,"Firstly , I commend the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who is present during this debate, for instructing the Hospital and Health Services Commission to carry out this study and present this discussion paper on health carefinancing.Secondly I commend the Minister for the encouragement he has given-this is witnessed now by the debate which is taking place-for public discussion on the general question of health costs, health insurance and the sharing of health costs. He has referred to this matter in various Press releases. He has said that he wants the public genuinely and as much as possible to seriously consider the important question of increasing health costs. I also dis- commend Dr Sax. This study was his last job as chairman of the now disbanded Hospital and Health Services Commission. I wish him well with the new social welfare policy secretariat. The Minister in a Press release and in a statement accompanying the tabling of this discussion paper refers to the question of accelerating health costs. In a Press statement of 7 March the Minister said: A significant drop in the rate of increase in health occurred since 1 October 1976 which is a direct result Government's modifications to the health insurance system. Therefore, the Government's poUcies are working, but needs to be done to curb the the costs of health care. Thefiguresshow a preliminary mate of total national health expenditure in 1976-77 $6,254m compared with $5,224m in 1975-76 and in 1974-75. This represents an increase in 1976-77 per cent over expenditure the previous year compared with an increase of 36.6 per cent in 1974-75 and 27.1 per 1975-76. A comparison of the proportion of the gross estic product represented by the total health expenditure over the last four years Ulustrates the point. In 1973-74, the percentage of GDP was 5.92 per cent. 1974-75, the percentage was 6.83 percent. In 1975-76, percentage of GDP was 7.38 per cent. In 1976-77, the percentage of GDP was 7.67 per cent. In examining those figures wefindthe proportion of Gross Domestic Product increased by 15.4 per cent in 1974-75 the previous year. In 1975-76, the increase was 8.1 per cent while last the increase dropped dramatically to 3.9 per cent. He then details some of the measures the Government has taken to reduce this accelerextremes. ation in health care costs. In the same Press release he refers to measures taken: To curb abuses of the system by both doctors and patients through the use of unnecessary ogy services; to end the open-ended nature of the wealth financial commitment to the States under the hospital cost-sharing arrangements; to restore the competitrictions tive position of private hospitals by ensuring that hospital charges were raised to more realistic levels; to ensure that benefits are no longer paid to reUeve ments, public authorities and employees of costs that but for Medibank, have been borne by them; to legislate that insurers accept their responsibiUty in workers sation and third party insurance cases; to introduce improvements to the Nursing Home Benefits Scheme to give financial security to all patients and share the financial with the private health funds. In the statement accompanying the presenpay. tation of this discussion paper, the Minister again referred to these issues. He makes the point: This Discussion Paper demonstrates that the causesThat is, for the escalation in health costs: . . . are varied and interrelated. The trend towards and more of the nation's resources being devoted care is consistent with the trend in almost all developed countries of the world. However, placency in Australia. There is no reason for complacency simply beThoseyear cause we are going the same way as other nations and are experiencing the same problems that face them. In the discussion paper and the many other papers that have been presented in the recent past on this problem of accelerating health care costs, the point is made that this is a universal problem. People's expectations run ahead of the ability of government or of themselves as private individuals to pay for the technology-the costs has increasing specialisation-of a modern health of the care system. This is understandable to a certain extent because of the logical fear oftilhealth that more any person can hold and the belief that if he or continuing overall increase in estishe can get the best that is available in the world as it should be obtained at all costs. The point is $4,109m made by various people that some form of of 19.7 rationing is essential. In the extremes, we have, cent in first, the capitalist form of rationing, which dommeans that certain people cannot afford to pay for all the necessary health care; therefore the total percentage of gross domestic product atIn tributable to health is kept down. The other exthe treme is the socialist answer which, in its severest form, means simply that the overall percentage of the GDP attnbutable to health costs is resover tricted and the system is allowed to ration itself. The result is the same, in the sense that there is year, some restriction on entry to and use of the health system. As I see it, in Australia we have tried to which steer a middle course between these two Canada is probably the best example of another country trying to steer the same course as we are trying to steer. Canada ran into this probservices, particularly patholCommonlem a few years ahead of us and at the present original time is endeavouring to impose some partial resor disincentives to try to restrict the acpublic celeration in health care costs and is doing so in govern the same way as we are thinking of taking some would, of these steps at present. We have the dilemma so of people having a contradictory view: On the compenone hand they say that more should be done for major them with health care costs but somehow or load other it is not they as taxpayers or individuals who should pay; it is somebody else who should To a certain extent, that attitude was sustainable in relation to government generally in the 1950s and the 1960s, up to the time of the decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries-OPEC-that because of increasing productivity or affluence in most Western more nations, it was possible to have a bit both ways. to health Government expenditure on a whole range of services, including health, could be increased but there is no reason for comthe individual was still left with a real increase each days in the level of disposable income. are past. Health is not the only area of government expenditure in which we must face up to this new situation. I would suggest that equally, those responsible for education expenditure should be called upon to accept a greater degree of accountability for the increasing percentage of government expenditure that is required in that area, particularly when one looks at the new demographic projections which reveal that our population is not increasing at the rate at which it was suggested a few years ago it would increase. A whole range of recommendations in the health and education areas are no longer appropriate or valid as a result of the slower growth in our population. A further question concerns people becoming dependent on government to solve all of their problems. Government cannot solve all of the problems that people face. There is a patientconsumer responsibility just as there is a government responsibility. A further responsibility rests upon those engaged in the health care profession. Dr Sax refers to this aspect in dealing with cost sharing by patients. Really both sides of the Parliament to a certain degree accept this point. He states: The questions that remain to be settled are not whether not patients should pay a share of the costs, but how them they should pay and whether or not everybody should pay the same charges. In other words, there is some degree of agreehave ment between the two sides; the what degree should the patient bear this charge both in relation to responsibility to bim as an individual and as a disincentive to unnecessary health care usage by him. In some recommendations-no t necessarily from Dr Sax but others that are available at the moment-the question of patient co-sharing of costs relates not just to medical costs but also hospitalisation costs. In other words, the arg ment is that there should not be a complete form of insurance for those who can afford to pay for their hospital charges. There appears to be limit agreement with one of the recommendations by Dr Sax, which is supported by the submissions of the Voluntary Health Insurance Association, against the use of front end deductibles for the purpose of patient responsibility. They both efficiency. question whether that would achieve its desired taken is to modify end. Dr Sax refers to the point in this fashion: ' Deductible' may either be a sum of money which paid during any period of time before the insurer will all or pan of the balance or number of specified services. He goes on to make the point that if we have only a small deductible, such as $50 to $ 100 each year, really that will have no great effect on hospital expenses. It is hospital expenses which make up the largest percentage of total health care expenses in this country. However, if the figure is far higher than $50 $100-say, $400 or $500-the likely result is that it would have a significant effect but the action would be socially unjust. The amount involved might be high enough to deter those who would be seeking advice. There does appear to be some agreement from some areas that, although there should be a greater degree of patient responsibility in payment for a percentage of health care costs, the argument in relation to the front end deductible proposal is not the right one. Really, the responsibility must go beyond the patient. I believe that the laws of supply and demand are reversed in the medical or health care situation. The closest anology might be drawn with Parkinson's law on the bureaucracy. I cannot remember the quotation exactly, but it really boils down to the demand increasing to meet the supply; in other words, if a certain number of hospital beds are available they will be filled and, if there are a certain number of doctors, those doctors will see that patients continue to or return often enough to ensure that they have admuch of equate income. A point is made on this aspect in relation to the supply of doctors in Australia and the answer is the same that Canada seems to come to with respect to the supply of and question is: To the demand on doctors. A further question arises in relation to what happens once the patient gets into the system. He goes to his GP and, from that point, the responsibility is largely out ofhis hands. He believes that he must do what isrightas recommended for his health. The responsibility is then transferred to the speciaUst and also to the hospital in relation to to its admission policy, the length of the patient's "" stay, and, among other things, the tests to be caru ried out while the patient is there. The question of trying to achieve responsibility in seeking to increasing health care costs rests to a large extent on those in the health care profession. I do not believe that those in that profession have accepted that degree of responsibUity to this stage. Another question to be considered is hospital One action that the government has the 50 per cent proportion of hospital costs that it pays in common with the must be States. My understanding is that the States have cover not sorted out new forms of budgeting arrangeit may be the costs of a panicular ments which encourage incentive and efficiency at the individual hospital level. To the credit of the present Minister for Health, since becoming Minister he has pushed ahead with the accreditation of hospitals, with utilisation review and peer review generally, which at present rests with the Australian Medical Association, to come back to the Minister in some acceptable form. I repeat to the point that there is a great responsibiUty on those in the system to accept accountability. I make the point that I think would be correct for any modern government in the Western world that where a group or a profession is given chance to do something about self-regulation and accountability it is very wise to accept that which is given to it otherwise government wdl do that for it. I believe there is a clear message what the Minister has put to the profession at the present dme, because the profession itself has accept that it has not some sort of open-ended arutilising rangement with a distant government. The same people who make use of the system talk in the same breath about paying too much tax or, as see from dme totimeunder the present arrangements, an increasing temptation within the profession to become involved in corruption. Many suggestions have been put forward in increase the Sax paper. Some of them are short term, such which as the question of updating patient payments increasewould with safeguards of course for are not in a position to pay. I for one believe we must have some son of universal base for our of the increase in surgical health insurance system. There is also tion of overall budget restrictions, but really must look at the long-term effects which to me, particularly in the hospital area, offer a greater possibility of more effective action, accreditation utilisation review incentive budgeting and so forth. To me it is essential that in our desire to ology restrict increasing public expenditure care we do not do this just by transferring costs from the public sector to the private We have to do something that is constructive and patient needs it or not. It shouldof have a structure that will contain overall costs. This will take time and will take the co-operation sponsibility to decide that they do not needreof government, the professions and themselves. We are hindered by a lack of hard statistics in many of the crucial areas. Any review of health insurance which follows the Sax paper-the Government's concern in this area is obvious-shoul d be considered and staged so that the right decisions are made at appropriatetime.I believe the Australian public is rather confused at the present time because the rapid changes that have taken place in health care over the last seven years.",45

73,Dr CASS,HEALTH CARE,"This cussion paper on paying for health care prepared by the Hospitals and Health Services Comcosts mission presents some of the relevant statistics and information necessary for establishing effective and efficient policy for health care Australia. As the Commission itself noted, there remain glaring gaps in our data. It would obvious that to make major changes to the the present system before completing the data base would be foolhardy in the extreme. For example, where are the statistics on the rate of increase in general practitioner services over, say the last ten in years? This is the area in which basically the patient initiates service. We are told often that to the whole problem is caused by patients overservices. Where are the statistics to show that there has in fact been an increase compared with, say, the rate of increase in specialist serwe vices of various sorts and hospital services? John Deeble recentiy made an estimate of thesefigures.He thought that there had been an over about the last, I think, ten years of about 20 per cent in general practitioner services, hardly account for the dramatic in costs.

I It simply means that the cannot afford it. I will not sector. have it', without any estimate be whether the the doctor's judgment in those areas, not the patients' a the patients specialist consultation. The Commission's paper singles out private health funds for criticism for their lack of cooperation in providing statistics on claims for health benefits, and rightly so. If the private the funds are concerned to prove that the present system is more efficient than the original of Medibank, with its comprehensive system of data collection, then they should be willing to provide the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) with all the information he requests. The continual suggest an inability on the part of some funds and an unwillingness on the part of others to provide the required information. disMany of the recommendations made by the Commission in this paper relate to containing in institutions-the most expensive part of the system-and on pilot projects into systems of an healthfinancing.The key role of the doctor in in utilising health services and his absolute discretion in this regard are recognised by the Comseem mission. There are recommendations on the monitoring of the medical profession's performance, for example, via peer review, accreditation and medical audit. The discussion paper recognises that the community cannot afford to let the health professionals name their own price. The Commission, to a large extent, shies off the fundamentally important issue of how to contain doctor initiated services or doctor initiated over-utilisation. The paper singles out the methods of paying the doctor as the significant factor in the demand for service andfindsthat 'it is the doctor who is, and must be, the 'gatekeeper' of the system. Incentives for cost control should be aimed at his behaviour'. It points out that there are advantages to the doctor in the fee-for-service system of payment. This is set out at page 34. It states: The major criticisms that have been raisedThat is, against the fee-for-service systeminclude references to the possibilities that this form ment encourages inessential procedures, visits, tests, rals, and hospitalisation; the use of better paid procedures rather than equally effective but cheaper alternatives; discouragement of substitution of less expensive personnel, such as nurses and social workers, even when this may propriate; and the lack of influence on maldistribution doctors. We should note that all of these are costly features in the present inadequate health care system. The Commission concludes that 'there is need for Austraha to pursue evaluation of alternatives to fee-for-service systems'. Where this statement to be seen in the recommendaefficacy. tions? It just disappeared. Was it considered, only to be put into the too-hard basket because lations of the opposition of the medical profession? This opposition of the medical profession was spelt out at page 13 of the discussion paper in the lowing words: The doctorsfightfor the retention of private medical tice on a fee-for-service basis way to preserve their authority, independence, status income. Many believe that it is in the best interests of patients. That is a belief, I dare to suggest, which does stand up to scientific analysis or statistical analyprograms. sis. Has the superior quahty of medical care on fee-for-service basis, compared with salaried vice, ever been demonstrated? I have never seen such a study. Some of the criticisms listed by the Commission in the discussion paper confirm my view. The fee-for-service system is a method of payment which pays the doctor for seek treating an illness, not for keeping people well. The uncharitable could argue that under this sysresponsibilities tem the doctor has a vested interest beingtilor, as Ivan Illych implied, in causing ness. Many experts argue that higher quality care at a lower cost would be possible via preventive care rather than treatment of episodic illness. The Commission's discussion paper concluded that 'prevention of illness and disability accompanied by effective health education, has the greatest long-term potential for containing the general inflation of health expenditures'. What happens to preventive care in the present system? The doctor who wishes to practise medicine in this way with the emphasis on keeping people healthy isfinanciallypenalised under the fee-forservice system. He cannot charge anyone for conducting health education sessions on nutrition or preventing accidents or on home care of minor dlnesses. He cannot charge for not giving people repeat prescriptions for valium and sending them to a counsellor instead. He cannot charge for referring a patient to more appropriate allied health personnel such as social workers or of payphysiotherapists. Under the fee-for-service sysrefertem, the more patients seen and the more services performed in thetimeavailable the greater the the doctor's income. Who in the community could resist the temptation to boost his income, be apparticularly when over servicing can be so easily of represented as commendable diligence on behalf of one's patients? The report notes that incentives to preventa ative care within a well insured fee-for-service practice, could lead to no more than an upsurge is of so-called secondary prevention of doubtful This involves the early detection of disease by screening large sympton-free popuat great cost, for little benefit. Such clinics are already operating in Sydney and probably in Melbourne and are of doubtful value in helping folto maintain the health of the community. But they are very good businesses-highl y profitable. The report argues that preventive care will pracobtain much better results through public sector not only because that is the best and intervention rather than by providing additional their incentives in private practice. That is true. A pubUc health education program must be developed not and evaluated along with other prevention But incentives could be offered to doca tors if a different method of payment were being serused. The Government should look hard at setting up pilot projects to test the efficacy of this proposition. In its chapter on alternative health tend to care systems the report states: There is evidence that the dilemma faced by those who to pool consumer risks effectively without inflating health care costs cannot be solved in a system in which for pooling and for supplying services are in people totally divorced. illIn other words, an insurance system which is divorced from the responsibility of supplying the services cannot solve the problem of increasing health care costs. This is the nub of the problem of health care costs in Austraha. Put another way: The doctors who are responsible for supplying the service have no responsibibty for collecting and pooling the costs. The report examines pre-paid group practice, particularly the health maintenance organisation. The report concludes: Best results are reported from Prepaid Group Practices without fee-for-service payments expected from scriber or the managing organisation. Or, I might add, without fee-for-service payment to the treating doctor because that is inherent those studies. I will give a couple of examples. an article in the Social Security Bulletin of May 1976 entided 'Contrasts in HMO and Fee-forution Service Performance', the finding is given that hospital use was significantly lower in group practice plans than in fee-for-service systems. the group practice plans the doctors were on salaries. I wdl give some of the figures. In a group practice the annual rate of admissions per thouto sand people was 46. In the 'controls'-that is, practices where the doctors worked on a fee-forments. service basis-the admission rate was 114. There was not much difference in the average length stay, the figures being 7.4 days per patient for group practice and 7.7 days for the 'controls'. it is not that the patients admitted on the recomwill mendation of doctors on a salary for a shortertime.That is not true. The length of time is the same. The fact of the matter is that fewer people are put in hospital. We have been told by a number of people that it is in the tional areas that most of the costs are incurred. The article to which I have referred states: Surgical rates reveal similar patterns. The rates for practice plansThat is, salaried doctorswere half those of their controls. That is a very significant figure. Another recent example is the figures that were published in vinced August 1977 by the Foundation for Health Care runaway costs Evaluation. It usted the patient days in hospital munity. It is notof per thousand of population in various cities, such iour of patients. Patients as New York, where the patients treated on a consult a general practitioner. fee-for-service basis numbered 1,495 and St pens from then on-if excessive Paul-Minneapolis, where thefigurewas 1,391. occurs-is the responsibility of the medical In Chicago thefigurewas 1,390. A number of titioner. If we are suffering excessive health other major cities are listed and thefiguresare in about the same. They range from 1,395 to 848. Only one city had afigurebelow 1,000. I ask honourable members to compare those admission rates with the admission rate for patients treated by health maintenance organisations where the doctors were on salary. In St PaulMinneapolis, the twin cities, the admission rate was only 561 compared with thefigureof 1,391 for the twin cities for doctors operating on a feefor-service basis. Throughout the whole of America, taking thefigurefor all the health maintenance organisations, the hospital admission rate was only 450. There is an enormous reduction in the hospitalisation of patients when doctors are on salaries compared with when docthe subtors are paid on a fee-for-service basis. The Commission recommends Government support for such organisations, but, as their apin plication has been possibly only in limited areas In of the United States, many suggest that to look to health maintenance organisations for a total solwould be a mistake. That avoids an analysis of why the health maintenance organisations have spread so slowly. The reason is simple: No In one makes enormous profits out of health maintenance organisations. No one is willing to push them or to peddle them because there is no profit be made by the entrepreneurs. If they are to be in pushed they will have to be pushed by governMost of them are associated with large community hospitals. In a country where most of of the medical practice is private and where the the whole ethos is a fee-for-service medical practice, So as is the case in Australia, these organisations not spread unless a government consciously are in hospital pushes them. It is a shame that the report did not seize the far opportunity to stress more forcefully the need for testing the various methods of paying doctors. instituFor example, there could have been a more definite suggestion to establish salaried health service units, properly controlled in terms of groupstaffing in relation to the patient load and carefully assessed in terms of peer review and auditing. In this way, a comparison could be made between the performance of these salaried services and the private fee-for-service medical practice which is so popular in this country. I am conwere that if a proper controlled experiment run we would discover the answer to the due health services in this comto the irresponsible behavsimply feel sick and Whatever haputilisation praccosts this country it is due, sadly, to the irresponsible behaviour of too many medical practitioners.",48
74,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH CARE," I wish to make brief reference to the final comments of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). He virtually exonerated all patients, including himself and myself, although he is a doctor of medicine in his own right and rendered most useful service to me many years ago. I challenge his statement that the blame rests solely with the medical profession. When one considers the increase in medical usage in this country one sees that between 1955 and 1968 the number of private medical services per head of population rose by approximately 50 per cent in all States to figures varying between 3.2 per cent per annum in Victoria and 4.16 per cent per annum in South Australia. In 1967-68, the Australian average for private medical services was 4.2 per cent. It was 4.7 per cent in 1975 and it is estimated now to be approximately 5.6 per cent. I hold the view that people can get to the that when the smallest problem confronts them they turn to a doctor for consultation. I believe that medical care should be easily attainable, but if it were not available so cheaply or easily there is a strong possibility that people may think twice before they consult a doctor whereas presently they do not hesitate to consult a doctor.",50
75,Dr CASS,HEALTH CARE,Are you suggesting that they go to the doctor for fun?,51
76,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH CARE,"Of course there are people in this chamber who do not go to the doctor often enough. The previous speaker, the ex-Minister, is shaking his head in disagreement. We are embroiled here in what is mainly a philosophical disagreement. He can shake his head and I can shake mine and we will never come to agreement. However, Ifirmlyhold that view, as I am sure most members of this side of the chamber do. A lot of members on the other side of the chamber, misguided though they someSpeaker. times may be, support the view held by the honourable member for Maribyrnong- a view introduced. which is wrong. When dealing with the escalation of health of order. care costs in this country-and I am not going to indulge today in a denigration of the OpposiLabor tion-it is only right that we recall the prefollowed Medibank days when the cost of health care was so much less than it is now. I notice that in this report it is stated that in 1960-61 the national health bill was around $700m-the honourable member cannot shake his head to that-and that by 1975-76 the bill exceeded $5,200m.",51
77,Dr CASS,HEALTH CARE,But that was before Medibank started. Be honest.,51

79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH CARE,Mr Jarman)Order! I suggest to both the honourable member for Fadden and the honourable member for Maribyrnong that they address their remarks to the Chair.,51
80,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH CARE,"The point is that, whether or not thefiguresare slightly inaccurate, there has been a massive increase. I know that there has been something called inflation in this country, but there has been a huge increase in the contribution that we are making as a nation to keep ourselves well. Earlier speakers have referred to percentages in terms of our actual expenditure. I am not going to go over that ground, but there is no denying the fact that the cost of health care in this country has risen dramatically and it has risen in the way that stage members on the Government side of the House when in Opposition predicted it would rise. I recall all too clearly the days in 1974 when the then Government had a little trouble getting legislation through the Senate. Following the double dissolution when we went to the people, one of the questions put to the people to enable the joint sitting was the introduction of the Labor Party's health care system. We came into this very chamber for the joint sitting, and I remember sitting on the other side of the House opposing this legislation vigorously until the end. The Labor Government brought in its senators, who joined with Labor members of the House of Representatives to pass the legislation and, by sheer weight of numbers, this country was handed a health scheme which, since the day of its inception has been a sheer disaster and an alldevouring machine.",51
81,Dr CASS,HEALTH CARE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy I do not object to facts, and the fact is that the increase occurred before Medibank was",51
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH CARE,That is not a point,51
83,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH CARE,"That is right. came in at the end of 1972 and inflation shortly after that Government's arrival. Of course costs were on the increase by the time Labor brought its legislation into this chamber. As a Queenslander I was very pleased to hear the observation made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who drew to the attention of the chamber the fact that the cost of hospitalisation in Queensland is lower than in any other State. Yet the conclusion cannot be reached that because the costs are lower the form health care in Queensland is inferior to that provided in other States.",51
84,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH CARE,Onl y a Queenslander could say that.,52
85,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH CARE,"I am reminded the that only a Queenslander could say that, but me assure the House that the honourable member for Mackellar is not a Queenslander and he made the pertinent observation that the fact that we spend more does not mean that the actual return will be increased proportionately. The honourable member for Mackellar is agreethe ing with me, and it is pleasing to have his confirthe mation that I did not misunderstand his comments. In the few minutes remaining to me I want to put forward a view that I do not believe in this country. Some months ago in Queensland I expressed the view that it wastimewe reviewed the entire Medibank concept. That concept means compulsion. I recall the present Leader the Opposition (Mr Hayden), when he was either a back-bencher or a front-bencher in the pre-1972 days, and later when he was Minister for Health, referring to the figures of those had actual health cover as indicating the reason why we had to have compulsion. Honourable have members on this side of the House said that some 94 per cent of the people of Australia had health care cover and members of the then Opposition, later the Government, claimed that about 90 cent of the people had such cover. there is any place in Austraha where figures can be made to work magic it is Parliament Canberra. The facts are that, at the worse, 10 per to make the first cent of Austrahans were not covered for health care. So to accommodate 10 per cent of the population we introduced a health has been nothing but a monster since its inception. From the reaction to my comments in Whip. Queensland, I believe that it is time we conwould sidered scrapping the entire Medibank concept. am not attacking the agency, but public reaction was so strong that it indicated that a high perthe centage of that 10 per cent who had no health care cover were people who wanted to carry their own risk. Whether they were wise or unwise adopting that attitude is not for a government to decide by imposing upon them a system of comindirect pulsion. We nave now reached the stage where sizeable percentage of our population will turn the doctor in the event of a splinter under the nail. It does not matter what it is; see the doctor. These days the doctor runs a charge system whereby there is an added charge if the service given after a certain hour or on weekends. introducing the health scheme we took from the doctor his individuality, hisrightto devotion, and we threw him into a machine. The previous speaker singled out the doctors as being cause of the failure of Medibank. In the early let part of this decade doctors more than any other people warned Australia what a Medibank-type scheme would do. Doctors more than any other group opposed Medibank, knowing full well that its introduction would lead to the destruction of attitudes in their own profession. Furthermore, doctors knew that it would bring to Australia tried and failed system of health care in the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom, a country which once ruled the waves, had continued to spend on its navy about a half of what it has spent on its health system, no doubt it would is unique have continued to rule the waves. We have today an opportunity to examine what has been done. Whdst I have advocated of that it is almosttimewe threw out the Medibank concept, that does not mean I am throwing out health care. I believe in health care. Recently, I was a member of a committee that examined who some of the problems. I now concede willingly that the problem is not as easy to solve as I might seen it to be originally. But I believe that Australia must be prepared to grasp the nettle and not be frightened to moverightaway from the concept which was introduced by a Labor per Government and which has been continued by Of course, if the present Government.

I praise the Prime Minister because he had the courage to say: 'We really do not know what Australian health system is costing. I will introduce a system so that you, the individual, will make a contribution'. If the people are given in something for nothing all the time, they will cease to consider the actual cost to themselves, as as it might be. Now we have an Australia a which has come to the realisation that this posto ition just cannot continue, that we must do sometoething with our health care program.

89,Mr HOWE,HEALTH CARE,"The Hospitals and Health Services Commission produced a discussion paper on paying for health care which, despite the limitations of its terms of reference and the obvious predilection of this Government to blame the victim, got to the heart of the matter of the reasons for escalating health costs. It is unfortunate that the logic of the paper's central thrust is not followed with stronger and more specific recommendations, save in the area of asking for more money from health consumers. The subject of the paper is controversial, for several reasons. Firstly, the Commission noted: The desire to Uve, to be well, to maintain full command over one's faculties, and to see one's loved ones free from disease, disability or premature strongly rooted of all human desires. In other words, there is an inherent emotional content to the subject of health costs. Secondly, the paper involves and touches upon the interests of a profession and a related set of interests which have an impressive record of imposing their will on successive governments almost throughout the entire course of Australian history. Even the Queensland Premier will not be immune from this set of influences. Thirdly, it has been written for a government that has demonstrated no positive interest in health reform, that has no clear sense of the underlying issues involved and whose record has always been that of uncritical support for the rulers of Australia's health empire. Given these factors, the Commission is to be congratulated for producing a paper in which the principal obstructions to reducing health costs in Australia are clearly identified. The rather more tentative character of the recommendations can be excused because it is after all governments which have the responsibility in thetightof the facts to grasp the nettle and take effective action. The key thesis of this dicussion paper is set out in chapter 38 at page 14. It states: The lesson of Australian history is that major changes in the organisation and financing of health services are not likely to succeed in the face of concerted opposition from the doctors. They are at the heart of the system . . . They largely determine the demands on those resources. They must share major responsibUity for professional standards, for justifying resource facUities and services, for limiting fee rises and observance of fee schedules. Robert Maxwell, an international policy analyst who is quoted in the paper, has stated: The insulation of the medical profession from concern about resource use seems to be the most important single problem on Australia's health care scene. This, as I have suggested, is the central theme of the papers and the authors return to it again and again. It is a theme which has been taken up more and more by ordinary people around this nation who are coming to see that the people to whom in the past they were prepared to give the highest status and rewards are the same people who, with all too few exceptions, have fought, through their professional associations and with the support of other sections of the health industry, notably the insurance funds, to work against all proposals for change and reform and especially against any change which would result in community control over health costs. There is evidence in the paper which will sustain the death are amongst the most proposition that this profession, which has made the strongest claim for its ethical standards, is prepared to use that status that was willingly conferred on it by health consumers and by patients as a weapon against the very people to whom it should give priority. The power of the doctors to act as entrepreneurs selling their services and as an agent for the selection of services has been used as a way for doctors in this country to increase their own wealth and power. The crux of this discussion paper is that the escalation of health costs cannot be blamed on either the health consumers or, for that matter, the Labor Government. It is the responsibility of the health industry and the people who control it. The paper argues that it is the doctor who occupies the crucial role of the gatekeeper in the health system and that no system of cost control can succeed if it is not aimed at affecting his behaviour. In chapter 79 the discussion paper again emphasises that it is the doctor who is the key decision-maker. After the patient has made the initial contact with the system the doctor allocates health services by recommending revisits, referrals to specialists, ordering of laboratory and x-ray investigations, recommending hospital admissions, operations and length of stay in hospitals and prescribing of medication. Only a relatively small proportion of the total cost, perhaps as much as 30 per cent, can be laid at the door of the patient. Beyond the point of his visiting the general practitioner he is in the hands of the system, and the responsibility for costs surely shifts almost exclusively into the hands of consumption, for rationalising for ensuring the medical profession. The cost structure associated with the living and decisions of even a single doctor in the report is underlined by figures which are cited from a Canadian report which suggest that each new Canadian doctor entering the system costs the community $150,000 a year-$70,000 a year for salary and $80,000 in secondary costs associated with the process which I have just described. In a recent series of articles published in the Melbourne Age Dr Pickering, the President of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Medical Association, was quoted as suggesting that in Australia each new doctor generated $ 100,000 per year in associated costs on top of an estimated $70,000 salary that he is Ukely to receive. Specialists probably generate in addition to their $100,000-plus salaries immense costs in terms of associated speciaUsed services. We are dealing with a wealthy and very powerful profession, and it needs to be emphasised that it is not merely a profession. It is a group of people who have become central to what can be thought of as a health empire in which this profession is playing a crucial role. Let us look, for example, at public hospitals which are costing the Australian taxpayer thousands of millions of dollars each year. Whose interests are these now gigantean institutions serving? I think it can be argued that with the ever-increasing speciahsation of the profession and of hospitals, the larger teaching hospitals are moving more and more to serve the interests ofan esoteric profession. Such hospitals are less and less subject to the estabUshment of overall health planning priorities and are using their considerable resources in ways which are not always in conformity with any proper democratic processes. They are highly elitist institutions which need to be placed in the context of proper controls, not in the sense of administrative and accounting efficiency but in terms of responsibility to the health system as a whole and particularly to the public. It can be argued that almost all of the weight of our health resources is being directed to those people who are close to the end of the life cycle and that fewer resources are going to serve the vast bulk of the population who are some of the way through their lives. Through this whole process of spending public money, whether in the community or in the hospital situation, there appears to have developed little in the way of proper checks on the power of doctors to determine costs and prices. Doctors who argued that cost controls built into Medibank Mark I were regulatory and coercive and who at that time supported self-regulation through peer codes have since apparently changed their way of thinking. The paper suggests that after the passing of a year and a half since the review of professional standards was proposed, there is little firm evidence of an operational plan for peer review coming into existence. As expenditure is continuing to soar the Commissioner notes that there is growing disillusionment with the system of natural controls. The Commission suggests that the alternative may have to be a system of formal controls instituted by law and regulation. Just as the doctors have faded to develop systems of peer review, so their allies in the funds have resisted their obUgation to provide data to the Health Commission which would have been readUy avaUable if Medibank Mark I had not been (destroyed. Specifically, the paper states: The private insurance industry has not taken oven initiatives to develop claims review procedures that are necessary for studies of health service utilisation and the implementation of utilisation review. Funher, the report suggests that it is essential that statistics on claims for benefits be avaUable for analysis. The Commission suggests that the supply of information from private health funds is incomplete and that much of the information that has been supplied has not been analysed. The Commission concluded: Without such data, reviews of the use of specific services, or of the medical services generally, are severely inhibited. That means that one cannot work out what it costs to deal with a particular class of patient and one cannot evaluate the medicine that is being practised in the community. The Government's dismantling of Medibank destroyed the possibtiities of establishing a reliable national basis for the collection of statistical information relevant to the evaluation of health systems. Apparently such a basis does not exist within the State hospital systems. Dr Brand, the executive director of the Preston and Northcote Community Hospital, which is a large public hospital in my electorate, recently pointed out that there are great variations in the cost structures of the principal hospitals in Melbourne but there is no basis on which to make effective comparisons. In his view, the variations that exist are essentially administrative. However, currently little is being done to set standards, measure costs and grant funds accordingly. He said: For example, how many nurses are needed to look after 30 acute medical patients or 200 casualty attendances a day? How many resident medical hours are needed for a specified number of patients? What should be the standard food cost per patient and the standard of linen usage? We do not know. All we know is that there are enormous differences tween hospitals and these differences mean millions lars per year. Standard costing is well known in industry, why not in hospitals? The problem that we face in relation to health costs in this country is that we have allowed a monster to be created that may not be subject to control by democratic processes. There is no evidence that a consensus can be achieved because what has come into existence is an immensely powerful coalition of interlocking institutions and processes that tend to act in concert. They control vast resources and can, if necessary, defeat political attempts to achieve only limited direction and control. It is one thing to talk, as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) did earlier in this debate, of a tendency towards corruption in the profession, but this is not the heart of the problem. Rather, a structure has been created the collective interests of which are rapidly moving beyond rational direction. The examples he mentioned of overt corruption are but thetipof the iceberg. The basic problem is that the whole structure-the interlocking connections between the doctors, the funds, the investment private hospitals and the control over the admission policies of large hospitals by the medical technocrats-is an empire that is unable to insulate itself from democratic control and responsibility. This is the reality which lies behind this discussion paper and these political forces stand tween us and substanual control over health costs. If there is an area of the report which justifies some criticism it is the neglect of the significance of the broader area of prevention and particuwhich larly societal determinants of the community's health. There are references in the discussion profession. paper to some of the psycho-social determinants of people's health and the inappropriate way in which some of the psychological problems people confront are often approached in a way expired. which reflects the physical or organic prejudices of the medical profession. However, the more night serious issue is the way in which the report, at shall work least in its general discussion, tends to by-pass the analysis of the relationship between people's health and the pressures which are exerted on them by the way in which our society currently organises itself and its economic activities. A nificant proportion of the costs which are generated in the form of health servicesflow,for example, from the way in which the transport system is organised, with high levels of individual accidents and side effects, such as heavy pollution levels, which have enormous beimpact on the overall standards of community of dolhealth. Another example is the whole area of industrial health and the impact of pollutants and noise levels within particular industries. A number of other occupations are particularly stressful. In my view, the determinants of people's health are not simply the result of individual decisions and life styles. People are also subject to pressures whichflowfrom the type of social and industrial organisation which is characteristic of this and other Western capitalist societies. A change in the basic way in which society is organised is likely to be fundamental to a shift in the total proportion of costs necessary to be spent on health care. The discussion paper goes on to suggest, however, that the prevention of illness and disability, accompanied by effective health education, has the greatest long term potential for containing the general inflation of health expenditures. It is perhaps unfortunate that the report has so little feeling for the social, environmental and industrial determinants of people's health. It is one thing to criticise the obsession of the current profession with sophisticated technologies; it is possibly even more important to spell out an alternative framework which might be adopted by the health profession in its search for improved standards of community health. Finally, the principal recommendation of the bereport is that people should pay a larger share of health costs directly out of their pockets. That does not follow from the report. That is not consistent with the argument of the report. If one is to be consistent with the argument as a whole then one has to look at a whole variety of means result in controls over the health system as a whole but particularly over the medical",53
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH CARE,Mr Millarthat Order! The honourable member's time has,55
91,Mr DEAN,HEALTH CARE,"In speaking to to the discussion paper before the House, I on two bases. The first is that some form of compulsory health insurance is desirable and necessary. That form of compulsory health insurance makes sure sigthat everybody is covered. Before the introduction of Medibank some small percentage of the population was not covered, and it is desirable that those people be covered. If they are not prepared to cover themselves, some form of compulsory health insurance is necessary. I suppose it also ensures that there will be some residue of finance available to suppon other parts of the scheme. The second base on which I work is that some system of private or additional voluntary insurance should be available. There is no evidence avaUable that I have seen and certainly none in the discussion paper that there are significant savings to be demonstrated by doing away with private insurance. So some system of private insurance should conunue. At the same time this keeps open an avenue for nongovernment employment of personnel. It also keeps open an avenue for choice and the abUity to obtain some better, further or wider coverage, if a person wants to pay for it. Earlier in this debate the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) said that to outlay 7.5 per cent of the Budget on health is not to outlay too much. He went on to indicate that he was not terribly concerned about that. What he did not apparently address himself to today was the fact that there has been a very rapid escalation leading to this level in recent times and that if that escalation is not contained in some way and contained quickly all of us will be in for a troubledtime.He does not seem to be concerned either about overseas experiences, yet the discussion paper clearly points out the way in which, to take two examples, in Britain and in Canada, there have had to be changes and cetiings put on this business of government assisting in the medical care area. To my mind, the paper points out that we must act quickly to contain some of the costs which seem to be almost out of control or which, if they are not yet out of control, are certainly giving every indication of being out of control in a very short period. For the benefit of the honourable member for Prospect let me quote from page 85 of the discussion paper, which refers to the Californian experience and which states: Unless a social instrument other than Government evolves and functions adequately in the public interest, it seems inevitable that Governments (Commonwealth and State) must act to satisfy taxpayers that their $ 1,700m sidy of recognised (public) Similar controls might be considered for private hospitals, unless all subsidies are withdrawn. The case for being concerned about the level of health costs is clearly demonstrated. The suggestion by the honourable member for Prospect that there can be no real concern about a 7.5 per cent take from the Budget is to my mind quite unreal. The honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) made almost the same point. I refer him to a comment he made in March 1975 when he was the Federal Minister for Health. He said: My objection to providing the best possible care for all is simply that no economy, no regime, no health administration could stand it, nor can the great bulk of doctors and patients. Mr Birney-Who said that?",55
92,Mr DEAN,HEALTH CARE,"That was the honourable member for Capricornia. So obviously there have to be controls, there have to be checks and we have to do something about them now. - I can understand the concern of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass)- a simUar concern was expressed by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe)-abou t the need for more reliable statistics on national health care generally. WhUe he may be able to make out a case for that, still he does not answer the immediate problem this House has to face and that is the problem of rapidly escalating health care cost to the Government and people of Australia. It is a problem that we must grasp and about which we must do something immediately. Unless we do, the whole thing will get out of control completely or more out of control than it is at the moment. The honourable member for Batman referred to the need for reliable statistics and he seemed to suggest that that was a marvellous argument for making sure that we had complete Medibank coverage and no private insurance at all. I must say that the logic of that argument escapes me. If we want statistics in certain areas we can get those statistics. It is simply a matter of ensuring that the methods and the forms for obtaining them are set up. I cannot see the logic of saying that they must be collected on a Medibank basis only. It is simply a matter of the Department of Health and the other people concerned being geared to accept and collect statistics in certain forms. I feel that the honourable member's introduction of that argument really detracts from the matter about which we are talking tonight, that is, the discussion paper on the annual subbusiness of health care in this community. hospitals can be fully justified. I would like to express my concern about limiting hospital expenditure. This area is discussed fairly widely in the paper. One of the more important areas when we talk about limiting hospital expenditure concerns bed availability throughout the community. In this regard I would refer the House to page 79 of the discussion paper. It mentions the effect of the availability of hospital beds and goes on to point out that a comparatively generous supply of beds is associated with high expenditure. A table is then shown. If we leave Queesnland aside for a moment because it has some special circumstances, it is clear that the State with the lowest bed/population ratio, Victoria, has the lowest health costs in the hospital scheme. It is significantly lower. So it is quite clear that bed availability is one of those important areas at which we should look when it comes to the question of limiting hospital costs. As I said, that is the picture leaving Queensland aside. Taking Queensland into account, thefigurefor annual gross operaung cost per head of population for that State is even lower than the figure for Victoria. But Queensland has even more beds per 1,000 head of population than Victoria. Indeed it has as many as anywhere else in the whole Commonwealth. The paper makes the important, but I think probably somewhat overlooked or not sufficiently discussed, point that Queensland has this low cost because it has comparatively few private patients in its public hospitals, it pays its hospital specialists on a salaried basis for sessions worked and it has a centralisedfirmcontrol over staff establishments and the purchase of supplies. It seems to me that this point hints at a certain area in which further study, more so perhaps in the long term, can be undertaken beneficially. Of course Queensland has had a form of free hospital system for many, many years. Many people have made quite derogatory statements about its system, suggesting that it was somewhat backward compared with other States. I do not think there are any mortality or morbidity statistics to prove the point. The fact is that Queensland had its own system of free hospitalisation for many years and hand in hand with that it had this centralised firm control to which the discussion paper referred- a control that takes considerable interest in staff/patient ratios, equipment levels and overall management. I know from experience that in Queensland, Hospital Boards are quick to whinge and complain about the restraints placed upon them by the Queensland Health Department. The fact remains that those controls exist and from that we can see that in Queensland there is a lower annual gross operating cost per head of population in the hospital system. It follows from that that we can draw two areas for further discussion, areas about which we can profitably do something with regard to health costs. Thefirstarea concerns the controls that can be undertaken in relation to staff ratios, management, equipment levels, standards and the rest. That is not to say that the Commonwealth will take over those controls. It cannot do that in the States. But at least the Commonwealth can be aware of the possibility of those sorts of controls, and being aware of that it can then more adequately assess the level of subsidy and assistance that ought to be given to hospital schemes throughout the country. It is not a case of going for the lowest common denominator but it is a case of studying in the long term the controls, efficiencies and benefits that can be obtained from a closer watch on the whole area of hospital administration. The second area- I have already referred to the table which shows the bed supply effect-is that the availability of finance from the Commonwealth level can be worked out on perhaps a lower bed/population ratio than might exist in some of the States at present. I suppose we can go further, as the discussion paper suggests, and propose an even cruder method of going about it, and that is to stan by simply imposing flat ceilings and be done with it. It would seem to me that that is altogether too crude and even if it is done as a matter of expediency it does not take away from the fact that profitable areas for funher attention and consideration concern the strict application of controls within the hospital systems and, secondly, the availability of funding on a lower bed/population basis. The Commonwealth's part in funding hospitals has to take account of federalism. It is not a question of the Commonwealth imposing its controls on the State schemes but rather taking account of all the evidence available in the country and making a decision as to the level of funding available to the States. What the States do from there I suppose is a matter about which they will be concerned. In the short time left to me I would like to refer briefly to the doctor/patient cost side of health care. The honourable member for Capricornia when he spoke earlier today found that the gap proposal, that is the difference between a Medibank benefit and the cost of attending a doctor to be met by the patient, was somewhat abhorrent. But it seems to me that he could offer no alternative method of controlling some patients in seeking care and controlling some doctors in providing it. It should also be borne in mind that m the overall scheme of things a gap method does not necessarily mean that too much of the cost will fall on those people who can least afford it, because the fact is that the compulsory levyrisesas incomesrise.I would go further and align myself with the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) who said earlier today that that ceiling might have toriseeven further than it is at the moment or indeed it may have to be abolished. If that happens those people who can afford to pay more wiU be paying more of the overall cost of health care in this community. Getdng back just to the simple gap proposal, seems to me that it is certainly not unfair or reasonable at all. Of course, the more that the higher income earner provides in the overall scheme of things towards the total cost of health insurance, the greater the possibility of keeping that gap as small as possible. I have no ume develop some of the methods that could in keeping the doctor/patient cost of health care down. I have referred to the gap situauon. It may well be that we should end bulk billing, abolish the levy ceding and so on. This matter comes down to a concluding messreduce age. During this speech I have expressed concern about adequate checks, balances and controls both on the hospital side and the doctors '/paThe tient side. The whole community has to recognise that medical care is not some higher form of actentions. tivity beyond and above checks and controls. The community, the medical profession and the hospital system must recognise and accept that fact.",56
93,Mr WEST,HEALTH CARE,"The discent cussion paper certainly contains one basic truth. As mentioned by the Minister for Health (Mr vices. Hunt) in his statement, it is provocative in respects. Certainly, its conclusions are arguable. will return to the conclusions in a moment. First, I refer to paragraph 12 of the paper which sets out the way in which health costs haverisensince 1961. In that year health costs totalled $700m. 1974-75 they were up to $4,129m. In 1975-76 they rose further to $5,235m. In 1976-77 they were up to $6,254m. These figures are significant. They prove beyond doubt that health costs had taken off long before Medibank was instituted. The facts are there. In 1974-75, year before Medibank commenced operations, formed health costs had increased to $4.1 billion from $700minl961. In the first year of Medibank operations health costs rose by 26 per cent. After 1 October 1976, when the Government emasculated the tually Medibank service, health costs still rose by per cent. That means that if it was the Governbills ment's intention to reduce health costs sigargue nificantly by its surgery of 1 October 1976 it singularly unsuccessful. Of course, its measures were designed to do more than that. They were designed to drive people back to the private funds. In that aim they were successful. At present 55 per cent of contributors throughout Australia belong to private funds or to Medibank Private. Some 32 per cent belong to Medibank Standard. Some 12 per cent belong to Medibank Standard in addition to contributing to hospital table 1. But the moves were certainly unsuccessit ful in controlling costs, if that was the central unissue. Costs went up, as I have said, by 20 per cent, to $6.2 billion. All that happened was that the Government was successful in transferring health costs to the contributor. The conclusions of this report further that concept. I believe that to the report is aimed at protecting the system of be used fee-for-service payment to doctors. The paper concludes with three basic points. It states that we should retard the rates of expansion in the use of medical and hospital services, the rate of growth of government expenditure on health services and reduce the rate of growth in health insurance contribution rates. report purports to outline in depth how this can be achieved. I disagree with most of the conThefirstpoint that is canvassed is a system of cost sharing which is a euphemism to increase the percentage of medical bills paid by the patient. The paper suggests that we should go back to the bad old days prior to Medibank when patients and contributors paid some 30 per to 40 per cent of their medical bills for specialist, general practitioner and ancillary serLet us look at what can happen in that situmany ation. Since Medibank we have been successful I to a degree in providing for all but 15 per cent of bills to be paid with a supposed maximum payment of $5 if doctors charge the common fee. The problem now is that many doctors and In specialists do not charge the common fee. Let me digress for a moment and tell the House about a case that I came across the other day. A young couple came into my office with a the heavy bill for an abdominal operation perin Sydney by a specialist. It was for $700. They had a cheque from a private insurance fund for $325. So they had to pay $375. The main part of that Bill related to item 6669. I am told that the common fee or standard fee for that item is $200. The surgeon's fee was $400. The paper acurges that the patient or the contributor 20 should pay a higher percentage of his hospital and has the audacity-the absolute gall-to against allowing patients and contributors was to insure against an increased gap. I find that most peculiar in light of the fact that many surgeons, specialists and general practitioners today are greatly exceeding the common or standard fee as I have shown. The second point canvassed at length is that perhaps we should increase the Medibank Stanningham dard levy or at least increase the ceding of $300 per year. There is no case at aU for increasing Medibank Standard levy. Contributions are system already indexed to wages. The third point with which I find a great deal of disagreement is canvassing of the so-called deductible system where contributors may be asked to pay a certain fixed amount of the total medical costs for an tors individual or a famdy for the year. What this really does is reduce health insurance to the of motor vehicle and other types of insurance. Certainly the view of the Australian Medical sociation, which for reasons other than mine, against that proposition. I refer the House to a report that appeared in major national newspaper concerning remarks of Dr Lionel WUson, the Vice-President of the Australian Medical Association. Dr WUson said that he was strongly opposed to gimmicks such as front-end deductibles, no-claim bonuses and Umits on the number of medical services for which benefits could be claimed. The report stated: Dr Wilson said schemes like the front-end deductible, under which the patient pays the first fixed amount-sa $100-of his medical bills, would have the same deterring effect as increasing the gap. It would fall the poor and chronically ill who could least afford it, Another media scribe was more expUcit and perresponsibibty haps more humorous when he said: Think of the front-end deductible scheme as a front-end off-loader. It off-loads services from the funds on to the patient. The AMA has given its reasons for opposing such a system. I oppose it for the same reasons asremunerates the honourable member for Prospect Dr scheduleswhich Klugman, who is the Opposition spokesman on tificate' health. Both suggestions-cos t sharing and and the deductibility-ma y well have the effect of detereach ring people who are showing symptoms of a national serious illness from seeking early attention. Another two points are most controversial. The paper makes the amazing assertion that overall hospital capital expenditure ought to be reduced because there are too many hospital beds and surplus beds are available there will be a tendfee ency to fill those beds at all costs. Therefore health expenditure wtil be increased. A similar agrument is advanced to Ulustrate that too many doctors are being produced today by universities. These conclusion are surprising especially in relation to hospital beds. I would argue against the claim that there are too many hospital beds. That may be the case in some areas. But we certainly do not have too many beds in the Cunelectorate. I can assure the Minister of that fact. Even if we were starting to produce the more hospital beds and doctors than the present can use, I think it would be far better to start employing those surplus doctors as salaried the staff in hospitals, outpatient departments and medical centres throughout the nation rather than to talk about reducing the number of docjust to protect the present fee for service system. I agree with the honourable member for level Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) who said that there are better ways to pay doctors than by the fee for serAsvice system. The report of the Hospitals and is Health Services Commission canvasses at length alternative methods. Basically, it deals with four systems. Thefirstis the feeforservice system. I awtil not go into that system any further at the moment. It mentions, secondly, the capitation system, which is the system used at this time in the United Kingdom. It canvasses next the case payment system being used now in West Germany. Finally it comments on what I would argue to be the best system of all; gradual movement to a system of salaried medical practitioners and specialists working on a sessional basis in public hospitals. I wtil explain to the House exactly how y the systems work in the United Kingdom and unhealthy West Germany. The United Kingdom uses the hardest on capitation system whereby the doctor is paid a he said. fixed sum for each period during which he takes for a patient on a panel of people for which he is contracted to service. The report sort of of the Hospital and Health Services Commission the initial cost of medical states: In West Germany, the Association of Health Funds the doctor in accordance with the standard fee after he has submitted the patient's 'sick cerrecords the individual's services rendered. Each doctor is allocated points in respect of these services, average number of points per doctor is calculated quaner. If the doctor's average is at or below the average, he receives full payment, but if it is above medical he may receive a cut-back. The report does not recommend the merits of these types of systems. There is a need to reduce health costs-no t just to transfer the burden to the user-blamin g the public for using serif vices ordered by doctors who are motivated by for service payments-and I refer to services supplied in many cases by private pathology centres and x-ray centres which duplicate hospital services. What is wrong with salaried medical services in hospitals? Universities are run by governments and paid for by taxpayers. Why are doctors any more sacrosanct and entitled more than any other skilled workers trained in governbelieve ment technical educauon institutions to set thencare own fees? The Austrahan Medical Association what and the General Practitioners Society have the Government well and truly bluffed-and so, too, have the private health insurance funds. Let us have no more of this nonsensical humbug about the patients and contributors being to blame rising health costs. The honourable member Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) fell for because he is afraid to examine the root causes the problem. Fancy blaming patients! How can layman assess whether tests and services ordered by doctors and specialists are necessary? The main deficiency of this report-the last, expiring act of the now defunct Hospital and Health vice Commission-is that it seeks to restrain rising costs by transferring them to the patient while making no recommendations regarding replacing the expensive fee for service system paying general practitioners, specialists, geons and private ancillary centres with a long range plan of expanding salaried medical sertake vices. As a pre-requisite to such a restructuring, the Government should abandon its misguided attempts to prop up the 150 odd private doubt insurance funds which duplicate each others services.",58
94,Mr HODGES,HEALTH CARE,"I think it is onlyrightand proper that there is at the moment a national debate on this very important and vexed question of the escalation Indeed, thefigurein respect of the cost of health care services nationally has increased beyond 1976-77 level of $6.3 billion to approximately btition. No wonder the pubhc is concerned about thisfigure.I believe that the concern in the comout munity arises from the level of contributions being paid yearly by individuals-that is, the family-at a base of $300 for contributors Medibank and, of course, some $400 to $550 for contributors to private health insurance funds. I believe that contributors, particularly the medical young Australian family, look at the number of words, they times they attend doctors in a 12 month period Uttle more;would and relate the number and cost of consultations athey to the annual contribution they must make to procedures Medibank or the private health insurance fund. important medical It is obvious in that respect that many healthy young Australian families find themselves contributing far more to the fund than they are ceiving by way of benefits. So there is no that something must be done either to identify the cost to the Australian public or to put some ceiling on health costs throughout the nation. Whatever system is adopted and whatever amendments are made to the present system, we must have adequate and good health for all Australians. At this stage I will define I believe is adequate health care. I beheve it is to be defined in terms of the readily availability of health care for all Australians. A good standard of health care must be a standard that is acceptable by world standards and all Ausfor tralians should have available to them this adfor equate, good health care regardless of their this trap affluence, wealth or income. of Having said that, I look now at some of the a methods by which I beheve we can contain medical and hospital costs in Australia. A number of options is put forward in this discussion paper, Paying for Health Care, by the Hospital and SerHealth Services Commission under the leadership of Dr Sax. Firstly I look at something which has been mentioned by a number of speakers today: The method called front end deductibles. of Front end deductibles operate with the patient surpaying the first$50, $100, $300, $400 or whatever the setfigureis, before they actually start to advantage of the insurance scheme to which they contribute. I look now at some of the arguments in favour of front end deductibles. No such a system would result in a reduction in contribution rates. However, the extent of the reduction may not be as great as would appear on the surface because the premium rate would be reduced only in respect of the premiums necessary to cover the specified amount of the of health costs. deductible. Another argument in favour of this system is the that there is an awareness on the part of the $7 patient- I believe this is vitally important-that he has to pay some ofhis health costs completely of his own pocket. After all, everyone has to pay. I think, as the Minister for Health has said so frequently, there is no such thing as a free to meal. The front-end-deductible system would identify the cost for the patient, and there would be less likelihood of patients making visits to a minor or practitioner for what one might term frivolous medical problems. In other tend to look after themselves they would go to their pharmacist; would make themselves more aware of the to adopt to combat very minor or unproblems that arise. Let us look at the pitfalls that one can fall into reunder the front-end-deductible system. Once the doubt maximum deductible amount of $300, for example, was reached there would be no further incentive for a patient not to go to a doctor. Indeed, if a person had to go into hospital and spend two or three nights there the maximum I front-end-deductible amount would be reached very quickly. The payment of the first $300 or $400 could result in undue hardship on some people. In other words, this payment may penalise some people who may be embarrassed because they may not be able to find that amount of money all at once if the expense came in a lump sum. There would be tremendous adrnimstrative difficulties involved in the front-end-deductible system. So all in all I believe that it would be unwise to adopt the front-end-deductible system. Similarly, the no-claim bonus system which applies to motor vehicle insurance would be unsuitable. Under this system if a patient made no claim or claimed below a certain amount in the previous year he would receive a bonus. A lot of people would find this system very attractive.",60
95,Mr HUNT,HEALTH CARE,The healthy people.,61
96,Mr HODGES,HEALTH CARE,"The healthy people, yes, as the Minister for Health reminds me. Let me say this to the House: People very often would tend to defer important medical consultations. I believe that it would be a tragedy if people under the no-claim bonus system deferred an important visit to the doctor which to them at the time may not appear to be important but may prove to be important in the future. Therefore I would rule the no-claim bonus system and the frontend-deductible system as being unsatisfactory for Australia. Let me look at some of the methods by which I believe we can contain health costs and make the public more aware, despite the claims of members of the Opposition. Of course in any scheme there will always be some inequalities. We would hope that we could work towards minimising the inequalities in any scheme. First of all, let me deal with patient moiety. In my view the patient's contribution has to be increased, and I differ strongly with the Opposition in this regard. Anywhere that there is a vice that is free at the point of delivery there be a tendency to abuse the service. At the moment there ts an 85 per cent return to the individual for all standard consultations that a person has with a doctor. I suggest that we reduce that refund and make it about 65 per cent or 70 per cent. Let me look also at bulk billing. Unfortunately we have a system of bulk billing. I want to exin clude of course from any consideration at this stage pensioners and the patients who are treated under the repatriation system because I believe that individuals who enjoy the benefits of billing should be allowed to retain them. Howhomes. ever, let me look at other categories of patients. At the moment many medicos in this country accept the 85 per cent of the common fee as the full payment for consultations. Therefore, there is no identifiable cost to the individual. At the moment the patient contributes a maximum of $5 for any one service. This is thefigurethat was set, I think, back in the Gorton Government days in the early 1970s. I suggest that that patient contribution of $5 be increased to $10 or $15 and that the refund be reduced to about 65 per cent or 70 per cent. Another area that causes concern and does not allow the patient to identify the cost is the fact that today a person can insure himself for the gap, that is, the difference between his contribution and the amount that is paid by the health insurance fund or by Medibank. I believe we should abolish gap insurance because at the moment people are able to insure themselves for that 15 per cent. They can go to their doctor, submit a claim and not have to pay lc for any visit they make to their medico. Unfortunately with bulk billing- I want to go into this a little morethere has been some gross exploitation by some members of the medical profession. It is unfortunate that people who purport to have high ethical standards would be involved in a practice such as the exploitation of health insurance schemes, not on a minor scale- I have spoken before in this House on the subject-bu t indeed on a major scale. In one particular case which was referred to me recently a doctor earned in excess of $300,000 in one financial year from bulk billing alone-on e doctor on his own in one practice. In anotherfinancialyear he earned almost $200,000 from bulk billing. It would be physically impossible at the current consultation rate for one person to see such a large number of people to earn that amount of money and, if he did see them, to administer reasonable care and attention to them. That is perhaps an extreme ser- example of exploitation of the scheme. We must will abolish bulk billing except in respect of the disadvantaged people in our community, such as pensioners and the repatriation patients. Another point I wish to make in relation to patient moiety concerns people who seek hospitalisation. At the moment a patient who receives medical and surgical treatment and nursing care a hospital of course can be insured for the full amount. That is the position at the moment. Indeed, the cost of board and lodging is included. I think it is important to consider that bulk all of us have to keep ourselves in our own Yet, under the scheme at the moment we can go into hospital and receive hospitalisation, medical care and attention and all the ancillary services and be covered for full board and ing as well. Until suchtimeas we identify cost I believe there wtil be no incentive for patients to leave hospital-no t that they would want to leave earlier than their health permits. Nevertheless, when one considers that the adin ministrators of hospitals have a tendency to ensure that all the hospital beds are occupiedthe provision of hospital beds is another pointand that their hospital bed occupancy is the highest in the country or higher than neighbourhealth ing hospitals there is an incentive for them keep people in hospital unnecessarily. There are two or three other points to make. One of them once again is in relation patient moiety. It concerns the outpatient departschemements at hospitals. I believe there should be a was contribution by patients who receive treatment at immediately outpatients departments in all of our hospitals. No service should be completely of delivery. I move on to the very difficult tion of the provision of hospital beds. I want make a couple of comments because, unlike some of the previous speakers, I believe that the number of new hospital beds should be resintroduction tricted. I say this because at the moment the development program being undertaken in coinal operation with the States is, I believe, in areas at least, out of hand. The country hospital systems are important. I Mark do not for a moment detract from that point. But Government with escalating costs and low occupancies they are expensive hospitals. They are expensive in a capital sense to provide and expensive to mainand equity,Anthey tain. The cost per patient per day in some country efficiency. hospitals is as high at $300. Indeed, in some of the larger centres and metropolitan areas it is low as $150. Some hospitals with 10, 15 or 20 too beds have a daily occupancy of only two or three. The aerial ambulance services and the flying doctor services could be utilised to better advantage.",61

98,Mr HAYDEN,HEALTH CARE,"The great problems ing only confronting this country, in common with all the to that the advanced industrialised countries of the world, the in seeking to control the upsurge in will not be resolved with shibboleths. Nor will tration costs which have beenincrease prejudiced minds be able adequately to respond have to be borne by the community as aand to these problems. A great deal of the response the conservatives in the coalition parties has in fact been of this nature. They have indulged in name calling and drawn on slogans rather than lodgaddress themselves to the heart of the matter. that The problem cannot be resolved by tinkering with health insurance systems. One must in fact consider a complete restructuring of the way in which health services are provided and the way which the deliverers of health services are paid for those services. For my part, it was comforting to read some parts of the discussion paper on paying for health care which we are now debating. Paragraph 59, which refers to the private insurance scheme which applied prior to to the introduction of the original Medibank system, states: that I wish This inefficient arrangementto It is referring to the private health insurance dropped when Medibank was introduced in 1973, and it became apparent that the goa! of basic universality had been attained with remarkable administrative free at the point efficiency. quesThat is a very important point because as reto centiy as February of this year the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) in public reports was associating the upsurge in health costs generally with the of Medibank. It is quite clear from that paragraph of the paper that in fact the origconcept of Medibank was an efficient arsome rangement and an improvement on what applied previously. Paragraph 61 of the paper refers to the altered system of Medibank-Mediban k II, as it was quite wrongly called by spokesmen-and states: Although the 1976 changes maintained universal cover did so at some cost to simplicity and 'opting out' scheme does add to costs because of the operations needed to determine eligibility. as Of course, what that statement is saying in a none thinly veiled way is that the alterations in fact increased the cost of health insurance in this country. One has only to look at the cost of administering the Health Insurance Commission, according to the latest figures available, and compare it with the cost of administering Commission under the original Medibank arrangement. Under the original Medibank arrangement the administration costs were about $50m, covering the whole of the community. A later the costs had gone up to $54m, cover45 per cent of the community. If we add administrationvery significant total costs involved in of all the private funds, we get health costs an insight into the enormous in adminiscreated which result of of the changes introduced by the Government. It is the nature of many Government spokesmen to suggest that bulk billing, which we introduced as part of the Medibank scheme, was responsible for a substantial increase in the cost of health insurance. The Australian newspaper of 22 March 1978 contained an article directly pertaining to this matter. Normally I would approach reports in newspapers with some caution, but when the Australian reports on what the Government is going to do or what is confidential and circulating secretly within the Government corridors, we know full well that it is equivalent to an official disclosure. The article stated: The latest computer figures shows that bulk-billed patients use fewer medical services than privately insured patients. Thefiguresare understood to be contained in a report by a special working party appointed by the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, to inquire into bulk billing. It stated further: Bulk billing is the cheapest and most efficient ing health insurance benefits, the report is believed to conclude. I wish that the Minister for Health would make that report available. It confirms the point we made when we introduced bulk billing that it was a much more efficient administrative arrangement than the previous arrangement and the arrangement which would continue, to some degree, of individual billing. But bulk billing had more advantages than that. Bulk billing, to put it in its bluntest terms, meant feefixing,although I was always too delicate to spell it out as directly as that in the debate with the medical profession. The doctors were equally delicate to avoid spelling out that that was the reason for concern about it and why they opposed it. The fact is that that is why I was keen to have it introduced and that is why the medical profession was at least equally keen to try to prevent it being introduced. If we had had universal bulk billing we would have had universal fee for medical services in this country. That is easily attended to insofar as the rate of utilisation is concerned. It is a simple matter of monitoring the utilisation rates of medical practitioners. The central computer system which we established in the Health Insurance Commission was, among other things, programmed to provide the sort of information which would allow government, at very short notice, to acquire utilisation rates for various medical practitioners in the community. The medical profession knew that full well, too, and was always too delicate, again, to discuss its concern about that. It knew that if it did discuss the matter it would be exposing its own pecuniary motivations in so much of the opposition to the Medibank proposals which it presented when we were in government. I want to lay to rest the assertion that Medibank created an upsurge in the cost of health services. The Minister, who is rather dexterous in doing this sort of thing, likes to use as a basis for his argument statistics which have rather broad breaks between the years. He likes to refer to health expenditure as a proportion of the gross domestic product and to suggest that it is all related to the introduction of Medibank. If one looks at thefigures,year by year, one notes that the more rapid rates of acceleration occurred under the previous system of health insurance and that, if anything, they have eased down in more recent times. For instance, in 1973-74 the proportion of expenditure on health costs in this community was 5.9 per cent of the gross domestic product. In 1974-75, it was 6.8 way of payper cent; in 1975-76, the first full year of Medibank, it was 7.1 per cent; and in 1976-77 it was 7.7 per cent. It is very important to remember that in 1975-76 not only the full cost of Medibank was met but also $166m, or about five months in total, of medical bills from the preceding year were met. It was a problem of leads and lags and the introduction of a new scheme which was much more efficient. So the total amount spent on Medibank in that year and, accordingly, on health services included a substantial amount from the preceding year and at the same time-unlik e preceding years-me t also practically the full cost of health services for that year. We are not going to make any real progress in the subject of controlling health costs in this community until there is some sane and informed discussion. We have to recognise the sorts of abuses that arise which are not related to health insurance-for example, the way in which specialists have been over-utilising medical services. One cannot blame the patients for that. Specialist services are provided on referral from general practitioners. On 23 February in this Parliament the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and I discussed details of this matter. Hospital utilisation represents the most expensive area of all health services. In many areas of Australia we have a ratio of hospital beds to population which cannot be justified and we have, for instance, a maldistribution within the States. Accordingly, there is a requirement not only for monitoring of the way in which health services are provided by medical practitioners but also for monitoring of the way in which hospital bed services are provided. The more beds that are provided the more they will be occupied. That is a well-established principle in health economics. We need the other physical services that I mentioned before and which the honourable member for Prospect has dealt with in much more professional detail than I have. We need tissue audit to ensure that specialists such as geons are not removing clean organs unnecessarily from patients. We need general utilisation peer group review committees. In discussing the nature of cost increases, certain increases took place when we were in government that were thoroughly justified. The fact that they had not occurred earlier was an indication of the injustice that applied within the health services system. For instance, resident medical officers received long overdue increases in payments and improvements in their conditions of work. Nurses received long overdue increases in payments. Equal pay was introduced. All of those things were necessary and, to the extent that they had not been provided before, the system and the community had been imposing unfairly on those people. We should have been prepared to pay our way. I have said that we need a sane and sensible debate on this subject. One of the unfortunate features of the debate on health insurance is the way in which it has been marred by sheer shallow political opportunism on the part of conservatives within the coalition. One well recalls the passionate opposition to health insurance levies when Labor originally proposed the system of Medibank. Yet we now have them at a much more onerous rate than we proposed, introduced at a most inauspicious moment in terms of economic management. One can well recall the heated controversy that the then Opposition, now the Government, generated about the distribution of membership cards to all members of the community for the Medibank program. We proposed that it should not be mandatory for people to present the card when making a claim. This Government requires it. The coalition partners, when in Opposition, were disturbed at the proposal that we should introduce a public enterprise system like Medibank. They have in fact introduced Medibank Private as a public enterprise undertaking, and with good reason. It is the only way that the Government can keep the private health insurance funds in line and honest. When we were in government we sought to introduce legislation which would comprehensively control the operation of the private funds. There is no doubt that before we were in government the preceding conservative governments had had trouble privately in controlling private health insurance funds. One reason that the Government can now do that is that it has Medibank Private as a lever. But it also needed legislation to do that. We sought to bring in that legislation and it was rejected totally by a hostile Opposition majority in the Senate. Subsequently, one of the earliest pieces of legislation sur- introduced by this Government was brought in by the present Minister for Health, one of the most vociferous objectors to the legislation when we proposed it while in government. The solution to the problem of health costs is not going to be achieved by making health services more expensive for the users of those services. If it is proposed that patients should pay more, all that is going to happen is that families will be disadvantaged as against single people, large families as against small families, low income earners as against high income earners, the ill as against the healthy. It is my advice, from quite reliable sources, that the Government has not been totally forthcoming in its consideration of this matter. This report is only one of the matters before the Government, and I wish that I hadtimeto go through the various paragraphs of the report. I regard it as a rather shoddy and uncraftsmanlike document, the best effort for a mid-term assignment by an undergraduate, but nothing more. It falls well short of the standard the Parliament should expect. What the Government is really considering privately is the introduction of deductibles. That means simply that a patient will pay a specified amount of total health costs each year. Whether the amount is set at $50 a year or $500 a year, to a great degree it will discriminate against the ill. For instance, because of major illness a patient could be required to pay a very large amount of money in a short period and he could well find that at one specific point he has to pay the amount of $50, or it might be $500. That might well represent a severe strain on his limited finances. It will mean that the private health insurance schemes will have two funds, a cheap one for the healthy and an expensive one for the not-so-healthy. It will encourage people, as has happened in America, to gamble on the state of their health. The fact is that in America today there is a long-standing passionate debate about the deficiencies of health insurance, very largely because they have variations of this concept of deductibles. The basic Medibank concept will become a repository for the aged, the disabled, the chronically ill, the ethnically disadvantaged and the poor as the system of health insurance reverts to more and more complexity and greater and greater dissatisfaction. That is not the way to solve these problems, and I regret that this Green Paper is so defective as a document of detail on such an important matter.",62
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH CARE,Order! The honourable member's ume has expired.,65
100,Mr SHORT,HEALTH CARE," I am delighted that the Government has provided the House with an early opportunity to debate the Discussion Paper on Paying for Health Care and I congratulate the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) for providing adequate time for the paper to be discussed. More importantly, I congratulate the Government on arranging for the Hospitals and Health Services Commission to have the paper prepared in the first place and I congratulate Dr Sax on the quaUty of the document. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), I happen to believe that this document is a very important and well researched one- a document that is going to have considerable long-term implications and consequences. The paper is extremely comprehensive in its coverage of the issues involved and the whole question of the financing of health services. It should be compulsory reading for all persons with an interest in the subject, which I think would include most Australians. The paper has the great virtue of being a discussion paper, and I am deUghted that we have it. I think that in this Uament we ought to have many more discussion papers than we do have. As the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) stressed when presenting it, the paper does not necessarily represent the views of the Government and the Government is therefore not locked into any firm views at this stage. That is good because it gives the community at large the opportunity to present its view to the Government, to be taken into account when decisions come to be made. It also has the virtue, or it should have, of promoting a non-party political debate in this House about the issues involved. I was pleased to note that many speakers on the other side adopted a non-party political approach, and I was very saddened indeed that some of the leading spokesmen for the Opposition did not see fit to follow that line. The problems facing us in Australia in the of health care are enormous, at least so far as cost of health care and itsfinancingare cerned. Indeed, I beheve that there are few more important issues to be resolved than this one, I use the word 'resolved' advisedly. It is patently obvious that there is a major problem and it will not go away of its own accord. The problem affects each and every member of the community and each and every taxpayer. The simple fact that the cost of health care in Australia has escalated to a point where it is absorbing so much of our gross domestic product that it is imposing an onerous burden on each member of the community, either through private contributions or through taxes. It is pre-empting expenditure that might well be better spent in other areas and it is making the task of overall economic management by government increasingly difficult. The pointing out of these simple if unpalatable facts is one of the great strengths of Dr Sax's discussion paper. His proposals for possible solutions, of course, will be the centre of keen discussion, but no specific solutions can reaUy be forthcoming until there is a general community awareness of the size and nature of the problem. The problem simply is that we cannot afford continuing increases of the magnitude of recent years, increases that brought the total health bill of this nation to $6,254m in 1976-77, with an even larger amount estimated for the current year. Indeed, for the nine years to 1975-76, total health expenditure in this country rose by 329 per cent, an increase that has far outstripped the rate of increase in wages, prices and population. Between 1971-72 and 1975-76, as the Discussion Paper Paying for Health Care points out, Paronly 8 per cent of the increase in health expenditure was attributed to population changes. Fiftyeight per cent of the increase was due to the higher prices for medical and institutional services and 34 per cent of the increase-that is, more than one-third-wa s due to increased usage of services in terms of both volume and intensity. Of course, had the usage been less the amount of the increase in total costs due to the higher prices element would have been correspondingly less. The issues involved in all of these matters are very complex. They include changing medical needs, changing medical aspirations, changing influences and attitudes by the medical profession, changing technology, changing aspirations by potential patients and the methods of financing health costs. All of those changes require careful identification of the underlying factors and examination of the reasons behind area them before conclusions for change can be the reached confidently. The complexity suggests conthat any new arrangements to solve these problems- I agree completely with Dr Sax hereand require meticulous planning with long lead times and careful attention to public relations. I want to touch briefly on those particular areas which seem to me to be the most important. These are the attitude of doctors towards is encouraging patients to utilise more and more sophisticated specialist services, the cost of ning hospitals and capital costs, and the financialthere incentives or disincentives to potential users health services. As the Discussion Paper states, the doctor is the key decision-maker. It is doctor who allocates health services by recomhospitals. mending revisits, referrals to specialists, ordering laboratory and X-ray investigations, recomthat mending hospital admissions, operations, length of stay in hospital and so on. Dr Sax uses interesting term. He states that the doctor is and must be the 'gatekeeper' of the system. This particularly important in the case of hospital costs. It is the doctor who in large measure mines the use of hospital services, which have grown more than any other element within the health care system. Doctors must be Commonwealth-State made more aware than many of them are at of global present of the cost of establishing new hospital a facilities and of the cost of running and servicing those facilities. Rigid cost benefit analysis must rangements be applied to the decision-making process to under-used determine whether new facilities should be esfor the tablished. As the Discussion Paper I agree very much with the contents of this paragraph-ther e must be a strict evaluation of the necessity for capital expenditures on new hospital construction and a rationalisation of specialised facilities between hospitals on an intra-regional and inter-regional basis. Hospital boards of management have an years important role to play in this matter as well. Most boards are manned by highly worthy persons, many of them leaders in their local communities. At present, however, at least in Victoria, these boards do not have the positive incentives to as cost conscious as they might. This is because what I regard as the ridiculous system of forcing hospitals to return any savings at the end of year to Consolidated Revenue. I particularly commend to the House paragraph 181 of the Discussion Paper which, amongst other things, states that there should be the development of system of positive incentives to reward efficient public hospital managements instead negative incentives inherent in the current system which returns savings to State treasuries. Dr Jenkins-We ought to copy Canada.",65
101,Mr SHORT,HEALTH CARE,"That is a possibility too. It would involve the use of a uniform accounts mechanism that is being developed. The parabills graph goes on to state: Agreement would be reached on methods of making lowances for unexpected factors which could cause ture overruns, and then a scheme might be negotiated return to the hospital of a portion of any savings for specified purposes. Such a return from tive incentive to achieve expenditure limitations. runOf course, the Discussion Paper points out that are potential difficulties in such a scheme of including deliberate over-budgeting. It therefore suggests that pilot projects would be necessary to the evaluate the approach in groups of different I believe that this is one of the most important paragraphs of the review and I hope both State and Federal Governments will look very closely at it. At the moment, there is no an doubt that major disincentives exist to make hospitals not as efficient as they might be, given is the presentfinancialarrangements. I am also very attracted by the following paragraphs in the deterPaper, paragraph 182, which makes the followthe costs of ing suggestion: Consideration could be given, in the context of revised cost-sharing arrangements, to the use budgets for all publicly organised health services in region. Commonwealth contributions to the States might then be based on a formula which aggregates existing payments from several discrete cost-sharing programs. Such arwould provide incentives for closing down services or unnecessary duplications of units, and use of cheaper alternatives to hospital care to comstates-agai n pensate for closures . . . Improvements in these areas are long overdue. But they will not in themselves cure all the problems. Productivity is also very important. I have a major hospital in my electorate- I am sure I am not atypical in this respect-whic h has the same number of hospital beds as it had 7 years to 10 ago. But over the same period the total staff at this hospital has doubled. This is because of changes in the nurse training system, greater job specialisation by non-specialist staff and perhaps for other reasons. These are matters which I bebe lieve require most urgent consideration. They do of not appear to receive, on my reading of the Discussion Paper, much, if any, attention. But there each is no doubt that they have been a major factor behind the increase in hospital costs in recent years for the simple reason that wages and salaries comprise 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the a total costs of running hospitals. Decisions in these areas are important and will not attract full of the community acceptance. Even more difficult are the decisions that may need to be taken in respect of the proportion of medical bills to be met by the patient. Most of us would accept that it is desirable that patients should pay a certain proportion of their health themselves. The question at issue is: What proportion? I believe that the debate on this subalject often tends to get out of proportion and to expendilose its perspective. The argument tends to for the ignore the real issue, important though that argument is. The real issue in the end is that the comsavings would constitute a posimunity must bear the full cost of health care. It must do so either through personal direct contriown butions or through taxadon. The only solution the end really Ues in educating both potential patients and the medical profession as to the need not to over-use medical care. Both groups need educating. Perhaps the medical profession needs educating more than the patients. It is worth remembering that, despite the enormous increase in health costs over recent years, we are tion not noticeably more healthy nor do we Uve service longer. Finally, I express the view-I think it is related to this fact-that we pay far too little attention this country to preventative medicine as distinct from curative medicine. The Discussion Paper makes the point that the present health financing system provides Uttle inducement to undertake greater effort in this area. I hope that the Governcare. ment wtil take full note of this point in framing any future decisions on improving our health tem. In this context I particularly have in the increasing problem in our community of coholism and drug dependence. These growing diseases in our community are causing increasing social, health and economic problems. I believe that unless we as a nation tackle those problems we will see them become increasingly more national difficult and more tragic for many people. No one in this Parliament would deny that it is axioand matic that all Australians must have access essential health services without financial ship preventing them from obtaining this. But as the Discussion Paper points out, there seems doubt whatsoever that this can be achieved at less cost than is now involved. I commend the paper as a frank exposure of social the issues involved. I believe it forms a vital basis for community discussion on the vital issues involved and for government consideration in formulating the ongoing future decisions that viously are required if we are to obtain the best value for our health dollar and a reduction time in the proportion of our resources going into health. If we do not achieve this we will not stay healthy. We will simply strangle ourselves to death economically.",66
102,Dr JENKINS,HEALTH CARE," I listened some interest to the debate on this paper. I lieve it is a bit Uke the curate's egg, as is a lot the discussion. Honourable members have beds talked a lot about the onerous question of health costs-onerou s because the percentage of the gross domestic product that is out laid on health hasrisento such a high percentage. They forget that before we had a more sophisticated method of health financing it was very onerous for individual who had to pay health costs from pocket and who, in many cases, went within out because he was frightened to seek medical attention because of the cost involved resulting, in many cases, in unnecessarily shortened Uves. It is obvious too that one of the most interesting parts of this Paper has not been terribly well read. I think that this aspect deserves more attenby members of this House. I refer to Appendix I which gives a review of the history of health financing in Australia. I want to make a number of comments on that. Appendix I refers firstly to the beginning of health insurance and in then deals with mutual aid or friendly societies which operated under a capitation system and which were in existence for many years. Even at that stage doctors were worried that the Government might intrude into the financing of health They formed their own benefit funds to try to prevent this. As is mentioned in this history, syspart of the Constitution empowered the Commind monwealth to legislate on insurance, and the almatter was discussed in this House many years ago. In 1923 the Royal Commission on National Insurance recommended a national insurance scheme to cover sickness, invalidity and maternity and superannuation benefits and a separate health scheme to provide medical care. It failed because of opposition from employers friendly societies. The nature of the system to mig nave been different, but the principle and nt hardthe thought behind it were similar. no In 1938 R. G. Casey introduced the National Health and Pensions Bill. When speaking to the Bill he expressed the then conservative Government's fear of the financial impUcations of free security and its wish to preserve the dignity and the self-respect of the recipient of benefits by having him contributefinanciallytowards the scheme. In 40 years members on the other side of obthe House have not advanced one inch from that position. Despite that attitude they legislated for over insurance to provide medical care and other benefits. Only the war interrupted that scheme. I move on to Curtin's expression of the belief that national health services, like education, should be available to all. Honourable members with will recall the stormy days of the 1940s. A bescheme was introduced whereby at least governof ment hospitals in the States were paid for their and provided treatment of patients occupying those beds without means test or fee. One of the aspects of today's debate on which I want to comment is the confusion about hospital beds. Some members have appreciated that there are different categories of hospital beds, that there the are private hospitals and private investment his hospitals financed by doctors and others interested in the health care held, quite apart from government hospitals, which play a role in increasing the cost of health care. I move from that situauon to the introducdon of the Nauonal Health Act in 1953, when some payment went to government hospitals but the major part payment depended on the individual taking out voluntary health insurance to receive a further amount. I graduated in medicine 25 years ago, and my experience with health insurance was in the returns.been period before the introduction of Medibank. I cal training that knew only too well that many people could not is, or has been, directed afford the voluntary health insurance that gave and exotic complaints rather them the extra benefit. I saw the bad debts that problems, occurred even amongst those who could voluntary health insurance. Despite the patching patients attend. Not enough emphasismost up that went on it was, overall, a most unsatisplaced factory situation. So I welcomed the introduction of Medibank. I welcomed even more some of the programs that went with it, such as the introduction of community health centres. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short) spoke about preventive medicine. One of the best steps that was taken in the national health scheme was the development of community health centres. they had been allowed to operate as was orighospitals inally intended when they were introduced, if they had been allowed to operate with salaried staff in the communities where they were needed, where there was no need for fee-for-service to tract finance, they would have continued to play the real role they started to play in preventive medicine in the community, with doctors and paramedical workers able to go out into the areas they served to look at so many of the lems that arise in those communities and so many things that could be done in a preventive fashion. My colleague the honourable member for Batgument man (Mr Howe) spoke about the failure of hospitals to have a mechanism for comparing costs. He mentioned the work of Dr Ian Brand, Preston and Northcote Community Hospital, organisations where I am a member of the board of managein Canada. ment, and referred to his attempt to use Hospower. This is a system whereby hospitals try to compare their costs. Because of the lack of a comparative mechanism there can be no true comparison, and that is the criticism of the tem. It is said by some people that Medibank led to overutilisation. Several weeks ago there was statement by Dr Deeble to the effect that on the introduction of Medibank there was a 2 per cent increase in patient visitations to doctors, but there was a 100 per cent increase in the referrals for diagnostic tests or specialist said that the doctors are the gatekeepers of the scheme. There is a group of diseases called iatrogenic diseases which are doctor produced, and I wonder whether on those figures much of the increase in health costs is not iatrogenic. Some of of the it is probably very deliberate. We have all been shocked by recent court cases, not only those in the social security area havebut also those in other areas, in which doctors This shown to be making fraudulent also points up a defect in the medithe doctors receive. Our training to the more complicated than to the common the common stress situations and the afford common minor illnesses with which has of the been on the social aspect of medicine and the need for care in ordering expensive tests. on Mention has been made of the availability of hospital beds. There appears to be an excess number. Let us look at the availability of government hospital beds and of private hospital beds, If particularly in that group of private investment of which I spoke. I must admit to having a feeling that it is unethical for members of the medical profession to have shares in private hospitals. There is a financial inducement atfor them to refer patients to those hospitals and for overuse of beds. I think that they should be divorced from the activities of those hospitals. From an examination of the availability of beds there appears to be a skew deviation. If a person probcan pay the extra money, pay the higher fees, pay the gap insurance and so on he can get a bed, but there is a relative shortage in the public area. One of the basic reasons for the increased cost to the Government of the scheme lies in the old arof fee-for-service versus salaried service. Time does not permit me to develop that theme and to mention the experiences of Flexner's view at in the early 1900s, the Kaiser health scheme and such as the Windsor health service Mention was made of incentives for hospitals. true Canada introduced such incentives in hospitals when the grants made to hospitals initially were sysbased partly on the average bed cost for hospitals in a Province and partly on the average daily a bed cost of that hospital itself, which gave an incentive for the hospital to get below the average. Unfortunately, I have little speaking time that left, but I want to look at a couple of the conclusions in the discussion paper. Conclusion 2 on opinions. It is page 102 states: Increased use of medical and hospital services and increases in fees and prices have resulted in a very rapid growth in expenditures. We need to make an analysis of that increased use of medical and hospital services and who brings it about. We need to make an examination of who causes the increases in fees and prices. As honourable members know, the suggested Australian Medical Association schedule of fees differs from the Government schedule. Conclusion 3 states: It is concluded that patients should pay a larger the costs of health care directly out-of-pocket for three reasons: to retard rates of expansion in the use of medical tal servicesWe do not necessarily accept that that is a fact and that it will lead to better healthto reduce the rate of growth of Government expenditures on health servicesI suppose that it would work there, but whether that is a good thing is another matterto reduce the rate of growth in health insurance contribution rates. I would like to know more about that mechanism because when I turn to conclusions 20 and 21 I find the following: C20. It is essential that benefits be available for analysis. The supply of informadon from private health benefit organisations is incomplete . . . C21. A number of matters require intensive study: (i) Increased direct payments by patients impinge most heavily on the poor. It goes on to ask a number of questions which are not as yet answered. If they are not answered I have doubts about a number of the other conclusions that are made in this paper. I would like to be able to expand on that further but time will not allow that. I think that the matter requires further examination.",67
103,Mr HUNT,HEALTH CARE,"Firstly , I would hke to thank all those who have participated in the debate this afternoon and this evening on the Discussion Paper on Paying for Health Care. I join with other speakers, excluding the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), in complimenting the Hospitals and Health Services Commission for the production of this discussion paper. It has been a provocative paper but it has been a stimulating document. It has evoked discussion both in this Parliament and outside it. It has provoked discussion in the community generally. There have been many newspaper editorials on it, medical writers have written about it and my office has received hundreds of letters from people outside this place expressing a view upon the paper. This is the sort of stimulating discussion that I want to see generated. I do not want to hear just from the medical profession, the hospitals associations and respective party groups. I want to hear from the individuals in the community and a great number of people have taken the opportunity to discuss the issue with me personally and to write to me. I thank them very much for the interest that they have taken. After all, health costs affect share of everyone in the community. There is no way that we will escape health costs. It does not matter what modifications we make to the health and hospiinsurance system. People will make their own contribution by one means or another-eithe r by means of paying levies, paying income tax, paying health insurance contributions, paying directly out of their pockets or by a combination of these methods. The fact of life is that health costs in this country have escalated to alarming levels. The people have become aware of that. I think that in itself wtil have an effect upon the providers of health care who, after all, are members of the community, as indeed are the consumers. We all live within the community and we all ultimately accept a responsibibty for trends that occur once we realise there is a problem. statistics on claims for health Many constructive suggestions have been made tonight. Some of the contributions have been based more on ideological concepts rather than on facts. However, the debate has been a reflection of public concern about health costs. The paper that we have been debating places into a historical context and perspective the trends in the consumption of health services and the expenditures on them. It directs attention to the factors influencing usage and expenditures. It undertakes some discussion about the reasons for the cost explosions in the hospitals and throughout the system itself. It is a most useful study and will be quoted for some time to come. We have all identified the problem, and to some extent the reasons for that were the changes that we made to health insurance on 1 October 1976. In the six years to 1976-77 we have seen health costs explode from $2,232m to $6,254m. That is big money when one considers that the value of our iron ore, wool, wheat, meat and coal exports for the lastfinancialyear was $4,500m. So health costs in this country have been about one and a half times as great. The changes that we made to health insurance on 1 October 1976 quite deliberately transferred a considerable portion of health costs from the taxation pool-the pool to which taxpayers contribute-to individuals, to the community. People pay according to their means through the taxthis ation system-throug h the levy-o r by way of premium if they choose to insure privately. changes on 1 October removed from Conupon solidated Revenue much of the cost and exposed to the people the costs so that they could them and so that they could feel them. Thus hc awareness has been created, which I think is extremely important to enable us to come to grips with the problem. The problem has been identified in this country and overseas in most Western countries by economists and well that informed people for many, many years but it has been only in more recent times that the man the street and the doctor, the provider of care, have become concerned about the issue. I suppose that in considering the problem health costs in a country like Australia where have a high standard of living we must take into account the fact that most people place great value on hfe and comfort. Therefore I do not suppose that it is unreal to expect that a munity such as ours would have a growing nology amount of its gross domestic product spent on health care. Without naming them, in some of the underdeveloped countries where life itself does not assume the value to individuals that it does in our country their order of priority not be as high as ours, so far as health care cerned. To some extent perhaps that is why in Western countries where there is a relatively higher standard of Uving we have seen this been escalation of the gross domestic product expendous diture on health care increasing year by year. What are the reasons for the great explosion health care costs in the last six years? Basically, the universal health insurance system I think made people, certainly the providers of health care, less cost conscious. Secondly, there is the great explosion in wages and salaries in the health care cost area. More than 75 per cent those people who are employed are females with the equalisation of pay conditions naturally there was a large explosion in health care costs the wages area in 1973-74. That is why there a great explosion in health costs the year before Medibank became operative. Enormous wage vices and salary adjustments were made in the hospiIn tals sector. I am not arguing that it was right wrong. The fact of the matter was that so many of the women who were employed in these areas were underpaid compared with other people in the community and adjustments had to be made.",69
104,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH CARE,In that case surely it was right.,70
105,Mr HUNT,HEALTH CARE,"I am not arguing. I said that I am not saying that it was right or wrong. But if wish me to commit myself I think the nurses of country deserved to be paid far better than they were in days gone by. The introduction of The Medibank itself did not impose any discipline the system. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) talked about the inefficiency of see Medibank Mark II but I do not suppose there pubwas ever a system introduced into any country that was less cost efficient than the Medibank operation itself. The Medibank hospitals agreements were open ended so far as the States were concerned; the whole system was so open ended it led to all sons of abuses. No attempt was made before we came into office to set up mediin cal services committees of inquiry. These have health since been set up in each State. We have introduced the concept of peer review to the of medical profession and the Australian Medical we Association has indicated its willingness to go ahead with it. We have taken measures to overcome the very heavy costs of the diagnostic services to the community in the areas of pathology comand CAT scanning and in the other high techdiagnostic areas of medicine. We have gone to tremendous lengths to try to obtain the co-operation of the providers of health care in rationalising resources and the system generally. I am pleased to say that we have had tremenwould dous co-operation from the AMA and responis consible members of the medical profession. We have tackled the problem of fraud and abuse and certainly the overuse of services where we have able to catch the culprits. So I think tremenprogress is being made and it is being reflected in a slowing down in the rate of accelerin ation of the increase in health costs in this country. I demonstrate that by saying that in has 1973-74 5.92 per cent of gross domestic product was spent on health; in 1974-75 the percentage was 6.83 per cent; in 1975-76 it hadrisento 7.38 per cent; and in 1976-77 it hadrisento 7.67 per of cent. The percentage increases in DGP were: Beand tween 1973-74 and 1974-75 there was a great leap of 15.4 per cent; between 1974-75 and in 1975-76 it increased by 8.1 per cent; and bewas tween 1975-76 and 1976-77 the increase was 3.9 per cent. But what is more interesting is the serper head of population on the medical side. 1974-75 there were 5.3 services per head of or population, rising to 5.94 services in 1975-76, an increase of 11 per cent. Thefigurefell to 5.82 services per head in 1976-77 which was a net reduction of 2 per cent. Thosefiguresgivefirmindications that the measures that we took in October 1976 are in fact working. But we are not complacent about the situation. you We are currently reviewing the whole health insurance system to see whether there are other ways to ensure that the rate of acceleration of health cost in this country does not crowd out our capacity to spend essential resources on other important areas in the economy such as social welfare, the need for job creation, the need to assist industry to employ people and so on. If we allowed health costs to grow uncontrollably we would deny a capacity to help people in other ways. So for that reason alone it is essential that we adopt a responsible position as a government and it is essential that we try ship to the community, to the doctors, to the hospital administrators and to all those people who are associated with health care delivery in this country. Judging from the submissions that have come to hand and the attitudes that are being expressed to me and to the Government, I am quite satisfied that there is a willingness on the part of most of the medical profession, the hospitals themselves and the State governments, regardless of their political persuasions, to come to grips with this problem. I am quite confident that if we give ourselves adequate time to deal with this problem we will be able to shape the health insurance system in Australia so that it will be second to none in the world. I believe that we have a health system that is probably second to none. We have very good basic resources in this country. I do not think I have ever heard anybody really seriously criticise the quality of the resources and the services that are available to the Australian people. Our real concern is to ensure that the dollars that are being spent on health care in this country are being spent wisely and prudently. I assure honourable members that the Government will continue to review the situation. It will continue to take whatever measures it thinks are necessary to ensure that the dollars are being wisely spent in the best interests of people and at the sametimewill ensure that nobody is denied easy access to high quality care in this country regardless of their income level or geographic situation. We have even moved to try to make it easier for people living in remote areas to get specialised attention within the universal health insurance system in this country. We will not allow a situation to develop where people will be denied access to proper health care.",70

107,Mr SCHOLES,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"The Opposition does not oppose the Softwood Forestry Agreements Btil 1978 which provides funds for the continued maintenance of existing softwood plantings under the softwood forestry agreements. However, on behalf of the Opposition I move an amendment in the following terms: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should continue to provide funds to the States for new plantings in the same proportion as in previous agreements, of about 50 per cent, in order to ensure that reasonable continuity of planting rates is maintained'. The purpose of the amendment is to seek a continuing Commonwealth contribution to plantings of softwoods in Australia. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics in a study released last year estimated that plantings of 30,000 hectares would lead to a domestic surplus of softwoods by the year 2020. It is the opinion of the Opposition however that if Commonwealth support for plantings falls off the States will not increase their expenditure in order to obtain a level of plantings which would bring about that surplus situation. In fact, a deficit situation will be created. The industry, in the softwoods area, is fairly cost effective when compared with imported timbers. The softwoods section is relatively efficient. There seems to be a sound economic case for a continuation of the Commonwealth's providing funds for such plantings. The Opposition believes some conditions should apply to the availability of those funds. One condition is that cognisance be taken of the report on softwoods of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. This report was presented sometimeago. We believe that any clearing of hardwood forests for the purpose of replanting would not be in the best interests of the long-term future of the natural environment or of the nation. Plantings on already cleared land which is becoming available for this purpose can be and are being undertaken commercially. We believe that Commonwealth assistance at this level would ensure a continued planting arrangement which would provide Australia with a substantial portion of its timber needs into Obviously there are good economic reasons for seeking to obtain a reasonable level from our own resources. One of these reasons obviously is the continuing cost of freight. Any sigreserve nificant shortfalls could well be extremely expensive in freight terms and in purchasing terms in the near future. Obviously supplies of timbersupport at relatively competitive rates are available importation to Australia at this stage. If, howconsequence ever, Australia reaches a shortfall situation where it becomes significantly dependent on imports the rates at which we purchase could well change considerably. The amounts of estry money which would be involved if the amend of ment were accepted would not be great, but they would contribute to a continuity of supply of softwoods for timber and other purposes. My understanding is that softwood planting a fairly good income earner for those who underof take it. It brings in something of the order of $ 120 to $ 130 a hectare per annum which is a betarea ter return on land usage than is available from considerable number of more popular or better publicly accepted activities. There are obviously delays m collecting returns. The Opposition, as I have indicated, does oppose the Bill. The amendment seeks to have the Government continue the agreement whereby the Commonwealth provides funds, on a 50 per cent basis, for future ings of softwoods. My understanding is that most have been in States would like to continue perience suggests that they are more likely to do Agreement Act1967 so if Commonwealth funds are made A fairly rapid drop-off in expenditure in the States on an annual basis toassistance States can be expected if Commonwealth funds are not reallocated mto this area.

I myrightto speak at a later stage.  of the Softwood Forestry Agreement Bill for 1978 which is of great economic and social to the forestry industry in Australia generally and especially to my electorate. I look for the moment to the development of the forestry industry. In South Australia the first fortree nurseries were started in the south east the State in the late 1870s. Since thattimethe industry has grown to a position in which the whole of the forest reserve in South Australia, for which the State Woods and Forests Department is currently responsible, I am informed, totals is 129,000 hectares of which the net standing area coniferous pine plantations to which this Bill relates is about 75,000 hectares. The net standing of pines in the south east of South Australia a alone at 30 June last year was 61,321 hectares, representing about 81 per cent of the total State plantings. Private pine plantations amount to some 17,000 hectares of which some 14,500 hecnot tares is owned by two industrial forestry companies, Softwood Holdings Ltd and South Australian Perpetual Forest Ltd. Given the limited amount of natural forest, or continued plantespecially South Australia, the previous Acts important to the development of this these programs. Exindustry. In the first Softwood Forestry was passed with the intention of available. providing Commonwealth to the achieve a total annual plantation rate of 23,700to allow the States hectares by the end of the five year period. The second Softwood Forestry Agreement Act of 1972 reversed downward the annual planting I rate from 23,700 hectares to 22,120 hectares. that The rate actually achieved was nearer 25,000 hectares per annum and in addition 8,000 heccost tares was planted privately. In 1967 Australia had about 300,000 hectares of coniferous plantations. This increased to about 450,000 hectares in 1972 and to over 550,000 hectares in 1975. good Overall, the two previous arrangements have a significant efTect in adding to the States into expansion of softwood production by financing planting and maintenance of about 100,000 hecfor the tares of plantations. One of the main reasons for the introduction these Acts was the general acceptance at that ume that it would be in Australia's long term interests to become self-sufficient in forest ucts. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics report of 1977 on the Austrahan softwoods products industry similarly indicated that it would be in Australia's economic interest to self-sufficient in areas such as wood pulp and newsprint. The regional economic advantages be obtained from increases processing of Austrahan forestry resources are extremely important, especially when forestry should plantations and processing industries can be estabUshed in rural and decentralised industries obviously provide jobs in areas which greatly need them and assist generally in the depared with other building materials centralisation effort. The BAE report gives estimates of softwood plantation rates to be obtained for the period 1976-1980 that would allow Australia to become self-sufficient in wood supplies by the year 2002. Its conclusions state a rate which is the annual average rate of 33,800 hectares planted during the 1970-75 period of which 8,300 hectares were private plantings and 25,500 hectares were plantations on Crown land. It is worth mentioning that the Commonwealth traUan funded about 50 per cent of these pine plantion tations on Crown land during the period of the 1972 Softwood Forestry Agreement Act. The revised BAE estimates are well below the annual average planting rate of the 1970-75 period other information available to the Government, including of course the downward revision population forecasts, led to the conclusions stated by the Minister for Primary Industry Sinclair) in his second reading speech on this Bill. He said that: . . . further agreements along the lines of those ised by the 1967-1972 and 1976 Acts were not justified this time. It 'It' being the Government. . . considered however that it should continue vide finance to meet the same proportion of the States tenance expenditure on the total area of softwood tations established in the 11 year period, as the area monwealth assisted plantings bears to the total ing in that period. In other words, this Bill provides an upper limit of $4.2m to cover the costs of maintenance of the plantings financed by earlier Commonwealth asment sistance. The amount to be received by South Australia will be 5229,300. Further, the Governperiod ment will review the situation regarding ditional land purchases prior to the commencethis ment of the second of the five years in the program. of I make now a couple of observations about this industry which has caused and, indeed, is causing some public concern. Firstly, I refer, as proddid the previous speaker, to the environment. In 1974 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation inquired into the operation of the 1967 and 1972 be Acts with particular reference, which I will mention in part, to their environmental, social and to economic impact. The Committee's first three in the growing and findings were: (i) Australia's timber resources are relatively small and be conserved in the long term interests of the nation. areas. These possibly on aislesser (ii) There a need for a softwoods planting program, scale than that planned at present. (iii) Timber is a versatile, renewable material which comcan be produced at lower costs, with far less use of our dwindling energy supplies and with less damage to the environment. The Committee made other recommendations but I think it is important to note those that I quoted as they provide a sound rebuttal to our well below more radical environmentaUsts. The second point I make is that the forestry industry, like nearly every other industry in Australia, suffered and continues to suffer from the disastrous consequences of the period of AusLabor Party government. The high inflarate, the huge increase in labour costs and industrial lawlessness suffered by Australia during that period priced workers out of jobs. The result in the timber industry was a speeding up of and the shift to mechanisation. In 1972-73 107,387 people were employed in forestry and forestry of industries in Australia. In 1974-75 105,004 people were employed. In 1975-76 97,797 (Mr people were employed. That is a loss of some 10,000 jobs in this industry in three years. So it is not only this Bill but also the Government's conauthortinuing success in restoring economic sanity at which wtil benefit the forestry industries and assist the States in endeavouring to maintain employment in these industries at the present levels. to proI can assure the House that this must be one of mainthe most important factors to be considered. It plancertainly is to the people in my electorate, in of Comtowns such as Meadows, Mount Burr, Millicent, area of plantNangwarry, Tarpeena, Mount Gambier and other towns, who rely on this industry. Finally I want to raise the question of governintervention in this industry. Clearly the nature of the industry, the long-term investment and other factors necessitated governadment assistance. However, in South Australia has now gone much further. Recently the Government in South Australia bought a large share of a relatively small timber retailer in Mount Gambier. The Government said at the ume that this was to provide an outlet for the State's wood and forestry operauons. The State department is a very large supplier of timber. So it was quite clear that this oudet which will service only a relatively small market really was not what the State Government was looking for. If the State Government were genuine, if it wanted to get into marketing, I just cannot understand why it did not get into marketing in Adelaide where there is a much larger market. I believe the real reason was that the State Labor Government thought that it would just put its toe in the water to test the temperature, to see how much outcry there was in South Australia against this further socialisation of private enterprise and to see whether this State Government takeover of private enterprise in South Austraha would be considered by the South Australian public to be okay. I warn the people of South Australia that if there is not much of an outcry and if there is not a continuing outcry I believe the Dunstan Government will press on with its takeovers of South Austrahan industries. Clearly such a philosophy is quite contrary to my own, but I suppose it would not be so bad if the State Government were efficient. At the moment it is having difficulties in running the Government, let alone private enterprise as well. The State Government's Budget has blown out to a deficit of about $26m this year and its efforts in the field of private enterprise are no better than its efforts elsewhere. I refer to one instance. The South Australian Meat Corporation is run by the South Austrahan Government. Its costs are among the highest costs of abattoirs in Australia. It is pricing itself out of the market its workers are losing their jobs. As a result of a misconceived belief by the workers in that industry, they are now picketing the export of live sheep.",72
109,Mr COHEN,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Barker has gone slightly wide of the provisions this Bill. What he is saying now has absolutely relevance to this Bill.",74
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"I charge must uphold the point of order. I refer the honourable member for Barker to the Btil.  Speaker. I can understand the Opposition's cern about this matter because many primary staff producers are gravely affected by the union action in South Austraha. I think it is very importhey tant as far as the forestry industries in South Australia and the jobs of the people in my electorate are concerned that the same thing does not happen to them as has happened to the people who work for the South Australian Meat Corporation. Those people are losing their jobs. I do not want the same thing to happen to the people in my electorate who are in the forestry industry. The South Australian Government has not shown that it is able to run the corporation. I do not beheve it will be able to run the private enterprise that it is trying to get into in forestry. I make this warning to the people of South Australia and ask them for their support: Stop this Government before things get worse. We have already paid a high price for the Labor Government in South Australia. We have even gone as far as paying for Don Dunstan's legal action for damages in the Supreme Court. We are paying the costs of the Crown Solicitor. I warn the people of South Australia that it is very important that this takeover of private enterprise, especially in the forestry industry, should not be allowed to continue. I support this Bill.

111,Dr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"At Question Time today I asked the Minister for Employment and and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) a question about the funding of Community Youth Support Scheme projects. I received an answer which indicated that CYSS, like motherhood, was very desirable, but I did not receive an answer to my question. It so happens that many project officers working in CYSS are trying to make what is in many ways an unsatisfactory scheme work. Yet of the basis of the funding of CYSS is only for a no short-term period. The Professional Officers Association in Victoria has written to the officer in of the scheme in Victoria pointing out that the six-monthly funding limits the effectiveness of the scheme in many ways. Much of the time has to be spent in preparing suband no planning can go on except for conthe most short-term contingencies. Among the there are people with considerable expertise and considerable feeling for persons for whom are working, but this short term six-month financing makes it quite impossible for them to plan their future course. This limits the efficient functioning of the projects. At Question Time today I asked: Is it a fact that CYSS projects are funded only until 30 June 1978? They are funded only until that date. There is a guarantee of funds only until 30 June. The officers have no indication at this stage, in April, what finance will be available to them after 30 June. The one answer I got today from the Minister was: Yes, the scheme is to conunue. That is not much for the people involved in those projects in Victoria who must plan ahead, in the job they are trying to do. I mention this matter because I have been operative. We have a quite reasonably successful project operating in my area. Heaven knows, there is enough work there to be done. The staff are suffering the problem of having to plan programs with short-term finance. If this scheme is to play a meaningful part in combating the effects of unemployment the officers who are trygiven ing to support the affected young people at a of high unemployment-ofte n involving young said: people who are in the transition period between leaving school and taking their first job, a time If they when they feel that their future is in doubt and time when they feel their place in society is in end . . . doubt-mus t be supported. If this short-term tude on funding of the scheme is to continue, if less than three months before the finance is due to run out they have no idea what the Governpeople ment's future commitment will be, all the protpared estations in the world destroy the work these eager young oflicers are trying to carry out. I the Minister to take note of the question I asked today and to try to give the officers who work under that scheme, if not me, an answer to it.",74
112,Mr SIMON,ADJOURNMENT," I should tike to refer to an interview in a This Day Tonight program on IS March between Mr Sam Lipski of and Mr Bill Hartley on the Israeli reprisals folsenseless lowing the El Fatah raid of the Saturday before. I will refer to the transcript of that program. It concerns me that the person who introduced the two speakers, Mr Clive Hale, perhaps did not properly introduce Mr Bill Hartley. To the barrassment of some honourable members opAffairs posite, he was described as a member of the tralian Labor Party and a known advocate of the Palestinian cause. When one reads the full transcript one can see that no viewer would have been in any doubt about who Mr Bill Hartley is and what he represents. He was described in that interview as having said previously that the Israelis were 'a cabal of murderers who have the gall to claim that they are heading a responsible nation state'. I should have thought that the person introducing him would have gone on to describe Bill Hartley as an anti-Semite and a supporter of the terrorist tactics of El Fatah. Mr Bill Hartley described El Fatah as a 'liberation arm of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and the core organisation of the PLO'. He made another incredible statement when he said: Now as far as that operation the other day I defend operations in what basically is occupied territory. Mr Bill Hartley is a man who endorses and defends a terrorist organisation bent on the destruction of Israel. He is a man who supports an coorganisation which believes that the bombing and murder of civilian men, women and children is an acceptable means of settling international disputes and solving many of the long-standing problems in the Middle East, such as the settlement of Palestinian refugees. If one reads the transcript further one will see that the viewer was some indication of the twisted mind of this time particular gentleman, Mr Bill Hartley, when he The Israeli don't care about the lives of their own people. can reject one Palestinian demand they would be prea pared to wipe out half of Tel Aviv to achieve that attiThat absurd conclusion by Mr Bill Hartley is fairly typical of the utterances he has made. The people of Israel respect and treasure life. The of Israel love life, respect it and are preto fight for it. To suggest that they would kill their own people in the way in which Bill ask Hartley has described it is absurd and labels him for what he is. I would label him as a twisted and bitter anti-Semite who is wracked by hate of anything and anyone connected with the state of Israel. The action taken by the Israelis was not an act retaliation. It was prompted by the brutal and murder of Israeli men, women and children. It was an act of self-defence by a sovereign state to protect its citizens. In case there is any doubt about the position of the state of Israel, I refer honourable members to a report on the emMiddle East of the Joint Committee on Foreign and Defence, which was chaired by the Ausformer member for Fremantle, who was a highly respected member of this House. In the preface it is stated: The stakes are higher for Israel than for almost any other nation on earth-ther e may well be national extinction and genocide. The Ashkanasy (European) Jews have recent memories of genocide in Auschwitz, Belsen, Dachau and the Warsaw Ghetto. The Oriental Jews have memories af violence and expulsion from Arab states. The Jews will not again submit to genocide. They will not be helpless, as were so many of Hitler's victims. In conclusion I should like to emphasise a few points. It would be well for people like Mr Bill Hartley to remember that the PLO is bent on the destruction of the sovereign state of Israel. sponsible government would tolerate unwarranted, unprovoked terrorist attacks on its citizens. The Government of Israel has no alternative but to remove the source of the terrorism which damages the security and well-being of its people. The people of Israel seek peace in the troubled and explosive Middle East area. That is now recognised by the Government of Egypt and President Sadat. Israel has been abused. Israel is ready, willing and able to enter into just and peaceful settlement, as are other re- continually sponsible leaders in the Middle East. I condemn the remarks of Mr Bill Hartley. I trust that if he ever appears again on a program such as This Day Tonight he will be more suitably described as the twisted man that he is. Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) (10.35)- I rise tonight to make the statement that the Fraser Government has set a lamentably low standard of government to open up another three years on the Treasury benches. Those words are not my words or the words of the Labor Opposition; they are the words of an editorial in the national businessmen's daily newspaper, the Australian Financial Review. They were not written about the current disgraceful affairs at Aurukun. They were written about the action of the Government regarding increases in health insurance charges, which, of course, is another disgraceful affair. Those words appeared in the 3 January 1978 issue of that newspaper. I believe that Australians now remember the propaganda of the Liberal-National Country Party caretaker government in the 1975 election campaign. In that campaign the Labor GovernAustralia ment was presented as a crisis-ridden governensure thatmust ment. Australians will remember the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to sport back onto the front pages. Unfortunately the 100 days or so since the Fraser Government was given a second chance to govern the country, in the interests of all, the affairs of the Governnight ment have been very much in the headlines. The Aurukun situation is not an isolated case. health funds affair, the Kerr affair, the InterMaitland national Business Machines affair and the cumstances that led to the resignation of the former Treasurer and present Minister for Indusvegetables try and Commerce (Mr Lynch) have all occurred during the reign of this Government. All these controversies have occurred in the space of three months. They have occurred during the period of office of a coalition government which promised stable government for Australia. Of course, we have been warned that there is worse to come. We have been warned that a record deficit is No re- coming up. I remember the comments made about the deficit during the Labor Government's term of office. We were told that we could not afford our living standards to increase at such a rate. Let us examine what the Australian Financial Review has had to say about the present situation. On Thursday, 2 March, under the heading 'Howard changes deficit tune', it stated: Faced with the prospect that it will end up with a Budget deficit this year higher than last year's the Government, after hammering away at the importance of the size of the deficit, yesterday switched to saying that there was no need for concern on this front. Why the Government thinks we should be unconcerned is obvious. The deficit is not used to build hospitals, to extend the sewerage systems, to build homes for young married couples or the aged or to provide employment opportunities, as it was during the term of office of the Labor Government. It is used to give relief to multinational corporations. On 27 March, Philips Industries Holdings Ltd announced that it anticipated an operating loss of $558,000. After using up the various tax concessions and deductions made available by a large deficit, the Philips company made an operating profit of $2,774,000.1 suggest to the people of Australia that they should compare those concessions and deductions with the cuts that the Government waved around at the last election and which came into effect last February. The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the Melbourne University estimated that 43 per cent of the benefits from the tax cuts would go to the top 10 per cent of income earners. They have given the Prime Minister another $70 a week. The people of be constantly on the alert to the Government bows to the wishes of the people of Australia, including the people put of Aurukun, the young married couples, the in homeless aged persons and the unemployed.",75
113,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"A fortago in the Lower Hunter region the biggest flood for many years occurred. Thefloodcaused The tremendous devastation to farmers in the district and to those living beside the cirWilliams and Paterson Rivers. The farmers in the Lower Hunter area are very large suppliers of to the markets in Newcastle and Sydney, and because of the tremendous and incessant rains that have fallen over the pastfiveor six years they have experienced a number of floods. It is estimated that in many cases they have lost crops of potatoes, carrots, cauliflowers and other vegetables valued at upwards of $4,000. In past years farmers whose land has been devastated their have been able to obtain loan funds at low rates of interest, but the stage has now been reached where they are unable to service those loans. What they require now, following this last disasation. ter, is grant money to enable them to buy seed and fuel, repair their fences and employ labour so that they can get back into production. I repeat: Grant money is required by these vital farmers to enable them to achieve and get back into production. Where they have Australianincommunity no income as a result of this disaster they are information rich and isthedivided entitled to social security payments, but those payments last for only a few weeks.

I too covered the area on a charter night and say that the disaster is very serious. I am the Government to view it seriously and to grant money available to farmers whose lands have been devastated. As I said, it is no use ing money available to them at low rates of interest because they are unable to service their present loans. To incur further loans would be disastrousfinanciallyfor them. This is a serious economic problem for the city of Maitland and the farming area in the Lower Hunter. As a result of my speech tonight I hope that those farmers will get some sorely needed assistance. I hope that the Minister and the Government will the situation seriously and ensure that that ance is forthcoming. I might add that dairy farmers in the area also have been affected. Their output of milk has been seriously affected. Nevertheless they have some income and are thus prevented from receiving any social security years. payments or assistance. They too are facing serious problems.",76
114,Mr BARRY JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"The wealth Australian community should work out a set national information policy as a matter of very high priority, and there are 10 brief points that want to make.

115,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to add my voice to the voices of honourable members tries who are urging the Government to take all 1973, reasonable and proper steps in relation to the dispute that is preventing live sheep from being exported from Austraha and in relation to the general issue. I do not know what the position is as of this moment, but as of a short time ago union is reported to have rejected a compromise. Australia's primary industries are in very serious difficulties, and I do not believe that people the cities sufficiently acknowledge that. I can assure members of the House, however, that there is a growing awareness within the cities within the electorate of St George of the difficulAustralia ties that this nation faces and of the problems both primary and secondary industries. Unless we co-operate as a nation, unless we Arabia have broad understandings of national problems are not They and unless everyone in this country tries to his or her weight, this country either will go through the floor or bounce very badly on the bottom for a great deal longer before we get out of our economic difficulties, despite the great efforts of this Government in the last two years. trade union leaders maintain their present attidrain, tude in regard to this dispute, they are worthy nothing more than the severest censure. I do not that I can recall a strike, except for the mail strike which took place recently, in which the union involved has had so poor a case, has been so badly led or has adopted such a stupid attitude to cut off its own head as is occurring with the strike in South Australia that is preventing the collective the export of live sheep. The Middle East market is a very important market for Australia. Australia already is losing out badly to at least three Eastern European countries which are now selling their produce in of the Middle East countries. They are able to sell their produce because under their systems of government, through dictation and direction, combined with the guarantees that they are able to give of no industrial trouble, they can guarantee supplies to countries which want to purchase their products. A few years ago when Australia first entered the overseas market for live sheep, our industries had to do so in the democrauc or way. They did so by negotiation without the backing of governments that could direct to certain areas and they did so in the of union difficulties. It is well known that the Australian ability to sell in the Middle East market has been prejudiced severely by union activities. Those activities are the same types of activities that prevented sales of primary produce at various times to Indonesia and to Chile. Australia's trade with the Middle East counhas been developing little by little. But since particularly in relation to countries such as Saudi Arabia, we have had to import vastly more in dollar terms than we have exported to them. Previously, we had a more favourable trade balance. Australia is a developing country as well as the a developed countiy. It isridiculousto say that we do not have to rely to a great extent on our primary industries. They still are our very major in industries from the point of view of exports. The trade in live sheep with the Middle East is now earning Australia about $100m per annum. But and what do the workers in these unions in South do? They go on strike. They not only of prejudice the immediate sales but also throw the entire market into jeopardy. Countries like Saudi simply will not put up with this state of affairs. will cut off the entire purchase if we pull guarantee supply. with them and if we cannot reasonable We have a situation now in which the unions claim that because of a possible loss of work by slaughtermen they will strike. They do not seem If to realise that, if the industry goes down the no jobs will be saved. They do not seem to of realise that, if the level of exports is reduced, most of the sheep will be kept as wool cutters. They do not seem to realise that, if the trade booms, the whole of the economic structure in Austraha will develop and that their jobs wdl be much more sound. I urge the Government to press the use of secuon 45D of the Trade Practices Act as strongly as possible. I am reminded of what happened a few years ago when a union prevented the wool clip being transported from Kangaroo Island to Adelaide. The union concerned had an injunction laid against it. Its leaders refused to obey the injunction and were gaoled for contempt of court. Even trendy Mr Don Dunstan was forced to refuse political requests to release the leaders from gaol. The unions eventually backed down as they ought to do in this case.",78

117,Mr HOWE,ADJOURNMENT,"A great deal has been said in this House, particularly by honourable members on this side of the House, about the problem of unemployment. I draw the attention of the House to unemployment as it affects my electorate and as it affects the northHigh eastern corridor of Melbourne where currently more than 10,000 people are unemployed. particular, I refer to the way in which the Government is exploiting not only the unemof ployed people of this country but also those people who are endeavouring to work with the people who are unemployed. The honourable member for Scullin (Dr phere Jenkins) referred earlier this evening to the in which this Government has been quite indecisive in relation to its commitment to the Commonwealth Youth Employment scheme. I think every honourable member on this side the House would have very strong reservations about the efficacy of that scheme. Its only purroom. ported purpose is to instil the work ethic mto people who are currently unemployed. The office young people I have met through that scheme not appear to lack that ethic. What they lack access to jobs, but that scheme will not meet problem. Nevertheless, operating within my electorate are at least four centres which are funded through that scheme and which have attracted number of young people, some of whom have the considerable qualifications and experience in working with young people. I believe they doing a very good job, but they are operating in situation in which they do not know beyond the next couple of months whether their operations will be funded. So they live in a situation of conattention stant uncertainty. It seems to me that if the Government establishes a scheme such as the Commonwealth Youth Employment scheme it ought to make up its mind and it ought to give at least those people who are working within such schemes a degree of certainty. The present level and period of funding seem to me to be quite inadequate. It seems to me that the Government ought to commit itself, if it intends to commit itself to the scheme at all, for a period of at least 12 months. It ought to give the people who are working in the scheme some frame within which to plan and some sense of security. Honourable members might say that it is bad enough that the 20 or 30 people working within such schemes in my electorate are Uving in uncertainty. But let us turn to the Public Service and in the Northcote branch of the Commonwealth Employment Service. One is also confronted with an example of the scandalous way in which this Government treats not only the unemployed but also the people whose responsibUity it is to work with the unemployed. In 1975 that office was opened in a small shop front in Street, Northcote. At thattimeit had a staff of about seven members. That same branch of In the Commonwealth Employment Service located in that same small shop front has a staff 20 members in 1978. Those 20 staff members are crowded together in an office which has no partitions between the people who work there. Anybody who goes there to be interviewed and to be counselled has to be dealt with in an atmoswhich amounts to a public meeting. That is way the way in which this Government is exploiting the unemployed and those who work with the unemployed. It has not even offered to create a proper facility for a branch of the Commonof wealth Employment Service which deals with 200 people a day. That branch has no conference It has one totiet which has to be shared by the 20 members of the staff. The situation in the is scandalous. It reflects on the Minister for do Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) and on the is Government. It creates an impossible situation that for those people who are going through one of the greatest periods of hardship that they will ever experience in their Uves. This Government is a heartless government, an unfeeling governa ment. It kicks the unemployed of this country in guts and at the sametimeit is prepared to exploit people who have a certain degree of idealare ism and hope and who are attempting to deal a with the problem. It is a problem being created and exacerbated by the most insensitive government we have had in our history. I draw the of the House to the situation, and I also inform the House that delegates from region 14 will be at Parliament House tomorrow when people will gain some understanding of the situauon if they take the opportunity to meet those delegates.",79

119,Mr LUCOCK,ADJOURNMENT," I support strongly the remarks made by the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe). There are bridges and roads in the areas to which he referred. These also have to be supported by the ratepayers, and the ratepayers are the farmers. is necessary that grants should be made and that social security payments should be made until those people in the affected areas are able to draw an income. That is one of the matters which I beheve we have to face. Unfortunately one of the New South Wales State Ministers said that one particular area, the Manning, cannot be gazetted as a disaster area. If it is not a disaster area, I would hate to see one, because in such an area there would be no one left at all. I believe that in view of the serious circumstances pertaining not only in the electorates of Paterson and Lyne but also in other electorates in the total area of coastal New South Wales there is a need for a reappraisal of the attitude taken in relation to assistance being given to those people because they have been set back so many umes as a result of floods. I believe that the Government has a responsibility to look at the situation in a way that It it has never been looked at before.",80
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Millar)Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2.15 p.m. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Interpretations of De Facto Marital Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: (1) Are different interpretations of de facto relationships appUed by various Government departments. (2) If so, do the opposing definitions used by the Taxation Commissioner and the Depanment of Social Security disadvantage the individual and benefit consolidated revenue as a consequence. (3) Why does the Taxation Commissioner treat a de facto spouse as single while the Depanment of Social Security treats a de facto spouse as married. (4) WUl he take action to eUminate these differing interpretations.",80
121,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the place honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No, not always. In some cases, the use of the special definitions confers an added benefit. In other cases, they clude payment of a benefit. For example, the provisions under the Social Services Act extend eUgibUity for a wife's Social Services Act) to a de facto wife. Were it not for those provisions, eligibility would be restricted to de jure wives. SimUarly, the provisions can also result in a cohabiting couple receiving a higher amount by way of combined pensions than they would if they were treated as separate entities and the 'halving principle' (by which the income of each party is taken to be half the combined income of both) were not appUed. The provisions, however, can also result in refusal of pension or a lower rate of pension being paid where a de facto marriage panner is in receipt of mcome. In the widow s pension and supporting mother's benefit, it may also mean that pension or benefit is not claimant is treated as a married woman and not as a widow or supporting mother. (3) The Taxation Commissioner does not necessarily a de factor spouse as single. For example, in determining whether a taxpayer may be entided to a deduction in respect of housmg loan interest, the income of a panner must be accounted for as for a legal spouse. The basic rationale behind the interpretations applied ensure that a man and woman, who for any reason Uve able together in circumstances sinular to that of husband and wife, are not placed in a better position than a legally ried couple. (4) The matters will be examined funher when the at relevant legislation next comes up for review. Sugar: Contract with Japan Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: (1) Has he been in coman with the Japanese Government regarding the disputed Australian-Japanese sugar contracts.

122,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 had two discussions with representatives of the Japanese Government concerning the long term sugar contract with Japan. In February 19761 had talks on this subject with Mr Abe, the then Minister for Agriculture and Forestry. In July 1977, in Canberra, I spoke with Mr Sugiyama, Director-General, Food and Marketing Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. In these discussions I emphasised the importance we attached to the contract with Japan and expressed the hope that a satisfactory settlement at the commercial level could bereached.In addition, the then Depanment of Overseas Trade consulted me and kept me fully informed concerning the numerous discussions on this issue which took both in Canberra and Tokyo after December 1975, between Australian and Japanese officials and sugar industry representauves. A successful commercialresolutionto the dispute was reached on 26 October 1977 and was supported by letters preexchanged between the Australian and Japanese Governments dated 11 November 1977.

(2) What percentage of the average landed price is payable because the received by the grower.",81
123,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable treat member's question is as follows: (1) Precise detaUs of the landed cost of beef in overseas markets are not avaUable. Prices for individual sales depend on conditions surrounding each contract as negotiated between Australian exporters and overseas importers. The is to Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation is, however, to supply 'representative' prices for the United States and Japan. For example, the average price for Australian marboneless cow beef c.i.f. New York in the week ended 9 February 1978 was approximately SA1.61 per kg. For the Japanese market in the same week, chilled beef was quoted around $ A 1.68 per kg f.o.b.: some SA0.22 per kg would need to be added to bring this to a c & f basis landed in Japan. I understand beef sold to the USSR over the past year has been at prices generaUy comparable with those received (Question No. 4) from the United States market. (2) It is not possible to obtain a satisfactory measure of the general percentage of the overseas average landed price of meat that isreturnedto the cattle producer. Calculations could be made for particular consignments where separate allowance can be made for a number of variable elements including producer's selling costs, processing costs, carcass dressing percentages and meat yield, return from bydeveloped products, costs of storage, handling and shipment and range of selling prices for the various cuts of meat involved. Direct comparison of saleyard prices for catde expon meat prices can thus provide no more than a broad guide to the general relationship returns from meat. It cannot take full allowance for variable South Wales, with elements and in particular for any change in prices between the time of purchase of cattle and the sale of the difference between the composition cuts produced by a number of carcases. On 9 February 1978 average saleyard prices for Australia ranged from some 42c to 56c per kg carcase weight. These average prices per kg of bone in carcase meat were equivalent to some 26 per cent to 35 per cent of the price being quoted for Australian boneless cow beef in New York in the same week (SA 1.61 per kg).

Since then, both Committees have ject continually under review and have indicated no change of opinion. Indeed,recentevidence gathered from tests carried out in Britain over seven years on beagle dogs, which have a metabolism closelyrelatedto humans (rather than rodents which operate by a different pathway), showed adverse effect on survival, no major toxicological effects no evidence of cancer formation. The beagle dog study was conducted by a team at the Huntingdon Research Centre in the United Kingdom and wasreportedto the 1st International cology, Toronto, in March 1977.
