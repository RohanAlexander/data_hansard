1,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown, I seek leave to move a motion to refer bills to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. Leave not granted. NA Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament,19
2,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS," by leave-I move: That this House: (1) affirms its support for the: (a) goal of a world free of nuclear weapons; and (b) Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the essential foundation for the achievement of nuclear disarmament and the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime; (2) notes: (a) ratification by the United States and Russia of the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START) on 5 February 2011; (b) unilateral nuclear arsenal reductions announced by France and the United Kingdom; (c) the strong working relationship between Australia and Japan on issues of non-proliferation and disarmament, including more recently by establishing the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative to take forward the 2010 NPT Review Conference outcomes; and (d) the unanimous views presented by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in Report 106 on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament; and (3) calls for: BILLS (a) further cuts in all categories of nuclear weapons and a continuing reduction of their roles in national security policies; (b) states outside the NPT to join the Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states; (c) ratification of the Comprehensive NuclearTest-Ban Treaty by all states yet to do so; (d) the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations for a verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes; (e) stronger international measures to address serious NPT non-compliance issues; (f) Iran, Syria and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions; (g) political and financial support for a strengthened IAEA safeguards regime, including universalisation of the additional protocol; (h) further investigation of the merits and risks of nuclear fuel cycle multilateralisation; (i) exploration of legal frameworks for the abolition of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of a nuclear weapons convention, as prospects for multilateral disarmament improve; (j) efforts to establish a Middle East zone free from weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, freely arrived at by all regional states; and (k) efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism within the framework of the IAEA and the Nuclear Security Summits. Nuclear weapons are a reality in our world, a real challenge to our resolve to build a better world, a challenge which needs to be faced by all nations, one not to be ignored and one Australia cannot and will not ignore. We are realistic about eliminating nuclear weapons. It will be difficult, it will take time and ultimately it will require a stable, international security environment. But be done. Indeed, progress has been made. There are many fewer nuclear warheads in the world today than there were in 1989. That is why Australia supports the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the disarmament initiatives of the United States and the nuclear weapons states themselves. It is why Australia supports the United Nations Security Council's measures against the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea. It is why Australia has its own sanctions targeting the programs of proliferation in these three countries. It is why we are introducing additional sanctions measures against Iran compatible with those of the EU. It is why we urge Iran to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions applying to it and its IAEA obligations. why Australia also actively supports the Financial Action Task Force and other international measures to combat the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is why Australia supports President Obama's call to secure all at-risk nuclear materials by 2014 and the commitments made at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. We support all of these measures because these measures have made a difference and because they continue to do so. Australia has made a difference in past years, including through our leading role in the negotiation of major international arms control instruments such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the IAEA's additional protocol. We have a strong and long standing record of activism and achievement on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation: in 1972, when we joined with New Zealand at the International Court of Justice in actions against nuclear testing in the Pacific; in 1995, when we established the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear it can Weapons; in 2008, when with Japan we established and supported the independent International Commission on Nuclear NonProliferation and Disarmament; in 2010, when we again partnered with Japan to establish the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative. We take our nuclear obligations seriously. That is why Australia exports uranium only for peaceful purposes under the strictest safeguards now and into the future and why we will make a difference again next week, combating the threat of nuclear terrorism when I participate with other world leaders at the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit. I commend the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, including its chair, the member for Wills, for their tireless advocacy of non-proliferation and It is disarmament that led to this motion. Now today this parliament, with this motion, can state our ambition to make a difference in future years too. That is why I have moved this motion and that is why I welcome the fact the Leader of the Opposition will second it. A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term commitment. We may not see it, any of us, in our time in this House. Indeed, we may not live to see it. But one day our successors should say of nuclear fear: the threat has passed, the game is over-never again. I commend this motion to the House.",19
3,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," The coalition does support the proposed resolution now before the House. Nuclear weapons cannot be uninvented but they can be, and should be, controlled and reduced and it is good, as the Prime Minister has said, that the United States, Britain, France and Russia have unilaterally reduced their nuclear stockpiles since the end of the Cold War. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been very important in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, which looked almost unstoppable in the 1960s when the treaty came into place. It is important to rein in the nuclear ambitions of countries such as North Korea and Iran, and that is why the Prime Minister's trip to Seoul next week is worthwhile. It is also important to reduce tensions on the subcontinent between two nuclear armed neighbours. The last coalition government, in line with other Western countries, urged India, Pakistan and Israel ultimately to accede to the non-proliferation treaty as non-nuclearweapon states. It is important that we are realistic on these matters. There does need to be a creative solution to India's current status in relation to the non-proliferation treaty. India has an impeccable non-proliferation record and wants to join the treaty but, due to tensions with China and Pakistan, will not destroy its nuclear weapons. This motion also supports the goal of a weapons of mass destruction free zone in the Middle East. The coalition understands-and it is important to put this on the record-that Israel will not choose to disarm, indeed should not disarm, as long as Iran persists with its nuclear weapons program coupled with threats to wipe Israel off the map. It would be unrealistic, and indeed it would be utopian, to expect Israel to consider such disarmament before a broader peace settlement is in place in the region. So with these reservations the coalition is happy to support the government's motion. Debate adjourned. Reference to Federation Chamber",20

5,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS, I again seek leave to move a motion to refer bills to the Federation Chamber for further consideration as per the agreement between the opposition and the government. Leave granted.,21
6,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"I thank the House and move: That the following bills be referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration: Judges and Governors-General Legislation Amendment (Family Law) 2012; Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) 2011; and Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) 2011. Since, I think, February of 1994 the Main Committee, now the Federation Chamber, has operated with great success. It has taken considerable pressure off the main chamber in this place and more often than not it has been used as a forum for bipartisan discussion and debate. For all of that period, part of its success could be, and has been, attributed to agreements about the way in which we refer bills to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. In my 16 years here-and I am sure back to 1994never has the opposition of the day denied the Chief Government Whip the opportunity to refer bills to the Federation Chamber or what was then the Main Committee. This is just another example of the wrecking ball being taken to this place by those who sit opposite. Their view, sadly, is if they cannot run the country, no-one can. They will do anything and everything to frustrate the processes of government in this country. I say to them: this morning was another very severe miscalculation on their part as was their decision to deny the member for Dobell leave during the week. My advice to them is to get back into the game, become responsible and send a very clear signal to the Australian community that they are here for the right reasons. They are here to be a responsible opposition and, while it is their entitlement and their obligation to challenge government legislation and government policy, they are also here to make this place work and, if you like, shape the right outcomes for the benefit of the Australian people. What occurred this morning is another very unfortunate precedent and, in my view-and I am sure in the view of the Australian community more generally-was a disgrace. Question agreed to.

Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
7,Mr CLARE,BILLS,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (09:17): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction I am pleased to present:  the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012 together with  the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendments Bill (No. 1) 2012. They represent the third tranche of legislation that implements the government's reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system announced in June last year. These bills are introduced into the House together. They contain reforms designed to provide better access to the anti-dumping system for Australian industry, and to ensure any applicable remedies are available as quickly as possible. Substantive measures This third tranche of legislation includes four substantive reforms to the anti-dumping regime. 1. All facts available provision First, this bill clarifies the CEO of customs and border protection and the minister's power to take 'all facts available' into account when:  determining whether a countervailable subsidy has been received; or  in determining the amount of a countervailing subsidy;  when the parties being investigated by Customs fail to provide relevant information within a reasonable period or significantly impede the investigation, review or inquiry. This reform ensures that our anti-dumping system better reflects the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. 2. Expanding CEO/Minister powersContinuation Inquiries Second, this bill removes the need for a separate review of anti-dumping measures and continuation inquiries to be run in close proximity to each other. This is achieved by enhancing the powers that the CEO and the minister have to conduct a continuation inquiry to allow for similar results to those currently available in a review of measures. Through this amendment, customs and border protection will be able to recalculate the level of the duties of an anti-dumping measure during a continuation inquiry. This reform will streamline the process, meaning quicker outcomes for all interested parties. 3. Removing Limitations-profit and normal value Third, this bill implements the recommendation of the International Trade Remedies Forum-to remove the current limitation to the inclusion of profit when calculating the 'normal value' of a good in its country of origin, in certain circumstances. This amendment improves the effectiveness of the 'particular market situation' provisions in the Customs Act-by providing greater flexibility for Customs to more accurately determine the 'normal value' of goods. These first three reforms are delivered through this bill. 4. Additional forms of interim dumping duty The fourth reform is delivered by the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendments Bill (No. 1) 2012 which amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. This allows for different forms of interim duty to be applied from those currently used. The types of interim dumping duty which could be used will include an ad valorem duty, a fixed amount of duty, a combination duty, or a floor price mechanism. The methods for working out these new forms of interim dumping duty will be outlined in regulations to be made in support of this amendment. Release of the two working group reports Today I am also releasing two reports from the International Trade Remedies Forum (the ITRF) that make important recommendations to improve the anti-dumping system. The International Trade Remedies Forum is made up of 21 members representing manufacturers, producers and importers, as well as industry associations, trade unions and relevant government agencies:  CSR  Dried Fruits Australia (on behalf of the National Farmers' Federation)  OneSteel  Capral  Kimberly-Clark  Australian Industry Group  SPC Ardmona  Australian Steel Association  Australian Food and Grocery Council  JELD-WEN  Plastics and Chemicals Industry Association  Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU)  Australian Workers' Union (AWU)  Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)  Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU)  Australian Customs and Border Protection Service  Attorney-General's Department  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  Department of Innovation, Industry and Science  Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; and  Treasury. The first report examines Australia's 'particular market situation' provisions. was prepared by the market situation working group made up of representatives from:  the Australian Industry Group:  Australian Food and Grocery Council;  Australian Steel Association;  Australian Workers' Union;  BlueScope Steel;  Capral;  the CFMEU;  Dow Chemical Company;  JELD-WEN;  Kimberly-Clark;  OneSteel;  the Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association; and  representatives from a number of government agencies. The report makes 16 recommendations. The government will implement all of them. One of the recommendations (3.4) is to remove the legislative limitations to determining profit when constructing the 'normal value' of a good. This reform is made in this bill. Other recommendations include:  changes to guidelines and Customs manual to clarify the evidentiary standards required to support an allegation of a particular market situation;  updating the questionnaires for exporters and foreign governments;  amending the Customs manual to reflect Customs and Border Protection's new practice of working with applicants to develop market situation questionnaires; and It  convening a separate working group to examine possible improvements to Australia's countervailing provisions. The government will implement these changes administratively-through changes to relevant guidelines, manuals and other arrangements. The second report was prepared by the close processed agricultural working group of the ITRF, made up of representatives from:  Australian Dried Fruits;  Australian Food and Grocery Council;  Australian Pork Ltd;  the National Farmers' Federation;  SPC Ardmona;  the CFMEU; and  representatives from relevant government agencies. It made six recommendations-and the government will implement all of them. These include:  retaining the close processed agricultural goods provisions of the Customs Act;  providing the Small and Medium Enterprise Support Officer (when appointed) with briefings, documentation and training that they need to work with Australian primary producers; and  continuing the operation of the close processed agricultural goods working group until mid-2012. Not all of the views that are expressed these reports are endorsed by the government. The government's purpose in reforming Australia's anti-dumping system is to improve access to the anti-dumping system for businesses and ensure that the anti-dumping investigations can be resolved more quickly. These reforms also continue to ensure that Australia's anti-dumping system complies with our international trade obligations. Together, the bills in this tranche of reforms and the 22 recommendations from these reports will make a number of important improvements to our anti-dumping system. Foreshadowing tranche four reforms The fourth and final tranche of legislation to implement the anti-dumping reforms announced last year is planned to be introduced in the next parliamentary sittings. The fourth tranche will contain reforms in three broad areas: It will further amend the subsidies provisions of the Customs Act to ensure they better reflect the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. These changes will increase the clarity of these provisions by removing long-term interpretive issues that stakeholders have identified with these provisions. Second, it will establish an anticircumvention framework in Australia. The framework will prevent parties involved in importing goods into Australia which are subject to anti-dumping measures illegitimately circumventing Australia's anti-dumping system to avoid duties. Anticircumvention schemes have already been implemented overseas in the United in States, the European Union, New Zealand, Brazil and, most recently, in India. The development of an overarching framework to address circumvention practices will send a strong warning to businesses which intentionally seek to avoid measures imposed through our anti-dumping system. Third, it will strengthen the provisions that deal with noncooperation. I want to ensure Australia's anti-dumping system is effective in dealing with parties that do not cooperate with anti-dumping investigations. The next tranche of legislation will include further amendments to support the minister's power to impose tougher dumping margins for parties that refuse to provide necessary information within a reasonable period. Conclusion These reforms directly address the concerns of business, workers and unions. They will implement the reforms announced last year-and provide for a clearer and fairer system. I commend these bills to the House.

8,Mr CLARE,BILLS,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (09:27): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. As I have just outlined, this bill allows for different forms of interim duty to be applied from those currently used. The methods for working out these new forms of interim dumping duty will be outlined in regulations to be made in support of this amendment. Together with the other reforms, this represents the third tranche of legislation implementing the government's reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum incorporating a statement of compatibility with human rights presented by Mr Clare. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
9,Mr CLARE,BILLS,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (09:28): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Bill 2012 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will repeal and replace schedule 4 of that act. Schedule 4 delivers a wide range of tariff concessions, which have the effect of reducing or removing the normal rate of customs duty that would otherwise apply. These concessions lower costs for businesses and individuals importing goods. However, the current schedule 4 is complex and difficult for industry and importers to use. During 2010, the government announced a Better Regulation Ministerial Partnership to examine and simplify the tariff concession regime. Under this partnership, the relevant government departments-including Customs and Border Protection; Finance and Deregulation; and the then Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research-conducted a review of schedule 4. The review included consultation with relevant government agencies, a public discussion paper and consultation with key industry bodies. The consultation process showed that stakeholders, especially business, support a more user-friendly tariff concession regime. Significant recommendations of the review included removing items that are redundant or have no clear policy intent, consolidating items that have similar coverage and restructuring the schedule to place similar items together. The schedule 4 bill that I have just gives effect to those recommendations. In addition, the revised schedule 4 formally incorporates the extension, to 31 December 2014, of the SPARTECA-TCF Scheme that relates to textile, clothing and footwear concessions for prescribed Forum Island countries. This extension was contained in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2012, tabled in parliament on 16 February 2012. The bill also contains consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act and related legislation. When enacted, the schedule 4 bill will result in a renumbering of the items in schedule 4. As the GST and related acts refer to existing items in schedule 4, the schedule 4 bill contains amendments to those acts to update those references. When enacted, the schedule 4 bill will reduce the existing tariff concession schedule to around half the current number of items and improve its clarity and usability. However, the schedule 4 bill will preserve the scope of the various concessions and their concessional duty rates. Debate adjourned. Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum incorporating a statement of compatibility with human rights presented by Mr Bradbury. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
10,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (09:32): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to tabled implement a range of improvements. Schedule 1 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to implement the 2011-12 budget measure to disallow deductions against government assistance payments. The schedule responds to the High Court decision in the Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis where it was held that expenses incurred in satisfying an activity test for taxable government assistance income are deductible. The consequence of the High Court decision is that taxpayers with the same level of income have different tax liabilities depending on whether or not they receive taxable government assistance income that is eligible for a tax offset. Leaving the tax law unchanged will create inequality in the tax system. Amending the tax law to overturn the High Court decision will increase equity by ensuring that taxpayers with the same level of income pay the same tax. This measure will also provide certainty as to the scope of eligible deductions. From 1 July 2011, taxpayers who receive taxable government assistance income that is eligible for a tax offset will no longer be able to claim a deduction for expenses they incur in satisfying an activity test to qualify for assistance income. Government assistance income in scope of the amendment includes Abstudy, Austudy, Newstart allowance and youth allowance. This recognises that taxable government assistance payments are effectively tax free. The government considers that the most targeted and timely assistance is provided through the transfer system, not the tax system. This is why the government has introduced several key measures aimed at supporting students, including start-up scholarships for new university students, relocation scholarships for those studying away from home and reducing the age of independence for youth allowance to 22. These measures provide more timely assistance to students when they need it most. Schedule 2 removes the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat certain assets (primarily shares, units in a trust and land) as trading stock, which is consistent with the general industry practice of treating these assets on capital account. These changes promote certainty in the superannuation industry by removing the present ambiguity concerning the appropriate tax treatment of gains and losses made from the sale of shares owned by a complying superannuation entity. Schedule 3 exempts from income tax the ex-gratia payments to New Zealand Special Category Visa holders who were affected by the recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland. These ex-gratia payments are made for disasters where the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment has been activated, and are of an equivalent amount. By exempting these disaster relief payments from income tax, the maximum amount of assistance is provided to affected individuals. A tax exemption for these payments is consistent with the exemption provided for equivalent payments made in response to other disasters, such as the widespread floods of the 2010-11 summer, and Cyclone Yasi. Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to implement the 2011-12 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure to phase out the dependent spouse tax offset. The dependent spouse tax offset originated around three-quarters of a century ago-a time when the single-income family was the norm and the welfare system was in its infancy. This was a time when a breadwinner was expected to 'maintain' a spouse even without children, and there were limited employment opportunities for women. In today's modern economy, where unemployment is around five per cent, increasing employment participation and expanding the workforce is vital for the strength of our economy and the living standards of our community. That is why the government is phasing out the tax offset for taxpayers with a dependent spouse born on or after 1 July 1952 to reduce the disincentive for dependent spouses from undertaking paid employment. From 1 July 2012, taxpayers with a dependent spouse born on or after 1 July 1952 will no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse tax offset. Dependent spouses with children are not affected by this measure, nor are taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces or overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure. Schedule 4 will introduce minor amendments to ensure that taxpayers who maintain a dependent spouse are only able to claim one offset in respect of that spouse in determining their zone, overseas forces or overseas civilian tax offset entitlement. Schedule 5 includes several miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. Amendments such as these are periodically made to correct minor technical or drafting defects in the taxation laws and to address unintended outcomes. Advancing these amendments gives effect to the government's long standing commitment to uphold the integrity of the taxation system. Full details of the measures in this contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum incorporating a statement of human rights presented by Mr Sidebottom. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
11,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:38): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 reflects the government's commitment to more effective regulation by cutting red tape and creating clearer Commonwealth laws. The bill will amend eight portfolio acts and repeal one act entirely. It contains no significant policy changes, but the amendments will provide consistency, amend outdated or unclear provisions and reduce the likelihood of reader confusion. The bill responds to industry requests for reform of existing regulation. It will streamline existing administrative arrangements and improve response times. The bill will amend requirements of the Label Integrity Program under the wine legislation. The program aims to ensure truthfulness of label claims on vintage, variety or geographical indication of wine. It relies on accurate record keeping so that wines and label claims can be audited effectively. Retailers have demonstrated the need for differentiation of record-keeping bill are requirements between producers and retailers, and the proposed amendments are supported by retailers, wholesalers and the wine industry. The proposed amendments will reduce the record-keeping requirements of people who 2012 supply or receive wine goods that are packaged for sale to a consumer. Suppliers and retailers who do not change or affect any label claims about wine goods will be required to provide the Wine Australia and Brandy Corporation auditors with details of the manufacturer or supplier of the wine goods, rather than all the details to substantiate vintage, variety or geographical indication label claims. This maintains the integrity of the program, while meeting the practical requirements of suppliers and retailers. For the purposes of defining 'vintage' on a wine label, the bill will amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to assist producers by ensuring grapes grown in the same growing season can be labelled with the same vintage year. For example, producers will now be able to label wine made from grapes harvested from 1 September 2012 through to 31 August 2013 as a 2013 wine, not a 2014 wine. The bill will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to ensure that provisions are consistent and wording is clear. The amendments will correct a grammatical error and remove redundant wording in provisions relating to directions to close a fishery or a part of a fishery. They will also make compliance with a direction to close a fishery a condition on all types of statutory fishing concessions. amendments will better reflect the intention of the provisions, clarify requirements and simplify the administration of the act. The amendments to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 will correct a drafting error made in an earlier amending act so that agreed co-management arrangements can be implemented. The drafting error applied a delegation of powers provision to section 93 rather than to section 92. Once the provision is applied correctly to section 92, co-management arrangementsin which stakeholders will assist the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to perform powers and functions for the sustainable management of fisheries-can be implemented. The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 is being amended to allow the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry to consider all requests for the remission of late levy payment penalties. At present, only the portfolio minister can remit penalties exceeding $5,000. The proposed amendment mirrors efficient penalty remission arrangements for the Dairy Adjustment Levy. The process will be more streamlined and response times will be improved for levy payers. Levy payers will still be able to approach the minister to review a decision made by the secretary. To assist with clearer Commonwealth legislation, the bill will make the following technical amendments. It will renumber an alphabetical list in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 to remove any doubt about whether the list is incorrect or incomplete. It will replace the United States spelling of 'authorized' with the Australian spelling of 'authorised' in the Export Control Act 1982 The and the Quarantine Act 1908. The Australian spelling is the preferred style for Commonwealth legislation and these changes improve readability by ensuring consistent spelling throughout the two acts. It will remove redundant text in the Fisheries Management Act 1991, including several cross-references to provisions that have been repealed. These amendments will promote consistency in the act and reduce the likelihood of reader confusion. In line with the legislative drafting protocols, it will remove specific references to departments and secretaries in the Farm Household Support Act 1992. This will mean any references to department or secretary are related to the correct portfolio responsible for administering the act and will reduce the need for future amendments arising from changes to the Administrative Arrangements Orders. The bill will also repeal an entire act-the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952. The War Service Land Settlement Scheme commenced in 1945 to assist returned soldiers into farming after World War II. Authority for the scheme was established under Commonwealth legislation. The Australian Government has negotiated the sale and transfer of the scheme to each of the states, and now the Commonwealth legislation is redundant and suitable for repeal. The scheme served its purpose but has generally outgrown its original intent. Repeal of this act marks the end of an era and closes a chapter in Australia's history. Debate adjourned. Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum incorporating a statement of compatibility with human rights presented by Mr Sidebottom. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
12,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BILLS,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:46): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. On 1 July 2008, the Australian government reformed wheat export arrangements with the abolition of the single desk and the establishment of the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme, known as the scheme, administered by Wheat Exports Australia (WA). Previously, Australian farmers could not choose who would export their wheat. The abolition of the single desk has led to improved productivity and created new global export markets for Australian growers. This has led to improved job opportunities in rural and regional centres. There are now 26 accredited exporters, with 19 of these being active in the last marketing year. As promised by the government when the reforms were introduced, an independent review of the arrangements was undertaken by the Productivity Commission in 2010. The commission found that the scheme had served industry and the nation well, but that the industry was now mature enough to move to a deregulated model. The government agrees in principle with the commission's recommendations. However, after carefully considering the views put forward by industry, it has decided to introduce the next set of changes through a staged approach which will provide a more efficient transition to full deregulation in the longer term. The first stage was the introduction of a 'lighter touch' accreditation scheme to be applied until 30 September 2012. This change has reduced the level of 'red tape' for exporters while still meeting grower concerns about 'fit and proper issues' and maintaining the link with the access test for port operators that many exporters believe is critical. It is, however, not a 'softer touch' as the WA still has the capacity to respond to any issues that may relate to the accreditation of an exporter. marketing Passage of the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 will implement the next stages of the government's response and complete the transition to a fully deregulated bulk wheat export market. The bill will abolish the scheme and the wheat export charge (WEC) on 30 September 2012. The WA will continue in operation until 31 December 2012 to complete outstanding tasks such as preparation of its final annual report and also the Report for Growers. Abolishing the scheme will ensure that the benefits to industry provided by accreditation during the transition to deregulation are not undermined in the longer term by the direct and indirect costs of continuing with a scheme that has served its purpose. These costs include the WEC and the administrative and regulatory burden of accreditation, as well as the negative impact of unnecessary regulation on efficiency and competition in the wheat industry over time. The recent strong export performance has led to the WA special account holding more funds than are required to fund the operation of the WA. As this represents an overpayment of industry funds, the government will look to amend the regulations and set the WEC rate at zero as market soon as possible. However, the account will still hold surplus funds when the WA is abolished. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be repaid $500,000 owing from a previous funds transfer that was not used. The remainder will be reinvested in the wheat industry after consultation with relevant stakeholders. The government agrees with the commission's recommendation to retain the access test until 30 September 2014. The link between the access test and the ability to export bulk wheat will remain during this period. This action responds to concerns among some growers and traders about possible anticompetitive behaviour with respect to grain port terminal access. Retaining the access test until 2014 will give the industry sufficient time, and appropriate incentives, to adjust to the new trading environment. It will also allow for some new features of the competitive environment to be institutionalised while minimising the chances of damaging future investments or undermining reasonable returns to existing asset holders. The bill will facilitate the removal of the access test requirements for grain port terminal operators on 30 September 2014. The market will then move to full deregulation, with all aspects of the industry subject to general competition law administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. This will bring the wheat export market into line with other agricultural commodity markets and promote further competition in the wheat export industry, leading to increased productivity and profitability. To provide certainty for growers and bulk wheat exporters about security of access to grain port terminal services in the longer term, the access test will only be abolished if the industry has a non-prescribed voluntary code of conduct covering grain export terminal operations in place. The code must include continuous disclosure rules and be consistent with ACCC guidelines for voluntary codes of conduct. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will determine if the code of conduct is of a standard that will allow the abolition of the access test. The implementation of an industry code of conduct will give growers certainty that, irrespective of which exporter they sell to, their product will gain access to grain port terminal services. It will reinforce Australia's international reputation as a reliable wheat supplier and give overseas customers certainty that all Australian exporters will be able to meet supply commitments. It will also help ensure that these facilities have the necessary throughput to attract the level of return on investment required to keep them viable. The government is aware of some concerns from parts of the wheat industry that a lack of access to market information on stocks and flows of grains is impacting on competitiveness. The government is willing to help industry find a solution, potentially through the voluntary code of conduct. It is already working with Grain Trade Australia and the wider industry to develop the code and strongly encourages all industry sectors to engage in this process. If an acceptable code is not approved, the requirement for bulk wheat exporters that are grain port terminal service providers to pass the access test in order to be able to export will continue. The bill reflects the government's commitment to promoting competition within the wheat export industry. Australian producers are the most innovative and efficient in the world. Passage of the bill will further develop a wheat-marketing system that rewards this and provides benefits to all industry sectors. I commend the bill. Debate adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",31
13,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (09:55): On behalf of the Special Minister of State, I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of projects two and three of the Christmas Island new housing program. The Christmas Island New Housing Program was approved by the government in May 2010 to address a critical housing shortage on Christmas Island, with a total budget of $26.6 million comprising $25.1 million administered capital and $1.5 million for departmental and administered expenses. The housing program was approved as part of a $97.3 million package of measures to address the pressures being placed on the critical infrastructure on Christmas Island due to increased immigration activities on the island. The package was approved in two parts: $50 million in December 2009 and a further $47.3 million in May 2010. The cost of rental accommodation on Christmas Island has increased considerably. The rental cost increase is estimated to be more than 50 per cent. I know this from my observations of the island for over 25 years. These rental increases have created enormous pressure. They are directly impacting on ordinary workers on minimum wages, with rental costs becoming beyond the reach of locals on low to medium incomes, and this is a matter of some concern. The Christmas Island New Housing Program has as its objective to reduce the number of houses leased on the private rental market to accommodate Commonwealth employees. The impact of this program on the private rental market is expected to be an increase in the supply of rental housing and lower rental costs, making accommodation more affordable to the local community. Project One of this program was notified to the Public Works Committee as a medium work on the construction of 16 dwellings and associated infrastructure, commenced in September 2011, with a contract value of $11.4 million. The department has also purchased two established houses on Christmas Island at a cost of $0.950 million. Other costs including project management and professional fees total $1.65 million. Project Two, estimated at $7.9 million, is to design and construct 14 dwellings at Drumsite village on the remaining portion of the site adjacent to the Project One site. Project Three, at an estimated $1.7 million, comprises the design and construction of a number of large family homes containing four to five bedrooms in an established part of the Silver City residential area. An amount of $1.5 million has been set aside to cover contingencies and cost escalation. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in May 2012 and is programmed for completion by June 2013. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Before I sit down, I think it is important that I make a couple of observations about this. As I say, I have been visiting this island since 1987. Its economy has waxed and waned depending on particular Telecommunications circumstances. The backbone of the economy has been, up to date, a phosphatemining operation, which employs around 200 people. But, with the development of a detention facility on Christmas Island, the economy changed substantially. Whilst before its establishment accommodation was easily available and at a reasonable rental cost, and even purchase prices were affordable, with the impact of a large population moving onto the island to work at the facility and associated organisations which were indirectly and directly related to it, accommodation became at a premium, and of course the cost of building on Christmas Island is substantially different from the cost of building on the east coast of Australia, given its location and the difficulty of accessing particular goods and services. This expediency motion is very important so that we can provide opportunities for people on Christmas Island to access the private rental market because at the moment they have been squeezed out by the need to deploy Commonwealth employees and contractors to Christmas Island to service the immigration detention facility. This has meant that locals have been unable to get affordable accommodation. It is something that we are obviously keeping our eyes on, but it is very important that we support this particular motion and I commend it to the House. Question agreed to.

Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,34
16,Mr SIMPKINS,BILLS," I appreciate the opportunity to continue my remarks from last night, which were interrupted by the adjournment debate. The comments that I was making last night were related to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and to the general concept of the integrity of the electoral roll. As I said last night, I personally experienced a problem with the integrity of the electoral roll in the seat of Cowan and leading up to the 2010 federal election. My experience related to a house on Wanneroo Road, a major axial route within Cowan. The address was 64 Wanneroo Road, Marangaroo. This house had come to the attention of my office because a number of locals had complained, about a year out from the election, that it had been occupied by squatters and had been pretty much trashed and was completely unliveable. That had been confirmed to me by a couple of different people-people who were reliable sources. So it came as quite a surprise to have found during a subsequent check of the electoral roll about a month later, as we moved closer to the election, that two names were suddenly enrolled on the electoral roll at that house. The two names were quite familiar to me because they were, in fact, the main supporters of my Labor opponent at the last election. I was again informed that the standard of the house had not improved. Because it was on the route from my office to my home, I drove past the house every day. Whilst I did see a large amount of electoral advertising put up on the wallsapparently contrary to the City of Wanneroo's by-laws, but let us not let that get in the way of matters of integrity-and that there was occasionally a car parked during the day outside the house, there were never any lights on at night. There was never any activity. It seemed to be the same decrepit house that it had always been, or at least that it had been in the months since it was pretty much destroyed. Howeversurprise, surprise-there were those two names on the electoral roll and they were known to me. I knew exactly who they were. That is an interesting case when we look at matters to do with the integrity of the and I do know that the government has been lecturing and quite sanctimonious on these matters. My personal experience in 2010 was that a couple of dodgy enrolments had taken place and, with the exception of what were obviously campaign meetings in the month before the election, there was never a light on in that house at night. Yet for six months or so there were people on the electoral roll for that house. I am quite sure they were not on my side; my opponent got a couple of extra votes out of that. I decided I was not going to do anything about it before the election, but after the election I approached the AEC and said, 'Well, there's clearly noone living there, can you investigate that?' Their officers seemed to agree with me that there was no-one there, but it took another six months or so before they changed their enrolment back to where they actually did live. I found it to be quite an interesting experience, and I guess the government should take heed that there are some problems out there and that there are some other problems with the electoral roll that could be fixed up. I also said last night that there were two things I wanted to mention with regard to matters in Cowan and the integrity of the electoral roll. Back in 2007, when I was first elected, on the night of the election after the polls had closed I was approached by my booth captain for Blackmore Primary School, which was one of the booths in Girrawheen. I was told by the booth captain that he believed that there was one person who had voted three times. They were never in the same shirt, but a very familiar person seemed to show up on two extra occasions after their first vote. They were never carrying my how-to-vote card, not that that should matter, of course. So I asked the booth captain whether he had reported it to the AEC manager. Apparently he had, but I roll do not know what happened after that. Without doubt there is electoral fraud going on in this country and there are people doing the wrong thing. As I said last night, the government are very keen on taking these sorts of positions on election funding with bills exactly like this. But it always seems to be the case that whatever they propose absolutely favours their own interests. With electoral funding, unions are of course never part of those sorts of reforms, but any other form of election funding or support is always part of reforms proposed by the government. If the government genuinely wanted real electoral reform, they would ask for photo ID from people turning up at polling booths. I think that would be quite a step forward. It does seem strange that, for just about anything you do in this country-whether it is turning up for accommodation or turning up to take possession of a package left for you at Australia Post-you are always required to show photo ID, yet for one of the greatest responsibilities you have as a citizen you do not need to identify yourself. All you need to do is assert your identity. All you need to do is say, 'I am such and such,' and they will find that name and just tick it off. there were a real interest in electoral reform, making sure everyone is exactly who they are meant to be would be the right thing to do-particularly requiring provisional voters to show photographic ID. I think that would be a reasonable step forward. I stand with the coalition in opposing this legislation. There are better ways to have electoral reform in this country. We will see how this vote goes, but I stand with my coalition colleagues in opposing these ridiculous bills.",34
17,Mr SYMON,BILLS," I speak in support of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Participation) Bill 2012. Our side of parliament is about enfranchising people, not ensuring they remain disenfranchised-as many people have been up until now. So many people turn up to vote on election day, find out they are not on the roll and scratch their heads and wonder why. They may now get a bit of an insight into what has gone on. These two bills amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to allow the Electoral Commissioner to update the address details of an elector on the electoral roll and automatically enrol new electors based on reliable third party information. These bills are based on recommendations of the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election. That committee tabled a report entitled The 2010 federal election report on the conduct of the election and related matters. In the report, the committee said: When considering electoral reforms, our priority must be: enfranchisement, not disenfranchisement. That is a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with. The report continued: If The Committee remains concerned about the long-term effects of the decline in enrolment participation rates, and notes that the decline has continued despite ongoing efforts on the part of the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC, to arrest it using measures currently permitted under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Over recent years, the AEC has invested substantial funds in encouraging people to enrol and keep their details up to date. Indeed, in the lead-up to the 2007 election, the AEC spent $36 million on a project to increase enrolments, including $14.9 million on pre-election advertising. In its submission to the committee's inquiry, the AEC said: If we have to spend $36 million every election Elector year then that is a significant amount of money over successive elections. But, perhaps more importantly, it does not lead to a permanent or long-lasting improvement in the electoral roll. These gains are quickly dissipated months after the close of rolls as people start to move again and the same challenges There is an ever-growing number of people in Australia who should be on the electoral roll but are not. The Electoral Commissioner told the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that an estimated 1.2 million eligible electors were not on the electoral roll in mid-2009. By the end of December 2009, that number had risen to approximately 1.39 million. By 30 June 2010, that number had grown to 1.59 million people-people who should be electors but are not. If you were to average that number across the seats represented here in the House, you would come up with a figure of about 10,000 people per electorate who are not voting in elections-for either side. They have no say. It is not participative democracy if there is a large group in the electorate not having a say. In its submission to the committee's investigation of the 2010 election, the AEC addressed the question of the best way, in their view, to deal with this decline in participation. They said: Our view is that we now need to go further with our recommendation, suggesting direct update of the electoral roll based on third party information I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. These bills will introduce automatic address updating based on third-party data from sources such as state driver-licensing bodies. When people move house, one of the last things on their minds is changing their enrolment address. There are good reasons for that. It is not something that comes around every month or every quarter as do power bills. It is not something that you necessarily think about outside of an election period. This happens with other services as well. Some of the things we all use which are only paid annually or which are only renewed every three or five years, such as a licence perhaps-that sort of updating can simply slip people's minds. They eventually catch up, but in the meantime, especially when it comes to enfranchisement-the right to vote-it can actually impact quite severely and take that right away. In addition to the challenges of encouraging people to update their address, the AEC actually takes people off the roll without their consent. Information from reliable third-party sources is currently used by the AEC to monitor the accuracy of the roll and to remove people from the roll. Current examples of data used in datamatching are Australia Post redirection advices, Centrelink change of address advices and some state motor transport data on new licences. What that means is that the very data that these bills propose to use to put people on the roll or keep them updated on the roll is currently used to take people off the roll. To those who say there is a lack of integrity in the process, I would say you cannot have it both ways-if there is integrity in the data that is used at the moment to take people off the roll, the integrity in the data should equally be good enough to maintain people on the roll. The AEC posts out a single monthly mailout to addresses identified by this external data as being addresses of current electors who appear to have moved address without updating their enrolment with the AEC. Last financial year the AEC mailed out over four million letters reminding electors to update their enrolment details. The AEC has advised that response rates were generally between 15 and 20 per cent for the monthly mailouts during periods when there are no major electoral events-when, as I said, the vast majority of the population do not have their minds on what happens in a place like this. Each year approximately two per cent of all electors are removed from the electoral roll by this process. The AEC advised the joint standing committee that the votes of over 200,000 people who had cast pre-poll, absent or provisional votes at the 2010 election were rejected due to those individuals being incorrectly enrolled or not enrolled at all. The Electoral Commission has suggested that 'they are clearly potentially part of the group that have fallen off the roll because, at some stage, they did not respond to an AEC letter' and were removed under this process. Some of the decline in participation in Australia's elections can also be traced back to a number of people not enrolling for the first time when they turn 18. This is a very long standing problem, and something that I have direct experience of. I missed out on voting in the 1983 election, having turned 18 only shortly before the election was called. At the first opportunity I had to enrol I went to what I thought was the local AEC office on a Friday afternoon, the last day before enrolments closed. They said to me, 'Sorry, you have turned up at the wrong divisionyou need to go up the road to the next office'. I had just turned 18 and, like most people of that age in Victoria, I did not have a car, so I can admit here that I missed out on voting in the 1983 election. Subsequently I, like of course many other people in Australia, have continued to exercise my right to vote-a right which is a wonderful thing. These bills will enable the AEC for the first time to automatically enrol people on the proviso that the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that the person is entitled to and has lived at an address for at least one month. Under this proposal the AEC would write to the individual that the AEC proposes to enter his or her name and address on the electoral roll, and they will be given 28 days to respond if they do not live at that address or are not entitled to enrol. These bills will allow the AEC to place people on the roll based on external data such as driver licence details, school enrolments, Centrelink information or Australia Post redirections. This legislation adopts changes that have already been put in place in Victoria and New South Wales. Automatic enrolment was introduced in Victoria and NSW in 2010slightly different systems but they certainly go along the same path as this legislation. The SmartRoll project, established by the New South Wales Electoral Commission, minimises the need to complete and lodge enrolment forms; electors who have changed their address details and notified a New South Wales agency of that change are automatically enrolled at their new address. It has been estimated that over 500,000 electors change their address each year in New South Wales. SmartRoll will help to ensure that eligible voters retain their right to vote. The Victorian Electoral Commission estimates that there may be up to 180,000 electors in Victoria with out-of-date details. After finding voters that have moved without notifying the VEC, the VEC writes asking them to change their address. The average response rate to this program over the five years to 2009 was only 23.5 per cent and dropping. According to the VEC: Generally, people are becoming less inclined to respond to written communications. The intent of these bills is also to ensure that young people get on the roll as soon as they are eligible to vote. Before the introduction of SmartRoll in New South Wales the enrol enrolment of young people, those who have just turned 18, was low. Of the approximately 67,000 17to 18-year-olds who were registered with the New South Wales Office of the Board of Studies and completed the HSC in 2009, only 50 per cent enrolled to vote. That was even after a letter was sent to students asking them to enrol. It only got through to half of them. This lack of enrolment can lead to many of these potential electors not exercising their right to vote for a considerable time. The Victorian Electoral Commission, upon adopting an automatic system, reported back on its success: We wrote … telling them that they were on the roll and they had 14 days to let us know if we got it wrong. We received no correspondence from anyone saying that we got it wrong, due to the safeguards that we had in the process. The Commonwealth now needs to adopt this legislation because of the impact over time of the New South Wales and Victorian automatic enrolment system working alongside the Commonwealth roll. Since the introduction of SmartRoll in NSW there has been a growing gap between the Commonwealth electoral roll and the New South Wales state roll. As at June 2011 there were around 20,500 additional voters appearing on the New South Wales roll that were absent from the federal electoral roll. Based on the New South Wales Electoral Commission automatically approximately 10,000 people per month, Antony Green, the well-known political commentator, estimates that there could be a difference of 200,000 people between the Commonwealth and New South Wales state electoral rolls by the time of the 2013 federal election if current provisions remain the same. As I have said, automatic enrolment is already in place in New South Wales and Victoria, and Queensland is on track to adopt the process after this year's state election. It would appear that if the federal roll does not adopt automatic address change there will be a growing number of people who will be eligible to vote in a state election but excluded from voting federally. The AEC in their submission to the joint parliamentary committee inquiry anticipated that direct enrolment would provide the following benefits: assist eligible persons in meeting their obligation to enrol; build on the direct update model already supported by the Australian government; and balance existing provisions which enable the AEC to remove an eligible elector from the electoral roll where it believes, based on data received had from a number of agencies, that an elector is no longer entitled to be enrolled at an address. On 24 November 2011 the House of Representatives Selection Committee requested the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to inquire into and report on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. Their report on the bill was handed down only recently and the committee recommended that this bill, which is one of two bills in this cognate debate, be passed by the House. In the public hearing held on 8 February 2012, Mr Ed Killesteyn, the Electoral Commissioner of the Australian Electoral Commission, said: enrolling … direct update of elector addresses using reliable third-party information is not only a next logical step in the evolution of electoral roll administrative practices but also consistent with growing expectations of many in the community for seamless use of data across government agencies. There is a clear trend of declining enrolment participation in Australia. These bills provide the Electoral Commissioner with the ability to use modern processes to protect the participation of eligible Australian citizens in the electoral process. It is therefore a matter of logic that the more people who vote the more accurately parliament will reflect the will of the total electorate. Currently, it is estimated that over one and a half million Australians are not enrolled to vote. As I said, that is an average of 10,000 potential voters for each electorate represented in this House. These bills will not change the grounds on which a person becomes entitled to enrol or entitled to vote. They will simply enhance the integrity of the Australian electoral roll and help the AEC do its job. I commend these bills to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (10:24): I rise today to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. I do not support these bills as I believe that they will significantly reduce the integrity of the electoral roll. The integrity of the roll is at the heart of the issue that we are debating today. The integrity of the roll is something that we need and must preserve now and into the future, and we must be very mindful of that with any amendments that are being proposed. We must ensure that wherever possible the integrity of the roll is maintained and that the data contained on that roll is as accurate as it is possible to make it. I do not believe that the proposed bills are the way to go about achieving the integrity of the roll. We are debating two bills today and I would like to briefly discuss the provisions of each bill. Firstly, there is the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The amendments provide for the details of an elector to be added to the electoral roll when the commissioner is satisfied that the elector lives at the address. This bill does not propose to directly enrol electors on the roll. However, the other bill being debated today does seek to do this. This brings me to the second bill being debated, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Participation) Bill 2012. This bill does propose to introduce automatic enrolment. Under this bill, amendments are being introduced to provide the Electoral Commissioner with an ability to directly enrol eligible individuals who are not on the electoral roll. This direct enrolment will occur if the commissioner is satisfied that the person has lived at an address for at least one month and the person is not enrolled. This bill also seeks to allow the commissioner to enrol certain persons who have been removed from the electoral roll and to admit their declaration votes. In Australia, voting is compulsory and it is therefore vitally important to our very democracy that the integrity of the electoral roll is upheld to ensure that we have the most efficient and fair electoral system. I believe the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 as it currently stands is appropriate in respect of enrolments. Section 101 of this act already requires individuals to update their enrolment details within 21 days of residing at their new address for at least one month. A person who fails to comply with this requirement will have to pay a $110 fine as per section 101(6). An inquiry into the 2010 federal election was recently conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, with numerous electoral matters inquired into and subsequently reported on. The Labor and Greens committee members recommended that eligible electors be put directly on the electoral roll through the introduction of automatic enrolment. Automatic enrolment will mean that individual electors may be put straight onto the roll without an enrolment form ever being filled out by them. Instead, automatic enrolment will occur based on information from other government sources. This is the central provision being introduced Elector that I have several concerns about. My concerns are threefold: firstly, that the individual responsibility of electors to update their own enrolment details, such as changing their address, will be diluted; secondly, that the accuracy of the information to be relied upon for automatic enrolment is compromised; and, thirdly, that automatic enrolments will erode the integrity of the roll. In relation to individual responsibility, electors must currently update their own details and the onus is on them to ensure that they do so. However, I am concerned about proposed changes which will permit personal address details of individuals to be changed by the government, on the individual's behalf, without their knowledge or consent. The Australian Electoral Commission's website talks about the importance of the right to vote and actually states: The right to vote is one of the privileges of living in a democracy-you get a say in who runs your country. I could not agree more with this point. In their dissenting report on the conduct of the 2010 election, the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters noted that Australian citizens have four duties in relation to their enrolment:  to enrol to vote,  to accurately maintain their enrolment at their permanent place of residence,  to cast a vote when an election is called, and,  to fully extend preferences to all candidates contesting election for the House of Representatives in their local electorate. The Gillard government does not have faith in the Australian people to maintain these responsibilities. It should not be seeking to dilute these duties. These are not obligations that are too onerous for Australian citizens and electors. If individuals are told they do not have to take proactive steps to ensure that their electoral details are correct, then they will just presume that their engagement with government agencies will guarantee the accuracy of their electoral details. This is a direct dilution of an elector's responsibility to compulsorily enrol. The other concern I have with regard to automatic enrolment relates to the accuracy of the information relied upon to make entries on the roll. An inquiry into automatic enrolment in New South Wales made reference to this issue, stating: One of the concerns about receiving data from trusted agencies for the purpose of automatic enrolment or automatic update of electors is that any address data sourced from these agencies was not gathered for the purpose of collecting electorate information. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2012 will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to change elector address details by determining what are 'reliable and current data sources'. The coalition has concerns about this provision. It does not take into account the fact that the address provided by some electors to particular government agencies is merely a point of contact rather than their actual place of residence. Under this provision, however, this point of contact address may be applied to the electoral roll. Furthermore, if data is being relied upon from state and territory governments, there is an additional risk of error as the accuracy cannot be verified by the Commonwealth. As I mentioned previously, the only way to ensure this information is accurate and to maintain the electoral roll's integrity is to continue to give the responsibility of updating these details to the individual and not to a third party. The final concern I would like to discuss today is in relation to the impact automatic enrolment will have on the integrity of the electoral roll. I believe this is also closely linked with the issue of individual responsibility of electors, which I have already discussed. The basis of my concern is straightforward: if an individual updates their electoral details, details which they know are accurate and appropriate to them, then the accuracy and therefore the integrity of the roll will be ensured. However, if this responsibility is taken away and given to the Australian Electoral Commission, there is a much higher chance that an error will occur, particularly if this change of address is made without the knowledge of the elector. We must remember also that there are many people who have multiple places of residence and, if their enrolled address is changed without their knowledge, there is clearly a high likelihood that an error will occur and they will be automatically enrolled at an address that is not their principal place of residence. In their dissenting report on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill, my coalition colleagues highlighted three groups of people who will be impacted by this legislation, to the detriment of the integrity of the roll: those who have more than one place of residence; secondly, electors who move temporarily; and, thirdly, those people whose place of employment is a residential address or who, for whatever reason, receive mail at a different address. The best way to ensure the integrity of the electoral roll is to maintain the not-so-onerous responsibility on the elector to update their details, not to transfer this responsibility to a third party who could make errors. Automatic enrolment already occurs in New South Wales and Victoria and has been tested at their recent state elections. Because there are several variations between the federal and state legislation, numerous electors in New South Wales and Victoria are enrolled for state elections but not for federal elections. This means that these electors are sent an enrolment form by the AEC when their details are changed or added to the relevant state electoral roll. Following the New South Wales state election last year, it was found that only 64.3 per cent of those electors who were automatically enrolled for the first time turned out to vote. Based on the New South Wales experience, the high non-participation rate indicates that the information used to put new electors on the roll is unreliable. This also means that, because incorrect address details have been used on the electoral roll, some electors will be issued with a fine for not voting when it was in fact their information that was incorrect in the first place. Does this sound like a ringing endorsement for automatic enrolment? It certainly does not and I do not support it. Individual responsibility is a tenet of our great liberal democratic system in Australia and efforts should not be made to dilute this. Electors can and currently do update their enrolment details themselves-these are not onerous requirements. These bills, however, firstly, will introduce a system of automatic enrolment which forces government into the lives of people to change their enrolment details, at times without their knowledge. I therefore oppose these bills on the three premises I have outlined: firstly, the dilution of individual responsibility; secondly, the problems with ensuring the accuracy of information which is being relied upon to change an elector's details without their knowledge; and, thirdly, the overall impact on the integrity of the electoral roll. Let us not have government intrude into the lives of Australians and let us have confidence that the current responsibilities placed on electors to update their own electoral details are not too onerous. I oppose these bills.",36
18,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," My electorate of Fraser has one of the highest number of enrolled voters in Australia. As a result, we send out hundreds of enrolment forms to potential new electors and it is my pleasure to be able to send out every month hundreds of letters to people who have joined the rolls. It is a genuine delight to welcome somebody onto the electoral rolls. In Australia we have had compulsory voting since 1924. We have recognised that with the many rights of citizenship there are responsibilities as well. One of those responsibilities is that an elector is required to vote every three years or so in federal elections and every four years or so in state or territory elections. It is a right of all Australians and it is a great privilege, I believe. As other speakers have noted in this debate, there are many countries in the world in which people fight and die for this very right. High voter participation matters, because we know that in countries where voter turnout is low the voter turnout is unrepresentative. In the United States and the United Kingdom, where about half of the electorate votes, you end up with those who vote not being a representative slice of the electorate. They are too often more affluent, older and better educated. As a result, governments are elected that do not truly represent the demographics of the entire electorate. When we on this side of the House look at the issue of the electoral roll, we look at it through the lens of Labor values of equity and fairness and our belief that all should participate in the electoral process. But so often we have seen those on the other side of the House approach the issue of enrolment through a partisan lens. In a contribution last night in this debate the member for Moreton referred to the point at which the Howard government closed the electoral rolls, in 2007, attempting to deny tens of thousands of people their say in that election, as one the more shameful moments in the Australian democracy. That attempt to shut down the electoral rolls is something that this country should never see again. Why did they do so? We know why. Study after study, including some of my own work, has shown that younger voters are less likely to support the coalition parties. Making a purely political judgment, those on the coalition benches have decided that they should do what they can to deny a say in the electoral process to younger voters. It is also the case that people who were born overseas are less likely to vote for the coalition. I am sure that those opposite know this as well as I do or any researcher in this space does. That is why they, during the Howard government era, under-resourced efforts to ensure that new migrants join the electoral roll. They have also under-resourced efforts to ensure that young people maintain their electoral enrolment. We on this side of the House do not believe that elections should be won or lost depending on who you manage to get onto the electoral roll. We believe that all Australians should be on the electoral roll and that election results should turn on the views of all Australians. So we are not prepared to sit back and let an estimated 1.5 million voters stay off the electoral roll. We are seeing a widening gap between the number of eligible voters and the number who are on the roll. The Australian Electoral Commission has estimated that since 2001 there has been an increase of over half a million electors who are not on the electoral roll. They estimate that, by 2013, 1½ million eligible voters will not be on the roll and will not be able to cast their votes. That is an average of 10,000 people per electorate10,000 people who do not get to have their of say in choosing the direction our nation should take. They do not get to participate in the choice that we will face at the next election between an optimistic, nationbuilding government-one that is prepared to tackle the big challenges, to make the investments that lay the prosperity for Australia's future-and a constantly carping and negative opposition. They will not get to make that choice. I think it is a pity for any Australian not to get to make that choice. The reforms in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 have been described as some of the most significant since the very introduction of compulsory voting in 1924. Yet the opposition do not support the bill. As a result, they will keep people off the electoral roll. It is almost as though they believe only the right Australians should be able to vote in elections. Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition when asked about school retention. Last November he said: It is all very well keeping kids at school past 10, but they have got to be the right kids … The opposition's opposition to this bill reflects the same philosophy. It is all very well having people on the electoral roll, but they have to be the right sort of voters. For those opposite the right sort of voters are not younger voters or overseas born voters, because they know that those voters are particularly unlikely to support the coalition parties. The Leader of the Opposition should explain which voters do not deserve to be on the electoral roll-which voters should not be participating in our electoral process. The Labor Party is founded on democratic principles. It was the progressive parties that saw the introduction of the universal franchise, first getting rid of the property qualifications, then extending the franchise to women and then extending the franchise to Indigenous Australians. All these expansions of the franchise have occurred thanks to the progressive side of politicsand each has been fought by the conservative side of politics. You can go all the way back to the Eureka Stockade movement to find those in the progressive movements in this country encouraging the expansion of the franchise against the conservative moneyed interests who wanted the franchise as restricted as possible. Labor believes that casting a vote is a basic expression of democratic participation. We want all Australians who are eligible to vote to do so, particularly young people, who are becoming increasingly disengaged from politics. We want them to be engaged in the democratic process. I took the opportunity to look at the share of Australians in the last half-century who have cast a valid vote-the share of Australians who have turned up to the electoral polling place and not voted informally-and that share has been declining. There is a greatly concerning downward trend in the share of Australians, year even conditional on being on the roll, who are actively participating in the democratic process. I think that is a pity, and it is something we need to reverse. As a result of this bill the Electoral Commissioner will be able to directly update an elector's enrolled address following receipt from reliable and current data sources from outside the AEC. That will be particularly important in my own electorate of Fraser, which has a high level of mobility-many Australian moving here to study at one of the great universities in the ACT or to work in the fine Commonwealth Public Service. This bill will enable them to maintain their democratic rights to vote and participate by making sure that their record on the electoral roll remains accurate. At the moment eligible electors are being removed from the roll despite the AEC having accurate information of their current address. That is having a detrimental effect on enrolment rates, and we want to change that. Under this bill an elector will be notified of the intention to enrol them at a new residential address. They will be given an opportunity to object to the change, and people who are not on the roll will still need to enrol in accordance with the current requirements of the Electoral Act. In response, there has been scaremongering, and I think scaremongering has been put to bed most nicely by the member for Melbourne Ports, who has noted that between 1999 and 2010 there were six electoral events, including a referendum, and 72 proven cases of electoral fraud. Within those six approximately 72 million votes were cast. As the member for Melbourne Ports points out, this is a fraud rate of one in one million. This is not a problem that should cause us to hold back 1½ million Australians from the electoral roll. I am proud of the fact that my own electorate of Fraser has a lower informal voting rate than the national average, but I am concerned by the fact that that informal voting rate has risen-from 2,679 voters in 2007 to 5,171 voters in 2010. I do not want to represent an electorate in which everyone has not had their say. I want that informal voting rate to be as low as possible. I want Australians to be participating in the democratic process. In Disconnected I encourage civic engagement, contacting politicians and participating in the political process. In recent elections we have seen one out of 10 Australians failing to participate in the electoral process, even those who are on the roll-either failing to show up to the polling booth or spoiling the ballot paper. That is emblematic of a wider disengagement across other aspects of civic participation. In Australia it is a democratic right and responsibility to cast a vote and have your voice counted in the choice of government. The next election will be a critical election for our nation's future. It will be one in which the Australian people have a clear choice between the economic management that saw us through the global financial crisis and an approach to economic management that says, 'When downturns hit, governments some should cut back and cause Australia to slide this into recession.' We have an opposition with a $70 billion black hole-$70 billion of undisclosed cuts-and whose first priority will be to cut taxes on the most carbonpolluting goods, to cut taxes for the big miners and to reinstate a private health events, insurance rebate for millionaires and billionaires but who, when asked about an issue like a national disability insurance scheme, say, 'Well, we don't know if we can do that straight away; that's not a priority for us.' The opposition, if elected, would cut 12,000 Public Service jobs, and they have said that the axe would swing hardest on the ACT. The member for North Sydney talks about making 12,000 Canberra public servants redundant. When the issue arose, we heard the member for Kooyong interject, 'And that's just for starters.' We are proud of our record. We are proud to go to the Australian people. We want to go to the next election with the biggest rolls possible-with as many Australians as possible on the rolls and eligible to participate. Ours is not a philosophy that the franchise should be restricted-that it should be kept to only the right sort of people. We want those 1½ million eligible Australians to be able to cast their vote at the next election, because we believe in the fundamental values of equality, democracy and fairness. I commend this bill to the House. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (10:51): I was listening to the comments of the member for Fraser with great interest and was very surprised to hear him cast aspersions on us on this side of the House, saying that we do not want to encourage people to participate in the democratic right of voting, which is an absolutely outrageous claim. He was talking about welcoming 100 people to his electorate every month. I also have a high turnover on my electoral roll and I really care about making sure that the roll has integrity. At the moment my roll does not have integrity. So I am disappointed that the member for Fraser would cast such aspersions on this side of the House. The bills before the House are the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. The first bill seeks to provide a mechanism whereby the Australian Commission, the AEC, can automatically update details relevant to an elector in terms of residential address, based upon information obtained from sources other than direct advice to the AEC by that elector. The second bill is designed to expand the implications of the first by allowing the AEC to enrol new voters directly to the electoral roll where the Electoral Commissioner has been satisfied the person is eligible to be on the roll and has been residing at an address for a period of one month. Quoting directly from the explanatory memorandum, the bills will:  allow the Electoral Commissioner to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt and analysis of reliable and current data sources from outside the Australian Electoral Commission that indicate an elector has moved residential address … The amendments afforded by both bills move the AEC toward an automatic enrolment capability whereby the AEC can automatically update when an elector changes address or becomes eligible to be on the roll. I hold grave concerns about the current quality of the electoral roll, particularly within my own electorate, as I have already mentioned. Only within the last month I was in contact with the AEC directly in respect to inconsistencies in the roll for my electorate, specifically the omission and removal of persons from the roll. In several cases, this related to electors who were removed from the roll without a change of address or change of electoral details in any way, shape or form. In this instance the AEC investigated and advised my office of the outcome, that being that some of the processes they had in place had inadvertently removed a number of eligible electors, without justification, from the electoral role. Electoral It just so happens that those people that contacted my office that were removed from the roll were actual conservative voters. There is a bit of a concern there. This hiccup in the system I understand has now been fixed. But what concerns me most about this seemingly minor procedural error is how it could happen in the first place. How can a system based on a premise that details can only be changed following formal advice from the elector remove people from the roll? If this can happen now with a system reliant on elector contact, what are the checks and balances to be in place when the system no longer relies upon an elector as the best source of information? The explanatory memorandum, as I have been stated, notes 'analysis of reliable and current data sources'. My question remains: what are the checks and balances? By whom and how is this analysis of data determined to be reliable? Integrity of the electoral roll is an absolute must. At no time should the opportunity exist, or be allowed to develop, where corruption of the data contained within the roll occurs or can occur, nor should the situation be allowed to develop where the individual person can shirk their responsibility in terms of maintaining accurate records for the AEC. It is not optional to vote in local, state and federal elections; it is mandatory. The ramifications in terms of electoral validity, should there be doubt in the integrity of the electoral roll corruption of data, are broad and erode the very foundations upon which our voting system sits. Similarly, the legislation has been designed by Labor and the Greens solely for electoral advantage. In preparing this speech I noted the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters released a report in July 2011 relating to an inquiry into the 2010 federal election. The Labor and Greens members on that committee prepared recommendations, one of which was the introduction of automatic enrolment-a situation whereby an individual elector will have their details entered directly onto the electoral roll without the need for them even to contact the AEC. This, in the view of the coalition, has privacy implications on top of the concerns relating to data integrity. I can think of many a situation whereby an elector may have an address other than their specific home address in order to address some set of circumstances in their life, be it personal or otherwise. Government has yet to mandate that a person can only have one address. What of the people who are employed in flyin fly-out occupations where they have multiple addresses? What of people who own multiple properties? What of people who are forced to move temporarily due to circumstance-for example, bushfires, floods and cyclones? Certainly this is the case within my own electorate. I can cite further examples of why people may have alternative addresses. But the issue is not address; the issue with these bills is once again a government seeking to again denigrate the personal responsibility expected of individual Australians when it comes to managing their own privacy and their obligations in terms of correct and accurate electoral details for the AEC and ultimately the electoral roll. As I have demonstrated, there are factors or at play which cause me great concern. To add further substance, all we need to do is look at the New South Wales and Victoria examples. Both Labor governments prior to the last state elections introduced automatic enrolment, a tactic designed to advantage both Labor and the Greens. Unfortunately, a number of the electors were enrolled for only the state election and not for the federal election, due to differences in state and federal legislation. Additionally, when an elector has been added to the roll or has had their details changed, they are sent an enrolment form by the AEC. Antony Green noted in an article on 16 July 2007 that only 64.3 per cent of the first-time voters who were automatically enrolled prior to the New South Wales state election actually turned out to vote. The low turnout suggests that the information used to put those electors on the roll may have been unreliable. To take this example a step further, if the lower rate of turnout was a result of those electors being unaware that they were on the roll, how could they be fined for not voting if the AEC chose to follow that path? The coalition remains concerned with the potential for electoral fraud. At present the process of being added to the roll or changing one's details is evidenced by an AEC document signed by the elector. This singular event in any formal legal proceeding for fraudulent voting activity provides a sound basis for the determination of elector knowledge. With the implementation of an the automated system utilising data sources external to the AEC determined by the AEC to be reliant and current, it is my assertion that this in fact dissolves elector responsibility and makes the process of investigating and prosecuting electoral fraud substantially more difficult. We on this side of the House have voiced our disappointment with the AEC's attitude to the questioning of prosecuting cases of fraudulent voting. Despite there being over 20,000 multiple voters at the 2007 election, not one has been prosecuted. If I thought for one moment that the initiatives being proposed by without risk to the integrity and ongoing confidence of the electoral roll, ensured the integrity of the roll and were measures designed to ensure equality in the roll I would consider supporting these bills. However, clearly these bills ring alarm bells and prompt more questions than answers. Any measure to divest individual electors of their responsibilities in terms of accuracy in AEC and electoral roll details is not warranted, nor do I believe it is the role of the AEC to make a determination as to what resources are reliable and accurate. The view of the coalition echoes this point. The AEC is not equipped, nor should it be empowered, to make determinations as to what is reliable and accurate in external data sources. In addition, I have been unable to determine whether a suitable risk assessment has been undertaken on the roll or if in fact a document risk analysis reviewing the potential impact of the measures being introduced by these bills has been conducted. To add further food for thought, how accurate are the sources of data being considered? Are they actually fit for purpose? An audit report by the ANAO, No. 24 2004-05: Integrity of Medicare enrolment data, stated: ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. Such inconsistency in Commonwealth data is clearly not acceptable or legitimate for the AEC to update the electoral roll. How accurate and trusted are other Commonwealth data sources? It is the assertion of the coalition that any external data sources which the AEC may draw on to update electoral roll details are potential risks to the integrity of the roll. Without integrity, the roll becomes a tainted record, one that potentially has the capacity to damage public trust in the roll and the these bills were electoral process. In conclusion, the amendments proposed by these bills before the House in essence provide the mechanisms for the AEC to automatically update elector details and to automatically enrol new electors. The New South Wales and Victorian state Labor governments introduced such measures prior to recent elections in both states not as a value-added initiative to the electoral roll or to boost integrity in the roll but for electoral advantage for Labor and the Greens. We talk about responsibility and empowering people, yet the measures sought through these bills would diminish the responsibility of the elector to maintain accurate records in terms of their address and electoral compliance. As I have stated, the integrity of the electoral roll must be maintained. Opening the way for the AEC to source data from external resources without the proper risk assessments and without definitive knowledge of the accuracy of those records can lead to only one result-that is, a loss of integrity. Without integrity, the very electoral system which the electoral roll underpins will became tainted, resulting in a loss of public faith and credibility and in the potential for illegal electoral activities, including the instance of electoral fraud. So, no, Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot support these bills. Without 100 per cent compliance to integrity and without value of data, the only way to ensure the electoral roll remains true is the continuation of current practices. That includes the responsibility of individual electors to maintain accurate details for the roll and the prosecution of those who fail to enrol or who seek to manipulate the roll for some advantage.",42
19,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. These bills amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act. They arise from the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the conduct of the 2007 federal election. The first bill is said implement the government's response to recommendation 10 of that report and the second to recommendations 1 and 24. I need hardly add that these recommendations were not supported by the coalition members on the committee. The key provisions in the set of bills before us today will do two principal things: firstly, they will allow the Electoral Commissioner to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt and analysis of what is determined by the AEC to be reliable and current data, from sources outside those already maintained by the AEC, which indicates that an elector has moved residential address; and, secondly, they will grant the AEC the capacity to directly and automatically enrol new electors. What is the framework in which the coalition analyses the policy measures proposed in the bills which are put before the House for its consideration this morning? The coalition approaches these bills as it does every piece of legislation brought forward by the Rudd and Gillard governments on electoral matters and the electoral roll-in a spirit of intelligent scepticism. Naturally, we wish to believe the best of this government and all who comprise it, but as that great conservative statesman Ronald Reagan so well articulated, a good principle by which to live your life is 'trust, but verify'. As we apply this principle to the motives which may lie behind the Rudd and Gillard governments bringing forward this package of changes to the law as it governs the integrity of the electoral roll, we think it is important to look at the historical matrix and ask ourselves the question: does the Australian Labor Party have form when it comes to rorting the electoral roll? The answer to that question is very plainly on the historical record. The Australian to Labor Party does have form when it comes to rorting the electoral roll. I am sure you are familiar, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, with the Shepherdson inquiry, which looked into matters of electoral roll integrity in the state of Queensland, and I am sure you would be familiar with the episode in which a member of the Queensland parliament and former state secretary of the Queensland ALP was asked, under cross-examination, about an address he was listed as living at which had appeared on the roll some years before. He was asked whether he had actually lived at that address. After being forced to admit that he had never lived at that address, he retired to consider his position. Very shortly after, the parliamentary career of Mike Kaiser came to an end. I note parenthetically that, happily, his very good friend the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy put him into a $400,000-a-year job as the head of government relations at NBN Co. An onerous job, you might thinkmanaging relations with the government when the company is 100 per cent owned by the government-but far be it from me to ask whether the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy had carefully turned his mind to the question of whether the government was getting value for money.  on a point of order. Is this relevant to the legislation? Also, the assertion about the appointment of Mike Kaiser to NBN Co. is incorrect. That was not a decision of the minister.",49
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, There is no point of order.,50
21,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I return to the conceptual and philosophical framework in which the coalition analyses whether the changes to the legislation regarding administration of the electoral roll put forward by the Rudd and Gillard governments have merit and whether they ought to be supported. I am making the point to assure the House of the careful historical context within which we consider this question. We approach the question of the merits of this legislation in a spirit of intelligent scepticism. Having applied that analysis to this legislation, we are reluctantly forced to conclude that we are not satisfied of the bona fides of the government in bringing forward this legislation. We are not satisfied that their motives are pure and beyond reproach. Let me make three points in the brief time. I have available to me. Firstly, on this side the House we consider that it is entirely appropriate that electors should bear responsibility for taking the necessary action to change their own address on the electoral roll. Secondly, we note with concern that the bills before the House fail to implement important safety mechanisms which were recommended in the joint standing committee's report. Thirdly, and consequently, the package of measures contained in these two bills threatens the integrity of the electoral roll and nothing could be more serious when it comes to the continuing operation of the tremendously successful Australian parliamentary democracy in which we all take justified pride. We must be tremendously sceptical of changes-no matter how high-minded the stated motives for those changes-which, on analysis, present the real and present danger of undermining the confidence of the citizens of this country in the democratic process and which are so important to the maintenance of this tremendously successful parliamentary democracy in Australia. Let me turn, firstly, to the question of personal responsibility. As you would be aware, under the law today citizens have an obligation to enrol to vote and to accurately maintain their enrolment at their permanent place of residence. We do not think that these requirements are unreasonable and we fundamentally object to the measures in this bill, which would remove that responsibility from an individual. We think it is poor policy and objectionable in principle. We also take the view that the positive action required of a citizen to notify of his or her change of address is not unduly onerous. We think it is a perfectly reasonable responsibility to expect a citizen of our democracy to exercise. In addition, I note that the Australian Electoral Commission regularly conducts information campaigns to of encourage Australians both to enrol and to maintain the currency and accuracy of their enrolment. I have myself participated at forums in local high schools in my electorate where the Australian Electoral Commission has been informing 16-, 17and 18-year-olds about the importance of getting on the roll. The second point I wish to make is on the grave failure in this bill to implement vital protections recommended in the joint standing committee's report. In its report the committee was careful to recommend a number of very important preconditions to the notion that the AEC should be able to obtain data from external sources to update the roll. The first precondition was that the elector should provide their proactive and specific consent to opt in for the data to be used to update the roll, and the second was that there must be surety that the proof of identity processes used by the respective government agencies have sufficient integrity. What is proposed in this bill is that a data source which has not previously had anything to do with the electoral roll or the integrity of the electoral roll is now to be drawn on for the purpose of automatically updating somebody's enrolment. Yet we have had no satisfaction provided to us by the Rudd-Gillard government as they bring forward this legislation as to the methods which will be used to ensure the integrity of the data in that external data source which is now to be used for the purpose of upgrading the electoral roll. That is a vital protection which one would expect as a bare minimum before a change of this magnitude were proposed; extraordinarily, there has been no satisfaction provided to the coalition side of this House as to the adequacy of those protective mechanisms. That brings me to the third point that I want to address, which is the vital need to protect the integrity of the electoral roll and the loss of integrity to the roll which will inevitably result from these ill-conceived changes contained in the bill before the House. When you think about the matter, a very important safeguard of the integrity of the roll is that the citizen is required to take a proactive step to update the commission as to a change in his or her address. Amongst other things, that means that there is a paper trail which can be followed to verify any particular entry in the roll, because there must be a form signed by the relevant citizen or there must be alternative high-quality data sources that are based upon processes of proven existing integrity and which can be resorted to in order to verify the quality of the information in the roll. The measure proposed before the House today does not build in those safeguards. Therefore, it represents a fundamental undermining of the processes which exist for a very good reason, which is to safeguard the integrity of the roll, which in turn is vital to underpinning public confidence in our parliamentary democracy. If confidence in the integrity of the roll is lost, if a suspicion emerges that there are large numbers of entries on the roll which do not accurately reflect the existence and the true address of those individuals, that will greatly undermine confidence and, in turn, will undermine the quality of our parliamentary democracy. In this regard, I note that in the minister's second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum we are told that the Australian Electoral Commission will rely on data sources that are 'reliable' and 'current'. Those words appear nowhere in the bill. The bill does not explicitly require that the data sources used by the AEC are 'reliable' or 'current'. The only requirement is for the commissioner in his or her absolute discretion to be satisfied that the elector lives at another address. This is a highly dangerous degree of discretion to give to the commissioner, and the danger inherent in that is reinforced by the fact that on all the evidence available about large-scale databases managed by the Commonwealth government, there are very large numbers of false positives. There are very large numbers of entries in those databases which do not correspond on a oneto-one basis with real, living people. As other speakers from this side have done, I refer the House to a 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration which found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people. Similarly, an audit report found that 'up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records are probably for people who are deceased'. I cannot comment as to whether any of those people appear in Labor Party branch records. I have a strong suspicion that they do, based upon the evidence of the Shepherdson inquiry and other indicators that we have seen of a lack of commitment on a day-today basis by the Labor Party to the integrity of the roll and indeed based upon the conduct of individuals, including Labor parliamentarians, to actively rort the roll. It is because of that grubby and shameful record that we look at this set of provisions with a degree of intelligent scepticism. There is a high burden of proof which ought be discharged if these fundamental changes are to be made, and that burden of proof has not been discharged. These changes are a threat to our democracy and we strongly oppose them. WYATT ROY (Longman) (11:21): One of the many things that is internationally recognised and respected about our great nation is the strength and fairness of our democracy. While we do not pretend that our system of democracy is without flaws, we know that as Australians we have every opportunity to contribute to the national debate about the issues that impact us and the issues that are important to us. In fact, many would say that my very presence in this place, my election to the House of Representatives, is illustrative of the fact anyone with the passion and the desire to make a difference in their local community can actually do so. In this country, age, race and gender are not characteristics that exclude individuals from having a voice that is heard. Every single adult Australian citizen has a voice, and they have the opportunity to use it. They have the opportunity to simply stand up and put themselves forward to participate in the national debate and to be part of democracy in action. It is the very fact that people can have a say, even if it is to disagree with the majority, that adds strength to our voting system. Democracy is a concept that is thousands of years old and has taken many forms over the ages, but it is a concept which is empowered by our voting system, a voting system that gives every citizen-every man and woman over the age of 18-the opportunity to vote for their representative in local, state and federal elections. One voice equals one vote, and the majority vote rules. In a practical sense, it is a system which enables us at the federal level to have a say about who we want to represent us on the issues that affect our daily lives and will determine the future direction of our country. And it is this system that we are here to debate today as we speak to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the cognate Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Electoral Participation) Bill 2012. These bills propose fundamental changes to the powers of the Australian Electoral Commission under the Commonwealth Electoral Act and consequently serious changes to our voting system, changes that I have serious reservations about. The electoral roll is one of the key tools that enables democracy and facilitates our voting system. It is a key tool that ensures that our that elections are fair and unbiased and it prevents electoral corruption. The accuracy of this tool is vital. Australia relies on it to ensure that no-one has more than one vote and no-one misses out on their chance to vote. But the key changes outlined in this legislation have the ability to compromise, rather than strengthen, our democracy by threatening the accuracy of the electoral roll. This legislation effectively takes away the responsibility and authority from voters and instead hands them to the Australian Electoral Commission. Let us make it very clear what this debate is about. This is not a debate about the need to improve the quality and the consistency of the electoral roll. While there is no denying that more can be done to further increase the accuracy of the electoral roll, the debate that we are having in this place is not about the need to do so. No, what this is about is the means by which these bills seek to achieve greater accuracy. Today the debate is about the vague and nondescript powers that these bills provide the Australian Electoral Commission with. It is about the lack of accountability that there will be for the Australian Electoral Commission determining who should and should not be on the roll and where they should be enrolled. It is about the lack of external scrutiny of the processes and information that the AEC will use when making a decision about what details are current and what details are outdated. These bills bring us to a point of automatic electoral enrolment. We know that the Labor and Greens members who were on the recent Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the 2010 federal election even went so far as to recommend that automatic enrolment be instigated, so it is no wonder that this Labor government is putting forward legislation that seeks to achieve this. These bills will allow individuals to be put on the electoral roll without their knowledge or their input. These bills also provide for individuals' addresses to be automatically updated by the Australian Electoral Commission without their knowledge. We members of the Liberal Party have always believed in individual responsibility. We believe that every single person is responsible for their own actions. We also believe that it is not an overwhelming responsibility for citizens to be responsible for their own enrolment, to take the simple steps of completing a form to enrol to vote and submitting another form to update their enrolment address. But these bills ultimately undermine the responsibilities of Australian citizens and they detract from societal civic accountability. I am concerned that this devalues the privilege that we share, as Australian citizens, to have a voice and a vote. We cannot afford to take this privilege for granted, and it should be highly respected. The last thing that we, as policymakers and leaders, should be encouraging is for citizens into lose respect for mechanisms that ensure equitable and stable democracy in our country-that is, an electoral roll that is managed by the citizens themselves, with the responsibility for updating it in their hands. By removing the responsibility for people to update their details on the electoral roll, we are breeding complacency and disengaging our constituency. This is a dangerous path to travel and one that we on this side of the House believe should be avoided. Not only is personal responsibility a key factor in this issue; the irregularities that will potentially arise on the electoral roll as a result of automatic enrolment and updating of details are a serious concern. These bills will provide the Australian Electoral Commission with the discretion to determine what data they utilise to inform their decisions, and the combination of data sources that the Australian Electoral Commission would use to identify voters and update their details cannot be relied upon to provide accurate details. This measure makes the assumption that other data sources will be up to date and accurate, but this assumption is misguided. Not only this, but it assumes that the AEC will be able to make value judgments about which information is legitimate without any requirement on the AEC's part to justify their choices. An individual alone should be advising, first hand, about their current details. As in so many other areas of life, when you are dealing with only half the information and half the picture, there is a large margin for human error. The opportunity for irregularity is simply too high, and it is a risk that we, the sake of our democracy, cannot afford to take. Not only this, but with inaccuracy comes the opportunity for abuse. With individuals being unaware of their enrolment, the opportunity for someone with malicious intent to manipulate and abuse this, effectively taking away a person's opportunity for a voice, is a real threat, a threat that I do not want to see any opportunity or any advantage given to. There is tangible proof that systems of automatic enrolment are fraught with errors and actually decrease engagement and accuracy. Last year this system was employed for the New South Wales state election. The results speak for themselves: 35.7 per cent of people who had been automatically enrolled did not turn up to vote. It is clear that while individuals may be enrolled, there is no guarantee that their details are correct-such a high nonparticipation rate demonstrates this. In my electorate of Longman, more people rent than have a mortgage. Clearly they will be changing their addresses on a reasonably frequent basis, and it is simply not possible that second-hand information obtained by the Australian Electoral Commission will be able to accurately keep up with these changes. It is up to us in this place to be doing more to encourage those young people to get enrolled on the electoral roll and to encourage all citizens to keep their electoral enrolment up to date. Education is the key, and engaging with our constituents and our communities is vital. It is through continued effort on these fronts that we will see people take their personal responsibilities seriously and understand how they go about undertaking their responsibilities. Only through enrolment details that are for advised by the individuals themselves can we maintain an accurate electoral enrolment roll and, consequently, a voting system that gives every adult citizen the chance to have an equal vote. I am aware that for the most part, and particularly for young people, a lack of knowledge is a barrier to getting on the electoral roll. Many young people are unaware of their responsibility to enrol as soon as they turn 18 and believe that they can do it before the next election. Others are confused about how this process takes place and mistakenly believe that as long as they are enrolled before polling day they will be able to vote. The key here is not automation, but education. Only a concerted educational push that engages voters, rather than disengages and distances them, can resolve this issue. In Australia we are afforded many privileges and opportunities to contribute to the future of our country. The views and ideas of all of our citizens are valued, respected and encouraged. Our voting system is prized as an example of democracy in action. We are beholden as policymakers to uphold and strengthen this voting system, not to undermine it. These bills, and the changes they intend to make to the Electoral Act, will indeed undermine our voting system. They will remove the responsibilities of individuals, and will instead grant additional powers to the Australian Electoral Commission, making the waters of electoral enrolment murky and vague and breeding irregularities that have the potential to be manipulated. This is not what we want to see happen to our voting system, and this is why I oppose these bills.",50
22,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," It is a great pleasure and privilege to follow the member for Longman and his outstanding contribution to this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Refendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. I congratulate him on it. As a young person in this parliamentthe youngest ever elected to federal parliament-he knows that the Labor Party's false and misleading campaign that these bills are about ensuring more young people are enrolled to vote is more about the Labor Party seeking electoral benefit rather than any detailed evidence to the contrary. It really sums up why these bills are so hideous and should be opposed by this House and by the Senate. These are bad bills and they should be opposed absolutely. We have said this time and time again, and I note the work of the member for Mackellar, the shadow spokesperson for this, and in particular Senator Scott Ryan, who has done outstanding work exposing the flaws in this legislation brought again before this parliament. The Labor Party, and their coalition partner the Greens, see this legislation as a way to obtain some sort of electoral benefit by reducing the integrity the electoral roll, which is one of the most important and fundamental elements of our democracy. We have seen this with state Labor governments in New South Wales and Victoria. The member for Casey, a Victorian, knows about this and saw it in operation. It should be noted that no matter how much they fiddle with the electoral laws, nothing will save a bad Labor government from facing the appropriate treatment by the electors. Might I add, that nothing will save Anna Bligh's government this weekend, and nor should it, when the electorate gets to speak about its performance. This is purely and simply about weakening the integrity of the roll, significantly decreasing privacy for individual electors and removing virtually all individual responsibility for electors to take care of their own enrolment. I am enjoying very much Karl Rove's book, and I enjoyed particularly the section where he recounted details of the 2000 US election, which is a very famous election where the result in Florida became absolutely vital to the result of that election. The Democrats in the United States took significant and sustained legal action questioning the integrity of the voting system. They did that because-and much as I admire the United States for their democratic principles and their commitment to freedom and their world leadership in that matter-the integrity of their electoral roll is not one of their high points. What that led to was-in this election for the presidency, the greatest prize in US politics, the leader of the free world-a month of uncertainty as the Democratic party and its candidate, Al Gore, questioned the result in Florida, which was extremely close. They took it through all the court systems that they possibly could, and the matter was not resolved until late of December 2000, a month or so after the initial election had actually taken place. Of course, there was nothing wrong with the Democrats doing that; it was completely within the US law and their system. However, it showed that when you reduce the integrity of your roll, you open it up to genuine question. This bill does that. This bill hands unelected bureaucrats the power to remove electors or change the enrolment of electors on a whim, using data sources which they describe as reliable. This is this parliament handing over to a bunch of bureaucrats the opportunity for them to change an individual's electoral information. We should be very careful if we take this step because this goes very much to the integrity of our roll. Each of us in this place relies very much on knowing that when we go into an election campaign that, in large part, the electoral roll reflects our communities, reflects who lives there and so forth. Sadly, there are always people who do not take responsibility for themselves and do not inform the Electoral Commission of their movements. There are people who forget and there can be other circumstances where people do not immediately inform the Electoral Commission, but they get time. It is not as if people are unaware of their obligations-they get told. If people are not aware of their obligations, we should certainly be educating them better. But what we should not be doing is taking out of their hands the responsibility to ensure their personal information on the electoral roll is up to date. It is their responsibility do that so they can participate in deciding who will govern their country, who will govern their state and who will sit on their council. This bill will reduce the ability of people to look after that responsibility themselves. It hands to unelected bureaucrats-people who are not responsible to this parliament and not responsible to the electorate-the ability to play around, within their own guidelines, with people's electoral information. As the member for Longman pointed out, this legislation raises all sorts of questions about people with temporary addresses or residences. As we know, there are increasing numbers of people working in fly-in fly-out industries-in the mining industry, in particular-in places like Queensland. Even in my home state, with the developments at Olympic Dam, we are seeing increasing numbers of fly-in fly-out workers. Some of these workers take the opportunity to spend their weekends back at home in Adelaide and its surrounds, flying to mine sites across the state-even across the country-to earn their money during the week. In fact, the husband of one of my staff is an engineer at a goldmine. He flies in and flies out each week. The question arises: if the Electoral Commission decides, for whatever reason, that he is no longer a permanent resident at his home address-that he is now a permanent resident at the mine site-should it change his electorate?",55
23,Mr Crean,BILLS,He would not be able to vote you out.,56
24,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"The minister is right-he would not be able to. And Mayo, as you know, is a tight marginal seat. Mr Crean interjecting",56
25,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"What he does with his vote is his decision. We are not like the to Labor Party-we do not force people to follow the ticket. We do not ask for ballots to be shown. We just let people get on and make their own decisions based on the policies put before the electorate. I am very happy for the people of Mayo to make their judgments based on what I do and put to them before the next election. I think the minister at the table knows that. I think he is just being a little frivolous, which is disappointing because he is not a minister I ever thought would be frivolous in this place. But this legislation is not frivolous. These bills are very serious. They are a very serious attack on the fundamentals of our democracy and on the integrity of the electoral roll and they are designed purely for the political benefit of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens, their coalition partner. They see the opportunity to drag in votes which they think are rightfully theirs. They base their judgment on data which suggests that people who are not enrolled would be more likely to vote for the Labor Party or, at worse, the Australian Greens, from whom the Labor Party know they will get the preferences in the end. So they are creating law to make it easier for bureaucrats to make decisions about electoral enrolment rather than ensuring that electors make those decisions. We should oppose this. These are bad bills and this is a bad direction for our country to go in. We have a tremendously successful electoral system. We are very lucky that our elections are largely free of corruption. There have been very few examples of serious matters being taken to the Court of Disputed Returns. That is something we should be very proud of. Generally we know that the winner announced on election night-there are exceptions of course and the last federal election was one of those-will indeed turn out to be the winner. In fact, following the 2007 election, I remember an American friend commenting to me that he was always taken aback at how simply a change of government occurs in Australia-how people accept the result, the verdict of the electorate, and move on. The new government come in and make their decisions-sadly, this one has made some very bad decisions and we are suffering from that now-and we accept the fact of democracy and that we put our fate in the hands of the voters. But we do so on the basis that we completely trust the integrity of the electoral roll. ",56
26,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"Let me tell you, Member for Moreton, that I will trust the voters of Queensland this Saturday. I reckon they will get it right, as Bob Hawke once said. We need to guard against moves which will weaken the integrity of the electoral roll, especially moves based on spurious reasons which, at their heart, are more about political benefit for one side or another. That is why these bills should be opposed. They should be opposed by this House and, if they get to the next house, they should be opposed there as well. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (11:43): I join with the other speakers from this side of the House in opposing the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. In following the member for Mayo, I highlight the point he made at the very beginning of his speechthat in our country we have a compulsory voting system and a compulsory enrolment system. As a corollary of that, it is the responsibility of individual citizens to be on the electoral roll from age 18 and to turn up to a polling booth on election day-or, as is increasingly the case, to a pre-poll centre in the days leading up to election day-and, at the very least, have their name crossed off the roll. It is a feature of Australian democracy and it has been for a number of decades. It is the law of the land that all eligible Australians must vote. That is not the law in a lot of other democracies, but it is here in Australia. What goes with it is that you must be on the electoral roll. It is your responsibility to be on the electoral roll when you are eligible and, when you change address, to ensure that the roll is updated. As the member for Mayo and all of the speakers on this side of the House have outlined, these bills seek to damage the integrity of the roll through an automatic update and automatic enrolment process. On the one hand, this parliament is saying to every citizen, before these bills come into law, that under the existing law you must be on the electoral roll if you are eligible and you must vote, even if that means getting your name crossed off on election day and destroying your ballot paper. You must exercise your choice. On the other hand, the parliament is saying: 'If you do not enrol we will automatically enrol you. If you do not keep your address details up to date on the electoral roll, they will be automatically updated-through some data source that the House is simply assured will be accurate.'  Mr TONY SMITH: Of course how that will work in practice is, as so many members on this side of the House have indicated, very open to question. I say to the member for Moreton that this is a serious debate. I know it is customary to interject, but we are not at two o'clock yet-it is not question time. I am glad the member for Moreton is still with us, since we are talking about elections. He was on the verge of calling a by-election. These are bad laws. They are laws which Labor think, in their heart of hearts, will favour them. They think that if they can enrol people who do not want to enrol, if they can update addresses of those who have not updated them-in other words, if they can take action on behalf of that percentage of Australians who do not want to vote-that may somehow give them electoral advantage. These are bad bills and we are opposing them here and in the other place. As our shadow minister the member for Mackellar pointed out just yesterday, these bills will compromise the integrity of the Australian electoral roll. We hope they do not pass; we suspect they will. If they do, they should not become part of the fabric of our electoral system, which has served our country so well. Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (11:58): I rise today to speak on two bills this government is introducing to amend the Electoral Act, allowing the Australian Electoral Commission to automatically update the details of an elector when they change their residential address, based on information obtained from other sources, as well as when an Australian turns 18-again, based on records obtained from other sources. According to the explanatory memorandum, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill will: … allow the Electoral Commissioner to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt and analysis of reliable and current data sources from outside the Australian Electoral Commission that indicate an elector has moved residential address; What will those reliable and current data sources be? Will they indeed be reliable or current? Enrolling to vote is a wonderful privilege afforded to all Australians. We have one of the best electoral systems in the world and one of the fairest. Walking into a polling booth on an election day certainly conjures a tremendous feeling of pride for many Australians. With the current state of affairs, many Australians wish they were exercising their vote sooner rather than later. There will be an opportunity to change this nation for the better at the next electionsmall something that residents in my electorate speak to me about on a daily basis. Residents in Macquarie are concerned about many issues, and they are particularly concerned when they have arisen because this government has failed to consult with the electorate on important issues-like the carbon tax, the mining tax, cutting the private health insurance rebate for Australians it deems too wealthy to be given a break, and the list goes on. With this legislation the government has again failed to consult with the people it will impact on, meaning that it is again dictating to the Australian public what it wants for Australia. What will this legislation achieve? We already have a system of compulsory voting. Socially we have come leaps and bounds since Federation, with every single Australian citizen being given the right to vote. It will achieve more votes for the very group of people that Australians are unhappy with: Labor and the Greens. That is all this government is concerned with-gaining votes the only way it knows how, by deciding who is and who is not on the roll based on information that may or may not be reliable or accurate. What about people's personal responsibility? I think everyday Australians know when they need to change their details. They are very capable of deciding when to fill out a form or when to contact the Electoral Commission and make the recommended changes. Clearly, this government does not concern itself with personal responsibility. It imposes responsibility on people without so much as giving them the choice or the chance to correct what may or may not happen on the electoral roll with regard to their capacity vote. The government purports that its proposed amendments to the bills will restore the integrity of the electoral roll. These amendments will do just the opposite. These amendments will mean that many Australians may not be aware that they are registered to vote or that they are no longer registered to vote. I note in the 2010 dissenting report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the committee outlined the duty of each Australian citizen when it came to voting, and I would like to highlight them now. Firstly, it is the duty of each Australian citizen to enrol to vote. Secondly, it is also the duty of each Australian citizen to maintain their enrolment at their permanent place of residence. Thirdly, Australian citizens have a duty to cast a vote when an election is called. Lastly, and most relevant to this House and the reason we are able to stand here and debate these poorly constructed amendment bills, Australian citizens have a duty to fully extend preferences to all candidates contesting election for the House of Representatives in their electorate. These duties are the cornerstone of our democratic system of parliament and governance. If we strip away these duties and responsibilities from everyday Australian citizens, we expose our system of parliamentary democracy to fraud and irregularities. These amendments contravene the very idea that is basis on which our democracy resides and, if this legislation is passed, it will be a very dark day for democracy and for this nation. The coalition takes issue with the amendments proposed by the government for several reasons. The first is something that I have already alluded to, and that is a reduction in the integrity of the electoral roll. If electors are to have their details updated automatically and without their knowledge, to it will lead to a high number of potential irregularities. It so often happens that mail is returned to my office because of incorrect details on the electoral roll. Flaws already exist in the system. I understand that a database of millions of people will not be without some flaws; I accept that. But what I do not accept is this government providing a platform for potential additional flaws to our system to take place, not to mention the potential for fraud that could result from automatic enrolment. This would not achieve anything except to give a greater power and a vague power to the Electoral Commission and allow this government to capitalise on those flaws. It is all too often the case that we see legislation that gives the government broad and vague powers and that plays to the Greens rushed through this House. It seems that this government is far too concerned with a track record of introducing as much legislation as it possibly can before Australians exercise the little power and choice they have left to vote it out at the next election. This brings me to the second matter that the coalition takes issue with regarding the government's amendment bills, and that is that the AEC is empowered with the discretion to determine what are current and reliable data sources. That a broad scope for discretion is inserted into legislation is not uncommon practice by this government. In fact, with most of the government's bills, when they are debated in this House, I and many of my colleagues on this side of the House have on a number of occasions taken issue with the vague and broad discretionary powers given to departments, to ministers and to the government. The broad discretionary powers given to this government is the reason that so many Australians are placing importance on their vote at the next election. They are unhappy about being dictated to and dealing with uncertainty. The third issue is that these amendments undermine the confidence that this government has in its own citizens. Governments should exist for the people, not in spite of the people. It seems this is the unfortunate position that the government has forced Australians into. The coalition is not in support of these changes. They are broad, they are vague and they provide the unfortunate opportunity for the system to be abused and for people to potentially front up to a polling booth to find that their name has been removed from the poll without them knowing it or that they are listed at an address where they are not residing. In view of these challenges, I do not support the bills. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (11:57): I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 seeks to amend the Electoral Act to allow the Australian Electoral Commission, AEC, to directly enrol new electors on the electoral roll when the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that an individual has been living at a particular an address for one month and is eligible to be on the electoral roll. This bill follows on from the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011, which will give the AEC the authority to change the address of electors when it believes they have changed their residential address. As with the previous bill, the coalition opposes this legislation because it will greatly reduce the integrity of the electoral roll. In 2011, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters conducted an inquiry into the 2010 federal election. One of the recommendations from the Labor and the Greens committee members was to introduce automatic enrolment. This is a process by which an individual elector is put directly onto the electoral roll-without them ever having filled out an enrolment form-based on information from other government sources. The coalition opposes this recommendation as it will greatly reduce the integrity of the electoral roll and will mean a number of electors are put on the roll without their knowledge. The bill seeks to implement this recommendation. We, on this side of the House, are not only concerned about the impact that this will have on the integrity of the roll; we also firmly believe that the responsibility to get on the roll and to protect the right to vote lies entirely with the individual. Clearly, the right to vote is one of the great things about our democracy. At every election, we ensure that the elected representatives of our councils and state and federal governments are held to account. It is the right of every Australian citizen over the age of 18 to cast a vote. One of the things I love about Australia is that voting is compulsory-you can only whinge about the results of an election if you have had your say. But that vote comes with a responsibility to register and maintain your right with the AEC. It is a precious gift given to you by the country, and all the country asks in return is that you keep us up to date with where you live. But what is a reliable source of information? We note that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census. We also note there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a simple match. In Townsville we have a highly transient population. We have the Army, the Airforce, the NavyADF. We are a university city. We are fly-in fly-out specialists. We have a great number of renters. You only have to drive the streets of Townsville every weekend and see the number of utes piled high with furniture to see how many people are changing address. It is up to the individual to make sure that their bills get changed across and that their voting records are changed across. We saw this government send cheques in the first version of the stimulus package to dead people, people living overseas and the like. Is this a reliable source? If the government cannot get it right when they are sending out free money, what hope has the Electoral Commission got of maintaining the roll without the actual person taking the responsibility to vote seriously? I heard a member opposite state that the AEC spent $36 million on advertising in the lead-up to the 2007 election, and that the AEC stated that this cost would have to be ongoing election after election. So, I am not so sure that this measure will be a costsaving measure. My question to the AEC is: how much will it cost them to maintain this roll using the new methods? What is the quantum of paying a huge number of public servants to act on tip-offs as to people's whereabouts? Will they be buying the membership lists from Video Ezy and crosscorrelating the information? Will they be standing on street corners in trench coats, under a street lamp-lit cigarette dangling from the bottom lip-saying: 'Psst. Who lives in that house and have they lived there for more than a month?' Where will this end? that Will we end up with a system where votes will be taken by electoral officials travelling from house to house saying, 'Pick a name, any name,' and moving on to the shops to finish their election while having a pie and a coke? No, the right to vote is precious and it should be treated as such. The individual must take that right seriously and when they do shift house, they should remember to update their address details with the AEC, just like they do with their bank and their insurance. It is a simple process and the work involved to keep your enrolment up to date is not onerous. We heard the member for Mayo earlier talk about the great democracy that is Australia, and that the winner of the election is normally the winner that is called on election night. The only disputed one I have heard of was the disputed election in the 1998 Mundingburra election, which caused a by-election, which of course led to the seat of Mundingburra going to the Liberal National Party coalition and toppling a government, when Frank Tanti beat Tony Mooney. That led to the Shepherdson inquiry, which led to a whole heap of electoral roll rorting by some local branch members of the ALP in Townsville. So, if we are looking for reliable information, there is probably not a good place to start. The coalition is also concerned about the difficulties experienced in New South Wales state elections. Both New South Wales and Victoria have introduced automatic enrolment at their recent state elections, which means a number of electors in these states are only enrolled for state and not for federal elections. This is due to the differences in state and federal legislation. What happens here is that, when an elector has their details changed or added to the state electoral roll in New South Wales and Victoria, they are sent an enrolment form by the AEC. The ABC's election analyst Antony Green wrote in an article on 16 July 2011 that only 64.3 per cent of those people automatically enrolled for the first time during the 2011 New South Wales state election actually turned out to vote; so 35.7 per cent did not turn out to vote or were enrolled incorrectly. Surely this would suggest that some of the information used to put new electors on the roll is unreliable. Surely, the low turnout nonparticipation could be blamed in no small part to the poor information installed in the first place. As with everything, if you put rubbish in, you get rubbish out. My niece lived with us in Townsville for a couple of years. When she moved to Townsville from Brisbane, this 19-year-old had the sense, all on her own, to change her enrolment details with the AEC. She even told me she voted for me at the last election-but we had been arguing that week so I cannot be totally sure. She has since moved back to Brisbane and, hey presto, she has updated her address details on the electoral roll all by herself. She will be voting this weekend in Brisbane to make sure that Campbell Newman gets in up there. The three electorates of Townsville, Thuringowa and Mundingburra will also have new LNP members after this weekend. Every month I send out letters of welcome to people who have enrolled in the federal seat of Herbert. All these people have done the right thing and completed the form to change their details. Many of my electorate's schools get the seniors of each year to preenrol when they are leaving school to make sure they have their right to cast a vote. In the ADF when they turn up to their new post, they have the AEC forms there ready for them. People are organised. It is not that hard to maintain your roll with the AEC. No amount of legislation will cover every consequence. No amount of legislation will make up for personal responsibility. The right to vote is a right which carries but one tiny piece of responsibility-that is, to maintain your address with the AEC. This government can go on and on about the amount of red tape we are going to put into this, the amount of things we are going to have to do, but if someone does not want to do it, they will not do it. It is a right to and vote. It is something you should follow through with. It is something very precious that has been bestowed upon the people of Australia by this government. I think it is not too hard to understand that this can be done and I therefore do not support these bills.",57
27,Mr CHESTER,BILLS," There have already been many excellent contributions this morning on these bills before the House, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. I congratulate the member for Herbert on his contribution and those who have spoken before me in this place highlighting the great value we must place on our democracy. We should never take for granted the opportunity to vote and choose who represents us in this place. This debate goes to the core of what it means to play an active role in this great democracy we have in Australia. Like many members. I get the opportunity to speak to school groups on a regular basis. When I talk to them. I often raise what I consider are core values in our community: respect and responsibility. I tell the students it is important they respect others and they should respect themselves and the skills and abilities they have within themselves. It is important they try to achieve their best and make a contribution to our great nation. When I mention responsibilities I encourage them, once they turn 18, to make sure they enrol to vote. I often refer to it. I say, 'One of the responsibilities you have as an Australian citizen is making sure that once you turn 18 you enrol to vote and have your say in the future of this great nation.' I welcome the school group that has just walked in here today and encourage them, right now, that when they get to the age of 18 they enrol to vote and come into the polling booths, when the time presents for them, and make a choice of who will represent them in their electorates. It is an important thing. It is a responsibility we should never take for granted. The member for Herbert was correct when he said that the right to vote is precious. He, like me, writes to new members of his electorate, when they change their enrolment details, and introduces himself. It is not very hard for people when they move to our electorates to change their roll status, to make sure they keep it up to date. I do not believe it too onerous to place that responsibility on our citizens, but it is something this bill seeks to change. I know it is not fashionable to be standing up in parliament or standing up in school classrooms and talking about responsibilities. We have seen a progression over many years, at state and federal level, of a nanny state approach by this government and the Greens parliamentary team. I am concerned that these bills before the House send a message from the Labor Party and the Greens that they do not trust Australian people with this core responsibility of making sure that their electoral roll details are up to date. It is a bizarre judgment to be making upon our community-that you cannot be trusted with the most basic responsibility of making sure you are enrolled to vote, that your details are updated when you move and that you exercise your rights at an election. I refer to the dissenting reports which were submitted by coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I congratulate the coalition members of that committee: the member for Mackellar who is a fierce champion of issues relating to electoral integrity, the member for Fairfax, Senator Ryan and Senator Birmingham for their contributions to the dissenting report. The key issue they raised in this report was the integrity of the roll. I am sure that even the most casual observer would understand that the integrity of the roll is very important. The importance of it is very clear to the most casual observer. The recent election is a great example of that. There was not a clear majority; there were many seats won on a wafer-thin margin. That has always been the case. In fact, the member for Hinkler was telling me just the other day that in the seven elections he has contested four of them have been won by a margin of less than 500 votes. They are very close results. No wonder the member for Hinkler is turning grey in this place. It is important in those very close results that the people in that electorate, and the broader Australian community, have confidence in the integrity of the roll. If they are to accept the result of these very close-run contests they must have confidence in the integrity of the roll. These are the key concerns that the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters raised in their dissenting report. Their concerns were that the legislation will severely damage the integrity of the electoral roll by adding new electors, who may not be entitled to vote, without their knowledge and potentially without their consent should the elector not receive the Australian Electoral Commission's notice of enrolment. The concerns about integrity in the report go on to state: 'When the responsibility for enrolling and updating individual elector details is taken from the individual and given to the AEC', as this bill will do, 'the potential for errors to occur is significant. It also opens up the roll to fraud.' The Labor and Greens members of JSCEM as well as the Australian Electoral Commission seem to consistently downplay this issue of the integrity of the electoral roll. said: It was the member for Mackellar who made this very clear and highlighted the critical importance, from a legal point of view, of the electoral roll being reliable and accurate at all times. This leads me to concern about the sources of information that are proposed for updating the roll under the government's approach in the legislation as it is presented to the House. As the dissenting report indicates, the AEC has said in its submission to the inquiry that it will use Centrelink and state government records from the Roads and Traffic Authority. As previously stated, information from Australia Post will not be used. The use of these agencies is not legislated but they are merely stated as sources the AEC considers reliable, without providing any evidence to establish the reliability of this information. The dissenting report states that in reality the AEC could use any data source it sees fit, including records from the tax office or Medicare. The coalition has previously highlighted in its dissenting reports to the JSCEM inquiries into the 2010 federal election and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 the extraordinary risk of using those agencies, given the high number of duplicate records. The coalition has great concern that individuals not entitled to vote may be added to the roll because of this bill. They go to the core of our issues in relation to the integrity of the roll. For all the reasons I previously mentioned it is clear that the first responsibility of the AEC is to uphold the integrity of the roll. But there is a concern with the direction we are seeing, through this bill, that the AEC is tending to focus now on maximising the number of people on the roll. It is a point that was raised during the inquiry process by Dr Roger Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation. In his submission he I believe part of the problem is that the presumption is that there is a desire to maximise the number of people on the rolls. I do not believe that is an appropriate objective. The notion of the vote is a right-it is an entitlement-and turning it into an obligation, which is what that entails, I just do not believe is appropriate in a democratic process. The intention should be to maximise people's opportunity to enrol and to vote, and this goes well beyond that. It is not much to expect eligible Australians to actually enrol to vote when they turn 18 and then make sure that their details are kept up to date. That is a responsibility that best rests with the individual and not with the state. During this debate we have heard a lot of discussion about what could be the motive of the government in relation to this issue: why is the government seeking to move in this direction? The government's view seems to be: 'Simply trust us. We know what is right for you. You can trust us to do the right thing.' The member for Bradfield in his contribution highlighted that those on this side of the House have every reason to question that motive-and I am not going to go through the long history he outlined-but, when it comes to manipulating the roll for political advantage, the Australian people simply have no reason to trust a government which is saying: trust us. I think there is an enormous trust deficit between the current government and the Australian people. You only need to refer to the famous quote from our current Prime Minister that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' to understand that fundamental breach of trust. The coalition has concerns, first of all, with the motives of the Labor Party and the Greens in relation to these bills before the House, but there are also concerns that it will make it more difficult to investigate and prosecute cases of alleged fraudulent voting. In the dissenting report it was highlighted by the coalition members that they had some level of disappointment about the failure of the AEC to prosecute any cases of fraudulent voting stemming from the 2007 legislation despite there being over 20,000 cases of multiple votes at that election. I would like to refer to Senator Scott Ryan's contribution in the dissenting report in which he raised a valid point about how this legislation would make it harder for the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute cases of fraudulent voting. When electors are put on the roll automatically, potentially, without their knowledge or consent, there will no longer be a signature available for the returning officer to compare it to, if an elector is making a declaration vote. Senator Ryan said: If there are cases of potential electoral fraud, that is one less piece of evidence the commission will have in its armoury. You currently have a form that you can compare signatures to if, for example, people are using declaration votes and have to sign the envelope. That will not be available under these provisions. I think these are legitimate and well-founded concerns on this side of the House about the motives of the bill put before us today and the need for these bills in the first place. I believe they are unnecessary. I think they are intrusive and have the potential to undermine the integrity of the electoral roll. As I have stated earlier, I believe it is a nanny state provision that should be resisted in this place. I think this is more about Labor and the Greens seeking to achieve some form of political advantage than actual genuine electoral reform that will boost confidence in our democracy. I believe it will have the reverse impact: it will erode confidence in the integrity of the roll. My greatest concern is that the key elements of these bills have the capacity to weaken rather than strengthen the integrity of the electoral roll. I join my colleagues in the coalition in opposing these bills. The bottom line is: it simply should not be up to the AEC to determine when a person has moved; it is up to the individual to notify the AEC, as is their duty as an Australian citizen. I do not believe that is too much of an onerous responsibility to place on the Australian people. Being an Australian citizen bestows great rights upon a person, and we all benefit from those rights that, sadly, too many Australians have fought and died for in conflicts in the history of our great nation. It also places some important responsibilities on our citizens. Our citizens are expected to uphold the laws of the land, to make a contribution in whatever way they can to our great nation. But, surely, one of these responsibilities which remains and can remain into the future is to enrol to vote and maintain the accuracy of your own address and to exercise that right and that responsibility at election time. I have great faith and every confidence and trust in the Australian people that they can exercise that responsibility into the future. I am worried this government does not believe they have that capacity. This government seems to think so little of the Australian people that they do not believe they can be trusted with even that most basic responsibility. They are taking away that responsibility, which I believe sets a very negative precedent. The level of government influence in our lives is already quite extraordinary. We are subject to a ridiculous array of restrictions on our activities under nanny state laws and regulations that send the message that people simply cannot be trusted to accept responsibility for their own actions. We in this place need to push back at every opportunity when more of these nanny state intrusive regulations are placed before us. As I have said, this is a bad move. It is unjustified and it should not be supported in this House or any other place.",62
28,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I rise to support the previous speaker. In a nutshell, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 seeks to give electoral advantage to the ALP by bringing into question the integrity of our electoral roll. It is a shameful political act which goes to the heart of our democracy. The integrity of our roll is a cornerstone to the integrity of our voting system and to the integrity which brings every member to this place, and this bill brings this into question. The sad, sad fact is that it does this for base political purposes. There has been no significant evidence put forward to show that this will have any other broader benefit other than trying to bring people onto the roll who, as previous members of the other side have said, are more than likely to vote for them. Why should it be opposed? In the 2007 and 2010 election we had serious questions raised about the integrity of the role and, in particular, about people voting more than once. I know this from having been involved in the 2007 election campaign for the seat of MCEwen. The vote was incredibly close. It had to be counted, recounted and ultimately ended up in the courts before we got a final decision on who would win the seat. During that process, examples came forward which showed some of the rorting that had taken place. In particular, there was an example of a priest from a country town who was written to by the AEC asking him why he had voted three times in the electorate MCEwen. He wrote back to the AEC and said that in fact he had not voted three times within the electorate of MCEwen because he had been interstate on election day and had voted interstate. Someone had walked into three different polling booths in that electorate and used his name to vote three times. So rorting does take place. We should be looking to strengthen the processes so that we do not see a continuation of that behaviour. Instead, sadly, what we are seeing with this bill is that process being weakened further. We have seen why this will occur. Now it is possible for people to be placed on the roll without, at a minimum, having their signature on a piece of paper. There is a deafening silence and a dearth of action taken in instances of the roll being exploited. One of the requirements that we could have that could protect the integrity of the roll-a signature-is now being weakened. That will lead, sadly, to more rorting rather than less. I think it is beholden on all of us here to say enough is enough. We have to strengthen the system that we have; we do not need to weaken it. This legislation also raises privacy concerns. We are in many ways becoming the world's greatest nanny state. This legislation takes away the responsibility of an individual to participate in the democratic process. Because we do have compulsory voting at federal elections, this legislation puts more requirements on individuals to enrol and does so with complete disregard for their privacy. It would be interesting to see, if the bill went to the Privacy Commissioner, what the commissioner's views would be on whether this process will actually benefit the privacy of individual citizens or whether it is another step in eroding it. The government is putting forward another regulation, basically forcing people onto the electoral roll. This is not something that we should do lightly, because many people take their individual privacy extremely seriously. They do not want to see their privacy diminished because a government, for their own base political purposes, wants to put forward a bill which gives the AEC powers to put people on the roll when they might be already on the roll but it is unknown to the AEC or when there might be other compelling reasons that they have chosen not to do so. The privacy aspects of automatic enrolment are something which definitely need to be taken into consideration. I now turn to the dissenting report of the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, the Hon. Alex Somlyay, Senator Scott Ryan and Senator Simon Birmingham. I would ask all members of the House, before they vote on this bill, to read this dissenting report. I think in many ways the opening paragraph sums it up. It states: Coalition Members and Senators strongly disagree with the Labor and Green members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 (i.e. automatic enrolment) be passed by the Parliament. The Coalition has long opposed moves by the Labor Party and the Greens to introduce automatic enrolment and notes that this Bill is being introduced solely to improve the electoral prospects of both Labor and the Greens. This follows similar moves by the former Labor Governments in NSW and Victoria prior to their last state elections. Sadly, summed up in one: it is being done for base political reasons. We are starting to see a systemic desire by Labor and the Greens to do this, not only federally but at the state level as well. The dissenting report goes on to say: This legislation will severely damage the integrity of the Electoral Roll by adding new electors who may not be entitled to vote without their knowledge and potentially without their consent, should the elector not receive the Australian Electoral Commission's notice of enrolment. An excellent report that in a nutshell sums up the basis of why we, on this side, are opposing this legislation. The report then goes on to outline the main reasons for dissenting. I have touched on some of these, but it is worth highlighting the issues in this excellent report. The integrity of the electoral roll is the first issue raised: It is imperative that the Roll which is used to elect our Parliamentarians is accurate and reliable, particularly in the wake of the 2010 Federal Election where no political party won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and results in a number of individual electorates came down to only a few hundred votes. As I have pointed out, I saw this first hand in the 2007 election in the seat of MCEwen, and I fully endorse this dissenting report for making that point, because it is entirely accurate and extremely worrying. Privacy concerns are also raised: Coalition Members and Senators also note the risks relating to the privacy of individual electors raised during this inquiry and the previous inquiry into the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011. Dr Roger Clarke from the Australian Privacy Foundation told the JSCEM Roundtable hearing on 29 February 2012 that he was particularly concerned about the lack of consultation about the Bill, was not aware of any privacy assessments taking place and believed that the outcome of the inquiry appeared to be predetermined Here we have someone from outside the political process sadly being able to sum up these concerns in a nutshell by saying that this inquiry and this legislation appeared to be predetermined. In many ways that says it all. The dissenting report also goes into the issue of fraudulent voting. There is already some dismay at how fraudulent voting is dealt with by the AEC. There has been a worry that no prosecutions are occurring. It seems to be a practice that you receive no more than a slap on the wrist. Yet the fundamental basis of our democracy is the fact that we have one valid vote, and that is all that we should have. The dangers associated with fraudulent voting have been brilliantly summed up in this dissenting report. The report also goes into issues regarding New South Wales, and we know the steps that the former New South Wales Labor government would go to. There is no doubt that these issues have been adequately addressed in the dissenting report as well. The report concludes: Coalition Members and Senators realise that this Bill is being introduced by Labor and the Greens solely to increase their electoral advantage, despite the severe risk it contains to the integrity of the Electoral Roll and significant concerns about individual privacy. It is a sad reflection on the other side that we are in here debating this legislation today. It shows that they will stop at nothing and that they are prepared to jeopardise the integrity of our electoral roll for their own base purposes. At some stage, those on the other side are going to have to understand that ultimately what they need to deliver for the Australian people is good policy-policy that is in their interest and in the national interest-rather than spending the whole time cooking the books to give themselves an electoral advantage. (Time expired) Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (12:35): I rise for the second time in less than 12 months to defend the integrity of our electoral roll in what is the greatest democracy on earth. I find this is one of the most important roles that we should have here as representatives of our parliament. That is why I feel compelled to stand up and speak against the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012, which we are debating today. I have said before in this House that all Australians have rights and freedoms which they can rightfully expect to have unhindered access to. These include the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion and the freedom of movement, with the right to shelter, food, health care and, of course, most important, the democratic right to vote for your elected representatives. These are rights that must be steadfastly defended at all times, and sometimes they even must be defended at the point of a gun. Once again we find ourselves in this House debating proposed legislation that is ill thought out and misguided, for in our society for every single right we have there is also a corresponding obligation. We must balance those rights. We must balance the right to vote with ensuring the integrity of our electoral system and protecting it from the risk of fraud, as this is the only way we can protect our democracy. The Electoral Act provides both a right and an obligation to all citizens and, as I have said before, for every right in our society there is an equal, corresponding obligation. Section 101 of the electoral act currently provides that there is an obligation upon all citizens who are entitled to have his or her name placed on the electoral roll to do so within 21 days, but unfortunately these bills will take away that obligation. There are a few specific reasons why these bills should be opposed. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2012 will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to automatically update details of an elector when they change their residential address based on information obtained from other sources. According to the explanatory memorandum, this bill will allow the Electoral Commissioner to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt and analysis of reliable and current data sources from outside the Australian Electoral Commission which indicate an elector has moved addresses. It simply seeks by default to introduce automatic enrolment and take away the obligation citizens have to update their address on the electoral roll. There are five specific problems that this will cause and five reasons why we should be voting against this bill. The first is that bill will greatly reduce the integrity of the electoral roll, with electors having their details updated without their knowledge, potentially leading to a higher number of irregularities. Secondly, this bill gives the AEC the discretion to determine what reliable and current data sources are. Could this be a credit card from one of the major department stores? No-one knows. This is not defined in the bill. There are many sources from which the Electoral Commission can obtain information, none of which you can be sure is correct. Thirdly, the coalition believes in personal responsibility and if electors treat their democracy with the respect it deserves, they should be in charge of enrolling and maintaining their address details so that when they change their address they do not sit back and let the government do it on their behalf. This is all about individual responsibility. Fourthly, this bill is a step towards automatic enrolment. Those who have turned 18 and become citizens should have enough respect for our democracy, our history and our traditions to know that it is their obligation. If they wish to participate in our democracy, they have to take the simple step of enrolling. Fifthly, the coalition is particularly concerned about the reliability of other data sources. As the coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters noted in July 2011 in their dissenting report: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make them fit for use in forming the electoral roll. That is exactly correct and is why the bill should be opposed. The dissenting report goes on: As outlined in the previous report into these proposals, a 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Economics, Finance and Public Administration: Numbers on the Run – Review of the ANAO Report No.37 1998-99 on the Management of Tax File Numbers found that: There were 3.2 million more Tax File Numbers than people in Australia at the last census. Given this fact, how can we rely on this data to maintain the integrity of our electoral roll? Secondly: There were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a match. Similarly, an ANAO Audit Report (No.24 2004– 05 Integrity of Medicare Enrolment Data) stated that ‘ANAO found that up to half a million Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased'. This dissenting report shows exactly why we cannot rely on the so-called 'other sources' for the Electoral Commission to take their records from. It must be the obligation of the individual citizen. The second bill is the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. Again I would like to give full reasons why this House must oppose this bill. Firstly, this bill will corrupt the integrity of the electoral roll, with electors potentially being put on the electoral roll again without their knowledge. It must be the obligation of every citizen to take that step, to fill out the AEC enrolment form to put their name on the electoral roll. That shows they are taking responsibility, and not taking that responsibility shows disrespect for our democracy. Unless people are prepared to do take those steps, people should not be allowed to vote. Secondly, as with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2012, this bill gives the AEC the discretion to determine what reliable and current data sources are. Again, there are so many data sources in our society today and we simply do not know the integrity of those data sources, but this bill will allow the AEC to use data sources to put names on the electoral roll, completely corrupting our electoral roll and therefore undermining the very principles of our democracy. Thirdly, the coalition believes in personal responsibility, that electors should be in charge of enrolling and maintaining their addresses on the electoral roll. When details change, it should be up to the individual sample citizen to show respect for our democracy and make the changes on the electoral roll rather than leaving it for the government to do it. We see so many bills go through this active House. We see a reduction of individual responsibility where roles for which citizens should be responsible are handed over to the government. This unfortunately is another of those bills and yet another reason why it should be opposed. Fourthly, the coalition is particularly concerned about the reliability of these other data sources. As the coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee On Electoral Matters emphasised in the same dissenting report, there are 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia, and there are 185,000 duplicate tax records for individuals. Fifthly, and the main reason we should be opposing these bills, is it gets back to the importance of our democracy. It gets back to making sure that individual citizens respect our democracy and that they realise that it is something that has been fought for and passed down to them by previous generations-by their forefathers. It is not something that is just handed to them on a platter. It is not to be taken for granted. If these bills are passed, that is what they will do. It will take away the obligation of the citizen to take those formal steps to enrol which have been set out and followed throughout the history of our democracy. These are bad bills. I hope that, even if there are not a few government members that would stand up and oppose it and stand up for our democracy, we will at least see some of the crossbenchers realise how bad these bills are and that they should be opposed. The cornerstone of our democracy is to protect the integrity of our electoral roll. These bills will weaken our electoral roll. They will weaken its integrity and they will weaken our democracy. That is why they should be opposed.",66
29,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. The first bill will empower the Australian Commission to modify the address of electors when it believes the elector has moved address. The second bill will empower the AEC to add individuals to the electoral roll when it is satisfied they are 18 years old, living at a particular address and entitled to vote-that is, automatic enrolment. These are bad bills. That is why the coalition opposes them both. At the heart of this legislation is a move by the Labor Party and the Greens to gain electoral advantage. The same tactic was adopted by the Labor Party in both Victoria and New South Wales, where they sought to gain electoral advantage by introducing automatic enrolment before the last state elections in each of those states. These automatic enrolments were failures. They should not be repeated at the federal level. In effect, these failures have corrupted the integrity and the reliability of the electoral roll. There could not be many more important subjects than the future integrity of the one document which is relied upon to form the federal government-to elect the legislators that shape the future of our country. This is what is at stake: the heart of our democracy. These matters have been the subject of considerable discussion by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which reported in July last year. The dissenting report-and I want to pay particular tribute to my colleagues Bronwyn Bishop, Alex Somlyay, Senator Scott Ryan and Simon Birmingham-is very instructive. Let me say what a great job our special shadow minister for state, the member for Mackellar, has done, assisted by her Senate colleagues and by Alex Somlyay, in shining a light on the weakness in this dangerous legislation. The dissenting report found that, were we to proceed to automatic entitlement, the Electoral legislation would severely damage the integrity of the electoral roll. It would have extensive privacy implications and it would undermine the fundamental notion that people need to take responsibility for ensuring that they are correctly recorded on the electoral roll. In terms of the integrity of the electoral roll, automatic enrolment opens up the real possibility of both error and fraud, As Professor Graeme Orr in his book The Law of Politics has written, the integrity of the role is paramount. He wrote: 'Like other official public registers, such as land registers, a chief feature of the electoral rolls is their finality. The purpose of a roll is to be a definitive statement of the entitlement to vote, leaving aside the provisional provisions, thus there is conclusive evidence of the entitlement to vote. Reinforcing this is the secondary rule in almost all jurisdictions that a court of disputed returns is not to inquire into the correctness of the roll.' The problem here is that the AEC has sole discretion, and the data that the AEC would seek to rely on is not clearly defined. In fact, in their submission to the committee on the second bill, the Australian Electoral Commission said: … the AEC would receive data from a third party data source, conduct a data matching process including a check of the eligibility of individuals to enrol, notify eligible individuals and, after a period of 28 days, make additions to the electoral roll and inform electors of the AEC's action. What data is deemed reliable? What restrictions are there on the type of data that could be used? What is the standard of proof that is applied in these matters? The AEC will make use of Centrelink, state government roads and traffic authority information, and even materials from Australia Post. They will, no doubt, even go to the Tax Office and other sources of sensitive information. Use of this material raises real concerns. Previous parliamentary reports have found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census; there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; and 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in the sample match. The Australian National Audit Office has also separately found that 'up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who were deceased'. The problem here is that the AEC is just trying to expand the role and the size of the roll for the sake of expanding it. In the process, they are undermining its integrity and increasing the margin for error. Dr Roger Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation said: I believe part of the problem is … that there is a desire to maximise the number of people on the rolls. I do not believe that is an appropriate objective. … The intention should be to maximise people's opportunity to enrol and to vote, and goes well beyond that. Indeed, in regard to the privacy implications of the legislation before us, Dr Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation has also raised real issues about publishing people's details on the electoral roll without their knowledge or approval and, importantly, without their having the opportunity to register as a silent elector. This is a particular concern for people who have been victims of domestic violence or who would like their addresses suppressed for a range of safety issues. At a hearing in February this year Dr Clarke said of this legislation: We are not aware of any risk assessment having been performed. We were not aware of any privacy impact assessment having been performed. This is really inexplicable, and it reeks of political advantage and political opportunism on the part of the Labor Party and their coconspirators in this legislation, the Greens. I have mentioned the experience in New South Wales and Victoria. What is instructive about the experience in New South Wales is that the people who had the automatic enrolment did not turn out in the numbers expected. In fact, only 64.3 per cent of these first-time new enrolments turned out to vote. Compare this to the overall turnout of 92.3 per cent for the 2011 New South Wales state election. This raises serious issues about the integrity of this automatic enrolment process and about the potential for fraud. In conclusion, these are bad bills. These bills are motivated by an opportunistic desire for political advantage. There has not been proper and rigorous assessment. In fact, we have heard from experts, from parliament committees and elsewhere about the dangers involved. These bills, and the subsequent changes, will compromise the integrity of the Australian Electoral Act. They will raise this significant privacy issues that will affect all Australians. What is more, they will undermine the personal responsibility that is incumbent on individuals in Australia when they reach voting age to take the opportunity to vote in Australia for their political representatives. There are not many more important subjects than this. I implore all the Independents, who will not have the same political motivations as those opposite, to take this opportunity to vote against this legislation and ensure that the integrity Australian electoral roll is maintained.",71
30,Ms ODWYER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Participation) Bill 2012 out of a great concern for the implications that these two bills will have for Australian democracy. Australia is one of the world's oldest democracies. We have been a democracy since our inception. At the very heart of our democracy lies the fact that each Australian citizen has the franchise; the ability to put themselves on the electoral roll so that they can vote for their representative in this place and in the Australian Senate. Under existing legislation it is very clear who is currently able to put themselves on the Australian electoral roll: anybody who is over 18 years of age and who is an Australian citizen, a British subject and or on the Commonwealth electoral roll as at 25 January 1984. This is pretty clear. More than this, in advance of somebody turning 18, at the age of 16, a citizen of this country who meets the criteria can in advance put themselves down on the electoral roll so that when they reach their 18th birthday they will automatically become entitled to vote, should an election be called. These two bills, however, seek to undermine the way people are put onto the Australian electoral roll. It is, according to this government, a necessary evil. They say that so many people are disenfranchised under the existing system. They say that many young people, in particular, are disenfranchised because they do not have time to put themselves on the electoral roll. But of course any basic examination of these facts demonstrates the paucity of the government's argument and invites anybody who understands this issue to ask themselves the question: what is the of the real motivation for this government in seeking to make a change to how citizens are put onto the electoral roll? Already, under the existing rolls-and I quote from the AEC website: The electoral roll is continuously updated, Elector however, following the issue of the 'writ' for an election, which sets the election timetable, the roll for the election is closed. The roll for the election closes at 8pm local time on the third working day after the writ is issued and cannot be updated after that date. So it is very clear that when an election is announced-when the writs are issuedpeople most certainly do have the ability to put themselves on the electoral roll. Whether they be young or old, they themselves can go to the AEC and put themselves on the electoral roll so that they may vote in that election for their representative. Instead, the government is seeking to automatically put a number of people onto the electoral roll. It is seeking to do this through data matching. Without anyone's consent or permission, this government would put people onto the electoral roll or make changes to an entry for an existing person on the electoral roll as to where they are entitled to vote. This would be the result of the Australian Electoral Commission, in and of itself, determining how that person is to appear on the electoral roll. This concerns us greatly, because it should be for the individual themselves to go through all the proper and correct processes to put themself on the electoral roll. Only in this way can we be assured of the integrity of the electoral role, that there are proper checks and balances-that people are in fact entitled to be on the electoral roll and are enrolling in the correct place and not seeking to skew the electoral roll in any way. This government would rather see the Australian Electoral Commission make a determination as to who should be on the roll and how they should be on it. This concerns us because the Australian Electoral Commission will be forced to rely upon information that is provided to it by third parties that it determines are of sufficient quality to be allowed to make that determination, yet there are no criteria on which this is based. I would like to refer to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. My colleagues Bronwyn Bishop, Senator Scott Ryan, Alex Somlyay and Senator Simon Birmingham wrote such a stellar report pointing out a number of the flaws with this legislation. Bronwyn Bishop spoke with the AEC and asked a very pertinent question about the process that went to the issue of the integrity of the roll: I want to go back to the process. Supposing you have decided, because of your checking with your material, that Mrs Bloggs has actually moved from her previous address. Under this legislation, you would write to the new address and say, 'We have changed you', because you are satisfied that she has moved. Mr Killesteyn replied: We would not say that we have changed it; we would write to the individual and say, 'We have information which leads us to believe that you are at this address. You have 28 days to advise us whether that is not the case.' If there were no response, then we would change the address at that point. That is a great concern. You could have a situation in which somebody has provided their address details to one of these thirdparty organisations or government agencies and the AEC decides to write to a new address, which could in fact be a holiday home that is frequented only on occasion. As a result of this, someone's electoral enrolment could be radically changed. The enfranchisement of that person to vote for the individual or representative in the electorate in which they live would in fact be changed, and there are no adequate checks and balances in order to deal with this. I think this is a very critical point, and it goes to just how flawed this legislation actually is. When you look at it even more closely you can see that there are some significant flaws in the way in which the Australian Electoral Commission will go about supposedly matching up data. They are going to rely, as I said before, on third-party sources. I quote again from the dissenting report, which refers to another dissenting report: In their dissenting report in July 2011 to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' investigation into the 2010 Federal Election, Coalition members of JSCEM noted the risks of using external data sources such as the ATO, Medicare or other Government agencies to update elector details: It then quoted from that dissenting report: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make them fit for use in forming the electoral roll. As outlined in the previous report into these proposals, a 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration: Numbers on the Run – Review of the ANAO Report No.37 1998-99 on the Management of Tax File Numbers, found that: There were 3.2 million more Tax File Numbers than people in Australia at the last census; There were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. Similarly, an ANAO Audit Report (No.24 2004– 05 Integrity of Medicare Enrolment Data)stated that ‘ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased' So there is no level of comfort here that the records that are supposed to be data matched are in fact accurate themselves. Yet this is the information that the Australian Electoral Commission will rely on in order to change the electoral roll. We think this goes to the very heart of the integrity of the electoral roll and it is incredibly flawed and dangerous for our democracy. Moreover, the third-party sources are going to be entirely at the discretion of the Electoral Commissioner and can be changed at any time. This also concerns us because, while the ATO have supposedly been ruled out, now this could in fact change and it is of the initiative of the Electoral Commissioner to determine what may or may not be appropriate. There are no guarantees. So much is unknown. Again, as can be seen from my previous statement about previous reports, this is clearly a government agenda to change the electoral roll. You have to ask yourself the question why-why are they seeking to do this? The only response you can give to that question is that the government believes it can seek an electoral advantage by changing the electoral roll, which is why it has been so committed to try and achieve this. But there are other significant concerns. Privacy, of course, is one of them. Dr Roger Clarke from the Australian Privacy Foundation gave very strong evidence to the JSCEM, stating that there were concerns regarding the matching of data, particularly in light of the fact that there may be a number of people who do not wish that data to find its way onto the electoral roll. We hear of many awful instances of domestic violence, of stalking, whether that be cyberstalking or physically stalking a victim. We know that there are a number of people for a variety of reasons who would not wish to appear on the electoral roll, for reasons of safety and the safety of their family. Yet under these changes put forward by the government we would see circumstances where these people are automatically placed onto the electoral roll without any consent, without any checking, which could pose a grave risk to them. This concerns us, and again there is no sufficient response from the government to give us any comfort that they have considered these most serious issues. There should be an incredibly high burden of proof. There should be some incredible harm that is occurring for the government to make such serious changes to the electoral roll. Yet we do not hear any such evidence from the government-far from it. In fact, the evidence that has been heard by the committee, not only in the most recent inquiry but in the inquiries before it, has been that we do have a strong electoral roll now. It works well and it balances many competing interests, and it is the best way to ensure the enfranchisement of citizens of this country. The potential for fraud and the potential for error are very significant if these changes are made. I have mentioned privacy breaches. We do not support these bills. (Time expired)",73
31,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the cognate debate of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. Just as we have seen on several occasions in this place, these bills may have harmlesssounding names but they represent a dangerous step in our nation's democracy. As a result I speak in strong opposition to these bills before the House today. In brief, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 will give the Australian Electoral Commission the ability to change the address of electors when the AEC believes that the elector has moved addresses. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 will give the Australian Electoral Commission the ability to add individuals to the electoral roll when they believe they are 18 years of age, living at a particular address and entitled to vote. This is known as automatic enrolment. These bills do not carry the civic responsibility that the government spin doctors may try to attach to them. They are plainly and simply an attempt by the Labor Party-Greens alliance to gain an electoral advantage. This legislation will severely damage the integrity of our nation's electoral roll, where a centralised and unelected government funded bureaucracy can add new electors and change the enrolled address of new electors without the individual's knowledge and potentially without their consent. We are a nation that embraces the idea of individual responsibility. It is an elector's individual responsibility to enrol vote and to inform the Australian Electoral Commission if they change address. It is also an elector's responsibility to vote at an election. These are pretty responsibilities and they should not become yet more victims of state intervention. This point has been made time and again by my colleagues since the formation of the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2007 election. My colleagues have also noted the extensive implications for issues of privacy that this legislation raises. Dr Roger Clarke of the Australia Privacy Foundation provided the joint standing committee with some valuable insights regarding the individual privacy concerns that this legislation raises. He was particularly concerned about the lack of consultation about the legislation, and he said that he was not aware of any privacy assessments taking place and that the outcome of the inquiry appeared to have been predetermined. He said: We are not aware of any risk assessment having been performed. We were not aware of any privacy impact assessment having been performed. We were not aware of consultation processed which the Electoral Commissioner has just referred to. We are not aware of the APF or any of the civil liberties organisations being involved in any of those. We have checked back through our records and confined our evidence of that in our own records. … … … Finally, the outcome of the inquiry does appear to be predetermined. The inquiries being held by the same committee came forward with a related proposal, and when we sought further time to address this matter we were told that, 'The committee was merely focusing on the adequacy of the bill in achieving its policy objectives.' This sounds rather less than substantive consideration of the matter. It must be of very real concern to all individuals if their personal details are to published on the Commonwealth electoral roll without their knowledge and without them being given the opportunity to register as a silent elector. This would cause alarm in simple particular for people who are victims of domestic violence, for people involved in custody disputes and for people who, for any other reason, wish their name to be suppressed. These bills pose some genuine dangers to people who are most at risk in our society, and their needs and protection should far supersede the stated motivations of these bills. The process of automatic enrolment will put into question the integrity of the electoral roll. There are few documents which we have greater dependence on for their integrity to ensure an effective and representative democracy. When a centralised system has authority over an individual's listing on the electoral roll, we are opening our system up to error and the possibility of fraud. As we have seen in times past, the Labor Party are capable of very creative strategies when faced with a campaign to hold onto power. Allowing automatic enrolment is opening a Pandora's Box that may commence with good intentions but can quickly become corrupted. A procedure where the Australian Electoral Commission relies on notification received in reply to their correspondence is a very dangerous way to manage an electoral roll. The chief electoral commissioner of New South Wales has admitted that the response rate is about 20 per cent. This means that on average 80 per cent of people whom the AEC writes to to inform of a change to their enrolment will not confirm their receipt or understanding of this change. Progressively, the integrity of the electoral roll will become diminished as a result of these bills. In the coalition's dissenting report on these bills, the shadow minister quoted Professor Graeme Orr's book The Law of Politics. I repeat the words of the shadow minister: … Mr Orr writes: 'Like other official public registers, such as land registers, a chief feature electoral rolls is their finality. The purpose of a roll is to be a definitive statement of the entitlement to vote'-leaving aside the provisional provisions-'Thus there is a rule that the roll is conclusive evidence of the entitlement to vote. Reinforcing this is the secondary rule in almost all jurisdictions that a court of disputed returns is not to inquire into the correctness roll. In his chapter 'Enrolment and the Roll', Professor Orr also cites the case of Perkins and Cusack: 'The federal Court of Disputed Returns faced a petition claiming that many people were on the roll for the seat of Eden Monaro whose real place of living was outside the electorate. Even though it was alleged that some enrolled electors lived at addresses that lay outside the divisional boundaries, Justice Starke refused to allow any evidence to be tendered that might contradict the face of the roll.' One of the curious aspects to this bill, which should raise many an eyebrow around the nation, is that it is even more extreme than the recommendation made by Labor and the Greens in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election. In this inquiry, Labor and Greens members recommended that the sources of data used by the Australian Electoral Commission to automatically enrol electors should be subject to disallowance by parliament, yet these bills provide sole discretion to the Australian Electoral Commission. To quote from this report: The Committee recommends that, wherever appropriate, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 should be amended to allow the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to directly enrol eligible electors on the basis of data or information provided by an elector or electors to an agency approved by the AEC, as an agency which performs adequate proof of identity checks, where that information is subsequently provided by that agency to the AEC for the of purposes of updating the electoral roll. Approval of such agencies by the AEC should be made by disallowable instrument. Whilst I have a lot of faith in the Electoral Commission and respect for the impartiality of the work that they do, it sets a very dangerous standard for an unknown future of the when an unelected bureaucracy has this kind of power. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that under these bills they will list any individual on the electoral roll if they believe the individual is eligible after consulting various data sources. These bills do not specify what data sources are required or will be considered reliable, nor are there any restrictions placed on which data sources the AEC can use to enrol an elector. There is no provision in these bills to specify the standard of proof the Electoral Commission needs to enrol an elector. These judgements and decisions fall far outside the scope and jurisdiction of the Australian Electoral Commission. The first obligation of the Electoral Commission is to maintain and improve the integrity of the electoral roll. Instead, these bills will focus their attention on maximising the number of people on the electoral roll at the expense of that obligation. Dr Roger Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation told the committee on 29 February 2012 that the intention of the AEC should be to maximise the opportunity for people to enrol, not to do it on their behalf. He said: I believe part of the problem is that the presumption is that there is a desire to maximise the number of people on the rolls. I do not believe that is an appropriate objective. The notion of the vote is a right-it is an entitlement-and turning it into an obligation, which is what that entails, I just do not believe is appropriate in a democratic process. The intention should be to maximise people's opportunity to enrol and to vote, and this goes well beyond that. In the dissenting report, my colleagues made clear our concern about the risk of duplicate records as data is sourced from organisations as varied as the ATO, Medicare, roads authorities and Centrelink. The report stated: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make them fit for use in forming the electoral roll. A previous report found:  There were 3.2 million more Tax File Numbers than people in Australia at the last census;  There were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. Similarly, an ANAO audit report stated: ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. There are also serious concerns that, as a result of these bills, individuals not entitled to vote will be enrolled. There is no requirement in these bills for the Electoral Commission to check whether a person is over 18 years of age or an Australian citizen before they are added to the electoral roll. For these reasons, many constituents may well ask why these bills are being introduced into this House. The answer is clearly that the Labor-Greens alliance has determined that it will be the recipient of an electoral advantage. Any move that threatens the integrity of our electoral roll and therefore tarnishes our democracy should be rejected by this parliament. The responsibility of enrolment should remain with the individual Australian citizen and not be given to a centralised government bureaucracy.",75
32,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 questions the integrity of the electoral roll. Surely this goes to the essence, the very core, of what we are about here in this parliament and who we represent. This bill could potentially result in electors being put on the electoral roll without their knowledge. The number of irregularities this could lead to boggles the mind. This bill, as with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011, gives the Australian Electoral Commission the discretion to decide what are 'reliable and current data sources' from which information about electoral addresses is able to be obtained. This is way beyond the capability of the Australian Electoral Commission, as sound an organisation as it is. The onus and responsibility ought to be on individual electors to supply accurate details about their enrolment and to update those details when they move or when their situation changes. The coalition is a big believer in personal responsibility. People need to take responsibility for their own actions. We should not be taking control out of the electors' hands. We should not be taking their responsibility to choose to enrol away. This bill will reduce the responsibility of people to ensure that they are looking after themselves. It raises questions about temporary residents and people in fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out situations. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, inquiring at present into fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out arrangements and the working practices of people in regional Australia. We have heard evidence from people in mining and other communities in regional Australia. It was very interesting to go to Moranbah in Queensland recently to hear about the difficulties that people in fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out work arrangements have with enrolling and with voting. Some of them think the onus is on the mining company to provide that sort of information; others think it is their own responsibility. There are all sorts of difficulties around happens when voting is held-or when the government wishes to conduct its census, which occurs on a Tuesday night. If we cannot get it right for those people, how can we expect this bill to get it right if it is enacted? Labor and the Greens are hoping that with these bills they will gain more votes, and the member for Bennelong made that point in his speech just a few moments ago. That is the core of these bills: Labor and the Greens, who are running Labor, are hoping that they will get more votes. At present, we have a tremendously successful electoral system, but it still has its flaws. Prior to when I ran for parliament in the August 2010 election, we sent out direct mail to people who we thought were at their right addresses in the electorate of Riverina, and it cost quite of money. But, prior to and after the election, boxes upon boxes of mail came back which had been incorrectly addressed, and I am still getting them. Now and again, I still get one or two of these letters back in the mail with 'incorrect address'. Where do you think we got the information on these supposed voters in the Riverina? It came from the Australian Electoral Commission, so their records are not always entirely accurate. Certainly they do a great job. We all in this House recognise the wonderful but difficult role they have, but with modern technology that role sometimes becomes even more onerous. Whilst they try to do the job as accurately as they can, the role does have its flaws and irregularities. If these bills become law, they will create even more hassles. I hate to think of the number of boxes of wrongly addressed mail I will receive when I next run for parliament if these bills are passed. Last time, I actually had an Australia Post truck roll up in my front driveway to hand them back to me. There were five or six boxes, what which I took to the Australian Electoral Commission in Narrandera, which is in the heart of the Riverina. They were able to follow them up to see why they were incorrectly addressed, to cross-reference them with the records of addresses that those voters had given to the Australian Electoral Commission but which obviously had not been updated. These bills seek to damage the integrity of the electoral roll, as I said. It is the law that you should be on the roll if you are eligible and over the age of 18. The member for Mackellar pointed out that these bills will compromise the integrity of the Australian electoral roll. As with all matters procedural that the member for Mackellar raises in this House, she is correct once again. We hope they will not pass but we suspect that they a lot will. Information will be updated from sources such as Centrelink and the maritime and roads authority. Coalition members and senators strongly disagree with Labor and Greens members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012-that is, automatic enrolment-be passed by this parliament. The coalition has for a long time opposed moves by the Labor Party and the Greens, to whom they are beholden, to introduce automatic enrolment and notes that these bills are being introduced solely to improve the electoral prospects of both Labor and the Greens-I hope from experience of this parliament that Labor actually puts the Greens last on their voting tickets at the next election, and I hope every member of parliament does the same; I know I did in the Riverina in the 2010 election-following similar moves by former Labor governments in New South Wales and Victoria prior to their last state elections. It is interesting to note that both of those New South Wales and Victorian governments were indeed Labor and that now both sit very much where they belong, on the opposition benches. The coalition also notes the extensive privacy implications that this legislation raises which, unfortunately, have been ignored by both the Labor Party and the Greens. The coalition has very real and genuine concerns about electors having their details published on the electoral roll without their knowledge and without the opportunity to apply for silent elector status. Can you just imagine the confusion that will surround the voting process when people who do not even know that they are on the roll all of a sudden start getting fines in the mail after an election or when voting material is sent to the wrong places if this bill goes through? That is exactly what will happen. The coalition has great concerns that individuals not entitled to vote may be added to the roll because of this bill. None of us in this place should want that. Coalition members and senators are extremely disappointed with the Australian Electoral Commission's attitude to fraudulent voting and have consistently noted the AEC's failure to prosecute any cases of fraudulent voting, despite there having been more than 20,633 multiple votes at the 2007 election. Mr Lyons interjecting",78
33,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"I can hear the member for Bass interjecting there. I am not quite sure what he said but I am sure that he, like all of us in this place, would be concerned about fraudulent voting. I did say that the AEC do a marvellous job, and they do. It is a very difficult and onerous job, particularly in these days of technology, to make sure that the electoral roll is as good as it can be, but these bills are not providing that. I am sure that the member for Bass would not want people fraudulently voting. I am sure that people in Bass would not be fraudulently voting but, unfortunately, they are in other areas of Australia because there were 20,633 multiple votes at the 2007 election. Goodness knows how many there were at the 2010 election. At present, an elector must fill out an enrolment form to be added to the electoral roll, and that is the way it should be. However, if they are automatically enrolled, there will be no specific record that refers to how they were enrolled, why they were enrolled or, indeed, who was enrolled in the first place. On 29 February 2012, Senator Scott Ryan raised a valid point about how this legislation will make it more difficult for the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute cases of fraudulent voting. When electors are put on the roll automatically, potentially without their knowledge or consent, there will no longer be a signature available for the returning officer to compare when an elector is making a declaration vote. That is just a disgrace. If you go into a shop and you use your credit card for a purchase of $10 or more, a trifling amount, you have to have your signature on the back of your credit card verified to make sure that you can take that purchase, but, if these bills come into place, people whose signature will not be able to be verified will be on the electoral roll and they will not even know they are on the electoral roll. How will they know next time that they ought to be voting for the National Party or indeed-as the member for Dawson joins me-the Liberal National Party in Queensland? It just beggars belief. Senator Ryan noted that this will be one less piece of evidence that the Director of Public Prosecutions will have available if they are attempting to prosecute a case of fraudulent voting. It is interesting to note Senator Ryan's comments there: We currently have a signature on a form with an enrolment. We have had a number of discussions in this committee and the Senate committee the AEC comes before in estimates about the difficulty proving certain electoral offences and the burden of evidence required for the DPP to take action. I am concerned that, if we move to what I am going to continue to call automatic enrolment-simply because I think it is automatic in the sense that it does not require action elector-we are going to lack that signature from a voter. That worried me. If there are cases of potential electoral fraud, that is one less evidence the commission will have in its armoury. You currently have a form that you can compare signatures to if, for example, people are using declaration votes and have to sign the envelope. That will not be available under these provisions. That is a damning indictment of these bills, and truer words could not be said. The previous New South Wales Labor government, under Premier Keneally, introduced automatic enrolment prior to the March 2011 state election, and the result was that a large number of electors automatically added to that state's electoral roll failed to turn up-that is right; they failed to turn up-to vote at the 2011 election. I wonder why that is? I wonder why those people failed to turn up? I will tell you why they failed to turn up: because they did not know they had to. They did not know that they were on the electoral roll. They could have turned up and they could have even given the coalition more votes than we received, and we could have had more members in parliament, and we could have jettisoned Labor further to where they belonged in that particular election, because we had had 16 years of the worse state Labor government that New South Wales had ever had to endure. You could say it was 16 years of hard Labor! Back to the bills in question: coalition members and senators realise that these bills are being introduced by Labor and the Greens solely to increase their electoral advantage-shame on them-despite the severe risk they pose to the integrity of the electoral roll and the significant concerns about individual privacy. We hear so often from those opposite about privacy issues and from an how it is important to have privacy absolutely paramount in today's society. Indeed, we do need to have some of those piece of privacy issues at the forefront of any legislation that we bring before this House. As such, coalition members and senators believe that this legislation should be rejected by the lower house, and hopefully it will not even make it to the Senate, in order for the responsibility of enrolling to remain with individual Australian citizens and not be given to the bureaucracy. We have enough bureaucracy. We have enough red tape being foisted on us by this Labor Kristina government. We do not need any more. When the coalition were in office, we had to remove prisoners from eligibility to vote, but the Labor Party changed that too. As I say, we should reject these bills out of hand, and commend to the House that we do that.",80
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Before I call the member for Aston, I remind people about putting things on desks-so it is better on chairs.",82
35,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," Australia is a truly great democracy. We are indeed one of the great democracies of the world, the longest continuous democracy on the planet despite our relatively short history as a nation. We have never had a coup. We have never had a revolution. When we have elections at the state and federal level they are abided by. People go and cast their vote peacefully, generally without interruption. The ballot is cast, the votes are counted and the decision is made, and people adhere to that decision. In fact, I often pose a question to members of school communities when I am speaking in their civics and citizenship classes. I ask: 'What normally happens after we have had an election and the government has lost the election? What normally happens the next day?' They look at me and scratch their heads and wonder what I am talking about, but of course the answer is that the next day after a government has lost an election, just like the Howard government did in 2007 when they lost to Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party, you go into your office and you pack up your office quietly. You go to your files and you shred some of your files, you tidy it up and you leave very peacefully. And you hand over the keys to what had previously been the opposition. That is what happens. It is a remarkable thing about democracies that this occurs. You do not need the police to come in. You do not need the military to come into assess that or ask one party to leave and to hand the keys over to another party. No, it is all peacefully done, and enormous power is transferred from one I group of people to another on the basis of an election. The reason that that can occur is that we have integrity in the voting system. Both sides of this House and the Australian public know there is integrity in the voting system because we know that there is a system whereby people have to enrol to vote and that there is integrity in that process and we know that there is integrity in the process where the roll is marked off, where the votes are counted and where there is scrutineering all through the process. I am deeply worried about the bills before us, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012, because I think they will damage this integrity. That is my primary concern in relation to this legislation, because this legislation enables the Australian Electoral Commission to use a variety of sources of information-which are unspecified to date-to update the electoral roll, whereas presently the system is that an individual must go and enrol to vote and must go and update that enrolment record if he or she has changed their circumstances, such as by changing address. We on this side of the House are concerned that the system which is proposed here by the government and is outlined in this legislation will lead to a number of negative consequences.",82
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," It being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA World Down Syndrome Day",82
37,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today is World Down Syndrome Day and I would like to commend a group of parents in my electorate who have dedicated their lives to supporting families living with Down syndrome in Macarthur. The Right Start Foundation is committed to raising awareness about Down syndrome and giving their children the best chance in life. The main objective of this group is to establish Australia's first Down-syndrome-specific centre in Macarthur to ensure children and families receive all the therapies and support they need for the right start in life. I have worked with this group on many occasions to help raise awareness and funds for their cause. They are a wonderful group of parents who want only the best for their children and work tirelessly to achieve this despite the tough challenges they face on a day-today basis. I have also spent time with their beautiful children, who are some of the most courageous, inspiring and amazing children in my electorate: Jake Graban, Talara Gray, Claire Robinson, Ash Longbottom, Brodie Ellul, James Pennock, Aiden Puttock, Joshua Richardson, Joshua Batten, Harrison Golden, Maia Careres, Olivia Montgomery and Emily Laws. They all live with Down syndrome and, together with their parents, they are bringing support, hope and joy to the lives of other families living with the condition in Macarthur. As we celebrate World Down Syndrome Day today, I hope that we, as leaders of our communities, can show our support to all families living with Down syndrome. I give special praise to the members of the Right Start Foundation who work so hard to make this world a better place for their beautiful children. Kingston Electorate: Hackham West School",83
38,Ms RISHWORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to congratulate the Hackham West R-7 School in my electorate for their commitment to helping people with leukaemia through the World's Greatest Shave. This was brought to my attention by a parent at the school, John Creedon, and I particularly mention Mr James Reid's year 6/7 class at Hackham West R-7 School who raised close to $3,000 for the Leukaemia Foundation, more than doubling their original goal of $1,000. All the students in the 6/7 class either coloured their hair or shaved their hair, with some of the teachers and parents also getting into the spirit. Mr Reid said, 'I am immensely proud of the group of kids who are in the area of disadvantage having big hearts to raise money for people in great need.' I pay special tribute to one of the girls, Emily, who was especially brave for shaving off her very long hair to raise money. Mr Reid's year is one of many teams around Australia who are doing fantastic work to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation. The World's Greatest Shave raises funds for the Leukaemia Foundation's important work providing free and practical emotional support. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Reid who is an example of a teacher who puts in great effort for his class, not just in the teaching but also in ensuring that kids have an understanding of what it is to contribute to society. So congratulations to all the kids in the 6/7 class at Hackham West R-7 School, Mr Reid, Mr Creedon and everyone involved. Rabbit Plague",83
39,Mr RAMSEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," As this is the second last sitting day before Easter, I take this opportunity not only to wish members a safe, happy and meaningful Easter but to raise an important and reemerging threat to our natural environment. Along with Easter eggs, the Easter bunny has become a commercial symbol of Easter. In an effort to raise public awareness and funds to support the fight against this unwanted and destructive pest, the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia, in association with the iconic Adelaide company Chocolates, has promoted the Easter bilby as a replacement for the Easter bunny. Within 70 years of their introduction to Australia, rabbits had colonised two-thirds of the continent. They have unimaginable environmental Myxomatosis, introduced in the 1950s, gave us our first successful biological control and lifted profitability in the wool and meat industry by about $1 billion a year in current terms. Unfortunately, the rabbits have become increasingly resistant to the virus and in 1995 the calicivirus was released as our second biological control, reducing rabbits to a historically low level for over 10 years. The agricultural benefits of calicivirus had been valued at over $2 billion, but numbers are rebuilding and the next tool of control must be found quickly. In the medium to long term, rabbits will decimate the Australian landscape, including local extinction of plant species, irreversible changes in vegetation across vast areas of Australia and a loss of fauna dependent on those vegetation communities. Members will find an eastern bilby, courtesy of the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia and Haigh's Chocolates, in their places. I ask them to enjoy and consider what they can do to help Australia with this four-legged pest. France: Toulouse Tragedy",83
40,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I mourn the deaths in Toulouse, France of four innocent people-Rabbi Jonathan Sandler, his daughter Gabrielle Sandler, age 4, Arieh Sandler, age 5, and Miriam Monsonego, the daughter of the principal of the school in Toulouse. The tragedy of what has happened in France should be clear to all people. Three innocent children were gunned down, including the daughter of the principal, who was grabbed by the head by this monster and Haigh's shot in the head as she reached the door of the school room. This is one of the worse international incidents I have heard of. I hope the government of France is able to catch the caused criminal who apparently is responsible for damage. the murder of three Muslim soldiers in the French army. This is an outrage. One of the witnesses said, 'Now, when I close my eyes, I can see their bodies on the ground in front of me.' Their mother has lost her husband and her two children and is alone now with a 10-month-old baby. Can you imagine what it is like for her? I am sure I send messages of condolence and grief from many people in this House to the bereaved families in France. Harmony Day 2012",84
41,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I also add my condolences. March 21 is Harmony Day, a day when all Australians celebrate our cultural diversity, and it is also the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In 2012, we celebrate the important role that sport plays in bringing Australians from all walks of life together to share in a common passion, with the key messages of play, engage and inspire. The aim of Harmony Day 2012 is to encourage everyone regardless of background to participate in sporting activity, to increase understanding and to be inspired or to inspire others. Harmony Day encourages and embraces community participation, inclusiveness and respect. Since 1999, when the Howard government initiated the Living in Harmony program, more than 25,000 Harmony Day events have been staged in childcare centres, schools, community groups, churches, businesses and federal, state and local government agencies. The event is growing in popularity and participation. Last year nearly 6,500 events were registered. In schools throughout the country it provides a great opportunity for students to learn not only that they share common ground with other cultures but also that our differences make Australia a very special place to live. I was very pleased to attend and address the Harmony Day Festival opening on Saturday at Multicap in Eight Mile Plains. I thank Global United Ethnics, particularly their president, Shan Ju Lin, for their invitation to this event. (Time expired) Petition: Sri Lanka",84
42,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to table a petition on the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens of Australia draws the attention of the house to the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Since independence the minority rights enshrined in the constitution has been systematically eroded. State sponsored colonisation, periodical pogroms and policies of discrimination resulted Tamils demanding federal system of government through civil disobedience campaigns. They were met with force. Unable to tolerate this tyranny Tamil Youth took up arms. The Government unleashed a violent response and indiscriminately killed Tamil Civilians. Report of the UN Secretary-General's (UNSG) Panel of Experts revealed credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity which have been committed. The government's LLRC report was rejected by many in the International Community. The ongoing exodus of Tamil asylum seekers demands an examination of the root causes of this conflict. As a country that upholds the rule of law and principles of human rights and as the chair of the Commonwealth organisation, Australia could play a significant role in finding a solution to this conflict. We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to recommend to the Australian government to: (a) Demand the UNSG to implement the main recommendations of the panel he established - to establish an independent, international Mechanism to monitor SL's domestic accountability process and to conduct investigations independently into the alleged violations and (b) Support publicly the US led initiative at the current 19th session of the UNHRC. from 2,550 citizens Petition received.",85
43,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I could not agree more with this petition. The world is crying out for justice for the Tamil people. (Time expired) Hall, Mr Lincoln, OAM",85
44,Mr HOCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I inform the House that, at the age of 56, Lincoln Hall passed away this morning from mesothelioma. Lincoln Hall was one of Australia's foremost mountaineers and he was a friend. He was left to die at that top of Mount Everest in 2006 after having summitted, something he had sought all his life to achieve. As I joked to him, no human being in the history of the Earth has ever in slept at a higher point and survived than did Lincoln. Lincoln was a formidable man and he has a magnificent wife and family. Michael Dillon, who came up Mount Kilimanjaro with us as a film man, was the one who, back in 2006, rang Barbara to tell her that her husband had died at the top of Mount Everest. No wife should have to be informed on two separate occasions that her husband has died. The big C wins again. Even someone with his fortitude and courage was unable to beat cancer. It is for all of us to give our condolences to Dylan, Dorje and Barbara and to remember that the hand of God cannot be defied again and again. Harmony Day 2012 Central Coast Mariners",85
45,Ms ONEILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today is Harmony Day and the theme of this year's celebration focuses on the positive influence that sport has in our multicultural nation. So I am delighted to rise today to recognise the efforts of Australia's greatest sporting team in promoting our great multicultural society. I am talking of course about the Central Coast Mariners. The Mariners have agreed to wear the Harmony Day logo on their strip when they take to the field tonight in their Asian Champions League game at Bluetongue Stadium against the Nagoya Grampus side from Japan. The logo will be on the Mariners' jerseys for the next three Mariners games in the Asian Champions League in Korea, Japan and China. Thanks to the Mariners, an estimated viewing audience of 150 million people will be presented with a positive image of Australia's culture of inclusion and tolerance. As the Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, noted today, sport has a tremendous power to build bridges of understanding and respect and is a marvellous platform for inclusion. Involvement in sport, whether as a participant, volunteer, spectator administrator, unites people of all ages. Importantly too it fosters that sense of belonging and an acceptance and understanding of other cultures. So my wholehearted congratulations go to the chairman of the Mariners, Peter Turnbull, and to coach Graeme Arnold and his players for being such great ambassadors for the New South Wales Central Coast, the game of football, our country and international harmony. The Mariners are all class. I would also like to acknowledge Regional Development Australia and DIAC for their assistance in making this possible. (Time expired) Jordan, Mr Frank",86
46,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to pay tribute to the life of Frank Jordan, vice-patron and life member of the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club, Olympian at the Helsinki games, founding father of the Cronulla Sutherland Water Polo Club, dedicated teacher and mentor, loving husband to Shirley for almost 57 years, devoted father, grandfather and greatgrandfather to Robyn, Jenny, David and their families and a great mate and friend to all those who had the pleasure and privilege to know him. Last Friday I joined with our community at the Woronora cemetery to pay tribute to Frank. Frank grew up in Bankstown, less than a mile away from the local pool. His swimming journey took him to Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club, where he gained his Bronze Medallion in 1951, and to a culture he would know, enjoy and nurture for the rest of his life. Frank's competitive achievements in the surf were the forerunner to decades of service as a coach and a mentor, enabling hundreds of young shire athletes to realise their potential and learn some important life or lessons from Frank along the way. In 1964, Frank convened a meeting at Cronulla to form what is now the Cronulla Sutherland Water Polo Club, which has produced Olympians and champions from Andrew Kerr to Alicia MCCormack. To paraphrase the president of the Cronulla surf club, Greg Holland, who joins me here today, Frank Jordan swam a good race with honesty, integrity and His life was one of vigilance and service in the great tradition of Australian surf lifesaving. To Shirley and all her family, I express my sympathies and condolences but most of all the thanks of a grateful shire community for Frank's faithful life of service. You knew him in his greatest rolea great family man. There is no greater achievement for a man than that. Bass Electorate: Small Business",86
47,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate a family in the north-east region of my electorate of Bass-Michael and Raylene Taylor. Michael and Raylene own and operate a specialist service that provides Proud-Aid, a product they developed and sell. This product has won the O group's Business Enterprise Centre national award for best home-based business in Australia, a fantastic achievement. The O group supported this business to help take it to where it is today and I congratulate John Brown, the manager of Launceston's Business Enterprise Centre, for his assistance to this business and to many other small businesses in my electorate. Congratulations to Michael and Raylene and their family, not only for receiving this award but for their innovative ideas, passion, hard work and commitment to getting the business to where it is today. All the best them for the future.",87

49,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister to for Trade and Competitiveness will be absent from question time today and tomorrow as he is leading a trade delegation to Jakarta, Indonesia. The Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism will answer questions on his behalf. NA Carbon Pricing",87
50,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of an Energy Users Association report out today showing that Australian electricity prices are 70 per cent higher than in the United States and 130 per cent higher than in Canada. Why is the government adding the world's biggest carbon tax to the world's highest electricity prices?,87
51,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am aware of the report, and of course I am aware that many Australian families struggle to make ends meet and certainly feel the pressure when the electricity bill comes in. It is important that Australian families be clear about the causes of rising electricity prices. The truth is that we have seen over decades and decades underinvestment in the capital necessary for our electricity systems, and that means that we are now seeing catch-up investment with all of the costs that come with that catch-up investment. The fact that this exists as a pressure on electricity prices has been acknowledged by all sides of politics. I do note, for example, that the member for Groom acknowledged this when he said that power prices were set to double over the next five to seven years, irrespective of who was in government-lack of planning had led to an investment drought. He also said: Australians in all states are feeling the impacts rising power prices, in large part due to the neglect and mismanagement Governments. I know on all sides of politics there has been an acknowledgement of power rises and that, for example, the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, apologised to the people of Western Australia for increasing electricity charges by as much as 50 per cent. He said: That was a difficult decision. I knew it was right decision … I apologise for it for the hurt. But we had to do it. That was an acknowledgement of the pressures that exist as a result of underinvestment in electricity generation and electricity supply due to, I would say, some severe neglect by state governments. In respect of carbon pricing, which comes into effect on 1 July, of course Australians around the nation will see assistance for an average family of more than $500 a year. There will be tax cuts, increases in family payments and increases in pensions. There will be that money on hand to assist people and, as we know in this parliament, the threat to Australians having and retaining that money is the Leader of the Opposition.",88
52,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Does the Prime Minister accept the Energy Users Association view that the carbon tax will make a bad situation worse by adding 20 per cent to what are already the world's highest electricity prices?",88
53,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Of course what I accept is the analysis of Treasury about the impacts for households, and as a result of that analysis we are providing the money I have just spoken about in the form of tax cuts and pension increases and family payment increases. But the Leader of the Opposition of is obviously very interested in the words of the Energy Supply Association of Australia. of State What they have said is that uncertainty over carbon pricing-that is, the reckless scare campaign of the Leader of the Opposition and his very futile promises to remove carbon pricing; something he will in fact never do-is having an impact on electricity. The Energy Supply Association have said: We're concerned that if there is any uncertainty around a future price of carbon it will affect the the ability for electricity generators to invest. And that it will also impact on their ability to offer",88
54,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to direct relevance. I asked about the Energy Users Association, not the Energy Supply Association. This is about the people who use power, the Australian public, who are being",89
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call to answer the supplementary question.,89
56,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am addressing issues about electricity pricing. The Leader of the Opposition professes concern but does not want to deal with the facts out of the Treasury modelling. He professes concern but he wants to rip assistance out of the hands of working Australians. He professes concern but he does not acknowledge that the uncertainty that he is creating is also bad for electricity supply, bad for pricing and bad for Australian families. The Leader of the Opposition ought to acknowledge that. Murray-Darling Basin",89
57,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the government securing the future of the Murray-Darling Basin?,89
58,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Kingston for her question and I thank her for her continued advocacy on behalf of the people of her electorate and the people of South Australia about the future of the River Murray. I was very pleased to join her this morning, along with other South Australian government MPs-the member Wakefield, the member for Makin, the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Adelaide and Mr Butler-as well as Senator Wong at an event organised by the Adelaide Advertiser to put a spotlight on the River Murray. As a result of that event, many people in this parliament today are wearing the badges that say they love the River Murray. I would like to congratulate the Adelaide Advertiser for its continued focus on the future of the River Murray. Growing up in South Australia, I understand what it is like for the people of South Australia and the people of Adelaide to worry about the future of the river. I know what it is like to be in Adelaide in days of drought. I know what it is like to have that sense of relying for your water security on the river and knowing that what is available in South Australia depends so much on the conduct of others upstream. I understand that the people of Adelaide do worry about too much water having been taken out of the Murray and, as a result, they worry about its future. We are working through aMr MCCormack interjecting",89
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Riverina will remain silent for the balance of the Prime Minister's answer.,89
60,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I understand an alternative view is being expressed about whether or not we should focus on the River Murray. I would be very grateful for the member to put it very clearly on the record and then we will compare whether or not it equates with, for example, what the member for Sturt says. That would be a very interesting comparison. As for the government, we are very focused on making sure that this important national river system, the Murray-Darling Basin, is managed properly and managed nationally. for We are very focused on the needs of the river. We want to see environmental benchmarks, like the mouth of the river being open nine years out of 10, met. We want to make sure that there is security, that there is an understanding of what will happen for the future of the river and that we do have a reform that meets the needs of South Australia, that meets environmental benchmarks like keeping the mouth of the Murray open nine years out of 10 and that meets the needs of the people of South Australia. We will continue to work through to secure a Murray-Darling Basin plan. The people of South Australia have an opportunity to have their voices well and truly heard in that debate. I welcome them lifting their voices today, and we look forward to continuing to hear the voice of South Australia. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",89
61,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Sunfresh Linen, which employs 130 people in Darra in suburban Brisbane, faces a carbon tax bill at least $83,000 and rising, despite the that Sunfresh has invested $2 million in becoming more energy efficient in reducing its emissions by 436 tonnes annually? How does the Prime Minister expect this company to continue to invest in Australia when it expected to pay such a high price under the carbon tax?",90
62,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who asked the question, of course I value very much what businesses around the country do in creating wealth and prosperity and in providing jobs for Australians. Indeed, I value that so much business, that we want to lift some of their burdens giving them a company tax cut. We want to lift some of their burdens by making sure that they pay less company tax. I think it probably very disappointing for the member who asked the question that he is not in a position to walk in the front door of that business to meet with the people who work there and to say to them that he supports a company tax cut for that business.  of order. The Prime Minister was asked about the carbon tax and the effect of the carbon tax on the 130 workers at Darra. She was not asked about any other matter and she should limit herself to answering the question.",90
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the Prime Minister was explaining why the imposition of the carbon tax would not necessarily have the adverse impact suggested by the honourable member for Bonner. The Prime Minister has the call and she is aware of the terms of the question.,90
64,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked a question My which went to the continuation of this business, its welfare and its ability to provide work for Australians, and I am addressing that question. In addressing that question, I of think it is relevant to note that the fact government wants to provide that business with a tax cut as part of ensuring that Australians around the nation get a fair share of the resources boom. I understand that those opposite are opposed to this business is getting its fair share of the resources boomthey want it to pay more tax-but I do not think that members opposite can come into this parliament and feign concern about individual businesses and not acknowledge that they are opposed to providing those businesses with a tax cut. On the question of carbon pricing and that and Australian businesses by generally, we are determined to make sure that we seize the benefits of a clean energy future and that we do it in the most costis effective way-that is, we do it in a way that is best for Australian businesses and Australian working people, because it is at the least cost. That is the plan of the government, a least-cost plan, and it stands in stark contrast to the shambolic, expensive scheme that that Leader of the Opposition advocates",90
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question.,90
66,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which of course includes making the working people at that business worse off by taking tax cuts off them, by taking family payment increases off them and by taking pension increases off aged members of their families. If you care about the Australian economy, its strength and its future, if you care about making sure that cut carbon pollution, you have got an obligation to look for the lowest cost way do it. We have. The Leader of the Opposition and his political party have not, and that bad for Australian businesses and Australian jobs. Murray-Darling Basin",91
67,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities. Will the minister advise the House on the progress of consultation on the draft Murray-Darling Basin Plan? Have there been any limits on the consultation process so far?",91
68,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:16): I want to thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He has shown a long-term interest, as have the many South Australian members on this side of the House, in wanting to see a good outcome in a national approach to the Murray-Darling Basin. One hundred and twenty-two days ago, the consultation on the draft plan began. There are only 26 days left in that consultation process. There have been meetings held, which a number of members from each side of this House have attended. Some members from my own side have made submissions. I know the member for Kingston has made a submission, calling for a tougher plan and wanting a better outcome for South Australia. I know some members opposite have stood up and asked for the numbers to go down in respect of their communities. The difference between the submissions from each side of the House during this consultation process is that on this side of the House, when we are participating in that process, we participate with the certainty of we knowing we will be on the side of backing the reform when it lands. We know that we to will be on the side of having a national approach to the Murray-Darling Basin, is whereas the most notable submission from those opposite was the one made by the Leader of the Opposition at the Griffith meeting, when he said that he would only support a 'good plan' without defining what a good plan would or would not involve. Water, Opposition members interjecting Mr Champion interjecting",91
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Wakefield will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). The member for Wakefield then left the Water, chamber.  of order. How could this be relevant to the question the minister was asked, to verbal the Leader of the Opposition, when the opposition is also in favour of a national plan for the Murray-Darling Basin?",91
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Manager of Opposition Business takes a similar point of order, he will be ejected under the provisions of standing order 94(a). The minister was asked whether there were any limits on progress and he was answering the question.",91
71,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a clear game that is going on during the consultation process with the Leader of the Opposition not defining what a good plan is or what a good plan would be. With 26 days to go, he is running down the clock without saying what he would and what he would not support. If your support is conditionalMrs Griggs interjecting",91
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Solomon will remove herself under the provisions of standing order 94(a). Sustainability, The member for Solomon then left the chamber.",92
73,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"then you have got to let on to the public what those conditions are. Instead, what happens is they just run down the clock so that when the basin authority comes back with a final plan those opposite can say, 'Oh, that's not what we meant by a good plan,' and then, reluctantly, the Leader of the Opposition will be compelled to vote no. Who would have thought? Who would have thought that you would have a design of a line which is-every step of the way there-to not let on what sort of plan you would vote for, and, in the whole consultation period, to run down the clock for the final 26 days and not make clear what the conditions would be for coalition support? Make no mistake: there are people on this side of the House who are arguing strongly for changes to the plan. But there is no-one on this side of the House, during the consultation period, who is saying, 'Let's spike the reform.' There is no-one on this side of the House who is saying that we should abandon the hope of having a national plan. Yet every word that has come from the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition has been designed to get to the day the authority comes back and then say, 'Oh, I never thought I had to support something like that I will just vote no.'",92
74,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister talked about consulting a lot of communities around developing a basinwide plan. Can the minister tell us about the importance of this for my home town of Adelaide? An opposition member: It's not even in the basin!",92
75,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (14:21): I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the supplementary question. Can I make clear: Adelaide is the one part of the entire Murray-Darling Basin where their catchment is the Murray-Darling Basin-more than half of their drinking water comes from the Murray-Darling Basin. There is an understandable level of commitment from those South Australian members, and in particular those from Adelaide, in wanting to see national reform. There is also a degree of peril. During the meeting organised by the Adelaide Advertiser today, they saw that the one person who did not join the Leader of the Opposition during his speech was the shadow minister for water. He was there but would not be in the camera frame when those words were being said. The puppeteer of water policy on that side of the House, and he would have described today",92
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw that reflection.,92
77,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw.,92
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the member for Sturt have a point of order?  the minister to falsely claim that Senator Joyce was not there this morning when he simply was there this morning. It is a completely false claim.,92
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Sturt will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a).,92
80,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, with respect, I ask you to reconsider that. The minister was making a false statement. He said that Senator Joyce was not there. All the member for Sturt was trying to do was correct a false statement, which is surely of assistance to the House.",92
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I pointed out previously to the member for Sturt that if he took another point of order that was an abuse of standing orders he would be ejected. He did so. There are other forms in the House if someone wants to correct a record. The honourable member has been here long enough to know that.,93
82,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I apologise for further detaining you on this matter. I certainly did not hear your warning to the member for Sturt. It is more than possible in the hubbub that the member for Sturt did not hear your warning and under the circumstances if you extended a certain amount of leniency you would be reflecting well on the conduct of the chamber.,93
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Sturt then left the chamber.,93
84,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the concerns of the member for Hindmarsh on behalf of the people of Adelaide were best reflected by an interjection that occurred during that exchange. The member for Riverina interjected, 'The environment will fix itself; it always has.'",93
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will be directly relevant to the supplementary question.,93
86,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason this plan needs to be in place, the reason the member for Hindmarsh is concerned, and the reason that this consultation process must lead to national powers over the Murray-Darling Basin is that you cannot just leave the environment to fix itself. It needs a national plan. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",93
87,Mr ROBERT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Are you aware of comments by the head of Queensland company Zarraffa's Coffee that: … it won't be long before coffee is an expensive commodity as we shoulder carbon tax impacts across transport, power, rents and so on. How does the Prime Minister expect this company, with its over 50 stores, to remain competitive and to continue to invest in Queensland when the CEO himself warns that the carbon tax may be the final undoing of many small to medium businesses?",93
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member's question I say this: I want to make sure that we are supporting small businesses in this country, medium sized businesses in this country and bigger businesses in this nation, which is why I want to ensure those businesses get a tax cut. I want to ensure that the very business the member refers to gets a tax cut. Unfortunately, the member who asked the question, who professes concern about this business, is opposed to giving that business a tax cut. I hope he has taken the opportunity to explain that to every person who works there.",93
89,Mr Hartsuyker,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order concerning direct relevance. The question related to the carbon tax being the final undoing of many small businesses and in particular, Zarraffa's Coffee.",93
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will direct her answer to the specifics of the question.,93
91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, I am talking about the future of this business. In its future I want to see it get a tax cut and get tax relief. Whether it is incorporated or not I want to see it get a benefit-a company tax cut, if it is incorporated. Whether it is incorporated or not it will get the benefit of an instant asset write-off of $6,500 a year. Whether it is incorporated or not it will have the ability to get a tax benefit of $5,000 when buying a new motor vehicle. The member who asked the question is opposed to all of that. On the question of carbon pricing and this business, or any Australian business, and the Australian nation, if we are committed to reducing our carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, as is bipartisan politics parliament, then action needs to be taken. Once you have agreed to that-reducing it by five per cent-there is only one question you then need to ask yourself. Do you do it in the most cost effective way or do you do it in a more expensive way? Prime Minister Howard and his government recognised that the most cost effective way of reducing carbon pollution was to put a price on carbon. Prime Minister Howard was right. The Leader of the Opposition was right when he campaigned with Prime Minister Howard on that platform in the 2007 election. All of the members of the coalition who are on the record supporting carbon pricing",93
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will become directly relevant,94
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"as the most effective plan, the cheapest plan, are right. Consequently, if we are to cut carbon pollution and look after this business that is the plan we need and it is the plan the government has provided. We do not need the costly plan, smashing into families at $1,300 a year, as recommended by the Leader of the Opposition. Commonwealth Grant Guidelines",94
94,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The Commonwealth Grant Guidelines state that 'agencies are responsible for advising their ministers on the requirements of the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines, and must take appropriate and timely steps to do so'. Today the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit released two lists, one of 33 instances and one of 11 instances in which the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines have not been followed. What assurances, therefore, can the Prime Minister give the House that all ministers will make sure all agencies follow their obligations under these in this Commonwealth Grant Guidelines?",94
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I know he is centrally interested in this because of the role he plays on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. Since coming to government we have made a significant number of reforms to improve whole-of-government transparency and accountability in grants programs. So we established the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines in 2009 following the highly critical Auditor-General report into the program run by the Howard governmentwhich came, for good reasons, to be known as 'regional rorts'. Having seen that slamming report, in which the word 'corruption' was used, we determined that it was appropriate to act. Our government has implemented the first ever comprehensive guidelines, established at the Commonwealth level, to ensure transparency in federal grants programs. I note that the Audit Office, in its report, has said-positively-about this development: For the first time, the Government's expectations for Ministers, agencies and officials when performing duties in relation to grants administration, were clearly articulated. The office of the auditor has examined some 800 ministerial briefs. It has identified only 33 cases of under-reporting of grants in a minister's electorate. So there is that transparency, and I think that that transparency is a good thing. With the Auditor-General now having pointed out this matter, the message must be received by ministers and by departmentsbecause, as the member would be aware, in the audit report there is reference to the conduct of departments in dealing with these questions-that these guidelines must be honoured and must be honoured consistently. But I would point out to the House that we have seen a considerable improvement from the free-for-all we saw under the Howard government. Overwhelmingly the Audit Office, in looking at these briefs, has found compliance. It has found non-compliance in a limited number of cases.",94
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question.,95
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The message is now clear to all ministers and all departments about the need for compliance with these guidelines. Taxation  question is to the Treasurer. What benefits will flow throughout the Australian economy following the passage of the minerals resource rent tax? In particular, has the government assessed the impact the corporate tax cut will have on Australian industries? And how is that government dealing with proposals to increase the corporate tax rate?",95
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Moreton for that very important question. We on this side of the House understand the importance of the change in weight in the global economy of the movement from west to east. That is producing a stunning investment pipeline of something like $455 billion in resources in Australia. We on this side of the House understand the absolute importance of spreading the benefits of that investment pipeline right across our country and right across every postcode. That is why we have introduced the MRRT as the revenue stream that will fund a tax break for 2.7 million small businesses through the $6,500 instant asset write-off. In the electorate of Moreton, that will go to something like 19,400 small businesses. That is why we are having this historic boost to superannuation savings, which will go to 8.4 million workers in our country. It is worth an additional $100,000 for a 30-year-old on average earnings. In the electorate of the member for Moreton, that is something like 50,000 people who will benefit, across all age groups. This is a massive way to spread the benefits of the resources boom right around our country. But we should also do more, and that is why we on this side of the House want to cut the company tax rate by 1c, starting first of all with small businesses and then moving across the board. There is a very clear contrast here, because those opposite want to jack it up by 1½ per cent. They do not really have any comprehension of what it is like for all those businesses that are not in the fast lane of the resources boom-for example, small businesses on the Sunshine Coast, and right around the country. I have been having a look at the difference between, say, a 29c rate and 31½c across various industry sectors. In the manufacturing sector that would be an additional tax bill of $392 million in manufacturing alone if they had their way. In the retail sector it would be a difference of $270 million. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I refer you to page 553 of Practice, where it says, under the old rules of relevance, that 'an answer must maintain a link to the substance of the question'. Under direct relevance, it is even stricter. The Treasurer is certainly not connected to that, and I ask you to ask him to return to the question or else sit down.",95
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer was asked about the impact of not reducing the company tax-maybe not in those words, but that was the gist of it-and he is being directly relevant.",96
100,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the retail trade sector and the wholesale sector it would be an additional $400 million of tax paid by companies. In the media and telco sector it would be an additional $188 million and in the construction sector $322 million. In agriculture, forestry and fishing, an additional $306 million would be paid by companies in those sectors.

101,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of findings of the Energy Users Association released today that show Queenslanders are paying amongst the highest prices for electricity of 91 countries and provinces surveyed? Does the Prime Minister really think it is fair to slug Queensland families and businesses with a carbon tax when they are already paying more for electricity than 27 countries of the EU, the United Kingdom and every state of the United States?",96
102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member for Hinkler, perhaps I could use these words in answer to him: 'You can't reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless you have a price on carbon.' They are the words of John Howard on 27 May 2007. I think Prime Minister Howard was absolutely right. The member for Hinkler thought he was absolutely right too because he campaigned alongside him",96
103,Mr Hartsuyker,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was quite clear: does the Prime Minister think it is fair to slug Queensland families with a carbon tax?",96
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I heard the question. The Prime Minister has just started her answer and I am quite sure she is going to address the specifics of the question.,96
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was referring to one eminent Australian who thought it was fair to put a price on carbon, that being former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard and his cabinet colleagues and backbench colleagues who campaigned alongside him for a price on carbon. Prime Minister Howard believed that because Prime Minister Howard, as I do, believes",96
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the specifics of the question.,96
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If, as I do, you believe we need to cut carbon pollution-and that is bipartisan politics in this parliament-then you have got to work out how to do it. The cheapest, most effective way to do it is to put a price on carbon. Then, having put a price on carbon, you need to support Australian families as they go about their daily work, including Australian families as they go about paying their power bills. We have determined to do just that, to make sure that we use money that flows from a price being paid by companies that are generating carbon pollution to support Australian families, including the Queensland families that the member refers to. So, looking at an average family, they will receive assistance of more than $500 a year to deal with impacts flowing from putting a price on carbon. Many families in fact will end up with more assistance through tax cuts or family payments or pension increases than they need-that is, they will end up in front as a result of the government's scheme. To the member who asked the question, I simply ask him to contemplate the alternative. He himself is a member of a political party committed to reducing carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. I ask him: why does he want to do that in a way that is more costly for Queensland families? Why does he want to reject the advice of former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard about the most cost-effective way to do this? Like the Leader of the Opposition, he is committed to sending those families a $1,300 bill. Donations to Political Parties",96
108,Mr HUSIC,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Special Minister of State. Will the minister update the House on recent reports of multimilliondollar donations to political parties? What challenge does this represent to the integrity of our electoral system?,97
109,Mr GRAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (14:41): I thank the honourable member for his question. It reflects an interest that many members of parliament have in the integrity of our electoral system. It reflects a concern that this parliament has had since 1984, 28 years ago, the first time we legislated to create a disclosure regime for political donations-a regime that was put in place to ensure transparency, a regime that was put in place to ensure integrity regime that was put in place because it acknowledges the fundamentally important role played by individuals and organisations who wish to contribute to the political debate. On my side of politics we have trade unions that make donations to political parties. Their donations are disclosed. I was asked in particular about donations of $1 million, and it is of course the case that in the last election the Greens party did receive a donation of $1.6 million from Mr Greg Wood. But I was caused earlier this week following media reports to peruse the total contributions of other individuals too. The House may wish to be aware that the contributions of individuals of substantial net worth are now at a point that should be brought to the attention of this place. High net worth individuals of course are at liberty to make decisions to support our political parties and our political processes, as is their wont. I was made aware that last year Mr Clive Palmer made a contribution in the order of $1 million to the coalition. I am aware that the total contribution now to the coalition from individualsMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

115,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata will not pay any of the government's new mining tax over the next three years?",98
116,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Speaker, I heard the shadow Treasurer make this statement on television this morning. I am not sure how he can do the work of the tax commissioner or indeed of the Treasury. What I can say is that we have put in place the MRRT. We have worked closely with the industry. In particular, through the Argus process we worked our way through the design of the tax, and we are absolutely satisfied that the revenue streams that we have forecast will be delivered. I do not know on what basis the shadow Treasurer makes that claim; I do not know on what basis he makes it at all. Mr Simpkins interjecting",98

Government Legislation",98
119,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Leader of the House. Will the Leader of the House outline how the government has progressed its policy and legislative agenda through the House? How has the government overcome obstacles, including attempts to influence its legislative program, to deliver this agenda? Why is important that we take a balanced and evidence based approach to dealing with government legislation?",98
120,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of Mr the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:47): I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. Indeed, the House has now passed almost 300 pieces of legislation in the 43rd Parliament, delivering a mainstream agenda, making sure we get the economy right, making sure that we create jobs and taking action on climate change, better retirement incomes and of course nation-building infrastructure. This is significant progress, in spite of the obstacles and the relentless negativity we get from those opposite and also from some outside the parliament. All of our major reforms have been opposed by those opposite and fought for on the floor of this chamber, and their actions have been supported, and indeed bankrolled, by their allies outside this place. We will see one of them outside this place tomorrow morning, when Clive Palmer addresses tomorrow's Global Warming Hoax rally.

It is important that we take into account people's views based upon the democratic principle of one vote one value, not on the basis of people's wealth or their the ability to influence. It is important also that we respect the democratic decisions of this parliament.

I refer the Treasurer to the blow-out in this year's forecast budget deficit from $13 billion in the 2010 budget to $23 billion in the 2011 budget to $37 billion in the 2011 MYEFO. Why should Australians believe anything said by this government on budget night when forecasts of this year's budget deficit have blown out by 184 per cent in just 18 months?,99
132,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," welcome that question because we hear questions like this, and points from those opposite all the time-talking down our economy every day, every week and every year.

We have behaved completely",100

And the Treasurer should be directly relevant to that question. I do The SPEAKER: I am sure the Treasurer is going to address the specifics of this very made like this, narrow question.",100
141,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have been addressing the very narrow question. The reason that we have had these outcomes is revenue writedowns. We are currently engaged in the fastest fiscal consolidation in our history to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. Mr Dutton interjecting,100
142,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson will remain silent.,100
143,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The reason we have deficits is that revenues have been weak. But they choose to stick their heads in the sand and not understand the most basic elements of macroeconomics. It just shows how unqualified they are for government in this country. Coal Industry,100
144,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management. How does the government respond to claims about covert actions by overseas intelligence agencies allegedly undertaken to undermine the Australian coal industry?,100
145,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (14:56): I thank the member for her question, because I think a lot of members in this chamber would have been concerned to hear these allegations that were  that one of our closest intelligence allies is using its intelligence agency to stop coal seam gas investments in Australia. This is a pretty extraordinary claim and I would have thought that those opposite-I mention in particular the member for Berowra, a member of the joint intelligence committee and a distinguished former Attorney-General who had a very close relationship, as in fact many Attorneys-General have had, with our intelligence agencies in the US and in Australia",100

This allegation and I do have to wonder whether  much Get Smart. Certainly he is working very closely with 'KAOS' over there. I just want to say that it is an important issue.

150,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point that I am simply trying to make is that national security is much more than jokes about shoe phones or jokes about other things. National security is about protecting real people from real threats, about making sure that our laws are operating properly, and I would have thought that those opposite would want to dissociate themselves from comments like this that just feed conspiracy theories and do us no justice when we want to work closely with those around the world to share intelligence about real threats that are emerging across the world.

154,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, if a small business paying the company tax rate purchases a new ute worth $35,000 after 1 July this year, will not the first-year after-tax benefit from the government's instant asset write-off arrangements be $1,300, not the $6½ thousand that the government was claiming yesterday?",101
155,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I will restrain myself, Mr Speaker. I just have to go back and run through some of the facts. We have a $6,500 instant asset write-off which can be claimed by up to 2.7 million small businesses. That will be a very substantial benefit, particularly to the cash flow of many struggling businesses right around our country. In the last budget, we did say that the first $5,000 of any car purchasenamely, a ute-could be written off within that framework. That is what we have said so yet again I have not the faintest idea what he is talking about.",101
156,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Will the Treasurer confirm that any first-year tax benefit will be offset by higher tax in subsequent years, so that the net value to the business of the instant asset write-off over the life of the asset is likely $300 and not the $6½ thousand that the government was claiming yesterday?",102

161,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is one of the most fundamental reforms that we could make to the tax system for small business. It has a very substantial benefit in terms of cash flow in the year that it is claimed and it also simplifies the system because it does away with complex depreciation schedules. So this is really welcomed by small business. This is one of the recommendations of the Henry review, and we are doing it in an affordable way. Mr Van Manen interjecting",102

167,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. What work is being done in the national interest to tackle people-smuggling and to deter people from taking dangerous boat journeys to Australia? Why is it important to have workable and practical border protection policies supported by other countries in our region, and what is the response to these policies and to other proposals to deal with people-smuggling?",102
168,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question, which goes to what is being done in the national interest to tackle peoplesmuggling. This week, debate started in the House on the legislation moved by the honourable member for Lyne. That legislation would allow the government of the day to implement deterrence to dangerous boat journeys to Australia. It is legislation that the government will support in the national interest. The bill from the member for Lyne would allow the minister to designate a country if it is part of the Bali process, if the minister is satisfied with the protections and, perhaps most importantly, if the country involved agrees to be a partner with Australia in that endeavour. It is very important that the country involved agree to receive people transferred. For example, a minister could not be satisfied with the protections in place if that country had not agreed to receive people. Whether people are being removed from Australia by boat or by plane, I would have thought it would be evident to most reasonable people that you would actually have to have the agreement of the country in question.",102

171,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even those opposite have recognised this in the past. At the last election, the Liberal Party's policy was that 'a commitment from the return country not to return persons seeking asylum to the place from which they came, claiming to be fleeing persecution, would be key'. That statement would lead you to believe that, if such an agreement could not be reached, nobody would be returned to that country. But, alas, it pains me to say that that appears now not to be the case. We have had a major policy development from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is good at saying no, but when a close partner and neighbour says no he appears not to understand the meaning of the word. The Indonesian foreign minister said in this building last week that it would be impossible and ill-advised to have boats turned around on the high seas and sent to Indonesia. He said, 'That would give you a hint of our approach.' He is right. Hints do not get much bigger than that. Yet the Leader of the Opposition seems to think that this policy is not dead. Apparently it is just pining for the fjords. The policy of turning back the boats is not dead, and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cook seem to say that it does not matter what Indonesia thinks, they will send people there regardless. They say they want a foreign and asylum policy that is Jakarta focused. Well Jakarta have told us their focus and their focus is to reject the cheap populism of those opposite, to reject this cheap policy which puts at risk the lives of Australian Defence personnel and",103

175,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is ruled out of order. Small Business,103
176,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business. How will government policies like tax breaks support small businesses and help them to thrive and grow? What support has small business expressed for these measures, and what are the challenges for small business that need to be addressed? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (15:07): I thank the member for Page for her question and her long association with small business. Indeed, she has over 11,000 small businesses in her own electorate. I also thank her for her advocacy for the small business commissioner, something that we have responded to in recent times. The Gillard government, of course, is committed to helping Australia's 2.7 million small businesses around the country. We are helping them in a number of very important ways. Firstly, there is the reduction in the company tax rate from 30c in the dollar to 29c. Secondly, there are the income tax rates from 1 July for those unincorporated small business owners, who will receive an increase because of the increase in the tax threshold to $18,200. Indeed, I might add that there is also an increase for those who can receive personal tax cuts, if they are an employee of their own company, and also receive the company tax cut. There is the $5,000 write-off for vehicles and the $6½ thousand instant asset tax write-off for assets purchased in that financial year, which is very important. It provides cash flow solutions to problems that may occur from time to time, particularly microbusinesses, sole traders-those small companies that really need some assistance. I might add, in relation to the question was asked earlier by the member for Goldstein, in relation to the $6,500 instant asset tax write-off, that that is for each asset purchased under $6,500, not just one asset, so there could be multiple assets. So this is a great boon for small businesses around the country. It can only be done, of course, because we have enacted the minerals resource rent taxMr Hockey interjecting",103

Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: This is a very important support for businesses, particularly in sectors like tourism and manufacturing that are confronted with challenges including the high Australian dollar. I know small businesses are astounded that the opposition has not supported this initiative. One of those is Derek Stewart from Queanbeyan Diesel Service, just down the road from here-indeed, so close that the Leader of the Opposition went there last year to do a media opportunity. Mr Stewart was quoted in the Australian today, and he said he was concerned that the Leader of the Opposition 'missed the bus' when it came to for tax cuts for small business. Well, Mr Speaker, he has missed the bus. I am sure he would not miss Clive Palmer's jet, but he did that miss the bus. The fact is that we will continue to",104

Given that the Auditor General has found that on 33 occasions ministers have failed to declare millions of dollars of grants to their own electorates, including the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, who has made three major grants to local councils in his electorate totalling more than $3 million without declarations, what action will you take to discipline the minister?",105
185,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the member for Kooyong's question, first, I draw his attention to what the ANAO actually found. The member for Kooyong had his first question ruled out of order because he in part sought to misrepresent that, and I would counsel him against that in this question as well. Second, I remind the member for Kooyong that this government has moved to introduce guidelines because of the conduct of the Howard government under regional rorts, causing the Auditor-General to author a report that used the word 'corrupt'. The member for Kooyong should understand that. The word 'corrupt' was used in that Auditor-General's report. We have responded to those kinds of findings about the conduct of the Howard government by making sure that there is a new system of transparency.",105

That is, of course, a different approach than has been taken in the past. We are a government that have introduced transparency guidelines because we were disgusted by the conduct of the Howard government. If the member for Kooyong is truly disturbed by such matters then I find it hard to explain how he can serve behind this front bench, given their conduct in the regional rorts affair",105

In relation to the report that was referred to in the question by the member for Kooyong, the grants concerned are the Roads to Recovery money that go to every local council in Australia.

NA World Autism Day,106
207,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I seek your advice. On 9 March 2012 Mr Murray Dawson-Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Autism Victoria, wrote to the Department of Parliamentary Services seeking to have the parliament building lit up for World Autism Day. I understand that you have very generously been supportive of that but that it may not have received similar support from your fellow Presiding Officer. Would you be able to advise the House in due course as to what is the correct position, what is the policy in relation to a group such as Autism Victoria seeking assistance and, if the answer is no, why it is no? I would also note that, as is appropriate, the House is currently being lit up for World Harmony Day in the evening. The SPEAKER (15:18): For approval to be given for lighting, there must be agreement between the Presiding Officers. I am quite happy to discuss personally the general policy with the honourable member for Flinders if he wishes to come and see me. NA NA Budget The SPEAKER (15:19): I have received letters from the honourable member for Goldstein and the honourable member for Chifley proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46 I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Goldstein, namely: The urgent need for the Government to deliver budget transparency for the business community. I therefore call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",106
208,Mr ROBB,IMPORTANCE," Over the last 10 years in office, Labor has never delivered a surplus. In fact, it has racked total of $241 billion worth of deficits-or a quarter of a trillion dollars-over those 10 years of wall-to-wall deficits since 1989. This compares with $103 billion of cumulative surpluses over the last 10 years of coalition government. To go from such a surplus to such a deficit and to have nothing to show for it is what Australians find unbelievable and unforgivable. Yet, if you listen to Australia's lightweight Treasurer, you would think all was well. It means that we all have to look beyond Labor's spin and instead look at the facts because Labor has turned sophistry-clever but deceitful arguments-into a fine art. Today I would like to provide just three examples of potentially hundreds of examples of this sophistry. I highlight the deceit of Labor's stimulus claims, I highlight the deceit of Labor's spending claims and I highlight the deceit of Labor's surplus claims. Let us look at Labor's stimulus claims. A report out today by the Australian National Audit Office once again suggests that the mammoth $87 billion spending splurge failed to boost growth as promised or, as endlessly claimed by our lightweight Treasurer, that the overall stimulus meant that Australia avoided a recession in 2009. The auditors found that the last of the payments under the inspired Greens initiative to create jobs by building bike paths, a key part of the $650 million so-called Jobs Fund, unveiled at the height of the GFC, was not expected to be made until next month. This is almost two years after the funds were meant to have been spent and a full three years since the end of the first quarter of 2009, the quarter that would have confirmed a recession following the negative 0.7 per cent growth quarter at the end of 2008. The Audit Office actually rebuked the government for not ensuring that taxpayer funds delivered the economic gain. A similar up a audit from 10 July of the separate $550 million regional community infrastructure project found the cash was spent too slowly to ensure the gains first claimed-the sorts of claims we have heard ad nauseam in this place for three years now. We know Treasury confirmed that a massive $10 billion of stimulus money was still to be spent this year, 2011-12. These are the facts as distinct from the spin. By the way, it is borrowed money which will not be repaid for years and years. The Orgill report into the $16 billion school funding program showed that spending began several months later than planned and it is still being spent to this day-several years after the GFC. One-ninth of the stimulus was spent towards the end of the one quarter of negative growth, which was the 2008 December quarter. We supported that first stimulus because of the collapse of confidence. In fact we suggested how it should be spent. Despite the nonsense peddled by our lightweight Treasurer, a Treasurer so far out of his depth",107
209,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The member for Goldstein will refer to the member appropriately.,108
210,Mr ROBB,IMPORTANCE,"Despite the absolute nonsense peddled by our Treasurer, a Treasurer so far out of his depth, a Treasurer who claims that the stimulus was the reason Australia avoided a technical recession, almost all the stimulus was spent after the economy was bouncing back, which it was by the end of the first quarter and the start the second quarter of 2009. It was the automatic economic stabiliser of the exchange rate and the work of the Reserve Bank which restarted our economy. In the first quarter, you might recall, our exchange rate fell to 60c against the US dollar. We all understand the significance of that now. It is not a surprise that the biggest trade surplus in Australia's history came in that first quarter of 2009-in the middle of the global financial crisis. Then the Reserve Bank cut interest rates-not only cut but slashed. They took 4.25 percentage points off interest rates between September 2008 and April 2009. The stimulus money had not been spent, but by April 2009 the pockets of households had more in them than they had all ever had as a result of the 4.25 percentage point cut in interest rates. The interesting point is that seven months later, in November 2009, when some of the spending was starting to take place, interest rates were back up by 3½ percentage points. Why was that? It appears the Reserve Bank was worried about overspending in the economy. The RBA had reduced interest rates by 4.25 percentage points-that got us going-but by the time the money was being spent out of the government's $87 billion stimulus, they were reducing interest rates due to worries about overspending. These are the facts as distinct from the spin. By the way again, it was all borrowed money and it will not be repaid for years and years. This deceit has been used to justify borrowing and spending of $87 billion and more. All that has meant is that the government has been in the market borrowing $100 million a day ever since. The effect has been to push up interest rates for households and for small and large businesses; push up our exchange rate; ensure that many small and medium sized of businesses have not been able to access finance for love or money, many going to the wall as a consequence; and make Australia highly vulnerable to any-even a reasonably modest-downturn in commodity prices. That vulnerability is due to our huge structural deficit, a deficit which is twice Germany's and even 30 per cent worse than Italy's, would you believe. Yet you never hear our Treasurer talk about structural deficits. Do not lecture us about transparency. The rest of the world, especially Europe, talks-is consumed with concern-about structural deficits. The Treasury are not even allowed to produce a figure for the structural deficit. The words have hardly ever even passed the Treasurer's lips in this place. This is yet more spin. Let us look at the deceit of Labor's stimulus claims. I could recite a litany of issues which have not been addressed by this government, yet they continue to parade this nonsense that the stimulus had some effect. It has had an effect; it has had a deeply negative effect over the last three years and is contributing to the huge debt hanging around the neck of every Australian. Let us look at the deceit of Labor's spending claims. The government's response to every problem has been to tax, borrow and spend, spend, spend and then to do high fives after they have passed each tax and spin it as reform. The government should be paying down debt to position Australia for some of the best and most extraordinary opportunities-across virtually every sector, including manufacturing-which emerging in the Asia-Pacific. They should be paying down debt to weatherproof Australia's economy against growing volatility on world financial and commodity markets-as the Howard-Costello government did ahead of the global financial crisis. That is why we got through the global financial crisis-we went into it with a $20 billion surplus and with a balance sheet that was $70 billion in the black. That and the automatic stabilisers are why we got through it, not the politically inspired stimulus spending which we are still suffering from and which businesses are still suffering from. Instead, this Treasurer who is out of his depth has consecutively delivered the four biggest deficits in Australia's history-$27 billion, $55 billion, $48 billion and $37 billion. I will not be surprised if that $37 billion blows out a lot further to help manufacture a surplus for 2012-13. Under Labor, annual spending has grown from $272 billion in 2008 to an estimated $370 billion this year. That is an increase of $100 billion in just 4½ years-$100 billion out of a budget which started at $262 billion. That is a 40 per cent increase. I suppose they would say it has kept pace with inflation, but inflation over those 4½ years was only 13½ per cent. Despite all that, they are increasing it spending again this year. Forget the stimulus for a moment. Let us say that the stimulus was warranted, that it has not brought thousands of small businesses to their knees because they cannot get finance as a result of having to compete against a government borrowing $100 million a day. You would think that, after they had spent the money on the stimulus, they would come back to something like the long-term level of spending, would you not? That is what a household would do if they had put an are extension on their house. The next year they would come back to their long-term level of spending. Not this mob. Under this government the deficit has gone up and up-$87 billion, but they could better that. Now they are at $100 billion more than they were spending 4½ years ago. That is why they never talk about expenditure. This Treasurer is out of his depth and he never talks about expenditure. This government has had two to three per cent more overexpenditure than previous governments as a percentage of GDP every year, on average, for 4½ years. Look at the facts, not the spin. So much for fiscal consolidation. It is a monstrous amount of money, much more than the $87 billion. This government has spent $70 billion over and above that $87 billion they have spent above the long-term spending trend. And they talk about fiscal responsibility. This fiscal consolidation line is, again, more spin. Labor's third outrageous line of spin is its claims about the surplus. Labor has been boasting for three years about its projected 2012-13 surplus while delivering the biggest deficits in our nation's history. You will hear it again this time-they will brag about a surplus that they have never delivered and try to bury one of the four biggest deficits in our history. In fact, a detailed look at their budget figures shows we have every reason to treat the surplus, if we ever see it, as thoroughly dodgy and thoroughly manufactured. It is a product of accounting tricks to shuffle money and hide spending to keep it off the budget bottom line and engineer the appearance of a surplus next year. Let me give just one of the many examples that I documented in a speech last Friday to VECCI. Labor accept that their damaging carbon tax poses a threat to Australia's energy security, and in response they will spend over $1 billion this year, 2011-12, to support energy markets through its Energy Security Fund. Jump forward two years, to 2013-14 and 2014-15. They will spend another billion dollars in each of those years. What happened in the middle? What happened to 2012-13? Apparently the carbon tax magically poses no threat to energy security in 2012-13. They are spending 1,000 times less-$1 million, not $1 billion. So it is a billion, one million, a billion, a billion. I could take you through 34 examples of very obvious cases where they have done this. Again and again they have brought spending forward or they have pushed it back into those two years. Get up and answer those claims. Explain to us why it is a billion, one million and then a billion, a billion to alleviate the threat to business from the carbon tax. This Treasurer has been pulling forward expenditure for two years and now it is being pushed out from 2012-13 into the subsequent two years, and he does not think anyone is looking. A forensic examination of the budget papers shows dozens of examples of this sort of chicanery. It is one reason why Labor's claim to be delivering a wafer-thin surplus in 2012-13 should be taken with a very large grain of salt. All these things add up to tens of billions of dollars. In fact, whatever they come up with in May, the real truth will be tens of billions of dollars more in deficit. This is a government that has practised and perfected the art of spin. Finally, we have the most notorious example of the government's spin. They have not only shuffled money around but have about $100 billion of items for which there is no identified funding, or they are hidden. They have taken it off the balance sheet or they have not identified funding. There is the Clean Energy Fund, the NBN, the structural black holes inherent in the mining and carbon taxes, the 12 new Australiandesigned submarines-all of these add up to an extraordinary amount of money, $100 billion. That is the real $100 billion black hole. Remember on budget night Labor's $100 billion real black hole? Remember Labor's cumulative deficits over the last 10 years in office, including a whopping and shameful deficit this financial year of $37 billion, adding up to a total of over $200 billion? For God's sake, look beyond the spin and look at the statistics. (Time expired)",108
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The last comment was not worthy of parliament.,110
212,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:34): Despite all of the allegations of spin, we have just seen more spin than a Shane Warne wrong'un. The member for Goldstein tried to spin his way out of what is a $70 billion black hole, but he will have to do better-and he will have to do better each and every day until the next election. We are going to hold him to account. He might have thought that at the last election he managed to skate through, but we all recall what happened back then. He recalls it really well. In fact, he was scarred by the experience. Most of his colleagues have made sure he was scarred by the experience. The buck-passing exercise that occurred amongst their shadow of an economic team left the blame fairly and squarely at his feet. And he is hurting-he is smarting from it. I feel a bit sorry for him because he was not the only one to blame. We all remember the budget reply speech that did not turn out to be a budget reply speech-it was more of a flick pass out the back to the shadow Treasurer, who was then given the opportunity at the Press Club a week later to detail where all these savings would be made. He failed abysmally. We then had another flick pass, and the poor old member for Goldstein was left holding the baby. There he was, with the football in his hands, left to account for their black hole. He could not do it. We all remember the 'time to call it Burke): quits' press conference, when the press secretary started motioning, in a cut throat fashion, to bring that painful press conference to an end. The pain and suffering of that experience is not about to come to an end. We are determined to make sure that excruciating, painful experience that the member for Goldstein endured lives on. His own conduct and the conduct of his colleagues have contributed to that. After the election, we saw in all of its ugliness the $11 billion black hole that the opposition went to the election with. It was only exposed because we had a hung parliament and the Independents, whom both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were negotiating with, determined that it was only fair and reasonable that the costings of both parties be placed on the table and that the sunshine be shone on what was ultimately an $11 billion black hole. Those are 11 billion reasons why those opposite are on that side of the chamber. It hurts. I know it hurts. But the reason it hurts most is that you have not learnt from your mistakes. Instead of going to the next election with an $11 billion black hole, it is looking more and more like a $70 billion black hole. This is not a figure that we have plucked out of the air. It was one of a number of figures that the member for North Sydney shared with his colleagues. In fact, I think the $70 billion was the figure he told the member for Goldstein. He also told a few other colleagues a few other figures-I think 50 and 60. Who knows? There might have even be an 80 in there. Just like the documents that are circulated with little secret markings to identify who the culprit is in the event that they are leaked, the member for Goldstein was caught out in leaking the $70 billion figure, and the member for North Sydney was brought to account in an interview.",110
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,Ms AE The Assistant Treasurer will resume his seat. I ask him to be relevant to the matter before the parliament.,111
214,Mr Robb,IMPORTANCE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask that you ask the member to withdraw that lie and that accusation that I had leaked",111
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Goldstein will resume his seat. The member for Goldstein knows he has other forms of the House to use, but the minister will withdraw.",111
216,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. The matter before the House is about transparency. I find it extraordinary that the member for Goldstein would call for transparency when nobody has more to fear from transparency than him. What we have seen with the $70 billion black hole-and that is only what they have admitted to-is that there are absolutely no plans to provide those savings at this point in time. In fact, what we saw recently was the so-called commission of audit that is going to be established.",111
217,Mr Husic,IMPORTANCE,They've got a great track record with auditors.,112
218,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Chifley reminds me of a very important point, and it goes to the question of auditing. I should have made this point a little earlier. When those opposite went to the last election with an $11 billion black hole that was ultimately exposed, the member for North Sydney came forward and said, 'But all of our costings have been audited.' He used the 'A' word. He said they were all audited. But we saw subsequent to that that, in relation to the costings of the opposition and the so called audit report which had been provided by accountants, those accountants ended up finding themselves being reprimanded for not having audited properly. In fact, they did not seek to audit those costings, even though the member for North Sydney said that they had been audited.",112

220,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The member for Chifley!,112
221,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,I appreciate the member for Chifley's concern,112
222,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,I don't.,112
223,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"about me being too tough on the opposition. I have not even begun. So we have this so-called commission of audit. This is what I like to call the chamber of horrors, because it is about locking up all of those nasty cuts that those opposite plan to make. You are just not honest enough to put them before the Australian people before an election. What you do is say: 'We've got it all under control. Trust us. Once we get elected, in the next term of parliament we'll set up this you-beaut commission and it will go through with a fine toothcomb and determine all of those places where appropriate cuts need to be taken.' If you think you need to make cuts, come clean with the Australian people and explain to them which vital services you intend to cut. What sorts of cuts are you going to make to Medicare? What sorts of cuts are you going to make to school funding? What sorts of cuts are you going to make to universities? What sorts of cuts are you going to make to family payments? These are the questions that people in electorates like mine and in communities like mine all around the country deserve to know before they go to the next election. We know about the $70 billion black hole; we just want to know how you intend to fill it. What cuts are you going to make to fill that hole? It is really interesting that we never actually see both the member for North Sydney and the member for Goldstein running side by side in one of these debates. That is because every time they open their mouths they contradict each other. They contradict each other every time they contribute to a discussion. On this question of whether or not they have costed their policies, the member for North Sydney has an answer for all occasions-the member for Goldstein knows that-but those answers are not always right. The member for North Sydney was asked a question about whether or not the coalition had done the hard yards on costing their policies. He said: Based on what we know now, we are doing all the costings. All our policies are costed. The journalist said: So you have found those savings you were looking for? And the member for North Sydney said: Yes, we have found the savings that we were looking for. That was on 13 March 2012. Just a few days earlier, on 5 March 2012, the member for Goldstein said: We haven't finalised any of our major policies … That it was a very productive week of policy work I find hard to believe. Why should we be expected to believe that they managed to do in one week what they have not managed to do in the last four years, and that is develop policies, develop plans, for Australia's future and cost them? They have not done it for four years, so I find it just a little bit difficult to believe that they did it in about a week. I have to say that I have some sympathy for the member for Goldstein, because I tend to believe him more than I believe the member for North Sydney. When the member for North Sydney says, 'Don't worry, she'll be right, all the policies are costed,' I do not believe it. The coalition have an enormous task ahead of them when it comes to filling that $70 billion black hole. They do not have any plans and, if they do, they are not prepared to share them with the Australian people because they are so scary and so nasty that nobody would ever vote for them. The coalition could come forward and say, 'We'll start to rip out the heart of Medicare,' in the way in which coalition oppositions have always wanted to do, but very rarely have they ever been brave enough to say it. Dr Stone interjecting",112
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The member for Murray might not get her opportunity to speak if she continues.,113
225,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"Which other essential services are they going to rip the guts out of in order to fund their $70 billion black hole? I mentioned earlier that the member for North Sydney and the member for Goldstein have all sorts of difficulty in agreeing on basic matters. It is a bit of a problem when they are two of the key figures in the shadow economic team. One issue where there has been a lot of disagreement has been on the question of a surplus. The government's position on a surplus is very clear: we will return the budget to surplus. That will require some difficult decisions, but we will do it because that is what the nation requires. We need to stick to the plans that we have made; they are tough fiscal plans, but, all around the world, capital markets are looking to governments to actually deliver on these plans. We are a government that is intent on doing that and, by doing that, we will keep pressure off interest rates and keep interest rates low for families. The member for Goldstein was asked whether or not the opposition would deliver a surplus. 'Would they commit to a surplus?' He said, 'Well, it just depends.' The member for North Sydney-not as directly contradictory as he normally is-simply said, 'Maybe.' The Leader of the Opposition said, 'We will do it as quickly as possible.' But then there was poor old Senator Abetz, who did not get the memo. Senator Abetz was out there and said, 'Look, we are not in the business of making extravagant promises.' Promising to return the budget to surplus is not of itself an extravagant promise, but when you are wallowing around in a $70 billion black hole, that is a very ambitious commitment to make; a very extravagant one, to use Senator Abetz's term. When it comes to the contradictions in their positions on key questions of economic policy-and of course this matter of public importance goes to the importance of transparency in budget policy when it comes to business making the decisions that business needs to make-there are very few areas that have exposed just how flaky the policy approach of the opposition has been on economic policy quite as much as the question of tax cuts for business. We have seen them cutting each other up over the last couple of weeks. Talk about poor judgment! Who was the brains trust that decided that they were going to lead the Liberal Party off this cliff? Who decided that they were going to come into this place and vote against tax cuts for business? If you go through the Hansard, you will see that just about every person on that side of the House came into this place and professed their 'unabashed support' for businesses large and small-'generators of jobs', 'creators of wealth'; but not worthy of a tax cut. When it comes to delivering a tax cut for them, they want to talk about how tough it is out there in the business environment. They talk the economy down, but when it comes to delivering them tax relief they come into this place and vote against it. To their eternal shame they will do that, and each and every one of them will have to go back to their electorates and explain why they voted against tax relief for the businesses in their electorate. On the question of business tax cuts, just last year the Leader of the Opposition said, firstly, 'The government should keep its commitments,' and, secondly, 'We support company tax cuts.' But then, just a couple of days ago, the member for North Sydney was asked the same question about whether or not they would support a cut in the company tax rate. The journalist asked, 'Are you signalling that when this comes to the House you will support a cut in company tax?' The member for North Sydney said, 'No, No, No, No, No,' and just for further effect he said, 'We have said no.' Six noes. Not one, not two, not three; six noes. When it comes to cutting tax, they say no. In fact, when it comes to any good idea proposed by this government, they say no. The only thing they will ever say yes to is a big fat tax cut to the likes of Clive Palmer. We have seen over the last couple of daysand in particular in the last 24 hours-some  You would have thought there would be a handful of people in the Liberal Party sensible enough to come forward and at least acknowledge that perhaps it was a little bit of overreach. Talk about conspiracy theories: the CIA! The only CIA that the Australian people have to worry about is Clive's influence agency. Those on the other side seem rather beholden to it. They want to give a big fat tax cut to the millionaire miners but not to the Australian- (Time expired)",113
226,Dr STONE,IMPORTANCE," Probably no government since Federation have spent so much time with personalised attacks on an opposition rather than actually explaining their policy and their extraordinary debasement of Australia's opportunities and the futures of our kids. Andrew Robb, the shadow finance minister, has just observed in the press today that a staggering 73 per cent of finance minister Penny Wong's press releases are attempts at diversionary attacks on the opposition leader, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman. There is something going on. There is something not smelling right in Denmark, as they say. The Australian public is seriously sick of Labor's endless negativity and shrill attempts to distract everyone from what they are doing with the economy. Unfortunately the public is not unwise and they are experiencing the impact of the government's debt levels that are now afflicting all Australians-some $6,000 for every man, woman and child. We have young people now in despair and not able to pursue careers that they imagined would be something for them. We have empty shops and retail confidence at rock-bottom levels. We in fact have an economy that should be bubbling along, that should be in great shape, but that is now looking pretty bad. As our first speaker, the shadow finance minister, said, our economy unfortunately has structural deficits rivalling the poor men of Europe. Labor is desperate to distract the public and paper over the fact that it has converted the coalition government's legacy of no government debt-$70 billion in net assets and a $20 billion surplus-into a staggering $130 billion net debt, with interest payments on average of about $6.5 billion annually. Under Labor, productivity has slowed, growth has stalled and only a few new jobs have been created. We are in a serious mess. None of Labor's debt can be paid off until it manages to produce a surplus, something it has not been able to conceive. It will have to be a very decent surplus to seriously tackle Labor's debt. On the current prediction for what the Treasurer, Mr Swan, calls a waferthin surplus, it would take over 100 years to pay off Labor's debt. As I said, our structural deficit is problem. We do not hear about that. I wonder if Mr Swan still believes that all we have to do is pray to China. 'China will save us,' he says, 'We are such a lucky country.' I doubt the Treasurer is sleeping well at night, now that China has downgraded this year's growth forecast to well below its average for the last 10 years. This government has hung all of its hopes for getting away with its profligate spending on rivers of gold continuing to flow out of the mines of Australia to feed China's insatiable demand for new goods and services. Unfortunately it is not that simple. China's growth is dependent on a strong performance in its own export markets as well as in its domestic demand. Europe's debt crisis obviously affects China's exports and that in turn translates into slower demand for what they want to buy from us. So we have to be smarter than simply saying, 'Spend, spend, spend-China will fix us.' If only we had a government that was more disciplined and had some depth of understanding of interacting factors, causes and effects-those sorts of factors that influence a nation's prospects. Instead, in the last four years we have had four of the country's biggest deficits. We have a government, typical of all previous Labor governments, that has overspent taxpayers' hard earned cash on hair brained and/or totally mismanaged schemes. Labor has wasted not just millions but billions of dollars and it continues to borrow about another $100 million per day to fund its unstoppable government spending. We have a huge Public Service administrating more government red tape and regulation than this nation has ever seen. The coalition will reduce that Public Service. Take the pink batts. Everyone in Australia knows what I mean by those two words. a serious Mention those two words to ordinary Australians and they either guffaw or groan. This program must go down as one of the most misguided, mismanaged and deadly that any government has ever cooked up in any country. Labor spent more than $1 billion to put the batts into hapless people's roofs and over $1 billion to take them out again when too many houses caught fire. You can understand why this government would also want to create smoke screens to hide the fact that they spent over $16 billion on new school buildings. But unless you were one of the lucky few in the independent school system you did not get what you wanted or needed. You could not employ locals and the value for money was just a joke. Meanwhile, on Labor's watch, we are now just about at the bottom of the OECD league tables in terms of literacy and numeracy improvements and teacher capacity. It is not just about a new BER hall, sadly, and this government does not get that. They think a website will fix it up: the new NAPLAN and My School websites. Sadly, that is a cruel joke as well. Imagine the cruelty of this government's intentions when it identified the need for a national disability insurance scheme-something the coalition also understands the need for-but did not and cannot put a single red cent on the table to turn it into reality. Not a red cent. But they have put it out there as though it is going to happen. I have had people with disabilities in my electorate saying: 'Isn't this fantastic! At last, a national insurance scheme.' I say, 'Look I'm terribly sorry; it's a great idea but they've got no money.' Imagine a government that introduces a paid parental leave scheme which is the cheapest and nastiest scheme you will find anywhere in the developed world. On top of it being the cheapest and nastiest it denies these new mothers any superannuation at the time of their leave. So the poverty of older women in Australia continues-no superannuation continuation in their working lives. Imagine a country that slaps a new national food plan on the table, very proudly, acknowledging that globally and especially in our region there will be enormous additional demand for fine food. At the same time it proposes to take away much of the key means of production in the Murray-Darling Basin-the water-from farmers in what is the largest food-producing zone in Australia. They have slashed Customs and Biosecurity funding as well and they have slashed the research and development effort that is going to help farmers innovate and meet that global food task. It is cruel and absurd. No wonder there is now a crisis in confidence in one of the nation's biggest employers, the food and farm production manufacturing sector. Applications to do agricultural science courses have crashed, universities have halved their course offerings and skilled and graduate jobs in agriculture go begging. People have basically given up on this government. Then there is the Gillard government's $500 million carbon farming initiative. There are doubts now that it can ever deliver real emissions reductions and the scheme will be too costly and too bound with red tape for most to even bother about it. The Greens have a lot to answer for. They are a key cause of the urgent smoke-andmirror campaigns of the Labor government. With the Greens, Labor are trying to cover up the economic troubles their marriage has helped to create, and the vulnerabilities they cannot understand or can no longer respond to. The carbon tax was the price of the keys to the Lodge. We all understand that, but we are the laughing stock of the world. Other countries like us acknowledge the need to live in a carbon constrained world but no one else intends to smash their competitiveness, to beggar their people by destroying jobsby closing down businesses or shrinking them-because the cost of their energy will be beyond any reasonable price. All of us on the opposition benches are closely in touch with our big businesses and also our small businesses, which are the generators of wealth and opportunity in our economy. We acknowledge the risks these businesses take. Unlike Labor, we applaud when they prosper and grow the wealth and productivity of the nation. We acknowledge that these businesses are now in great fear of the impacts of risings costs, as they see their power bills surge in anticipation of 1 July. The Murray Goulburn Cooperative, it is Australia's biggest dairy company, has worked out it will cost them, per annum, over $15 million a year extra. All of this will be passed onto their farmers, because the big supermarket duopoly laughs when they suggest putting up the prices of dairy products on the shelves. This is the sort of country we are now living in, a country where Labor's spin gets desperately louder and shriller every day. We just had an example from the previous speaker-attack the man, attack the woman but do not for heaven's sake let anyone look closely at what is going on with the figures, the finances, debt and the deficit.

227,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE, You get to hear a lot of crazy things in public life and in the sweep of public affairs. Only a few days ago we heard that apparently the CIA in tandem with the environmental movement is working tirelessly to shut down our Australian coal industry.,117
228,Mr Burke,IMPORTANCE,Shame on them!,117
229,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"I thought-exactly-I had heard it all, Minister, and then I saw this MPI. This is an MPI in which those opposite are calling for us to have budget transparency. I am going to hear the mafia call for law and order campaigns next. These people on the other side are incapable of demonstrating what they are able to do in terms of even meeting a surplus, even being able to show where they could make savings. Mr MCCormack interjecting",117
230,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Member for Riverina, you can rest safe at night. Can I tell you, member for Riverina, that those opposite have been working very hard. In fact, the member for Goldstein, as your shadow minister for finance, is working night and day to find those $70 billion in savings. And do you know what? After all that painstaking research and all that time at night, he has his eureka moment: $50 million in savings in government consultancies-$50 million down, $69,950 million of savings to go. Thank you for your great work in identifying savings. What a joke. We have had the fastest fiscal consolidation in four decades, and the best they can do is reach for that old chestnut of government consultancies where they reckon they can save $50 million. You know what? I will be happy to compare our record with the record of those opposite any day. We inherited inflation at the just under four per cent, now under three per cent. With regards to total tax take, when those opposite were in power tax as a percentage of GDP was close to 24 per cent; now it is 21 per cent and headed lower. Regarding interest rates, there were only six months of the 11 years that they were in office during which it got as low as 4.25 per cent. Regarding spending, the member for Goldstein lectures us about spending. Nominate a year in which those opposite were able to cut government spending. One year; just one year-nominate it. You cannot. In 11 years, they were unable to reduce real spending, and in fact it grew in the last five yearsMr Tehan interjecting",117
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The member for Wannon is warned!,117
232,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"When those opposite were in government, spending grew by close to four per cent every year. It has only grown by an average of 1.5 per cent a year under this government. The comparison is huge. If you look at it, we have had higher growth than many countries who had to go through the GFC; lower inflation; and lower unemployment. We are able to demonstrate a record that is way better than those opposite. We have been asked to be transparent. had Those opposite claim that apparently-I saw this the other day-they have 40 of 49 policy areas completed. Can you just name oneand not something small? Name us something that you have been able to achieve? You have said you are not bringing Work Choices back but where is your actual IR policy? You have now been for years working your way away from the claim that you are bringing back Work Choices, and the minute the business community sticks a stick in the cage, you suddenly find your courage and say: 'Oh no. We're bringing in flexibility.' Everyone in the general community knows that when you are talking about flexibility you are only talking about one thing. The talk about transparency and they are unable, for example, to meet this simple challenge. Last weekend economist Stephen Koukoulas, ex Citibank, a one-time prime ministerial economics adviser, tweeted simply this: The Govt publish its budget data twice a year: CIA! Can you publish your costings & program cuts? Just once? He tweeted that to Joe Hockey, and Joe Hockey got uptight and responded to me by saying: 'That's unfair. You guys can't even get board appointments right.' I am thinking: you get back to me when you can work out how to appoint an auditor and then you can lecture me on how that should work. ",117
233,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Or catering companies; that is right. The member for Moreton rightly points out when they want to challenge immigration department figures, they go to the caterers. Who are the chief immigration officers on Nauru? The guys from MasterChef? They are unable to stand up to the challenge. We are being challenged to be transparent. Let us be transparent about the decision-making processes of the economic team opposite. Laurie Oakes back in February talked about the economic decision making of those opposite. He said: In August last year, as the Coalition's expenditure review committee looked for potential savings, there was a leak. A news report claimed that documents from the so-called 'razor gang'this is the one that works hard to find $50 million in savings to meet a $70 billion targetrevealed a warning by Hockey that $70 billion needed to be found. In fact, well-placed sources say, the documents did not contain an overall savings target at all. Hockey provided it to shadow ministers when he spoke to them in person. And-here's the devious bit-he gave each of his colleagues a different figure. This from those opposite-there is trust aplenty in those opposite.",118
234,Mr Fitzgibbon,IMPORTANCE,It might have been the,118
235,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"That is right. The member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, points out rightly that it was the CIA perhaps. But those opposite are calling for transparency, yet even within their own ranks, within their so-called 'razor gang, they do not trust each other and hide real figures and are unable to show how they will get to surplus. In fact, in early February they all took a big step back from even committing themselves to a surplus. In one week we had the member for Warringah, the member for Goldstein and the member for Curtin all taking a big step back as to when they would actually put a surplus together. We have committed to that process. They have been unable to, and their $70 billion hole has not been made any easier by their refusal to support the minerals resource rent tax. The reason is this: opposition policy is being shaped in the shadow of a magnate, and that magnate is Clive Palmer. When I think of Clive-our national treasure-I wonder where all the good billionaires have gone. Look at the quality of billionaires overseas. Bill Gates, former CEO of Microsoft, is worth $61 billion and has donated between $28 billion and $34 billion to charity. He has his Giving Pledge, a moral commitment of America's richest families. Billionaires in the US will donate at least 50 per cent of their fortunes to charitable causes of their own choosing. Michael Bloomberg is worth $19.5 billion and has signed up to the Giving Pledge; David Rockefeller-I know that they do not like Rockefeller opposite-is worth $2.2 billion and has signed up; Ted Turner, founder of CNN, is worth $2.1 billion; Boone Pickens, $1.1 billion; Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is worth $44 billion and has promised to give away a full 99 per cent of his wealth. Then we turn back here to our home-grown billionaires. Over there they are building betting futures for others. Over here they are doing their best to wreck the A-League. What a contrast. That is what our billionaires do. Over there they donate half their wealth and here they put on tinfoil hats with antennas saying 'Take me to your magnate'. This is what we get from our billionaires: 'The CIA and environmentalists in an unholy alliance to destroy the coal industry'. What has happened to our homegrown billionaires? Why am I so concerned?

241,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"It is about transparency of the budget process. Those opposite have said they will repeal the MRRT and will be doing so because they have got someone who, since 2004-05, has donated a total of $3.7 million to the coalition. Mr MCCormack interjecting",119
242,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Wait for it, Member for Riverina: compare the $3.7 million Clive Palmer has given to your side with the $150,000 he has given us.

243,Mr CHRISTENSEN,IMPORTANCE, The admirable Assistant Treasurer,119
244,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The member for Dawson should have listened earlier when I said that people will use appropriate titles or they will not be heard.,119
245,Mr CHRISTENSEN,IMPORTANCE,"The Assistant Treasurer and the member for Chifley talked about Clive Palmer and the CIA. I do not know about the CIA but, gee, I wish I had one of those memory erasers that the Men in Black have because I cannot get back the 25 minutes of my life that was just wasted listening to the previous member's speech, but at least I can forget about it. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance, which is: The urgent need for the Government to deliver budget transparency for the business community. The words of those opposite might rubbish billionaires but their economic policies rubbish families and small businesses right across this nation. Transparency is definitely needed. It is not just an urgent matter for business; it is an urgent matter for the community and the country as a whole. Small business is the backbone of this country. It is small business that finds itself at the pointy end of some of the worse policies that any Australian government has ever produced. When small business is hurting, families are hurting. Right now small businesses are at a loss as to what the future holds for them. They see a government that is out of control. They see a government that is going out of its way to destroy the economy, industries, jobs and, quite honestly, families. They see a government desperately trying to hide-like a bunch of school kids who just broke the vase-the evidence, trying to hide the broken pieces of the economy and sweeping the evidence of their own recklessness and stupidity straight under the carpet. Manufacturing a network of deceit and fabrication to cover its tracks is not the answer. The business community needs certainty and not the certainty that is being peddled by this government, not the certainty of tax, tax and more tax, for that is certain failure. The best predictor of future behaviour for this government is its past behaviour. We look and see what this government has done. It is desperately trying to hide all of these failures, trying to sweep them under the rug and trying to hide the cost blowouts. In so many different programs it is trying to hide the waste, trying to hide the record budget deficits and trying to hide the record debt. But the problem is that there is no rug big enough to hide all that because it needs a bigger and bigger rug every day. Remember when the government said the 2011-12 budget deficit would be $12 billion? That was just 12 months ago. Then it was revised to $22.6 billion. The budget deficit has almost doubled in a year. Mr Ewen Jones: It's worse than that.",119
246,Mr CHRISTENSEN,IMPORTANCE,"You think it would not get any worse than that, as the member for Herbert said, but now somehow the most recent budget update puts it at $37 billion. Is it even possible that anyone in the world-the world's greatest Treasurer, for instance-could be that incompetent with a budget forecast? Maybe not, because the 2011-12 year is another write-off for this Labor government and another write-off for this nation. It is another Labor deficit to add to the collection. If you are going to stuff it up in the great old Labor tradition, you might as well go all the way; you might as will push as many costs under that rug as you can. You might as well take some costs out of future budget deficits and stick them under the rug too. What we have is a smoke and mirrors situation going on in this government in a desperate bid to produce a budget surplus, just one. We are hoping you can get it, guys, just one. For the benefit of those of us who have never seen a Labor surplus in our tax, lifetime, such as the member for Longman on this side, let us see if you can get it or at least get another rug to cover up what will turn out to be another deficit for as long as it takes to get to an election. While the government is trying to manufacture their first surplus, we have minister after minister come into this place to justify their economy-destroying policies, the ones we were told would not happen-there will be no carbon tax under this rug. The carbon tax cannot be hidden any longer. We have seen the Labor Party and the Greens constructing this elaborate new paradigm that is supposed to stop a tax from being a tax. They try to justify the carbon tax with the illusion that there will be this wealth of green jobs. So where are these green jobs? Ask Spain how they are going to get all their green jobs and how they are going with that. Go down to Immigration and ask them, because that is where they are-all the young unemployed are coming to Australia because the whole green job thing did not quite work out for them. In addition to the green jobs furphy, the government have tried to invent this new economy. That is because they stuffed up the old one. You can only talk about a new economy for so long because eventually people stop and realise, 'Hang on, this is just the old economy except there are fewer jobs and we are worse off.' The government try to dress up their carbon tax as the clean energy future, but what business really wants is for government to be the ones who come clean-to tell the truth. Business wants to know where they truly stand, not where the government can make people think they stand. And if they are going to come clean on the carbon tax they should do the same with the mining tax. Let us not try to justify this bad tax by selling it as something that it is not. The government cannot keep saying to businesses that they are spreading the wealth around to every postcode, in that dull voice that the Treasurer says it in. Giving a one per cent tax cut to companies is not spreading the wealth around; it is only giving a little break to companies. The government might be able to con a lot of the people like that but not small businesses. Most businesses are small and it is small businesses that are more likely than not-70 per cent of them, in fact-to be sole traders or partnerships, not companies. They will not be the beneficiaries of this spreading of the wealth, but they will be the ones paying the extra three per cent in superannuation that the government desperately is trying to say it is doing. What a disgrace and what an affront to businesses around this nation for the government to say that it is the one creating the super when it is actually businesses doing it. That is not spreading wealth, it is increasing the burden even more. It should not try and justify the mining tax by telling us that it is going to fund things that it is clearly not going to fund. As a bit of a segue here, it is incredible that we had the Leader of the House give this statement today. He is now the minister for urban rorts: snout-in the-trough Albanese rorting roads funding right into his own electorate. But we had the Leader of the House point of order that goes to relevance and misleading of the House. I know you were busy at the time, but it is about a reflection on the Leader of the House by the member for Dawson.",120
247,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," I did not hear the reflection. Someone was getting my attention to my side, so I cannot rule on that, but if the member for Dawson would assist the chamber",121
248,Mr CHRISTENSEN,IMPORTANCE,"I will withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. We had the Leader of the House here yesterday telling us the mining tax was going to fund the Peak Downs Highway, an important project for the region that I live in but, according to the budget, the work will actually start before the mining tax revenue kicks in. He goes on to say that the mining tax is going to fund the Mackay ring road study, which has already been done at a cost of $10 million. So the government cannot claim the mining tax is going to fund something that has happened in the past, unless the minister has a TARDIS. I am eagerly waiting next week's episode to see if the mining tax is going to fund the Sydney Harbour Bridge; it is only eighty years old. The only way the government could create a good economy is to start with great one. You only have to look at Australia's gross debt, which is third only to Iceland and Ireland, to see how they have managed to do that. Imagine what a real government could have done from the position this economy was in when Labor took over. For a start, there was money in the bank, not a record debt. Thanks to Labor's reckless spending, Australia is now forced to pay $6 billion a year in interest on the debt they have created. Coincidently it is estimated the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which we support, would cost around $6 billion a year to implement. Labor is trying to create this illusion that it is going to fund the NDIS and the coalition is not. Well, if Labor supported it it would be in its budget this year. On side of the House we support the NDIS, and we have the ability to fix the economy so that it can become a reality. In asking for transparency we ask for truth, because we have had a very, very long time where we have had exactly the opposite from this government.",121
249,Ms SMYTH,IMPORTANCE," I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance. I am a bit astounded that this is an MPI that is being put by those opposite, because I would not have thought that one from the opposition benches would be seeking to raise matters about either transparency or concern about the business community at a time when two very significant issues are facing them. When they come into this place they are clearly opposing the interests of those they repeatedly propose to represent by opposing tax cuts for companies and for small business. They have shown themselves to be very emphatic on those points. It is extraordinary that they are coming in today and putting forward an MPI which professes to support the business community. And in terms of transparency, it is just as extraordinary that they are here today talking about economic transparency when the hot topic at the moment is exactly what the opposition has committed itself to in terms of budget cuts and exactly what this new commission of audit constitutes in terms of the opposition's policies. The opposition have for almost 18 months gone about this place calling themselves an alternative government, trying at every opportunity to find a seat on the government benches of this place. Yet, when they are asked to provide very basic details about their economic policies, very basic details about costings and very basic details of what they do stand for, they go back to being the opposition. They go back to being not this accountable and they go back to indicating that they will reveal this in due course, that it is somewhere off in the distance and that at some point in the future they will provide information for people to be able to put their finger on what the opposition represents in terms of job cuts and cuts to health and education budgets-all of those things that we inevitably see whenever any conservative government comes to power. I am certainly very familiar with that because we have recently been the beneficiaries of the Baillieu government in Victoria. We see very clearly that while in opposition members of conservative parties are very reluctant to provide specifics about their economic policies and to provide appropriate details about what their priorities are, and when they get into government, as is the case in Victoria with Ted Baillieu, they sit on their hands, they do nothing and they allow the state to stagnate, or they decide to slash and burn. We have certainly seen that in previous governments at a federal level and very certainly at a state level, in my state. So it is extraordinary that today we are being invited by those opposite to talk about issues of transparency and support for the business community when they so obviously fail repeatedly on both counts. I am however very pleased to speak about this government's track record of transparency in relation to our economy and in relation to our support for the business community. I am somewhat disappointed to have heard the member for Goldstein, who brought this matter before the House, reflect on the events of the global financial crisis. So regularly as individual members, when we go to our electorates and see the benefits of construction projects in schools and housing developments, we hear of the benefits for ordinary people as a result of the stimulus spending put in place by this government. We see the practical effects of support for jobs in our own communities as a result of the very real policy commitments this government made during the global financial crisis. It is extraordinary that the member for Goldstein stands repeatedly in this place and pretends that it did not occur. We have heard that throughout the three contributions of the members who have spoken from the opposition benches this afternoon. We have heard denial of the global financial crisis as reality which affected the world several years ago and is continuing to be felt by countries around the world. We saw denial of the benefits of the Building the Education Revolution by the member for Murray. I can confirm that the 68 schools in my electorate which have been the beneficiaries of this government's economic responsibility at a very difficult time are very thankful for the commitments we made-the $110 million spent across my electorate. We heard denial from the member for Dawson about the financial impacts of natural disasters. He, as a member who has been directly affected by natural disasters, should know very well about the economic impacts that people in his own electorate must have felt and must continue to feel as a result. He must know that there are realities for our economy which must be faced as a result of those natural disasters. So it is utterly ludicrous for the people who have stood here this afternoon, seemingly talking about transparency and support for the business community, to be denying the realities of pressures being felt by our economy and denying the reality that this government is responding to those financial pressures. It is absolutely extraordinary that the opposition are speaking about transparency and accountability, because we have heard their proposals for economic transparency and accountability. I must say they leave rather a lot to be desired in relation to the most recent extraordinary plan about an audit commission. This is seemingly the way they are going to recover from the $70 billion black hole they have announced by various means will result in the event that they find themselves in office. The reason I and others on this side of the House are incredulous about this so-called a 'audit constitution' is that the understanding of members of the opposition and indeed the shadow Treasurer of what it means to conduct an audit and what an audit represents was made pretty clear at the last election. Seemingly audited accounts were revealed to have an $11 billion hole in them. We know that on ABC in August 2010 the shadow Treasurer said that their accounts had been audited. He said: You know what? If the fifth-biggest accounting firm in Australia signs off on your numbers it is a brave person to start saying there are accounting tricks. I tell you it is audited. Apparently they said that there were savings of $11.5 billion that the coalition had identified as part of their audit. This audit is an extraordinary thing because we now know that not only has it been revealed through appropriate scrutiny of those accounts that there was indeed an $11.5 billion hole in this supposed audit but that the ICA's appeal tribunal found that the audit the coalition had organised was not an audit at all. So industry bodies are aware of exactly what they mean by an audit. The Australian public and the Australian Treasury are certainly aware of what they mean by an audit. So in terms of transparency the opposition have a little bit of form about what it is to conduct an audit. They have a bit of form about whether or not their audit can be relied on. So it is with incredulity that all of us on this side hear about an audit commission which they propose to set up to be able to identify cuts to services, cuts to budgets-the inevitable things that conservatives do when they come to office. All Australians have come to know that. They are certainly coming to know that in my state. I expect that when the appropriate scrutiny is applied to those opposite, their audit will reveal to be exactly what it was at the last election-a sham. By contrast, we have been absolutely clear with the Australian people about our support for small business and for the business community in general. It could not be clearer that those opposite stand for undermining the business community generally undermining small business that they so heartily profess to support when they come to this place, when they are out on the hustings, when they are back in their electorates indicating that they have done their very best to support small business, despite the fact that they inevitably will vote against cuts to taxes for small businesses and they vote against company tax cuts. We heard today from the Treasurer about the practical realities of what the coalition's proposals for company tax and small business tax reform that we are undertaking, and that they are opposing, would mean. We know that they oppose the tax cut for companies. In fact, they want to increase company tax by 1.5 per cent. We know that this means an estimated $392 million cost to the manufacturing sector. We know that it means an estimated $270 million cost to the retail sector. Quite frankly, if you are going to come into this place and put up a matter of public importance about support for the business community, it would be worthwhile not adding to their costs through your public policies. This is an extraordinary motion and one which should not be supported by the House.",122
250,Mr WYATT,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on this matter of public importance about the urgent need for government to deliver budget transparency to the business community. Let me start by talking about the fact that transparency requires honesty, integrity and openness. I think the Australian public demands that of us. When I walk itself through my electorate and meet with small business owners and with other people, they ask why we do not put things up front for them so that they can understand the implications when it comes to the financial management of their businesses, including the financial management of their own homes. It is not hard to provide numerous and examples of gross ineptitude by the government in demonstrating budget transparency. If I were to do an analysis of all the answers that the Treasurer gives in this chamber to questions around budget and fiscal management, then I would find that there would be very little in the way of transparent answers, as opposed to attacks on the opposition and attacks on individualsindividuals who create the job opportunities for other workers which the government says that they represent but that we forget. That is a factor within any economy. There are many facets to the economy that are important to the way this country develops its wealth and the way it supports the families and communities that we have been elected to represent. It would not hurt have some transparency. It would not hurt to have the detail so that people can make judgments. There is a need to promote transparency so as to improve consumer confidence and assist the business community to effectively plan for the future. Just look at this week: we have had the biggest tax on our most successful industry passed by the Senate and yet the companies affected do not know the full detail. Today, when the Treasurer was asked what the arrangements with the big three companies were, he was not able to provide transparency around what has been negotiated and around what their contribution will be to the tax. We have the carbon tax coming out on 1 July this year and still we do not know the final detail. I have companies in my electorate that say, 'Can you provide any of the detail that will roll out with this so we can consider what the costs will be, what our decisions will be about the provision of services, what the decisions will have to be about our financial viability and about other arrangements we have in place?' I was talking to a builder who tells me that he now has on the bottom of all his invoices a reference to the fact that his price will be affected by the carbon tax and its implications. How can the Treasurer claim to be back in the black in this financial year's budget when he does not include future policy costings that the Gillard government is committed to but does include costings for policies that do not have the detail in the legislation and have not had the proper modelling released? However, what the Treasurer can take claim for is creating uncertainty in our business community. How can our business and industrial sectors make decisions to address the compliance requirements? The flow-on effects of these taxes are huge and to our business community does not yet know the detail. Let us look at some facts here. Labor have consecutively delivered the four biggest deficits in Australian history: $27 billion, $55 billion, $48 billion and $37 billion. The numbers do not lie. Labor say that this financial year is different. They say it will be back in the black. They say they have changed their ways, but we all know that a leopard does not change its spots. They say they have realised that pulling out Australia's credit card at every opportunity is not the definition of being fiscally conservative. It has taken them a while, yet if you look at the information the Treasurer provides in the budget you will notice there are no ongoing financial commitments to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As a public servant, I used to rely on the portfolio statements and the budget statements to that forward plan in the work that I did. When I look through some of the portfolio statements now, I find there are gaps or I find there are elements of the financial thinking of the Treasurer and the relevant minister that puzzle me-their thinking is not reflected in the transparency that is required in order for people to make business decisions. Nor is there any mention of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation which is, in total, a hundred billion dollar black hole in the budget. Not to mention, within that one hundred million, the debacle that is the National Broadband Network. A lack of planning, a lack of consultation and, ultimately, a lack of transparency has plagued this government since former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd formed government in 2007. I was at a breakfast just two mornings ago where the people who I was sitting with said that at one time there used to be green papers and white papers, which allowed the private sector or the business sector to provide input into the process before it became entrenched in a bill that was debated in this chamber. They had the opportunity to argue for a reduction in red tape. They had the opportunity of reflecting on the impact on them and on their business. We no longer do that; I have not seen evidence of that for some time. I hope that it is a practice that trickles back in. The coalition would certainly be committed to a process that engages those affected. Accounting tricks to shuffle money and hide spending so as to keep it off the budget bottom line contribute to the government's projected surplus, which is one-tenth the of the deterioration in this year's budget deficit over the six months between last year's May budget and the November midyear economic and financial outlook. The biggest example of this mess is the government's Energy Security Fund. The government recognises that the carbon tax poses a threat to Australia's energy security. In response, it will spend just over one thousand million dollars this year to support energy markets. It will also do this in the 2013-14 and again in the 2014-15 financial years. But according to this government the carbon tax poses no threat to our energy security, because the government are spending less than $1 million dollars on it. You would think that if the government took the implementation of the carbon tax seriously-which, by the way, is coming into effect in the 2012-13 financial year-they would fund the Energy Security Fund at an amount equivalent to the other three financial years. The government only care about their promise to have a surplus next year and they put this above the security of our energy industry. You cannot play political games with our industries. Businesses cannot cope with this uncertainty and lack of transparency much longer. Businesses within Hasluck want certainty. How can a small business plan for the future, when they do not know what the cost of the carbon tax will be on their bottom line? Small businesses are already struggling with many of the impositions placed on them over the last three years. Small business owners in Hasluck often say to me that they cannot make ends meet at the moment and cannot budget for the carbon tax because they do not know what the flow-on cost will be. We still do not know who the 500 companies are that will pay the carbon tax. How will flow-on costs be measured? There are many questions within the scope of fiscal size and financial planning and within the budgetary cycle that need to be transparent to all those affected. When my colleague the member for Moreton has his turn to speak, I will be interested to hear what he will say with respect to transparency. The Treasurer still refuses to tell the Australian public the real story about the full costings of all the associated measures surrounding this new tax. He should also explain what he promised the big three mining companies. This tax imposes a significant new administrative burden on all mining companies, even if they are below the government's threshold for paying the tax. Wouldn't it be an incredible situation for the Australian public and the voters if they had honesty and transparency? They could see and understand the bottom line, they could see clearly and understand what was contained within the budget. Elements of the budget would not be hidden or taken out of the bottom line and they could be fully conversant with where the carbon tax sits in the context of the total budget. We expect it of financial planning and of businesses. They expect from this government and this Treasurer a clear indication of what the financial implications will be for them and for the work they have planned that will develop the Australian economy to a position of strength within a global society and economy.",124
251,Ms RISHWORTH,IMPORTANCE," It is very interesting to hear from the opposition about budget transparency. Indeed, it is not their strong suit. At the election the government had many policies out there, all costed and transparent, while the opposition turned up with no costings whatsoever. Then, at the last minute, they decided they would get a company to do it. They would not put it to Treasury for costing. They put it to a firm that, it turned out, was fined for professional misconduct. So we see that the coalition's commitment to transparency is not that great. This government will always cost its policies. We will always be responsible economic managers. This has been shown many times in the way that we go about our business. We have shown, even during the financial crisis, that we act in a fiscally responsible way. As we recover from the global financial crisis, once again it has taken this government to budget the largest fiscal consolidation ever in this country's history. It has taken this government to act to support business. In contrast we see that those on the other side have not learnt from their mistakes of the last election, but continue to rack up potential debt with uncosted policies. We see a $70 billion black hole from which they keep promising things, whether it is a superannuation increase or their climate change policy, which will cost the average household if they end up imposing the $1,300 tax. They have not been clear about where this money is coming from. When we look at delivering budget transparency for the business community and for the nation, we on this side of the House have been doing a very good job. This is in sharp contrast to the coalition, which have provided no transparency on where their $70 billion in cuts will come from to fill their black hole. The opposition clearly refused to put their costings to Treasury. I ask: what have they got to hide? Their policies depend last upon who speaks for the opposition. Some have said they are done and dusted and have been put into the drawer ready to be pulled out at election time, but others say that no final policy exists. The shadow finance minister said that no policies are ready to go. It is hard to know which of these is true. It is certainly not transparent. To conclude, on this side of the House the government has worked on providing certainty for business, on providing budget transparency and on acting in the interests of businesses. On the other side of the House there is disarray, uncertainty and no transparency when it comes to budgetary matters. I look forward to the opposition's budget reply when we come back here in May. I hope they can show some transparency about where their cuts will come from.",127
252,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Bill 2012 Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill Customs Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill Returned from Senate Messages received from the Senate returning the bills without amendment or request. NA Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report  behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs I present the committee's report entitled In the wake of disasters: volume two: the affordability of residential strata title insurance, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.  present the report of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs into the affordability of residential strata title insurance. This is the second and final volume of its inquiry into the wake of disasters, which has examined a range of insurance issues following the natural disasters that have devastated many parts of Australia in recent years. The impact of Cyclone Lua in Western Australia and severe flooding in parts of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland remind us that we live in a place that is prone to natural disasters. All Australians need to be able to access affordable and appropriate insurance to provide cover against the risk of being 2012 affected by these kinds of events. We need a healthy and competitive insurance industry that is responsive to the needs of its customers and has the capacity to provide 2011 adequate cover at affordable prices for all Australians. On 27 February 2012 the House of 2011 Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs tabled its report In the wake of disasters: volume one: inquiry into the operation of the insurance industry during disaster events. The report made a range of recommendations aimed at ensuring that the insurance industry has the capacity to respond to people's claims on their policies in a timely manner. During the aforementioned inquiry the committee also received evidence about spiralling insurance costs, both in disaster affected areas and across Australia more broadly. In particular, the committee heard of extremely concerning increases in residential strata title insurance in North Queensland. In view of these concerns the report also recommended the immediate establishment of a task force to address the rising costs and potential market failure in the insurance industry across Australia. Many unit and apartment owners, particularly those in North Queensland, have been confronted with increases of over 500 per cent in their insurance premiums in recent years. This has been a result of a complex range of contributing factors, none more so than a glaring lack of competition in the market for residential strata title insurance. The committee recognised the urgency of residential strata title insurance affordability and resolved to conduct an inquiry into the issue with a short reporting time frame. The committee received the terms of reference on 24 November 2011, conducted four very well-attended public hearings and received 431 submissions and 17 supplementary submissions. The committee delivered its report today, outlining a clear and direct course of action to both alleviate immediate hardship and address longer term sustainability issues. The recommendations contained in this report call on the government to strengthen the regulatory frameworks of bodies corporate, examine the methodologies for the assessment and pricing of risk, increase transparency in all strata insurance cost components and raise consumers' awareness of their rights and responsibilities. The committee is asking the ACCC to examine the cost drivers and relative profitability in the provision of strata insurance policies by insurers and to investigate whether there has been anticompetitive behaviour in the North Queensland strata insurance market. I reiterate that the committee responded expeditiously to the urgent issue of residential strata title insurance affordability. The committee trusts that the Australian government will be similarly prompt in implementing appropriate and much needed reforms in response to the recommendations contained in this report. I thank the hundreds of people who made submissions to this inquiry and the many more who attended public hearings and bravely spoke about their dire circumstances. While there is no quick fix for this complex issue, I trust that this report sets in motion the actions required to balance the insurance market and address affordability issues for strata title insurance. I thank the local senators and members who lent their support to their constituents during the public hearings, including Senator MCLucas and the member for Herbert. The two supplementary members to the committee-the member for Leichhardt and the member for Dawson-made a fantastic contribution. I would also like to thank all the hard working members of the committee for taking on this inquiry in addition to their already increased workload in recognition of the urgency of the issue and the need to initiate government action. I thank Dr John White and Dr Anna Dacre, as well as my Chief of Staff, Matt Jutsum, who finishes with me on Friday, for the great work he contributed to this report and also for his loyal service over the last few years.",127
253,Mr ENTSCH,COMMITTEES," by leave-I would just like to take a few moments to also associate myself with this report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. In the first instance I would like to thank the chair and the committee for being prepared to move so quickly after dealing with the flood report, acknowledging the challenges that were being faced in Northern Australia by the emerging unaffordability of strata insurance. Public hearings were held in Port Douglas, Cairns and Townsville. We also had a videoconference in Mackay, and there was a further public hearing in Canberra. It became very evident very quickly that the rising premiums and the lack of competition seemed confined to the Northern Australia and Northern Queensland markets. There was also a problem, given that there is a mandatory requirement in relation to strata title insurance. There was a concern that insurance companies were choosing low-risk markets and in doing so were creating regional inequities. Unfortunately, there is currently no requirement for insurance companies to offer strata title insurance and therefore there is no regulatory requirement to ensure that affordable insurance is available in all areas of Australia. It is interesting too that the insurance brokers in North Queensland were suggesting that the situation was indicative of a market failure, and evidence that was presented by Mr Dallas Booth, the CEO of National Insurance Brokers Association in Australia, conceded that the market was struggling in Northern Australia. He said, 'I cannot deny that it is getting very close to market failure.' That was the challenge that we had. As the chairman rightly said, there were a lot of stories that were put into it, a lot of horror stories in fact about insurance. I think there were 400-and-something submissions to the inquiry, which is amazing. recommendations that have come out of this, while they are not going to fix the problem immediately in relation to affordability, are certainly going to start a journey, if you like, move: that will hopefully start to bring some sort of conclusion here that will allow people to be able to afford their insurance again in this area. The recommendations that came through I think were very good, particularly recommendation 2, where the committee recommended that the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority conduct a review of the risk assessment methodology and in particular the failure to consider the changes in building codes and the cost of reinsurance. The others recommendations I would also like to mention include that the Attorney General conduct a review of the state and territory legislative and regulatory requirements around strata insurance and looking at options to provide strata complexes with greater flexibility in their choices of insurance arrangements, including availability of tailored arrangements that may offer capped insurance to cover non-essential assets infrastructure. As I said, this is not a silver bullet but I certainly look forward to having this presented into an area of mine which is greatly affected by this particular situation. Though there is no silver bullet, I think it needs to be remembered that there is a legislative requirement for strata property owners to be covered by insurance and this in itself is a guaranteed market for insurance companies. Therefore I think insurance companies could play a significant role in immediately easing the insurance crisis faced by strata title property owners in Northern Australia by recognising a social obligation and re-entering the market with affordable insurance. I would expect this would be far The preferable to waiting for government intervention. I commend the report to the House.  That the House take note of the report. Debate adjourned. Report and Reference to Federation Chamber  leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. NA Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012 Report from Committee  behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I seek leave to make a statement on the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 and the Courts Legislation Amendment Complaints) Bill 2012, in discharge of the committee's requirement to provide an advisory report on the bills, and to present a copy of my statement.",129
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is there any objection to leave being granted?,131
255,Mr Ruddock,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am inclined to withhold leave. I believe that this should be the subject of a substantial inquiry. I sought to be added to the committee. I have not been advised of any meetings that have considered the matter and I think that it is pre-emptory to deal with this matter until there has been proper consideration. Leave not granted.

256,Mr ALBANESE,SCHEDULE B,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (16:59): I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Senate amendments amend clause 122 of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and make other consequential changes to facilitate the disposal of information for complaint handling. They further support the processes of policy development and review for public interest communications services. The amendments enable TUSMA to disclose relevant information to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. This responds to part of recommendation 1 of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry and reflects the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's proposal to the committee that TUSMA be permitted to in the disclose information to the TIO. The amendment to clause 122 will also allow TUSMA to provide information to the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee and the Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. This will support the processes of policy development and review. In particular, it would allow for the provision of useful information to the committee when reviewing the adequacy of telecommunications services for Australians in non-metropolitan areas. The amendments also ensure that TUSMA members have a sufficiently diverse range of knowledge, skills and experience to enable the agency to fulfil its charter. The amendment to clause 38 implements Industry recommendation 2 of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry. The amendment would alter clause 38(2)(d) of the TUSMA Bill to delete the reference to 'economic' and require one of the appointments to be a person with direct experience in the field of consumer affairs. TUSMA members with experience in the telecommunications sector and business or finance will bring a necessary focus on efficient and effective service delivery to TUSMA's decision making. A person with knowledge and standing in consumer affairs would provide a valuable additional perspective to the decisions of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency. My understanding is that this has the support of all the parliament. I thank the House for their support and I commend the amendments to the House. Question agreed to.

Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,134
258,Mr TUDGE,SCHEDULE B," Before I was interrupted for statements by members and for questions without notice, I was referring to Australia's great democracy and the pillars which underpin it. One of the essential pillars that does indeed underpin our great democracy is the confidence which we have in our voting system. There are many components to that. There is the way that the elections are conducted on the day and the way that the counting is done subsequent to the day, including having scrutineers and the like. But a critical component in us having confidence in the system is that we also have confidence in who is enrolled on the electoral roll and therefore who is eligible to vote. It is Bill 2012 immensely important for all of us in this chamber, and indeed for everyone across Australia, to have confidence in that so that we can have confidence in the system overall. My great concern is that the amendments that have been put in front of us will diminish the confidence that we have in our system and that the integrity of the enrolments will indeed be diminished. The legislation allows the Australian Electoral Commission to automatically update the voter records by taking into account a number of sources rather than leaving that in the hands of the individual. It is not clear exactly what sources the AEC will use to update that information, but it could have quite dramatic consequences if they get it wrong. That is our concern. You would think that they would look at, say, tax Bill 2011 file numbers from the Australian Taxation Office, follow that path down its track and use the information to update voter records. But, if they did that, they could very well have many mistakes. An ANAO report found quite recently, in the last census, that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia. Information as concrete as that, which you would think you would be able to rely on and therefore use to update the electoral roll, is in part not accurate. In fact, there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals, and 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. There are some quite extraordinary figures from what we would typically regard as a very reliable source of information, let alone what they would be if we went to other potential sources. I will use another example. We might think that Medicare is another source of information which is rock solid and something which the AEC might be able to use to update its records for the electoral roll. Again, though, I point out that an ANAO report found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. So their records can be considerably wrong, and this report found half a million active Medicare enrolment records were, indeed, possibly wrong. That is one of our concerns. The last thing we want is for records which are incorrect to be updated because that will reduce the overall integrity of the electoral system. The second problem I have with these amendments is they take away individual responsibility. We on this side of the House believe that individual responsibility is an incredibly important principle which should infuse all policymaking. We hold individuals responsible for enrolling to vote, accurately maintaining their enrolment at their permanent place of residence and casting their vote when an election is called, and we ask them to fully extend preferences to all candidates contesting elections for the House of Representatives in their local electorate. These are the basic responsibilities which individuals have, and we on this side of the House believe that individuals should rightly retain those responsibilities and the responsibility to update their records. The third and final argument which I have against the amendments in front of me is privacy. This has been spoken about by the speakers before me. There is a significant concern that, if records are updated without the knowledge of individuals, they may not even be aware of being on the roll to start with or of what district or electorate they are enrolled in. Further, they may not be aware of the information which the AEC holds or what information the AEC is using to update their records. We believe there is no need for these amendments to occur. We do not believe there is a case to be made for changing the way the electoral roll has been managed so far. We believe the single most important principle is maintaining integrity in the electoral roll and, to date, both sides of the House have found, by and large, that we can have confidence in the electoral roll. We amend these laws and change this system at our peril. If we reduce the integrity that is inherent in the electoral process, that will be a poor result for democracy overall.",134
259,Ms MARINO,SCHEDULE B," Like my colleagues, I do not support the amendments in both the bills before the House: the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. In simple terms, the legislation will damage the integrity of the electoral roll by adding new electors, who may not be entitled to vote, without their knowledge and potentially without their consent-particularly if the elector does not receive the Australian Electoral Commission's notice of enrolment. I live in a rural and regional electorate and this certainly happens. That is evidenced by the number of inquiries I get approaching an election. We on this side believe in personal responsibility. We believe it is an individual's responsibility to enrol to vote, to notify the AEC if they change their address and to vote at elections. The extensive privacy implications that this legislation raises have been virtually ignored by the Labor Party and the Greens. Previously today, in the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill, we heard that Dr Roger Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation provided the committee looking into this with some valuable information about the individual privacy concerns that this legislation raises. We share those concerns. We have very real concerns about electors having details published on the electoral roll without their knowledge or the opportunity to apply for silent elector status. Depending on where the AEC sources this information from, this is a very real issue. The integrity of the electoral roll is, as has been articulated by my colleagues, at the very heart of our democratic process. It is imperative, as a result of that, that we maintain the integrity of that roll. I think paramount in any democracy but particularly in this one in Australia. The roll needs to be accurate, as we have heard. We know that seats can and will be decided by a small number of votes, so the integrity of the roll, and the will of the people expressed by that, is paramount. The responsibility for enrolling and for updating individual elector details is so important-and it is an issue when that right and responsibility is taken from the individual, as this legislation will do, and given to the AEC. Not only is there the possibility for significant error; it also opens the roll to fraud, and I have no doubt that that is what we will see. The legislation, as I said, will corrupt the integrity of the electoral roll. The fact that people are going to be put on this roll without their knowledge could lead to quite a number of potential irregularities. The legislation gives the AEC the discretion to determine what those sources of reliable and current data are and where those addresses can be obtained from. This is far beyond the purview of the AEC. It is really up to me as an individual to tell the AEC about my details and my environment. It really comes down to the individual to talk to the AEC about enrolling and maintaining the address they have or when they have to change the address. The reliability of data sources has been mentioned repeatedly by my colleagues, and I do not think we should underestimate where the information comes from. We heard previously from the member for Aston, who touched on the reliability of the potential sources of information for the rolls. We have heard that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people, if that was the source of information and data. An ANAO audit report of Medicare found that up to half a million-we are not talking it is about enough votes or enough integrity. We are talking about using potentially incorrect information and data from whatever source the AEC chooses to use and the fact that it could have a major impact on the outcome of an election. The other thing that we as coalition members are majorly committed to and have great concerns about is that the right to vote is one of the highest held tenets of democracy. The right of the average citizen to play an individual part in deciding who will lead them into the future and who their government will be is basically essential to democracy and good governance in our world. It is a privilege. I do not think that any of us on this side of the House see the right to vote as anything other than a right and a privilege in this country. We do not take it for granted, and I am hoping that the majority of Australians do not take it for granted either. Just talk to the people in Syria, perhaps, or talk to the people in Egypt. People fight and die for the right to vote regular basis. I was privileged to go to Cambodia as an Australian delegate to the United Nations to look at the election process there. One of the most profound experiences I had as part of that visit was the absolute excitement of the Cambodian people at having the right to vote. In that system, one of the ways they tested whether someone had voted only once was by the use of indelible ink. They would dip their finger into the ink as a sign that they had voted. They knew who I was; I had the vest on. They knew what I was there for and, when they came out of the polling booth, they would come up to me with great excitement, showing me their finger. They were absolutely elated at the right to vote. It is something that we in Australia seewe can sometimes-because we have all grown up with it. It is what we expect, know and love, but we also need to protect it. That is what the integrity of the electoral roll does: it protects the right to vote, the eligibility of the individual elector, and is critical to what we do as a nation. As I said, when I met those people in Cambodia, it made me look at the things I value about being fortunate enough to be raised in this fantastic country, where democracy and the democratic process is something that we expect. But with this legislation I see that that expectation may be compromised, and I am not prepared to sit back and say, 'That's fine,' because I do not believe that it is. We have had constant battles for representation and referenda. What I am trying to get to is that in Australia we should not take this right, this privilege, for granted. It has been hard won. Over many years around the world countless lives have been lost in the pursuit of the right to have a say in who your elected representatives are and in the form of governance and government in on a your country. In the same way that it is a right it should, because of respect for that right, carry an inherent responsibility. It is the responsibility side that is often forgotten, especially in this country that is so blessed by a stable democracy, probably for longer than almost any in living memory. What is it that we ask of our fellow Australians who want to inherit and should inherit their share of Australian democracy? What is it that we are asking them to do? We simply ask them to register to vote and to come along on election day, and let the AEC know if they change their address. I really do not think that is too much to ask. In fact I think it underpins how important our democracy is and underpins the need to fight for and protect that right. If we gave that opportunity to people who live in other countries who do not have the right to vote, I wonder if they would say, 'You know, maintaining my address is just too hard.' I think that, like those people in Cambodia, they would say, 'I am absolutely beside that myself with the right to vote. I've got the finger that I have dipped in the indelible ink to prove the fact that I had the right to vote and I am so excited about having the right to vote.' In fact, some of those people have not been able to vote many times in their lives. That is why we need to protect the integrity of our electoral roll. I am concerned that we are debating legislation that basically thumbs its nose at our proud history of democracy and our entitlement to vote and leaves it open to fraud and abuse. I am appalled that our electoral roll, as a result of these bills, could be subject to fraud and abuse. I think anybody who, like me, absolutely values the right to vote and our democracy and is prepared to stand up for that would feel the same and should feel the same. We do not take it for granted. The government is suggesting that the effort of maintaining their addresses and maintaining their registration to vote is too much for Australians and that the government has to do it for them. I think we need to take responsibility and we need to constantly reaffirm the fact that we value this democracy and we do not take our rights and our democracy for granted. I do not believe that it is too much to ask for us to maintain our addresses. I just do not think that we should be taking it that lightly. It is our freedom and democracy here that are part of this legislation and part of what potentially eroded by these bills before the House. We know that Australians before us have fought and died to build and protect the democracy that we now enjoy. I encourage all Australians never to take that for granted and never to take for granted the integrity of the electoral roll and how important it is to our democratic process. But it appears that the government does not understand that sacrifice and thinks that perhaps getting to a post office to get an enrolment form or seeking it from an elected representative or from the AEC and putting it in a postage paid envelope is too hard for Australians. Strangely enough, millions of us have managed to do so. We have been able to quickly and simply have our democratic say. I see the legislation before the House as an insult to those who have made the effort to enrol, to those who fought and died for the democracy we have built and to those over centuries who have fought for democracy. I urge all Australians to see this and to see the right to vote-your eligibility to vote-as a reinforcement of our democratic process. We all, as members, talk to young people in schools. We go along and present flags, and we talk about the rule of law. We talk about what our flag represents. I think our electoral roll and the integrity of it fit into the same category.",135
260,Dr JENSEN,SCHEDULE B," The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to directly enrol new electors on the electoral roll when it is satisfied that an individual has been living at a particular address for one month and is eligible to be on the roll. This bill follows on from the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining is Address) Bill 2011, which will give the AEC the authority to change the address of electors when it believes they have changed their residential address. As with the previous bill, the coalition opposes this legislation because it will greatly reduce the integrity of the electoral roll, infringe on the role of the individual to keep their details up to date and reduce the privacy of Australians who may not wish to be publicly registered. The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recently conducted an inquiry into the 2010 federal election, reporting in July 2011. One of the recommendations of the Labor and Greens committee members was to introduce automatic enrolment, a process by which an individual elector is put directly onto the electoral roll without ever filling out an enrolment form, based on information from other government sources. This bill seeks to implement that recommendation. The coalition is concerned about how this will impact on the integrity of the roll. As Professor Graeme Orr notes in his publication The Law of Politics: Like other official public registers, such as land registers, a chief feature of electoral rolls finality. The purpose of a roll is to be a definitive statement of the entitlement to vote … Thus there is a rule that the roll is conclusive evidence of the entitlement to vote. He goes on to say: Reinforcing this is the secondary rule … that a court of disputed returns is not to inquire into the correctness of the roll. Given our experience at the 2010 federal election, where no political party won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and results in some electorates came down to just a few hundred votes, it is imperative that the roll which is used to elect our parliamentarians is accurate and reliable. We must not allow this very important document to be shrouded in concerns or doubts about its legal standing and validity. It is also the responsibility of the individual in our democratic society to maintain their enrolment details when they change addresses. As outlined in the coalition's dissenting report, it is the duty of each Australian citizen to enrol to vote, to accurately maintain their enrolment at their permanent place of residence, to cast a vote when an election is called and to fully extend preferences to all candidates contesting election for the House of Representatives in their local electorate. This responsibility is far from onerous, and moves to water down this process only detract from each Australian's right as a democratic citizen. As Dr Roger Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation notes: The notion of the vote is a right-it is an entitlement-and turning it into an obligation, which is what that entails, I just do not believe is appropriate in a democratic process. This legislation allows changes to due process that will ultimately lead to a high number of potential irregularities with little or no benefit to the democratic process. It is their also opens up the roll to fraud. As with the electoral and referendum amendment bill 2012, the 2011 bill gives the AEC the discretion to determine what 'reliable and current data sources' are from which information about elector addresses can be obtained. This is far beyond the scope of the AEC. Surely only individual electors should supply details about their enrolment, rather than a mish-mash of data from various government departments. Indeed, what about people who, for instance, own holiday homes? Potentially their information could be taken out twice from these various sources to put them on the voters roll twice. I seriously question the reliability of these other data sources. As coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters noted in their dissenting report: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make them fit for use in forming the electoral roll. As outlined in the previous report into these proposals, a 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration titled Numbers on the run found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census, that there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals and that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. Similarly, an ANAO audit report stated: ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. Neither this bill nor the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 specifies what data sources constitute reliable data, nor are there any restrictions on which data sources the AEC can use to enrol an elector. There is no provision specifying the standard of proof that the AEC needs to enrol an elector. Nor is there any legislative requirement for the AEC to check whether a person is over 18 or is an Australian citizen before they are added to the roll. This bill will give the AEC full discretion in these matters: … to directly enrol eligible electors on the basis of data or information provided by an elector or electors to an agency approved by the AEC, as an agency which performs adequate proof of identity checks, where that information is subsequently provided by that agency to the AEC for the purposes of updating the electoral roll. I believe that this is far beyond the jurisdiction of the AEC. Individuals who are not entitled to vote may also be added to the roll because of this bill. Members of the community who are not Australian citizens, who are under 18, who are not living at the address the AEC believes or are otherwise ineligible to vote may be incorrectly added to the electoral roll under this bill. Even without any contact from the individual, the so-called eligible voter will still be added to the electoral roll. The AEC submission to the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the bill stated: … the AEC would receive data from a third party data source, conduct a data matching process including a check of the eligibility of individuals to enrol, notify eligible individuals and, after a period of 28 days, make additions to the electoral roll and inform electors of the AEC's action. In reality, the AEC could use any data source it likes, including records from the Taxation Office or Medicare which, as I have said before, have been demonstrated to be problematic. In that light, I draw the attention of the House to the difficulties experienced in New South Wales state elections. Former Labor governments in both New South Wales and Victoria have introduced enrolment for their recent state elections, which means that a number of electors in these states are only enrolled for state, and not federal, elections due to the differences in state and federal legislation. As such, when an elector has their details changed or they are added to the state electoral roll in New South Wales or Victoria, they are then sent an enrolment form by the AEC to complete for the federal jurisdiction. Commentator Antony Green noted in an article on 16 July 2011 that only 64.3 per cent of those automatically enrolled for the first time at the 2011 New South Wales state election actually turned out to vote. Surely, this high non-participation rate is indicative of the unreliable nature of the information used to put new electors on the roll. Electors either did not know of their eligibility to vote or had no intention of voting anyway. This bill will only lead to electors being issued with a fine for not voting when there is no entitlement for them to be on the roll in the first place or because their address details are in fact incorrect through no fault of their own. Most importantly, there are also significant privacy implications that this legislation raises-an issue that is glossed over by Labor and the Greens. Dr Roger Clarke of the Australian Privacy Foundation submitted valuable information to the joint standing committee about the individual privacy concerns that this bill raises. He stated: We are not aware of any risk assessment having been performed. We were not aware of any privacy impact assessment having been performed … We are not aware of the APF or any of the civil liberties organisations being involved in any of those. The coalition and I have very valid concerns about electors having their details published on the electoral roll without their knowledge automatic and without the opportunity to apply for silent elector status. This is of particular concern to those who are victims of domestic violence, those involved in custody disputes or those Australians who may want their address suppressed because of safety fears or other reasons. The coalition has long opposed moves by the Labor Party and the Greens to introduce automatic enrolment and notes that this bill is being introduced solely to improve the electoral prospects of both Labor and the Greens. The first obligation of the AEC is to uphold the integrity of the roll. The AEC has instead focused on maximising the number of people on the electoral roll at the expense of that obligation. This bill gives the Australian Electoral Commission a blank cheque to decide what information sources it uses to add people to the electoral roll. This legislation does not require the AEC to justify the use of a particular data source or the potential for parliament to disallow the use of particular data sources. Nor does it state the level of proof required for the AEC to add a person to the electoral roll. I do not believe this legislation is in the best interests of Australia. The responsibility of enrolling to vote should remain with the individual Australian citizen and should not be given to the bureaucracy.",138
261,Mr TURNBULL,SCHEDULE B," There is nothing more important than maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll. All of us in this House are very aware of its importance and very aware that far too often people are excluded from voting when they should be able to vote and, regrettably, people vote when they are not entitled to vote. I want to share with the House an experience I had when I was running for parliament in the 2004 election. I was standing in the shopping mall at Bondi Junction-interfering with commercial activities as we all do when we are running for parliament-and I met a young woman and urged her to vote for me. She said, 'I will be away on polling day.' I said, 'Well, madam, you could get a postal vote or you could vote pre-poll.' She said, 'Don't worry about that; I will get my girlfriend to vote for me.' I nearly fainted-I was absolutely appalled. I impressed on her the seriousness of the offence she and her girlfriend were contemplating committing and I said, 'You can't do that.' She said, 'Everybody does that.' I hope I persuaded her that everybody should not do that. I had a similar experience on three or four occasions over the course of that election campaign and it impressed on me that not everybody takes the integrity of the electoral roll as seriously as they should. When I came to this place after the 2004 elections, I regret to say that I was unable to persuade the distinguished Prime Minister of the day, the Hon. John Howard, that one of the reforms we should make to the Electoral Act was to require people to produce proof of identity when they go to vote. This was regarded by others much wiser and more experienced than me-not least of whom the Prime Minister-as being a bridge too far. But I still hold to that view. I am open to being persuaded that I am wrong of courseI am open-minded about this. The more rigour and integrity we can put into the electoral roll the better. It is a remarkable thing that in this country you need 100 points of ID to open a bank account-you need to produce ID to do practically anything nowadays and almost everybody has multiple sources of identification, even multiple sources of photo identification-but you can go and vote and change the government of the nation, indeed the destiny of the nation, without ever having people's to identify yourself. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 does not deal with the question of producing identification at the polling booth, but what it does do is allow the Electoral Commissioner to directly update an elector's enrolled address following the receipt of information about the address that elector is at-without any discussion with, consent from or engagement with the elector in person. We all say that we have compulsory voting in Australia. In fact, we do not have compulsory voting",141
262,Mr Melham,SCHEDULE B,It is attendance.,142
263,Mr TURNBULL,SCHEDULE B,"As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports interjects, it is attendance which is compulsory. But the idea that somebody can be enrolled at a particular address simply because the Electoral Commissioner has found their name, with that address, on some other database or some other accounting system is profoundly wrong. Electors should be enrolled at the address they provide. If it turns out that they are no longer at that address, the Electoral Commissioner should do his or her duty and chase them up. Then it is up to the elector to put themselves back on the roll. But the idea of people being automatically enrolled is only calculated to make the electoral roll even less reliable than it is today. I am not going to speak for very long on this because my colleagues have spoken so well and comprehensively on it. But I will just make this one point in closing, because it is a point I did not hear made by my colleagues earlier in this debate: the most insidious thing this amendment does is undermine the sense of responsibility. I gave the example of the woman I met who said she was going to get a girlfriend to vote for her. She had, in my view-and I hope I persuaded her that she was mistaken-a quite inadequate, improper and indeed unlawful view of her responsibility as an elector. She thought she could delegate that to somebody else who could walk in there and impersonate her. Since ID is not called for, in all probability that sort of impersonation would generally be successful. There is nothing more important that we all do as citizens than vote. All of us have the very important civic obligation of attending a polling place and, if we choose to-and of course almost everyone does-voting. Our engagement with the electoral office is a personal obligation; our engagement with our democracy is a personal obligation. The idea that you can be put on the roll at an address without any action by yourself undermines that sense of personal responsibility. It debases the electoral roll and it will make the electoral roll, which is, as of today, insufficiently reliable, potentially much less reliable in the future. The member for Tangney and other speakers on our side, as well as my colleagues in the dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters, have described all the defects of the various databases that can be accessed. There is no substitute for an elector taking his or her own responsibility for saying, 'This is where I live, and I know that if I make an untrue statement. I am committing an offence.' The responsibility should be on the electors, on citizens-after all, this parliament, this democracy, belongs to them. Their engagement with the electoral process should involve a decision by them to put themselves on the roll or to correct and change their address when they move house. It should not personal be imposed on them by some computerised exercise of pulling their name and address out of a third-party database. For that reason we are opposing this legislation. Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (17:46): The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2012 allows the Electoral Commissioner to update the address details of an elector on the electoral roll if the commissioner is satisfied that the elector lives at the address. The bill does not propose to provide the capacity for the Electoral Commissioner to directly enrol electors who are not on the electoral roll. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Participation) Bill 2012 provides the Electoral Commissioner with the capacity to directly enrol an eligible person who is not on the electoral roll if the commissioner is satisfied that the person is entitled to enrolment, has lived at an address for at least one month and is not enrolled. It also allows the Electoral Commissioner to enrol certain persons who have been removed from the electoral roll and admit their declaration votes. This bill will corrupt the integrity of the electoral roll, with electors potentially being put on the electoral roll without their knowledge, leading to a high number of potential irregularities. This bill package gives the AEC the discretion to determine what are 'reliable and current data sources' where information about elector addresses can be obtained. The coalition believes this is far beyond the purview of the AEC and that only individual electors should supply details about their enrolment. Voting in Australian local, state and federal elections is one of the most paramount rights possessed by all Australian citizens. Like the member for Forrest, who witnessed the Cambodian elections, I witnessed the first ever democratic election in Iraq. I saw the joy of its residents in able to vote freely, like the member for Forrest saw, with them putting their finger in the ink well denoting they had voted. This reinforces how precious our right to vote is here in Australia. These bills take the responsibility for enrolment from citizens and give it to just another government department. It is almost as if the government wants to run our total lives. I remind the government that not all Australians are puppets-we do know how to do things. We know it is the constitutional responsibility of every Australian citizen of age to be on the electoral roll. This bill Elector passes this constitutional onus from citizens to the bureaucracy. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? Electors should be in charge of enrolling and maintaining their address details when they change addresses. Only a nanny state would give itself the responsibility of doing it for them. This government is taking over control of people's lives. Surely Australians are capable of deciding to put their name on the roll. I guess this obsession with the nanny state is not surprising from, to quote Labor's 46th National Conference platform document: The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party … I am also worried about how reliable the AEC's data sources might be. Coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters noted in July 2011 in their dissenting report: The reliance on external data sources that have been collated and that are utilised for other purposes does not make them fit for use in forming the electoral roll. A 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Numbers on the run-Review of ANAO Report No.37 1998being 99 on the management of tax file numbers found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the last census; there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; and 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. Similarly, ANAO audit report No.24 of 2004-05 on the integrity of Medicare enrolment data stated : ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased. Under our constitution, the integrity of our electoral roll is paramount to accountable, stable and democratic government and society. It is our constitutional responsibility to be on the electoral roll, to update our enrolment details when we change our address and to vote in every local, state and federal election. One of the things that make Australia great is our constitutional commitment to democracy in every element of our lives. This legislation takes your democratic rights away and gives your constitutional responsibilities to a faceless bureaucrat deep in the bowels of Canberra. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. This is a democratic country and we are able to make our own decisions, but in some cases we need more education. We have a large turnover of residents in Gilmore, being a coastal area, and as a local member I always advise those arriving to change their address and if they are new voters to enrol. Instead of just forcing automatic enrolment and government datamatching Australians, why do those opposite not try actual education initiatives to let Australians know that they need to both enrol and keep their details up to date? An idea I have advocated for quite a while is the introduction of electoral education classes in high schools, facilitated by the AEC. As outlined in the 2010-11 portfolio budget statements, the AEC is funded for one primary outcome, and that is to: Maintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters through electoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services and targeted education and public awareness programs. So, arguably, our most impartial government department would have to be the Australian Electoral Commission. This is why the AEC would be the perfect provider to come into schools and teach high school students about our electoral system, their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and how to enrol early once they turn 17. The process would be simple: allow experts from the AEC to visit the local high schools in their region just once or twice a year to talk to students in years 10 to 12. In most high schools, it would be practical to hold a meeting of roughly an hour with an entire year group, with two or three representatives from the AEC briefly explaining how voting works, what every citizen's obligations are when it comes to voting and then allowing those 17and 18-year-olds in their audience to enrol there and then at their school. This would not be a costly program to implement, with the distribution of electoral enrolment forms already in place in most high schools. If those opposite view enrolment levels as an issue then they need to look at educational options. The problem is lack of electoral education, and therein lies the solution. I now turn to the Joint Standing of Committee on Electoral Matters dissenting report and remind the House where it was stated that the coalition strongly disagrees with this bill. It is our belief that this bill is being introduced solely to improve the electoral prospects of both Labor and the Greens. It follows similar moves by the former Labor governments in New South Wales and Victoria prior to their last state elections. Finally, it is important that the integrity of the electoral roll remains. It is imperative active that the roll which is used to elect our parliamentarians is accurate and reliable, particularly in the wake of the 2010 federal election where no political party won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and results in a number of individual electorates came down to only a few hundred votes. Where the responsibility for enrolling and updating individual electoral details is taken from the individual and given to the AEC, as this bill will do, the potential for errors to occur is significant. also opens up the roll to fraud. Essentially, individuals are put on the roll if the AEC believes they are eligible after consulting various data sources. Neither this bill nor the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 specifies what data sources are required for the AEC to consider what constitutes 'reliable'. There are also no restrictions on which data sources the AEC can use to enrol an elector. There is no provision specifying the standard of proof that the AEC needs to be able to enrol an elector. This bill leaves all these decisions to the AEC, and coalition members and senators believe this is far beyond their jurisdiction. As I said earlier in my comments, there are 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia. How can this government introduce something so sloppy and so undemocratic to do something that we, the Australian people, are proud to do in our own name?",142
264,Mr FORREST,SCHEDULE B," I find myself agreeing with the member for Wentworth and the member for Gilmore and would like to follow their themes as I indicate my opposition to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012. Firstly, I would like to describe my own experience and then make some useful suggestions about the real challenges that confront us in maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll. I spend a lot of time out of my office working with my Electoral Commission officer in cleansing the roll. I am also a regular 'corresponder'. It alarms me that especially new enrolees-the younger group; the 18-year-olds-are so mobile. From the time that I am alerted about a new enrolee to the time that I write them a welcome letterIt welcoming them to Mallee and telling them a little bit about the democratic process-it astounds me the number of letters I get back with 'Not known at this address'. In general correspondence, where I might want to communicate with my constituency, I send out a broadcast letter. Again, the number of responses that come back to me with 'Not known at this address' is astounding. We then forward that information on to the Electoral Commission in an attempt to cleanse the roll. I work very closely with the electoral office based in Mildura. We try to reinforce the real value of our democracy on the younger generation. When schools visit Parliament House, we entertain them in area of the building where they can see the War Memorial. Walter Burley Griffin has done us an enormous favour, I think, in that Parliament House can be seen from the War Memorial and vice versa. The War Memorial reminds us that our democracy has not come cheap. It was very expensive in that men and women had to be prepared to defend it and fight to keep it. I sometimes worry that the importance of being able to vote is not generally understood by the Australian populace because they are so busy trying to make ends meet. They have very busy lives. A considerable number of my constituents are exempt from having to vote. Their objection to voting is for religious reasons. If they come into my office to complain about something, I will often say to them, 'If you don't vote, you can't come into my office and complain,' which is my way of trying to encourage them to be part of the process. The roll is so important. We all need to do what we can to make sure that it has absolute integrity. The number of letters that I send on to the Electoral Commission to make sure that the roll does have that integrity alarms me. So I am with the member for Gilmore, who argues that strong case to get in early with the younger generation and get the Electoral Commission to visit the schools. That is being done in my electorate. I encourage it. I do what I can to make sure that youngsters in particular understand the value of voting and that it is their individual responsibility, not somebody else's responsibility. It is such a precious right for them to have and they need it to be their responsibility to make sure that they are recorded on the electoral roll. I was alarmed when I first read what these bills contain-an automatic enrolment!-and what information may be relied upon to make this enrolment. I am, frankly, alarmed. My constituency is based along the Murray River, where there is a huge amount of horticulture that has an enormous demand for labour-people come from everywhereand the populations of my small Murray River towns grow enormously during the harvest season. One of the most substantial complaints from",145

Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as whole. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:18): The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 results probably from the deliberations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. One of the things that was a condition of advising that automatic enrolment and automatic changing of addresses would be agreed to was that the lists the Australian Electoral Commission was able to draw on-and the discretion remains entirely the Commissioner's-should be subject to tabling and disallowance. This bill does not provide for tabling and disallowance, and I ask the minister why that decision was made.",146
267,Mr GRAY,NOES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (18:19): The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Maintaining Address) Bill 2011 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill 2012 grow from NOES recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which cover a number of deliberations by that committee following the 2007 and 2010 elections. The bills respond to the need to ensure that 1.5 million Australians who are not on the electoral roll are given the opportunity of getting onto the electoral roll. That is 10,000 people, on average, in every federal division across our nation. PAIRS The Australian Electoral Commission itself feels that the need to move to modern technology to ensure an electoral roll that better represents our voting population-or our potential voting population-is an appropriate thing to do. These two bills necessarily harmonise the Commonwealth electoral roll with the rolls that are now being developed in our two most populous states. It is important to be aware that the act of harmonising the Commonwealth roll with the rolls in our two most populous states, creating a high-integrity system for ensuring that the roll itself is as accurate as it can possibly be and ensuring a direct enrolment system, is not-as has been characterised repeatedly in this place-an automatic enrolment system. It is a direct enrolment system that in many ways adds to the integrity of the roll itself. These measures respond to identified needs in our community to ensure that our roll provides the service it is meant to provide to the Electoral electoral process: to be as accurate a roll of electors as it can possibly be. It allows for technology to be used to ensure that the roll is accurate. It creates contestability for electors whose electoral details may be subject to these updating processes to challenge, via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, decisions made by the electoral commissioner. These bills represent a modernisation of the roll maintenance process that is long overdue, that responds to the needs of our community and that also responds to the Australian Electoral Commission's accurate identification of the weakness in our electoral roll and the ways in which we can attend to that.",148
268,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," I remind the House that under normal circumstances when we are considering bills in detail we will be referring to amendments. We do not have amendments before the chair, so the question is that the bill be agreed to as a whole. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:22): The bills were referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for consideration and investigation, and during that process the Electoral Commissioner gave evidence, in answer to a question of mine, that it was quite possible, as the Electoral Commission only writes to the new address and not to the address that is currently on the electoral roll, that indeed someone's address could be wrongly altered and when they turned up to vote at their normal place they would be unable to vote. Yet if somebody else was aware that the Electoral Commission had changed their address, they could go and vote for them in that different address. That means that the electoral roll is opened up to fraud. The answer to my question by the Electoral Commissioner was, 'Yes, that is factually true.' He wondered why people would have two addresses but he admitted that it was quite possible and that what I had said would result would. I ask the minister why he has not provided in this bill that the Electoral Commissioner is required to write to both the old address, which is the one that is existing on the electoral roll, as well as the new one which results from his consulting databases, which can come from any source, as the option is the Electoral Commissioner's to use any list he chooses. Why is he not required to write to both addresses?",149
269,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, The question is that the bill be agreed to. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:24): In another chamber earlier today we had a similar situation where the minister was not able to answer any of my questions.,149
270,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Mackellar must realise that this is not question time. We have had this debate before and there is no need for the minister to respond. This is consideration in detail. You can put the question but this is not question time.,149
271,Mr Albanese,NOES,There was an agreement. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: I had no agreement.,149
272,Mr Albanese,NOES,The opposition whip did.,149
273,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"The member for Mackellar has the call. The Leader of the House is not assisting. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: During the scrutiny that took place when the bill was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, it was pointed out that there was no provision in the legislation for the privacy of individuals to be protected. Under the current law, if someone has an appropriate reason to be left off the electoral roll and they make a submission to the Electoral Commissioner, they are entitled not to be put on the roll. It could be because of domestic violence; it could be for a whole range of issues. Yet under this legislation someone who is in that position who has not had the opportunity to request that they be omitted from the roll can be automatically placed on the roll. That evidence was given and I ask the minister why no amendment was brought into protect the rights of those individuals.",149

Bill read a third time. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,151
277,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS," The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 is part of the government's Stronger Super reforms package. The bill amends Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The bill was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 3 November and the committee report was handed down on 19 March. The coalition members of the committee concluded there were several significant deficiencies in the bill which I will detail later in the speech. The bill defines a MySuper product and provides a framework to allow registrable superannuation entity licensees to apply to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for authorisation to offer a MySuper product. The bill prohibits a regulated superannuation fund from offering more than one MySuper product except, in limited circumstances, to large employers. Large employers are defined as those having more than 500 members of a particular fund. The bill sets out rules on the payment of contributions and account transfers for MySuper products. The bill also sets out the nature and type of fees that can be charged by a MySuper product and the basis on which those fees can be charged to members. The bill provides that MySuper products will be offered from 1 July 2013 and that, from 1 October 2013, employers must make default superannuation contributions to a fund that offers a MySuper product for employees who have not chosen a fund. A big deficiency in this bill is that it does not make any alterations to the existing contentious closed shop, anticompetitive arrangements for the selection of default funds under modern awards. The MySuper initiative was one of the key recommendations of the Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system. It was incorporated into the government's package of reforms which are called Stronger Super. The government describes MySuper, in the typical spin, as: MySuper is a new, simple and cost-effective superannuation product that will replace existing default products. MySuper products will have a simple set of product features, irrespective of who provides them. This will enable members, employers and market analysts to compare funds more easily based on a few key differences. It will also ensure members do not pay for any unnecessary 'bells and whistles' they do not need or use. The coalition supports the intent of the MySuper products. However, there is a disconnect between the aims of the reforms and their implementation by this Labor government. The coalition has consistently supported any changes which make our superannuation system more efficient, transparent and competitive and which improve value for fund members. But, because of its compulsory nature, the coalition is acutely aware our superannuation system needs to be accountable, accessible and transparent. Australians must have confidence in their superannuation fund. The coalition members of the PJC have a number of concerns. Chief among these is the treatment of default funds-specifically, how choice for consumers could be improved. The coalition members are also concerned that charging members for intrafund advice is allowed as part of MySuper-which is seemingly at odds with the Future of Financial Advice reforms currently before the House. Coalition members made a number of well-considered recommendations improve the MySuper bills and these include, firstly, changing the definition of 'large employer' to be any employer with 500 or more employees; secondly, removing the need for individual registration for each tailored MySuper plan; thirdly, calling on APRA to release standards and forms required for the MySuper registration process at least 12 months prior to commencement; and, finally, providing a comprehensive definition of intrafund advice in the MySuper and FoFA legislation to ensure such advice is general only, and that any personal or financial advice provided through a super fund is paid for by the person accessing this advice with transparency of fees and without forcing fund members to pay for the personal advice of others for which they have no need. The MySuper proposal has already been through a number of changes. The initial MySuper proposal, to design a basic superannuation product and to impose uniform pricing through legislation, would have created unnecessary inefficiencies and left many consumers worse off. Research into the initial proposal by Chant West found that under a one-fee, government mandated model over 750,000 Australians would be forced to pay higher fees than they are currently paying. In other research, Chant West concluded that a small reduction in fund performance on the back of a lower performance by MySuper funds would very quickly wipe out any gain from lower fees. There has been extensive debate in the sector around these issues in the past 12 months and the government has now backed down from its original proposal to impose a uniform fee structure as part of MySuper. The government's proposal under consideration today is to allow MySuper funds to offer differentiated fee structures. We are still concerned that the creation of to a MySuper product through legislation is an unnecessary interference with an existing, highly competitive market for low-fee, nofrills superannuation products. However, what is proposed now is certainly better than where we started out a year ago. The coalition have three outstanding issues with this bill. The first outstanding issue relates to default funds. The bill mandates that, from 1 October 2013, only MySuper products can be used by employers to make default superannuation contributions for employees who do not have a chosen fund. In doing this, the government has made no attempt to address the current closed shop, secretive, anticompetitive arrangements for the selection of default funds under modern awards. Whilst every default fund has to be a MySuper product, not every MySuper product will be available as a default superannuation fund. The decision on which funds are selected as default funds remains with that august body Fair Work Australia, through a secretive, non-transparent and noncompetitive process. Nontransparentsimilar to the investigation into the member for Dobell.",151
278,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, I was just going to commend the member for North Sydney for being relevant up until that point.,152
279,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"This is at odds with the government's own Cooper review into superannuation. Recommendation 1.2 of the Cooper review in relation to MySuper and modern awards states: The SG Act should be amended so only a MySuper product is eligible to be a ‘default' nominated by an employer. In recommending universal eligibility of default funds for industrial purposes, recommendation 1.3 states: (b) all MySuper products are able to be nominated, for ‘default fund' purposes in awards approved by Fair Work Australia. The coalition is of the view that, in creating this new default superannuation product, all MySuper funds should be allowed to be an eligible default fund for any workplace and should be able to compete freely. Not allowing MySuper funds to compete on a level playing field fails to address the existing competition issues in the default super industry and undermines these reforms. Even the government had to recognise before the last election that the current process, which heavily favours industry superannuation funds, is not open, transparent or competitive. In August 2010, the government promised that a re-elected Gillard government would ask the Productivity Commission to design a transparent, evidence based and competitive process for the selection of default funds under modern awards. Finally, in January 2012, Labor made good on its promise-that was a rare moment-and sent a suitable request to the Productivity Commission. This is too little too late, independent Madam Deputy Speaker. The second issue concerns intrafund advice. The explanatory memorandum indicates that superannuation funds will be able to charge for expenses incurred in the provision of intrafund advice as part of their overall administration fees charged to all fund members of a product. Intrafund advice is clearly a type of financial advice yet there is no precise definition of intrafund advice inside this bill, nor is there a definition in the fund government's FoFA legislation. There is no limitation on what may constitute intrafund advice and there are no provisions determining who should pay for such advice in any of the proposed legislation. The coalition considers that the lack of definition and lack of restriction on charging for intrafund advice within both the MySuper and the FoFA legislation is a mistake that must be rectified. In order to address these concerns, the coalition will propose an amendment to the bill to ensure that the purposes of the MySuper productno financial advice fees-can be bundled into an administrative fee and automatically charged to all fund members. Specifically, this amendment will call on the government to, firstly, provide a comprehensive definition of the term 'intrafund advice'; secondly, ensure that intrafund advice is general in nature only; thirdly, ensure that any financial advice accessed within a superannuation fund beyond such general advice will be expressly subject to the best interests duty contained in the proposed FoFA legislation; fourthly, ensure that any financial advice accessed within a superannuation fund beyond general advice will be paid for by the person accessing this advice without any cross-subsidy from other fund members; and, fifthly, repeal the existing ASIC class order exemption as it would be superfluous once intrafund advice is properly defined in legislation. The third issue of concern relates to the benchmark set for the tailoring of MySuper funds for large employers and the process to obtain a tailored large employer super fund plan. When an employer contributes to a fund on behalf of 500 or more members, the MySuper plan can be tailored to the needs of the employer and employee. Tailoring of MySuper plans makes sense. However, the coalition believes the benchmark requiring a minimum of 500 members per fund is too high and will create confusion among business. The coalition favours a simpler system, whereby a firm is classified as a large employer if it has 500 or more employees as opposed to members. This will provide certainty for business and for consumers. It will mean that MySuper plans tailored to the needs of employees are more readily available. The process of tailoring MySuper plans for large employers is also problematic. The provision in the core provisions bill require prior authorisation of each tailored MySuper employer plan, rather than simply providing a reporting mechanism. The process of yearly reporting of compliance with MySuper licensing conditions for large employers makes much more sense. A solution proposed by the Financial Services Council suggested that MySuper plans could be reported to APRA on an annual basis. APRA would within 30 days be able to disallow a tailored plan where the tailored plan is not compliant with the licence conditions. This compromise will ensure that MySuper plans will be compliant with their obligations at law and would allow the regulator, APRA, to disallow a noncompliant fund. It would improve the ability of employers to tailor plans to the requirements of employees. In conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I am grateful for your close attention my speech, I can say that the coalition supports the introduction of a MySuper product in principle but believes the bill before the House can be improved. I indicate to the House that I will be moving a number of amendments to the bill when we come to the consideration in detail stage.",153
280,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I thank the member for North Sydney and those who may have helped in his speech for being relevant to the bill before us.,154
281,Mr HAYES,PAIRS," I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011. The bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The main purpose of the bill is to introduce a new, simple and low-cost superannuation product-that is, MySuper. The main purpose of this reform is to promote lower fees and a more efficient superannuation system, with the members of the fund in mind. MySuper will ensure that Australians have a fair system of accumulating superannuation. The standard will be required by regulation and will set the types of fees that may be charged. In fact, there are only six types of fees which will exist under the MySuper product, compared to the variety of fee scales that apply in the superannuation market at the moment. The bill will make it mandatory for employers to make contributions into a superannuation fund that offers this product. This is part of a large-scale revolution for the Australian superannuation system and it complements this week's historic passage through the parliament of the minerals resource rent tax, which is intended to spread the benefits of the mining boom across the nation. In addition to tax breaks for small business and funding the development of to critical infrastructure, the mining tax paves the way to building on the superannuation guarantee and increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is where MySuper becomes very important. The increase will be transitioned over the next decade, increasing the nation's $1.3 trillion superannuation savings pool by another $550 billion to the year 2035. Those national savings will be able to be invested in capital-intensive and social infrastructure which will go to the benefit of all Australians. The minerals resource rent tax will certainly increase superannuation savings for almost 8.5 million Australian workers, who are seeking opportunities in their retirement. There is no doubt that this is a historic move that will enable more Australians to enjoy a better retirement income in their senior years. People who have worked hard all their lives to build this nation will have certainty and will be able to live with respect, dignity and comfort on their contributions to their superannuation savings, when they retire. For those Australians on a low income, below the tax-free threshold, many of whom I represent in my own electorate, this will also enable a superannuation contribution to be made, effectively on a tax-free basis. They will therefore not be required to provide the 15 per cent entry fee for superannuation contributions. This will ensure a much fairer taxation of their superannuation and will be encouragement for people of low income to use superannuation as a preferred saving model. We on this side of the House are very proud to be further enhancing superannuation through MySuper. After all, it was a Labor government back in 1986 that took the first steps to allow award based superannuation to be developed. Many may recall the government's Prices and Incomes Accord with the ACTU at that stage. Those of us of a certain age and above will no doubt recall that the union movement sacrificed wage increases at that stage to offset a three per cent compulsory award based contribution to retirement income through the development of award based superannuation. For many blue-collar people, that represented their first opportunity to experience superannuation. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in its first national survey of superannuation coverage, in 1974 only 32 per cent of the workforce was covered by superannuation. Madam Deputy Speaker better Burke, you will not be surprised to learn that that was made up of mainly white-collar employees, managerial staff and particularly state and Commonwealth public servants. Following those reforms of the Accord process of 1986, in 1988 the superannuation guarantee came into effect and applied to all Australian workers. That is something that we on this side of the House are particularly proud of. It ensured that all workers, regardless of whether they were covered by an award or not, were subject at that stage to a three per cent superannuation guarantee. Apart from establishing a system for every Australian worker to benefit from superannuation in their retirement, it also set the platform for an enhanced national savings regime for all Australians. I have already indicated that the pool of national an savings through superannuation currently stands at $1.3 trillion. This bill addresses the challenge of Australia's ageing population. The fact is that, as baby boomers are growing old gracefully, they are nevertheless living longer than ever before. In fact, the ABS indicates that, by 2050, 25 per cent of Australians will be at retirement age. So it is paramount for our nation's future and long term sustainability to plan ahead to ensure that we are prepared for those days and to make appropriate plans for the ageing population and to be able to sustain people through their retirement years. It is in the interests of all of us, including the generations yet to come, to encourage working Australians to plan for and save for their retirement. Because it is in our national interest to secure the retirement income of our ageing population, it is only right that individuals should be given a hand in looking after their retirement savings. As a nation, we should make the job easier, and that is why the government, through this bill, through MySuper, intends to minimise the unnecessary and unfair fees and charges which often make significant deductions from the savings pool of people who, quite frankly, work all their lives with a view to accumulating their retirement fund. Australians on average pay $85 a month in superannuation fees. Those on low incomes, including a large number of the people, as I indicated, in my electorate of FowlerDebate interrupted. NA The SPEAKER (19:00): Order! It being 7 pm I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Boothby Electorate: Tonsley Park Master Plan",154
282,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak on the release by the South Australian state government of the Tonsley Park master plan yesterday. The intention of the master plan is to remediate and redevelop the Tonsley Mitsubishi manufacturing plant site, which is in my electorate at Tonsley Park. The area of land equates to approximately 62 hectares, which is more than one-sixth the size of the Adelaide CBD. The Mitsubishi manufacturing plant was closed in early 2008, at the expense of almost 1,000 local jobs. The facility had been an automotive manufacturing plant since 1964, originally opened by Sir Robert Menzies in October 1964 as a Chrysler Australia plant. Since the plant's closure, this 62-hectare facility at the centre of my electorate has sat largely empty and unused. It was purchased by the South Australian government in 2009 for $32.5 million. The original intention was to develop the site for new industries, including high-end manufacturing, research and new technologies. Yesterday, the state government released their 220-page master plan for the site, and I cautiously welcome that announcement. The master plan proposes to develop the site for a combination of residential, retail, hospitality and industry uses. These will be focused around a town square that is integrated with the re-use of the main assembly plant's shell. In addition, the redevelopment will also include the TAFE SA Sustainable Industries Education Centre. The proposal will provide some certainty for investors, and I welcome the new local jobs that this plan will create. If the plan is realised, the proposal will create 6,300 jobs over 20 years and $1 billion in private investment. However, the caution I highlight here is that the state government has so far only attracted one investor to this site and, like so many other announcements that the South Australian government has made, the devil is in the 220 pages of detail. In 2010 their promise was for a development that would create 8,600 jobs; now it is 6,300 jobs-2,300 jobs have gone missing. In 2010 the deadline for completion was 2026; now it is 2032. In 2010 they were not subdividing and selling off residential property. But now they are, in the interest of reducing the state government's contribution. In relation to the concern the state government had about purchasing the site to prevent it becoming a storage depot: when you read the plan, you realise that this is exactly what they plan to do. According to the master plan, for the sustainable light industry they plan to include as part of the redevelopment, their proposal is that 70 per cent of it be warehousing. In terms of the residential development, I welcome the fact they are looking at Subiaco Docklands and East Perth. I think they are excellent examples of successful developments. Lastly, in terms of having a hub or a cluster, it is important that we back our strengths. Industry clusters are only successful when they are industries that we are already strong in. The Waite Campus in my electorate is a perfect example of this-a co-location of university, research and industry, all together in areas that we are traditionally strong in, including viticulture and agriculture. 'Clean tech', 'sustainable light industry' and 'advanced manufacturing' are all buzzwords, but buzzwords will not make this industry cluster successful. I have been around long enough to see the South Australian government make these grand announcements and release fantastic flyover videos but then scale back the project to the point where it just does not exist. It would be a great thing for some enterprising person to come up with a mash up of all of these flyover videos which the state government have produced. They look fantastic, but ultimately what we end up with is nothing like these videos. So, I am a bit sceptical about it. I cautiously welcome it. If it does come to be, it will be good news for local people. I sincerely hope it is not another multifunction polis. It still remains to be seen whether vision of the plan of Parisian boulevards, urban chic and French industrial design is ever realised at this site, but I do hope the state government can move forward with this and actually make it happen. World Plumbing Day",156
283,Ms LIVERMORE,ADJOURNMENT," In private members' business on Monday night in the Federation Chamber, members debated a motion that was put forward by the member for Flinders marking World Plumbing Day, which was on 11 March. I missed my opportunity to speak on that debate because time had expired. But in my preparation for that speech, it seemed to me that it was very worthwhile spending my time during the adjournment debate tonight acknowledging that particular event. I can understand that, at first glance, other members and those listening might ask themselves why the House might have spent that time on Monday night recognising a particular trade or profession with a motion such as that about World Plumbing Day. But those same members and listeners would not think twice about the House debating a motion about the Millennium Development Goals, which happens quite regularly. We do that here in the Australian parliament because we take very seriously our obligation to work with the international community to reduce poverty and disease in the world. I note that the member for Corio has just left the chamber. In his role as the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs he is at the forefront of advocacy about Australia's responsibility for improving the living standards of our Pacific neighbours. The plumbers of the world, as represented by the World Plumbing Council, take those obligations very seriously too. They are out there every day providing the clean water and sanitation essential to good health and human development. Clean water the and sanitation are explicitly included in Millennium Development Goal No. 10, with the aim being to have the proportion of that people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. Furthermore it has been recognised by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban KiMoon that in fact few of the Millennium Development Goals are achievable without those basic needs being met. He has said: … access to sanitation is deeply connected to virtually all the MDG in particular those involving the environment, gender equality and the reduction of child mortality and poverty. Given those words, you can see that the World Plumbing Council is to be commended for keeping us focused on this important aspect of the Millennium Development Goals and for championing the role of plumbers in supporting the health of people today and helping us to manage our water resources sustainably. Progress is being made around the world, but yet again this year's World Plumbing Day on 11 March was a chance for all of us to reflect on how much still needs to be done and the enormous human cost of inaction on clean water and sanitation. One in five or around half a billion people in the world have no source of clean drinking water. Some 40 per cent of the world's population do not have access to a hygienic means of personal sanitation-in other words, not even access to something as basic as a pit latrine. The consequences of dirty water and lack of hygiene are incredibly serious. According to the World Health Organisation, each and every day 3,900 children die because of dirty water or poor hygiene. In fact disease transmitted through dirty water or human excrement is the second leading cause of death among children worldwide. The Australian government has been part of global efforts to improve access to clean water and sanitation in developing countries. One example is the series of projects in Indonesia where 77,000 homes were connected to safe piped water and 5,000 households were connected to sewers. In the last budget we added another $433 million for the water, sanitation and hygiene sector to Australia's aid program, doubling spending in this area to $870 million over the period from 2011-12 to 2014-15. This additional funding will help to provide over 2.5 million people in Africa, South Asia and East Asia with access to clean water and two million people globally with access to basic sanitation and improved hygiene. Governments can and are providing leadership and funding towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals with respect to sanitation and water. It is plumbers, however, who bring their expertise to the task of designing practical systems for providing water and sanitation and installing them in the most efficient way. That is why there has been widespread and deserved recognition of the role of plumbers as we mark World Plumbing Day. Here in Australia, we cannot be accused of taking water for granted and we do not take our plumbers for granted either. We know that plumbers are a key part of transforming our homes and cities to be capable of conserving and recycling water. We have learnt to appreciate the true value of water and the motion was all about showing that we appreciate our plumbers as well. (Time expired) Canning Walk for Autism",157
284,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT," This Friday, 23 March 2012, I will be commencing my Canning Walk for Autism with an official launch at the Mandurah foreshore at 8 am. This event will see me walk through the electorate of Canning over 10 days. I will walk more than 100 kilometres, visiting 43 schools along the way, to raise awareness and much needed funding to support families of children with autism. This event was inspired by my relationship with 13-year old Dermott Barnard, who has autism, and l am honoured to have Dermott as the face of my fundraising campaign. I have known Dermott since 2005 when he adopted me through the Adopt a Politician campaign. Since that time, I have seen Dermott grow and succeed despite his battle with autism. I have been so touched by Dermott's passion for life, including his passion for the Dockers AFL team, although I cannot say I agree with him on that because I am a member of the Eagles. He and I quite often joust over that issue. I have initiated this 10-day, 100-kilometre walk to do what I can so that other people with autism have a chance to become champions, the way Dermott Barnard has. This event is being supported by the Autism Association of WA and their insurer, Zenith Insurance. All money raised will go straight to Autism WA, as they are best placed to ensure the money is used appropriately. Autism Awareness in Canberra has also been most supportive, helping to promote this event through its social media network. During the walk, on Tuesday, 27 March, I will be visiting INKA Respite in Lake Clifton, which is also in my electorate. It is not-for-profit farm-style respite stay for teenagers and adults with autism spectrum disorder and Down syndrome. I will be able to join the staff and residents at INKA for lunch and will, I am sure, learn much more about autism and ways people can help. Joining me on the walk will be some of my parliamentary colleagues, members of local government, business people and people from community groups and other support networks. Both state and federal members are joining me and I am very pleased to say that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop, and the WA Minister for Health, Kim Hames, are among them. I would like to thank all of these people for the support they are giving me during what I expect will be a somewhat gruelling event, although not as gruelling as the challenges faced by those with autism and their families. I would also like to thank those generous people who have donated through my fundraising webpage. Those who wish to donate, please visit www.everydayhero.com.au/don_randall. I would now like to take this opportunity to tell you more about autism and its effects. Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, describes a group of related disorders belonging to the same diagnostic category and sharing the same core symptoms. These include autism, Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder. Autism is a complex developmental disorder where a person's ability to communicate and develop social relationships is inhibited. Autism is a lifelong disorder and is the most common developmental disorder in Australia. Today, one in 110 Australian children are diagnosed with ASD. Early signs that can alert a parent to the concern that their child may not be developing as they should are in the manner a in which their child responds to them. This is the key to dealing with autism. No-one has found a cure, but early intervention is the key. The child may have limited speech or may not learn to speak at all. The child may also have difficulty in understanding others or perhaps the child does not seem interested in playing with other children, even though the child has developed good spoken language skills. Distress with change of routine is another common feature. They love to be in the same routine and they feel uncomfortable if they are taken out of it. The good news is that with intervention, particularly early intervention, children with autism can be supported and they can go on to gain many of the skills that most of us enjoy. My good friend Dermott Barnard is a great example of this, and credit must go to his mother, Lyn, who has spent so much time making sure that Dermott gets the opportunities and the one-on-one care that he deserves. There are programs in place so that children are able to receive the help and education they need to be able to actively participate in everyday life. Unfortunately, the cause of autism is still unknown, despite ongoing worldwide research. It is for these reasons that I am throwing my support behind this cause. The research is ongoing and support services are still needed. I welcome everyone to join me on the walk, and I look forward to seeing those people who are already joining me out in Canning. Fowler Electorate: Harmony Day",158
285,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," As well as being my mother's birthday, 21 March is a significant day for all Australians. Today we celebrate our unique diversity and our harmonious community. This is Harmony Day. Today we recognise that the country we call home was built by generations of people who left their homelands in search of a better life. Other than Aboriginal people, all of us are either migrants or descended from migrants. I proudly represent the most multicultural community in the whole of Australia. In fact, according to the ABS, 50 per cent of my electorate of Fowler were born overseas. Becoming the member for Fowler certainly allowed me to see first hand the wonderful contributions that members of various cultural groups make not only to their respective communities but also to the general fabric of Australia itself. The contributions are widespread, ranging from economic in various fields, particularly in small business in my community, as well as a social and cultural diversity. Members of different cultural groups have introduced Australia to new cuisines as well as to vibrant and colourful customs and celebratory events, among other things. I currently have in my office an intern from the Australian National University, Ms Amanda Pashley. I have asked her to conduct a research project that will explore the many benefits of migration to Australian society. Amanda will compare the experiences of the Vietnamese groups who migrated to Australia following the Vietnam War in the late seventies to the experiences of more recently arrived refugees. There is undoubtedly a stigma in some sections of Australian society that refugees represent a substantial cost to the host community. We rarely acknowledge the many positive contributions they make to our society. I would like to also praise the valuable work of the migrant resource centres, including the Liverpool and Fairfield migrant resource centres in my electorate. They do a very good job in regard to the community in ensuring that people are properly settled, enabling them to become part of the general fabric of the Australian way of life. The Fairfield MRC is led by my friend Julio Gruttulini and the coordinator Ricci Bartels. The Liverpool MRC is led by chairperson Dr Amad Mtashar and manager Kamalle Dabboussy. They work very hard with their teams to ensure that the community is aware of the many positive aspects of cultural diversity and how that can be included in our normal way of life. As the member for Fowler, I have been able to witness first hand these benefits. I have been privileged to attend a number of vibrant celebrations, including the Lunar New Year Festival, Tet Festival, Chinese Moon Festival-which draws in outsiders from all over Sydney into the vibrant suburb of Cabramatta-as well as the Serbian Folkloric Festival in Bonnyrigg, and many others. During these events, the various groups put on display the sounds, the tastes, the colours and the vibrancy of their homelands, while keeping in mind that they are Australian. I have also had the opportunity to meet some extraordinary individuals who work very hard to represent their fellow countrymen in the best possible way and to make the best of their contributions to the Australian community. One such individual is James Chan, a local businessman. James is a respected and hard working member of the business community and a member of the Australian-Chinese community. In fact he is the President of the Australian-Chinese Buddhist Society. He works very hard, together with his wife, Jenny. Supported by their family, they make a tremendous contribution not only to local business but through what they do for our community generally. Amongst many other contributions, James and his army of volunteers-including Jensen Tran and Vinh Trang-work very hard with the Mingyue Lay Buddhist Temple in Bonnyrigg. The temple was established 25 years ago and draws thousands of people to the area. James is one of a number of people in my diverse electorate who do everything possible to ensure that we live in a harmonious and inclusive society. (Time expired) Rural Doctors Association Parliamentary Breakfast",160
286,Mr MCCORMACK,ADJOURNMENT," 'If rural practice was a patient, I would say that its condition would be critical.' Those were the words of Dr Maxine Percival as she addressed the third annual Rural Doctors Association of Australia parliamentary breakfast on 29 February. Rural practice, Dr Percival maintains, 'needs urgent resuscitation with appropriate funding'. Dr Percival would know better than most the seriousness of the situation. From Moree in northern NSW, Dr Percival has spent more than 25 years working hard specialising in rural birthing services and Indigenous health. A general practitioner and obstetrician, she was recognised for her dedication and skill in 2009 when she was deservedly named National Rural Doctor of the Year. Dr Percival gave an impassioned and informed speech to the breakfast which was attended by rural doctors from across the nation as well as, for the first time, a health minister-and I appreciate the fact Tanya Plibersek turned up, at least for the first part of the event. It is important the new health minister, as part of her brief, appreciates and understands the unique challenges faced by rural doctors and the strains of regional health in general. There is no better way of getting a handle on the demands and expectations of a GP than by hearing about it first hand, particularly from someone with the experience of Dr Percival or the President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Dr Paul Mara, from Gundagai in my Riverina electorate. Dr Mara has headed the national rural doctors' body for two years and is an outstanding advocate for country doctors and country health services. He cleverly and appropriately took the opportunity at the recent breakfast to include among the handout material a photocopy of the front page of his local newspaper, the Gundagai Independent, from 6 February 2012. In doing this, Dr Mara brought a Riverina perspective to a frustrating problem which is a burden on the provision of decent health services in regional areas. The article was headed 'Hurdles keep doctors away from bush'. It told of how technicalities in the way doctors are counted mean areas such as Gundagai do not qualify for the medical support they both deserve and need. The text was accompanied by a photograph of Dr Barb Cameron, who is passionate about regional health yet might not be able to use up her bond in many small country towns due to the rules of her bonded position. Bonded students have to work off their bonds in an area which is counted as a district with a workforce shortage. This system has some merit and I am the first to argue that there must be rules in place, and enforced, to ensure places where doctors are difficult to come by receive the resourcing and personnel they so desperately require. There is an argument for all small country towns with a population of under 15,000 to be automatically classified as a district of workforce shortage. The market will set the limit. However, as Dr Cameron said: 'Because of the way they count things, Gundagai isn't classed as district workforce shortage-but it clearly is.' That is notwithstanding the fact that Gundagai has only two fully qualified doctors providing services 24/7. I am pleased the member for Bowman, the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional health services and Indigenous health, Dr Andrew Laming, is at the table. He knows all too well the health challenges of the Riverina, having practised at Gundagai in 1992. Dr Cameron continued: 'It is a major problem. There is not just a shortage of doctors; there is a distribution problem. Just because we have all these medical graduates doesn't mean we can get them in the country, which is where we need them.' An area is considered a district of workforce shortage if it falls below the national average for the provision of medical services for the speciality, based on the latest Medicare billing statistics, but the portrayal of this less than transparent. Dr Cameron said the problem with the statistics is that they class junior doctors, such as herself and the Gundagai registrar, as full doctors, but they both still require the supervision of trained specialists. When these junior doctors do the rounds of the hospital they require supervision, as per the rules. This places some pressure and commitment requirements on the town's husband and wife doctor duo, Paul Mara and Virginia Wrice, who are already run off their feet and it limits where a doctor such as Dr Cameron can go to work off her bond. Dr Cameron said, 'The fact is that GPs, especially in rural areas, are getting older and they're going to retire. In 10 or 15 years, Dr Mara and my father's generation will retire and country areas will be in real trouble.' Dr Cameron's father, Dr Ian Cameron, is the long-serving chief executive officer of the New South Wales Rural Doctors Network based at Newcastle which, in conjunction with the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, is lobbying hard to get the situation rectified. There could be no better organisations working to make things happen. Both are representative groups of some of Australia's finest professionals: country doctors. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Rural Doctors Association movement. It is a quarter of a century since the New South Wales rural doctors' dispute, which was the catalyst for the formation of the state rural doctors associations and the RDAA itself. According to Dr Percival, back at that time seeing a patient went from $22 to $13.85 per consultation, regardless of the time of day or length of consultation. This obviously left doctors demoralised and undervalued and many wanted to leave the rural doctors' practices. I congratulate all rural doctors for their perseverance and the wonderful care is they provide and wish the Rural Doctors Association of Australia all the very best in all of its future endeavours. (Time expired) Chisholm Electorate: Harmony Day",161
287,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT," Today is Harmony Day and I am proud to be celebrating it with many people. I am sorry I am not back in my electorate, where I know many events are happening today. The continuing message for Harmony Day in 2012 is that everyone belongs, which means all Australians are welcome to be part of our country, regardless of their background. It is time to reflect on where Australia has come from and to recognise traditional owners of its land, and it is about community participation, inclusiveness and respect. That is one of the wonderful things about the country we live in and my electorate of Chisholm. I have two municipalities within my electorate: Monash and Whitehorse. In Monash about 40 per cent of its residents were born overseas and in Whitehorse 30 per cent. This is a very high proportion of people born overseas. It is made up of many different community groups and many different nationalities. It makes Chisholm a vibrant place to live. The place is made up of many phenomenal individuals, like Halina Wagowska. Halina has just put out a book. She demonstrates the story of what it was like to come to Australia, to make it a home, and also to contribute back to the country that has nurtured her. Halina says: These short stories are autobiographical not their main subject. Some pay homage to the people I have known and loved. Some describe unusual places and events and are a kind of testimony. It has been said: But contrary to what Halina saysand knowing her well I would testify to thisnone are 'commonplace', whether her stories tell of the gentile nanny who followed Halina's into the ghetto, the Russian soldier who saved her at the end of the war and nursed her back to health or the char ladies of Collins Street who first called the new immigrant a 'refo' before taking her into their hearts. And: Adopted mother, Frieda, keeps telling the young Halina that if they survive the camps they shall have to testify until they die, but The Testimony is also a record of what comes next for the young Halina: love, a career in pathology, and 'her life's work' in human rights-pouring her energy into everything from bursaries for Aboriginal education and books for the victims of the Black Saturday bushfires to bioethics and gay marriage. Described by the author as her last testimony before she drops off the twigand I say to Halina: 'Don't do that anytime soon'this carefully crafted work is no straightforward autobiography but one in which the people and places Halina has known take centre stage. The thematic pieces provide jewels of wisdom from a woman who has lived a truly full-richly rewarding but also horrifically harrowing-life. Eighty-one-year-old human rights activist Halina Wagowska survived the Auschwitz and Stutthof concentration camps in her early teens before immigrating to Australia. Over the years she has frequently testified to the consequences of prejudice she witnessed. Halina is the fabric of my community and she is an amazing human being. Her story is like many of those who have come and made Australia home. In fact, it is probably not but I am like many-it is far more remarkable. Then there is Ayen's story. Ayen attends the Blackburn English Language School, which is in my electorate. It is a phenomenal institution that provides children, predominantly migrants and refugees, with 20 weeks of language experience. This ensures that when they go to school they will be able to get right into the curriculum, with their English way up to speed. I had the family honour of recently visiting the English language school, with Minister Kate Lundy and my colleague the member for Deakin. It was a great day. Ayen's story says: I came to Australia in October 2006 with with my mum, dad, baby sister and little cousin. My cousin's name is Adur and we brought her to Australia to be with her mum, dad, brother. She was too young to travel with them when they arrived. When we arrived my aunt and uncle had a party for everyone because they were so happy to have Adur reunited with them. … … … My house in Sudan was made of mud. We had sticks at the windows but no curtains. Our beds were made from trees but they were comfortable. One bad thing was that the water would come in the house every day and it was smelly. … … … Sometimes I was scared when the animals came into our village. Many donkeys would come into the house to look for food. One day a rhinoceros tried to attack my mother but our dog stopped the rhinoceros. Mum got everyone into the house quickly. We had to keep the village gates closed to stop the elephants from coming in. But one day a big elephant broke the big gate to drink water from the tap. … … … One day I was very scared because some people broke the village gate and killed some people. Everyone was yelling and screaming and crying. My family was running with other people-we ran for two nights and one day. They finally arrived in Australia. She says: In Australia. I really like my school. At home I watch television and my favourite show is The Simpsons. … … … In the future I want to be a teacher because I want to 'know everything'-just like my mum. Ayen's mother is a teacher, and she has great respect for her. This is what our community is made up of: people from all walks of life who have amazing stories and then come and make Australia home. We should remember that these people have embraced us. It is not just us embracing them, they have embraced us. Harmony Day is a great day to recall all those fantastic stories and to recall what a great place Australia is to live in. Bowman Electorate: Pinklands Sporting Complex",163
288,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT," Many here will be familiar with my story. The Pinklands Sporting Complex is a 22-hectare reserve in my electorate of Bowman, nestled against Moreton Bay, encircled by the beautiful Eprapah Reserve, the southern expansion of Thornlands, which after all is a part of outer metropolitan Brisbane meeting Moreton Bay. On any morning you will find koalas, natural wildlife, the sound of Australian bushland punctuated only by the squeals of delight of young children playing netball or practising rugby league or the silent exhilaration of riding a pony at the pony club for the first time. Perhaps those at Yurara Art Society are indulging in their great passion for painting or possibly people are pulling up to play a day of bridge. It is so typically Australian, yet entering the Pinklands Sporting Complex is increasingly becoming a dangerous proposition. This was highlighted just this weekend with an appalling three-vehicle collision in very, very bad weather when a young resident was attempting to turn right into oncoming traffic and was hit from behind. Luckily, no-one was hurt but that was only through fate and incredible luck, because these three vehicles were strewn across the road. A power pole fell onto one of the vehicle's bonnets and, for a long period, traffic had to be diverted. This is the most recent example of what has been a 10-year struggle to improve entrance to the Pinklands sporting facility for young families who drive their children to their pursuits and passions. They should be able to do that with a set of traffic allows them to do so safely. This has been for me a six-year campaign, going back to the year after I was elected. In that era, we worked to expand the initial exit to two lanes to allow vehicles to turn left without being impeded. What has happened in the last 12 months is most disappointing. Finally, a state government agreed to duplicate ClevelandRedland Bay Road, which runs past Pinklands. It put in place and installed the traffic lights that we needed, only for our local Redland City Council to fail to do its part of the bargain: connect up the Pinklands sporting facility to the set of traffic lights that have been installed. We have the appalling situation of a road closed sign into the Pinklands Sporting Complex and local families in their thousands every weekend using the ancient and extremely dangerous exit as a result. I honestly asked a very simple question as any elected member would: why was this bungle-this debacle-last year not fixed with the appropriate council works being synchronised with the state government duplication of the road? There has been no satisfactory answer. The second question I asked was: when will it be fixed? Similarly, no answer has been forthcoming. At this moment, many people in Redlands would say, 'We admire the campaign but why should a federal member of parliament be taking the lead?' I make a very, very simple pledge and undertaking to the people of Redlands: if any level of government, even my own, does not deliver for you, you are completely within your rights, having given that jurisdiction the chance to fix the problem, to go to other levels and seek their support, mobilise the community and ensure resources are directed to get a solution that is best for the people. That is all I am asking lights that for here in Pinklands. Redland council have had their chance. They have had their meetings and delivered nothing. They have written meaningless correspondence on the issue but given no comfort to the people who brave that intersection every weekend. I was disappointed to see that it finally became personal when last week the local councillor, whose identity I will protect by not naming her in this chamber, said: Mr Laming has long touted that he ""fixed Pinklands"" access in the past, and that he's undertaken a decade-long campaign for a safe Pinklands entrance. Yet, a search revealed that from 2004 to today's date there has only been one letter from Mr Laming to council relating to roads, safety or Pinklands. It's dated February this year and sent to the council's CEO … one letter in seven years, some campaign! I would like to seek leave at the end of the speech to table the nine pieces of correspondence in seven months that actually led to the intersection being fixed in the first place, which was correspondence between me, a state member and the mayor. The fact that those documents are not on the council record in should no way impugn the community effort to get this intersection fixed. It is quite simple: we want to work together to get this fixed to make it safe for people to drive into and out of Pinklands every day of our lives, but I am disappointed to see the response from this councillor who said the following, which I can only regard as a hysterical rant in the paper: Do we want petty, party political squabbling in council as well? Do we really want a factionalised council run by faceless people at party headquarters? Do we want councillors who are lap dogs for the federal member? The questions are rhetorical - of course we don't. Let's fix this intersection. (Time expired) World Water Day World Plumbing Day",164
289,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT," I bring to the House today an issue that I think is very important-the importance of clean water and sanitation ensuring safety and that the Millennium Development Goals are met. Water is the very lifeblood. Without it, there is no life. is a basic human need; however, access to clean and abundant water remains a dream for millions of people around the world. World Water Day is tomorrow, 22 March, and there will be badges available for all members to wear tomorrow. It is to raise awareness that the lack of clean water and sanitation is the biggest cause of death and disease in developing countries. We also recently celebrated World Plumbing Day, on 11 March, and there was a private member's motion in this parliament recognising the importance of plumbing for the health and safety of our communities. There is cause for celebration. We have just achieved the Millennium Development Goal target for drinking water. Around two billion people have gained access to clean drinking water since 1990. There are 884 million people around the world who still have no clean drinking water and 2.5 billion people have nowhere to go to the toilet. While access to water has increased, sanitation has not received the same priority. Progress on sanitation has been much slower, and we are behind in meeting that Millennium Development Goal. Access to water and sanitation saves lives. Diarrhoea is the biggest killer of children in Africa. It is the second most common death amongst all children under five. It kills more children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined, so it is an issue that really needs to be addressed. Ninety per cent of cases of diarrhoea are due to poor water quality and sanitation. Water is one of our most precious, simple needs yet it is so powerful. Clean water and sanitation can transform lives and bring dignity to and empower so many people and communities. Access to clean water and sanitation promotes gender equity and empowers women and girls. Girls miss school because they spend hours every day fetching water It for their families and, with the onset of puberty, unisex toilets and lack of menstrual hygiene facilities in schools deter attendance. Water provides a safe and hygienic environment for childbirth and postnatal care to increase chances of survival for mothers and newborns. Not all children born in the world will live. It is a devastating and tragic fact that so many lives are still taken by preventable disease because of the lack of access to the most basic of resources-clean water. Aid programs focused on clinical response will be of questionable benefit if the medicines are taken with water contaminated by human faeces. We need to prioritise water and sanitation in aid budgets. Across the OECD over the last 10 years, aid to help the HIV-AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has increased by nearly 500 per cent while aid for water and sanitation has increased by only 79 per cent. Given the impact that increasing money spent on clean water and sanitation can have, there is no argument that more needs to be invested in clean water and sanitation. For every dollar invested in water and sanitation, on average, eight dollars are returned in better health and increased productivity. World Water Day is the time to bring to the attention of the government and all of us in this parliament the need to focus our aid budget on these areas, on these life-saving measures. A report by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF showed that more people in the Pacific are at risk from sanitation related disease now than in 1990. Poor rural communities in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and other countries in our region still lack access to clean water and toilets, which makes them vulnerable to cholera outbreaks. I call on all members of this parliament to join together with me in this campaign. (Time expired) Glasson, Hon. William Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (19:41): I rise to place on the Hansard record a tribute to a great Australian, certainly a great Queenslander, and the former member for Gregory in the Queensland parliament, the Hon. William Glasson, who was known to all of us as Bill Glasson. Bill passed away last evening. He was born on 23 February 1925. There was no fiercer advocate for the people of outback Queensland or the bush than Bill Glasson, not only in his public life prior to parliament but of course in his time as a minister in the National and Liberal Party governments in Queensland. Not only was he a great lover of the bush; the bush loved him. Why? Because he grew up in the bush and understood the bush. A part of his early education was through correspondence. He went to state schools and then on to boarding school in Brisbane. He put his career down as jackaroo. I can relate to that having been one myself. He was a station manager and did some droving of livestock between towns way before the modern transport modes were as plentiful as they are today. It was the way livestock was moved from property to property, town to town and so often to market. He was a grazier and a pastoralist and owned land in western Queensland. He gave generously of his time in public life as well. He served as a councillor on the Winton Shire Council from 1955 to 1957. Winton is that wonderful town in western Queensland, which was in the state seat of Gregory but is now in the state seat of Mt Isa and the federal seat of Maranoa, that gave birth to Banjo Paterson's Waltzing Matilda, the song that we identify as our unofficial national anthem. It was in Winton that the tune to Waltzing Matilda was first played, by Christina Macpherson on a piano. From there Waltzing Matilda has become legendary across Australia. During the Second World War, Bill Glasson served in the Royal Australian Air Force between 1943 and 1945 as a Flying Officer. His interests included horse sports such as campdrafting and racing. In many parts of outback of Australia campdrafts, rodeos and bush races are the sorts of things people like to participate in on the weekend and they perform a great social function. He was a great supporter of country racing and shows. He was also very supportive of the young and youth organisations. He was the president of the Gregory Turf Club and the Winton Rodeo Association. There is also a Legacy broadcast, and in my own home town that is quite often on radios during Easter and Good Friday. I am not quite sure whether that is the case out where Bill came from in Longreach. Money would be raised for Legacy on Good Friday to support the great work that Legacy does. Bill always made himself available to help others. He was elected in 1974 as part of that huge swing against the Labor Party in Queensland when the Labor Party was reduced to a cricket team of 11 members. The other thing I note about Bill, and I knew him quite well as I grew up, is that as Minister for Lands and Forestry in that period he gave people certainty of tenure of their land title. He also oversaw the breakup of some of the large pastoral holdings into ballots that gave other people a start in life when those ballots were determined. It also gave people additional areas of land from large pastoral holdings into smaller holdings. He oversaw the building of hospitals and schools. He was a great supporter of the decentralisation of Queensland and the legacy he leaves is still to be seen in western Queensland-the base hospitals Longreach and in Barcaldine. The main roads department has got a base in Barcaldine. These are legacies of Bill Glasson, as the member for Gregory at the time. Of course, Bill is one of those great people who has left a great legacy of building a better place in western Queensland. He will be missed. I pass on my condolences to his family, including Dr Bill Glasson, ophthalmologist. (Time expired)",166

291,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT," Last Monday the Senate approved and passed the government's minerals resource rent tax. It, together with the petroleum resource rent tax, will be assisting Australia's businesses and workers by funding national taxation and superannuation reforms, including a cut to company tax to 29 per cent, a new break for small business from 1 July 2012 and, most importantly, incredible superannuation savings for 8.4 million Australians. The opposition oppose that tax relief for 2.7 million small businesses. They oppose that superannuation reform that will allow a 30-year-old worker on an average income to retire with an extra $100,000 in savings. Amazingly, they oppose our investment in much-needed upgrades to infrastructure across both rural and urban Australia. The Liberals do this because they are being squeezed by some of the iron and coal plutocrats. That was very clear today. Why?",168
292,Mr Robert,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 90 is about reflections on members. The member for Melbourne Ports is imputing an improper in motive",168
293,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"In future the honourable member will not abuse the process of the House; otherwise, I will deal with him.",168
294,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"I am making a political criticism, not of individuals but of the political decisions of the Liberal Party to accept such extravagant support from people like Mr Clive Palmer-the $4 million manwhose donations to the Liberal Party are obviously changing their policies. There is a brutal Polish saying that says, 'You pay and you get.' As we have heard from the Special Minister of State, Clive Palmer has donated $4 million to the coalition-you pay and you get. Nothing shows the opposition are more interested in protecting their iron and coal plutocrat mates than their relationship with Mr Twiggy Forrest. Mr Forrest has contributed much to this country and he has certainly done well out of Australia. He claimed, when he came to Canberra, that he is standing up for the little Aussie battler. Presumably, they all have private jets. This MRRT, as it affects him, is much more like the Wall Street executive complaining about obscene bonuses while being reduced to merely outrageous bonuses. Mr Forrest came to Canberra to speak of the suffering the government will place on his company. Laura Tingle, in her article in the Financial Review on 17 June 2011 entitled 'Taxpayer Twiggy goes out on a limb', explained that the concerns he had raised with the government-the retrospective nature of tax doubling the value of spent capital, an immediate write-off in new capital and the full transferability of super mining viability across projects-were all addressed by the government. Mr Forrest came here in his private jet to modify the tax and we met his concerns. Mr Forrest admitted that on Lateline. He said: I can assure all of Australia this: under this new tax regime Fortescue will pay much less tax. However, as Laura Tingle points out, according to his own records he will be paying less than nothing because Fortescue has not paid any tax as a company so far. So he comes to Canberra to rail against a tax he has helped modify to meet his concerns, and he wants to pay less tax. Does he want to pay less than nothing? That is the question that I have to ask him. The Treasurer rightly pointed out in his article in the Monthly: Despite the howling of a small minority … The vast majority of our miners accept that they have a social obligation to pay their fair share the resources Australians own. What is even more confusing is that Mr Forrest remained quite silent when the Premier of New South Wales and the Western Australian Premier, who wail about the ruination of the MRRT, introduced increased state royalties. When the Western Australian Liberal Premier, Colin Barnett, announced he would lift royalties on iron ore production, Mr Forrest and other Liberals claimed that the money raised by the royalties would fund hospitals and nurses. Funny, I thought the opposition would, along with the rest of Australia, be all for investment on roads, bridges and infrastructure in mining regions, which is precisely what the minerals resource rent tax will do along with the other good that it will achieve. So the coalition is joined by a man who has professed his business will pay less tax under the MRRT and a man who launched the most extraordinary attack, as the Attorney-General pointed out, on the CIA. I was there on the grassy knoll with him. I must confess, we both- (Time expired) Broadband",168
295,Mr FLETCHER,ADJOURNMENT," Five years ago precisely, on 21 March 2007, the then Labor opposition announced its broadband policy. Five years later, Australia's broadband penetration ranking has dropped and Labor's policy has made zero difference to the broadband service received by 99.9 per cent of Australians. According to then opposition communications spokesman Stephen Conroy back in 2007, the coalition had done a terrible job. He said that the Howard government had 'comprehensively bungled its responsibilities' to facilitate the rollout of a fibre-to-the-node network. Labor apparently had a much better plan and Stephen Conroy was there to announce it, of tax on together with two people who have now disappeared from Labor's front-bench-Kevin Rudd and Lindsay Tanner. The plan was to build a fixed broadband network to 98 per cent of the population in five years. Five years on, what has been achieved by Minister Conroy? He has certainly splashed a lot of taxpayers' money up against the wall. The government owned National Broadband Network Company has been a financial black hole. Its latest annual report says it has received $1.36 billion in equity, funded entirely by taxpayers, and racked up losses exceeding $400 million. Yet according to the company's most recent disclosure in January this year, a grand total of 2,315 homes are receiving a service on its fixed broadband network-less than one tenth of one per cent of the 10 million premises the network is supposed to serve. So there is a stark contrast between what Senator Conroy promised and what he has delivered. He promised the new network would be substantially private sector funded, with public funding capped at $4.7 billion. He is now building a 100 per cent taxpayer funded and government owned network, the total cost of which looks likely to balloon to well in excess of $50 billion. He promised a competitive selection process, but hopelessly mismanaged it before abandoning it in early 2009. He promised a fixed network to 98 per cent of the population, but NBN is now rolling out wireless and satellite in rural remote areas, with only a smaller percentage to get a fixed connection. And he told us that his network would end Australia's 'broadband backwater' status. In October 2006, for example, Senator Conroy in a media release fulminated that: The latest OECD broadband statistics show Australia's ranking in the use of broadband remains mired at 17th out of 30 surveyed countries. Yet in June 2011, in the most recently published version of the OECD survey, where does Australia now rank in fixed broadband penetration? Twenty-first-on the very metric which Stephen Conroy said was the one against which his fixed broadband plan should be judged, Australia has dropped in the broadband penetration ranking. At the same time there have been very nasty anticompetitive side effects as the minister has tried to shore up NBN Co.'s hopeless business case. He has legislated to ban any new entrant from building a new high-speed broadband network to serve the consumer and small business market unless the operator adopts NBN Co.'s wholesale-only business model. This is a restriction on competitive entry the likes of which has not existed since telecommunications was deregulated in Australia in 1997. He has also legislated to sanction anticompetitive deals between NBN Co. and Telstra on the one hand, under with Telstra will receive $11 billion, and NBN Co. and Optus on the other, under which Optus will receive $880 million in exchange for those two companies agreeing to cease serving consumers and small businesses over their existing fixed line broadband networks, many of which, in the case of the hybrid fibre coax networks, are already capable, either today or with a modest upgrade, of delivering speeds of 100 megabits per second. These deals would be illegal under Australian competition law as and agreements between competitors to reduce competition were they not specifically sanctioned by the legislation introduced by Minister Conroy. In 2007, Labor's broadband policy document promised that the party would 'turn around Australia's broadband performance and put Australia back into the fast lane of the information superhighway'. Labor has fallen very far short of meeting this lofty ambition. For all the money it has spent, fixed broadband development and take-up has stalled and the private sector has largely halted fixed broadband investment. It is hard to avoid any conclusion but the obvious: Stephen Conroy has delivered five wasted years in Australian broadband policy. O'Connor Electorate: PortLink Inland Freight Corridor Plan",169
296,Mr CROOK,ADJOURNMENT," I am very pleased to speak to the House today about the nation-building project PortLink Inland Freight Corridor Plan in my electorate. This project is a significant infrastructure development for regional Western Australia and is set to have significant national benefits. PortLink has come about after more than 25 years of consideration. At first the project was envisaged as a transport hub in KalgoorlieBoulder and in more recent years it has progressed into the full PortLink project linking the major ports in Western Australia-Esperance, Port Karratha, Fremantle and, in the future, the Oakajee Industrial Port-with Kalgoorlie, as a gateway to the eastern states. It is a visionary project and I congratulate those that have kept it on the agenda over many years. In particular, I would like to congratulate and thank Graham Thomson, the former chairman of the GoldfieldsEsperance Development Commission, for his leadership in developing this project. PortLink will have many advantages for the nation. From a local member perspective, it will create jobs and improve industry within my electorate. On a state level, create safer roads, more connected regional communities and reduce heavy vehicle traffic around the metropolitan area. At a national level, PortLink will create a more effective transport network for the nation and will allow the resources industry to have greater access to the ports they need to export the minerals and resources that drive this nation's economy. In recent times, I have hosted the Prime Minister and Minister Albanese in Esperance to look at the project. As recently as last weekend Mr Albanese announced $2 million of federal funding to be put towards the next stage of the project. He also attended the Over the Horizon industry forum, facilitated by the Esperance Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Goldfields-Esperance Development Commission. There were some 230 participants, including local government, businesses and industry from across the Goldfields-Esperance region, as they discussed upcoming projects and plans for future developments. This was a very appropriate event at which to announce the PortLink funding. As part of the minister's visit, I also took the opportunity to showcase many future projects in the Esperance area. I would also like to thank the Western Australian Minister for Regional Hedland, Development, my Nationals WA colleague Brendon Grylls, for his ongoing support for this project. Minister Grylls has also been a strong supporter of the PortLink project. Through Royalties for Regions, Minister Grylls and the WA state government have committed $5 million towards the planning and development of PortLink. I would also like to acknowledge MLC Wendy Duncan, who lives in Esperance, for her commitment to the PortLink project. I would like to thank all of the Esperance leaders who made the day a success. In particular, I would like to thank the CEO of the Shire of Esperance, it will Mal Osborne, and Shire President Mal Heasman, Esperance Port CEO Shayne Flanagan, Grant Shipp from the Esperance Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Matt Dukes from Cliffs Natural Resources and Robert Hicks from the Goldfields-Esperance Development Commission. All of these leaders have shown tireless, unwavering support to their community and to the PortLink project. PortLink has now been given the initial support needed to enter the planning and development stage and I look forward to seeing this project progress in coming years.",170

Where financial advisers consequences of those actions should not necessarily There was a very clear direction from the Ripoll not the introduction of a complex new microregulation.

Yet in the Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Measures) Bill 2011 we are debating yet administrative burdens, increase compliance government says but what the government does House, as has been so eloquently put by many of my colleagues, have some serious concerns about which we think the legislation is flawed. Firstly, in many parts, unclear. This in and of itself costs. It contradicts the government's claims unclear, it will lead to many unintended consequences. The Association of Financial Advisers have 961E as creating uncertainty with respect to the legislation is so unclear that it will inevitably increases in professional indemnity premiums the application of the transitional agreements advice practices'. Obviously, with any increase uncertainty will lead to increased costs advisers. We think it is very important that Australians we were in government, we believed very transparent set of arrangements that would required to make decisions about their own purchased. Financial advisers are very important rely on their expertise to be able to make decisions families. We want to arm Australians with the families. So to put financial advisers out cost seems to make very little sense. Secondly, jobs, jobs, it is pretty clear that the changes job losses in the financial services industry parliamentary joint committee heard testimony AMP Financial Services, that these measures the industry. Mr Richard Klipin, CEO of the more pessimistic, estimating that up to 30,000 something we have heard about from those on be a consideration for them. We cannot forget that many people who are themselves small business men and women business, to use their expertise, to employ others have said, could result in many significant the chamber. Thirdly, the bill will legislate what many advice providers. As the dissenting … the disproportionate increase in costs to the industry financial advisers in Australia, the associated additional financial advice services providers will have accessibility of financial advice across Australia. Financial advisers have themselves said that in competition in the industry-and competition, consumers. It is through competition that consumers this legislation. There are five key areas in the legislation is unnecessarily complex and, leads to uncertainty and increased compliance of a productivity agenda, because, in being so identified proposed sections 961B(2)(g) and best interest duty. They are concerned that the have to be tested in the courts. This will lead to and, as they point out, 'lead to uncertainty in that will negatively impact on the value of in professional indemnity premiums, any for consumers who use the advice of financial be given the very best financial advice. When strongly that consumers needed a strong and provide them with the information that they financial future and the products that they to the well-being of so many Australians who about their future and the future of their ability to provide for themselves and for their of reach of so many consumers by increasing the for a government that says it is all about jobs, as a result of this legislation will lead to massive as firms try to adapt to the increased costs. The from Mr Craig Meller, Managing Director of could result in as many as 25,000 job losses in Association of Financial Advisers, was even job losses would result. Yet this is not the government benches. This does not seem to involved in the financial services industry are who have risked their own capital to set up a and to provide advice. This legislation, as I job losses, which does concern us on this side of describe as an unlevel playing field amongst coalition report suggests: and consumers, the reduction in the number of job losses and the further concentration of detrimental impacts on the cost, availability and they are concerned about the potential decrease as we all know, is incredibly important for are able to get the best deal and it is through competition that many advisers have advice and service for those consumers. The fourth point I would like to make concerned that the opt-in provision is seriously empirical evidence. In the dissenting PJC submission to the Ripoll inquiry, from the opt-in provision. The Ripoll inquiry then government, in its infinite wisdom, decided that first precedent. This does concern us. I would letter that was received by me from a financial notes these concerns. I will quote directly from direct cost that the opt-in obligations will was unable to replace a departing employee due operations. With over 600 active clients, we opt-in, which has been estimated at up to $120 an additional cost to our business of $72,000 reduces the opportunity for many within services which would otherwise enhance their as I have said before, is something that concerns government has not fully thought through. We of legislation, like so many of the announcements thought bubble which they then Fifthly, this legislation will greatly increase Financial Services Council that suggest it first year alone followed by $350 million in increase and is completely in contrast to the red tape and regulation through her belated which I note follows a deregulation task force year, of which I am a part and which I have some advice for the government: flawed to introduce bills such as this. It is thing and doing something completely different. immediate attention before it is put to a vote. Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, has outlined be adopted before the passage of This bill must undergo a full regulatory government's very own Office of Best Practice report: According to the government's own Office of Best adequate information before it to assess the impact the cost-benefit of the proposed changes. This is a pattern that has formed with this changes that it is making and it is ultimately pays. When quizzed at a Senate estimates to ensure that they are providing the very best today relates to the opt-in provision. We are flawed and not based on any logical or report it was noted that there was only one Industry Super Network, arguing in favour of the refused to accept that recommendation, yet the it would defy those findings and set a worldlike to directly read into my speech today a provider in my electorate, who specifically him. He says: 'A particular concern to us is the have on our business. In April 2011 our business to the ongoing contribution of the GFC to our are now faced with an annual cost to administer per client per annum. This could potentially be per annum.' This drives up the cost of advice and our community to access professional advice years in retirement. Noting the increased cost, us and it is something that we think the think, like so many of the government's pieces made by this government, they have a legislate on. This is no different. compliance costs, with evidence given by the will cost up to $700 million to implement in the each additional year. This is, indeed, a massive Prime Minister's calls that she will be addressing formation of the so-called deregulation forum, announced by Tony Abbott in December last is led by Senator Arthur Sinodinos AO. if you want to reduce red tape then it is very yet another example of the government saying one This seriously flawed legislation needs The coalition, led by so capably by the shadow many vital recommendations that need to this bill should be contemplated. impact statement that complies with the Regulation. According to the dissenting Practice Regulation, the government did not have of this bill on business and consumers or to assess government. It does not assess the impact of the the consumer, the everyday Australian, who committee, the executive director of the OBPR, Jason MCNamara, admitted that the government statement in front of it when it made the changes. We know that the minister, Bill Shorten, was trying to force the industry to meet was admit this failure and push it back. As we have commencement should be at the same time introduction of the bill simply did not allow again, adding to administrative costs. The opt-in provisions must be removed. whereby an opt-in process is implemented. Forcing is not only cumbersome to the customer but financial providers. There is no doubt that opt-in mechanisms far outweighs any supposed explained why, if this is such a brilliant contemplating introducing it. We are also incredibly of this bill. As it stands, the annual fee disclosure again adding huge administrative costs outcomes. As a principle, we on this side believe met to be able to apply legislation retrospectively. rule of thumb, this should not occur for fairly common occurrence with this government-that implement its program.

328,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," It is a pleasure contribution about the flaws in the Corporations Bill 2011 facing the chamber today. Fifteen through the problems that the sector will forward today. It does, however, follow the for Higgins pointed out, of not consulting and regulate. The government is not listening to concerns and not providing a reasonable framework the proposals of government. This is a dangerous this in this place before. Sector after sector government speak to us about the Here, with these Future of Financial Advice saying that they are not satisfied in any way completely unreasonable, that the implementation have serious detrimental effects on the operation government. Whenever this government has the did not have an adequate regulatory impact has admitted that the commencement date that he completely and utterly flawed and he has had to argued consistently throughout, we believe the as the My Super changes, and that the rushed industry sufficient time to adjust to the changesThere is no other marketplace in the world customers to consistently re-sign contracts adds huge levels of administrative cost to the increased regulatory and financial burden of benefit it may provide. It simply cannot be measure, we are the only country that is concerned about the retrospective nature statements would be applied retrospectively, with very questionable consumer benefits as that an incredibly high threshold needs to be We think, as a matter of principle, or as a obvious and good reasons. Yet this is a very it seeks to impose retrospective legislation to but let me simply conclude in the time remaining consumers have appropriate financial advice they have appropriate transparency. We do not significant changes. We think it is inherently responsible for bringing forward a very flawed to follow the member for Higgins's fine Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) minutes is certainly not enough time to go face with the proposals the government has put precedent set by this government, as the member embracing the sector which they are seeking to their suggestions, not taking account of their for the sector to be able to have input to way to do legislation. I have spoken about in the economy today is asking, 'Why won't the legislation that they're proposing?' bills we see before us, again the sector are with the legislation, that the time frames are of it will be unworkable and that it will of their sector-par for the course, under this choice between overregulating or letting off more lightly, it overregulates. If the choice 'Let's be more complex.' The complexity of substantial. When smart financial advisers and the proposals mean, how they will operate and very seriously. In my electorate of Mitchell, in the Norwest service based businesses, mostly small and clients. These are the businesses coming proposals will not only threaten the viability business, but also favour the big players. It is another narrative that is building-favouring businesses and crunching the ability of a business business. It is very much what will happen large part, unclear. My colleagues have commented on many of point to something that I have spoken about financial literacy. Financial advisers have enhancing financial literacy in Australia proposals that undermine the concept of making responsible for their own finances from a younger following through to superannuation. This bill, fairly operate, will lead to lower rates of people will be underinsured; there will be that a government should be seeking to These broad themes are very important feedback we are getting from the sector. That in my electorate. We ought to be taking measures and that should be a focus of this parliament, with unnecessarily complex proposals and out of the 2009 Ripoll inquiry and report which which Storm and Westpoint are examples. We were made. What I think is a fine dissenting coalition members. Indeed, Senator Sue Boyce, and Mr Tony Smith are to be congratulated dissemination of the flaws in the two It is not just a matter of the costs referred implementation costs, the $350 million increases are of course very substantial. It is government has in these bills, including opt-in unworkable. An opt-in requirement is something market in the world today. With the mining tax we have seen an experimental said, 'This is a radical experiment, a departure again we have the government experimenting is between more complex or less complex, it says, this particular set of proposals before us is operators tell us they cannot understand what whether they will be effective or not, I take it Business Park, I have hundreds of financial medium businesses advising small numbers of to see me with great concern about how these of their business, potentially putting them out of is another theme we see under this government. It big players in every sector, crunching small to go from a small to a medium to a large under this legislation, which is complex and, in the flaws in the proposals, but I would like to in this place before and that is the concept of a key role in this domain of increasing and today. We see from this government continued a person more financially literate and more age right through their lives to an older age which will remove the ability of an adviser to financial literacy. People will seek less advice; greater rates of underinsurance. The very things enhance and expand, this bill undermines. for the parliament to understand. That is the is the feedback I am getting from the businesses to enhance financial literacy and education not overregulating and overburdening the sector regulations. We know that these proposals come followed a series of financial collapses, of know that in 2009 a series of recommendations report was put together by the committee's  on what represents a very substantial bills that are before the chamber today. to in their report-the $700 million of per annum compliance costs-although these the basic nuts and bolts of the proposals that the requirements, that I think are completely that has not been tried in any other major form of taxation that most tax experts from all normal forms of taxation'. Now once with a radical model of opt in for the financial services sector that nobody is calling for potential to lead to some very undesirable and who think they are covered by advice, after under an opt-in requirement if they do not down such a radical and experimental path when to be doing such a thing. When you look at more than the nuts and bolts The member for Higgins spoke eloquently about essence all businesses in this space to go back already done and advice they have already issued. about the principle of retrospectivity in law where sectors, and I think that we should not be retrospective action without a very good reason. missing from what the government is doing to have heard throughout this debate, in which thousands of job losses from this legislation, we not listening to the very sector that we being punitive and heavy-handed? Why, in government's approach, are we using the I have received a lot of correspondence sector services around the country and from various Financial Advisers. Their comment is very interesting record: Our view is that FoFA, as it is currently drafted, access to advice. Minister Shorten has stated on for the financial advice industry and also that there financial service industry has many concerns with has been recognised and addressed That is from the Association of Financial Advisers, public that he has broad industry support for listening just to the small and medium enterprises there are real, justifiable and graphic concerns outlining. They are concerns that should constant Orwellian doublespeak from ministers businesses will be better off and we have the not. Another aspect of the FoFA legislation inquiry, but which somehow has got in, is those have mentioned. I have a big concern with the association and the industry expects, the they would not introduce retrospective commitment, a promise, and we have heard much why the opposition is so vehemently opposed cannot provide business certainty when you something and then you go ahead and do it anyway, would do and regardless of what the sector wants. and nobody is recommending. Indeed, it has the outcomes when customers who have not responded the 30-day period will no longer be covered respond. So I do not see why we would proceed there is no call from any major sector for us you will see other problems with these bills. the retrospectivity aspect, requiring in and seek permission for things that they have This is a bizarre notion. I have spoken here it is not to the benefit of people or industry requiring this sector or these customers to take Once again that principle appears to be justify this legislation. It goes back to what we the industry sector has said that there will be that compliance costs will be immense. Why are are seeking to make regulations about? Why are we relation to government legislation and the stick all the time and not the carrot? from businesses in my electorate, from financial associations, including the Association of to note, and I want to read it into the delivers neither improved transparency or increased a number of occasions that FoFA is a growth strategy is broad industry support for FoFA. In fact, the the current draft of this legislation, much of which in the coalition's dissenting report. so is why Minister Shorten telling the this legislation when clearly he does not? Even in the sector in my electorate, it is obvious with the proposals that the government is be addressed by the government and not by the that, 'Oh well, everything is going to be great, support of the sector'-which clearly they do before us that was not recommended by the Ripoll retrospective fee disclosure statements that I this because, when we were speaking about what government said specifically to the sector that disclosure statement requirements. It was a made of this in recent years. Again, this is to this legislation as currently drafted. You tell the sector that you are not going to do regardless of what you have said that you In relation to retrospective fee disclosure intention: they said they would not do it. It have retrospective fee disclosure requirements. you do not have that certainty that you need think, onerous and complex legislative burdens costs but also undermine the relationship between financial services space. We have heard from many coalition speakers that is built largely on trust between the overregulation here is seeking to undermine businesses. Why? We hear that there will be concept of trust from these relationships, financial advice-when they have to continually constantly be advised. No-one is suggesting here that there should should not be quality and valuable regulation. we are saying is that this legislation, in the way is unreasonable to say that when you see Regulation said that this was not adequate That is the most damning feature of all. The was concerned about the ability of this legislation and rigorously assess increasing costs and red the government did not have adequate information to be of concern for the government. They delayed the implementation of this legislation built into this legislation that the industry not matter when the parliament passes this meet the 1 July 2012 deadline. The government and consider the opposition's amendments very realistically, to improve the quality of sector for our economy. We know that the 1 July 2012 time frame issue that is related-that is the changes proposed It would make sense, you would think, when sector like this, to implement such massive changes at once, to limit the amount of expenditure symptomatic of this government's chaotic approach sectors of the economy that they are seeking these very substantial implementation changes It is completely sensible that the coalition legislation to be put forward to 1 July 2013, Listening to the sector, that is only reasonable deadlines imposed by this legislation, so it tend to get from this government, as we have requirements, the government gave their crept into this legislation, and before us today we If you are operating a business in this sector, to operate your business. You are facing now, I that will not only add to your compliance client and adviser which is so critical in this about that relationship. This is an enterprise financial adviser and client. The government's that essential component of the success of these thousands of job losses. When you remove the it is difficult to see why someone would take opt into a service, when they have to not be regulation in this space or that there In fact the industry itself accepts it. But what it is drafted, is not adequate. I do not think it that the government's Office of Best Practice and not up to its own standards of compliance. Office of Best Practice Regulation said that it to meet the government's own standards tape for both business and customers and that before it when it drafted FoFA. That ought ought to pause there and say: 'We have already to date. We now have unrealistic time frames say cannot be met.' John Brogden said that it does legislation; they cannot under any circumstance ought to pause and re-examine this legislation which Senator Cormann has put forward, I think this legislation and limit the damage to this vital is completely unrealistic, and there is another here by the FoFA legislation and MySuper. you are talking about businesses in a serious technological changes and complex regulatory that businesses would have to make. It is to legislation and to handling different to ensure these dates are not together and that are not going to be done concurrently. is calling for the implementation date of this and we are seeking those amendments genuinely. and rational. The industry cannot meet the ought to be amended and redrafted. But what you seen time and time again with its legislative approach, is that it does not matter if a piece or if it does something bad to the sector, it we'll come back months or years later to try later.' This is the stage at which the government or medium sized financial business in the country unworkable, complex, chaotic and unnecessary. business and limit their ability to provide financial government were serious it would look at know that the Minister for Employment and improving transparency and the quality of financial he is the minister for unions and is acting in medium sized enterprises around this country. they will suffer increased costs and job",218

But, sadly, this is flawed legislation, arising from a hijacked by vested interests after more than and upheaval for our financial services industry. requires that there be transparency, choice and absolutely none of those three. We need to between appropriate levels of consumer I would like to quickly go through a few areas fail. Firstly, they are unnecessarily complex expected to cause an actual increase in unemployment. unlevel playing field amongst advice providers, friendly business model against the interests Fourthly, the reforms in this legislation are a further $350 million per annum to comply estimates. I come to a few specifics about the impact participants have expressed serious concerns will have in its current form. The committee from the Financial Services Council that the opinion or recommendation can ever be economist Mr Alan Greenspan, who served as Board from 1987 to 2006. He was a man who had a track record of demonstrating that qualified to provide financial advice. But, that he had been partially wrong. He said: or permanent it is, but I have been very distressed and his opinion of the economy and economic I had been going for 40 years or more with very was working exceptionally well. economists and financial advisers give just best interests of their clients. The coalition play in helping Australians to better manage the opportunities. In providing this service, financial money. That is the reason why we must have an to ensure effective consumer protection and made available at a low cost and that they are the GFC in reasonably good shape. But, like In pursuing any regulatory change, we must complex and not just creating more red tape and We must avoid any regulatory overreach where business and consumers with no additional like so much we have seen from this government, flawed process. The reform package was simply two years of unnecessary regulatory uncertainty Confidence in our financial services industry competition. Unfortunately, these bills provide also make sure we are striking the right balance protection-but again these bills fail. where the coalition believes that these bills and in large parts unclear. Secondly, they are Thirdly, they legislate to enshrine an inappropriately favouring a government of small business in the financial planning area. likely to cost about $700 million to implement and with, and they are conservative industry of these bills on financial advice. Industry about the detrimental effect that this legislation that investigated these bills received evidence government's proposed changes would cost the industry $700 million to implement upfront and comments from Mr Richard Klipin, the chief executive Advisers, are worth reading. He suggests legislation could exceed 30,000. He states: In conclusion, FoFA, as it stands, will decimate the are at risk and over 30,000 jobs in total. This excludes they serve and the clients they service. A piece unacceptable. He is exactly right. He continued: FoFA as it stands will also increase He goes on to say: This committee has already had evidence that FoFA with-and this is just for the product providers provision of financial advice to clients in the bush the wealthy, and working families and lowerto middle-income be priced out of the marketplace. That comment alone shows why this legislation further offer some comments about financial concern that these reforms would actually increase and lessen competition. A representative of AMP stated: … I think there is likely to be a migration of advisers we think there is some competitive advantage in like my own, we do not believe it is in the broader should be what we think is likely, which Further, Mr Grahame Evans, the Group Services, stated: Australia did not get to be the No. 1 financial services because we were anticompetitive. I think this is that, in our rush to protect the consumer, there is the consumer appropriate protection and not marketplace. We have seen the dangers of increasing market and we have learnt from the mistakes. We have we have seen the problems in the trucking concentration. Unfortunately, that is what market concentration in the provision of financial planning services that are too big to fail. Australia simply did not get to be the respected by everybody else because we were aspect. We have to make sure that, in our rush between the objectives of being able to give and not reducing the competition that is out increasing market concentration. That is simply form should be opposed. $350 million every year thereafter. I think the officer of the Association of Financial that the total job losses resulting from this financial advice profession. Over 6,800 adviser jobs the businesses they support in the communities of legislation that inflicts this amount of damage is the cost of advice to consumers. will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to comply at the big end of town. It will also decimate the and the regions. Advice will … become a service for Australians who really need advice will should at least be put on the backburner. I advisers from AMP, who have expressed the concentration of players in the market to large players like AMP. So, despite the fact that the advice industry for this legislation to companies interests of the financial advice industry that there would be a consolidation of advisers. General Manager of Professional Investment hub in the world and respected by everybody else an important aspect of FoFA. We have to make sure a balance between the objectives of being able to give reducing the competition that is out there in the concentration in many sectors of our economy seen the problems our supermarket sector and industry all relating to increasing market we see these bills doing. We see an increasing advice whereby we risk creating financial No. 1 financial services hub in the world and anticompetitive. I think this is an important to protect the consumer, we create a balance the consumer an appropriate level of protection there in the marketplace, so not resulting in another reason why these bills in their current Another reason why these bills should be frame. As it stands, this legislation will actually more than three months away. The current implementation months is completely unrealistic, creating great need to change processes, they will need advisers-all before business has even seen the a period of time. A few interesting comments concern the problem this legislation in and enforce this on our financial create havoc. There will be mistakes made. It the $700 million estimate of implementation. coalition has recommended, is this: even if the form is the right way to go, its implementation changes are synchronised with the start of MySuper. for the industry to work through these changes, implemented on the lowest cost basis. Another great problem with this legislation will add unnecessary additional costs and yearly opt-in provisions will make it questionable consumer benefit. There is simply no precedent red tape anywhere else in the world, yet this received during the inquiry expressed concerns flow to consumers who do not opt in within they may have intended to continue with their have assumed that the relationship was ongoing. clients are automatically deemed to have ended submission, the Financial Planning Association Unfortunately, the legislation in its current form advice clients where 'the disclosure obligation' financial planner/licensee. This is because, by virtue of the default, 'advice client' if the planner does not receive day period. This may be completely contrary relationship and could have significant ramifications seek compensation from their planner for not movements that may affect their financial position. This also affects many of the small business value of their business. They may have built relationship, but if this automatic opt-out provision sent out, it diminishes the value of their business, away from being their clients if that I'm sure that we all know the number of forms day. If this legislation goes through, by simply often a consumer would put aside and think opposed is the unrealistic implementation time become effective on 1 July this year, a little time of a little more than three uncertainty for the industry. Businesses will to change software and they will need to train regulations. Three months is simply too short that it will all create. If we try and bring services industry in three months, we will will all cost the industry likely even more than What we should be actually doing, as the government thinks this legislation in its current should be postponed to 1 July 2013 so the In this way, it will make it much easier to accept them and to make sure they are is the opt-in provisions. These opt-in provisions create red tape. The government's proposed twowhether they actually provide any for these opt-in provisions and this increase in is what this government is trying to do. Evidence about the negative consequences which may the required 30-day period. That is even though financial advice relationship and may even Even where the lack of opt-in is inadvertent, their financial advice relationship. In its expressed its concerns as follows: does not provide adequate protection to financial or 'renewal notice obligation' is not satisfied by the the client will no longer be considered to be an the client's opt-in renewal notice within the 30to what the client understands may be the at a later date when the client attempts to advising them of changes to the law or market financial planners out there.

This opposed. Another problem is with the retrospective part of the government's proposed changes until throw-in that was done without any consultation the ramifications or the unintended consequences Executive Officer of the AFA, told Fee disclosure statements were never part of They jumped in at the last minute and are retrospective. endless amounts of time and money and will be one the higher value clients at the expense This is why this bill is deeply flawed. Financial To throw in such late changes at the last industry, without consideration for their consequences, up with such a flawed bill. There are many other problems with recommendations.

346,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," The objectives Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Advice Measures) Bill 2011 are sound. They while building trust and confidence in the standards which align the interests of the adviser of interest. The bills aim to facilitate access simple or limited advice. They also aim to create interests of clients and a ban on conflicted principles. Our concern is that the government, in objectives, has gone too far. As it currently stands, and reduced choice for Australians seeking number of amendments, and it is these amendments Our amendments seek to get the balance providing appropriate levels of consumer protection available, accessible and affordable. This provided by financial advisers helping people The reforms we are debating today have inquiry into financial products and services reform recommendations.

That is all I have to say, but I plead of this bill a further 12 months and to take of the Corporations Amendment (Future of Amendment (Further Future of Financial aim to improve the quality of financial advice financial planning industry through enhanced with those of the client and reduce conflicts to financial advice through the provision of a requirement for advisers to act in the best remuneration. Many of those are very sound putting forward a package to try to meet these the legislation will lead to increased costs financial advice. So we have put forward a which we would like to discuss today. right, with a sensible regulatory framework while ensuring financial advice remains is because we recognise the important service to improve their financial health and well-being. their origins in the 2009 Ripoll inquiry. This made a number of well-considered and reasonable was to require financial advisers to put their sensible point. Had the government proceeded in of the Ripoll inquiry, I think the Some of the recommendations of the Ripoll advice tax deductable for consumers; getting a professional standards board that advisers powers to ASIC; and having the government All the industry bodies supported the committee's and, as I said, had the government limited its in the Ripoll inquiry then this legislation would not do that and that is why we are here today we believe will improve the legislation. These include amendments for: the government statement; the opt-into be removed from FoFA; annual fee disclosure requirement to be removed; improved; the ban of commissions on risk insurance implementation of FoFA to be deferred a year do not want to go through every single one of the more important ones. The first is the undertake a regulatory impact statement. We financial cost imposed on the industry by the for job losses. As an absolute minimum, there on this, which would comply with the government's in other areas. The parliament should insist dealing with any of these bills. Based on the committee members concluded that this legislation choice for Australians seeking financial government must rigorously assess increasing consumers. The second issue is the opt-in provisions, our amendments would implement that. The coalition to force people to re-sign contracts with their opt-in process. This would add an unnecessary additional cost for both small business and consumers, would create additional red tape. Financial amount of time chasing up contract renewals. increased costs for the average financial advisory opt-in provisions go ahead. It will be small move will add to the Australia-wide problem people may well miss out on advice The third area is the proposed ban of commissions ban. Our view is borne out by the experience have since reversed the move. Like opt-in, make the problem of underinsurance in Australia become much more expensive upfront. I have constituents from the industry in relation to Garry, puts it well when he says: When I provide advice to my clients or would be received. If they proceed with the insurance recommended, then we receive a commission.

In pursuing regulatory changes, the costs and red tape for both business and which we believe should be removed, and one of does not support the government's push financial adviser every year through a so called regulatory burden, imposing too much for questionable additional benefit. It advisers would have to spend an inordinate According to Treasury, there would be firm of about $100,000 every year if the businesses and individuals who pay the cost.

355,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I rise congratulate him on an excellent speech where why if the passage of this future of financial deserve to see the government cooperate and not, we will be forced to oppose it because supported. Before I detail the reasons why the would like to go back a step, and start by Assistant Treasurer, for the excellent job he bill needs serious amending. Senator Cormann Wannon-it was about six months ago now-to financial services sector, in the electorate of of what their concerns were. It was very interesting forum. It was very well attended because in towns, and there are lots of financial services especially to surrounding agricultural producers cetera. So, at a very well attended forum on objectively about the Ripoll inquiry and what Ripoll inquiry and the making of Senator Cormann pointed out very clearly was regulatory change where the parliament more complex and more costly for everyone. well received within the forum. Senator Cormann question that was asked by one of our financial you think that this bill that is going to come will favour the big super funds rather than all advice?' That was the first question which is necessary and substantial additional work It needs to be recognised that this additional be borne by customers, who will pay more initial impact will be on financial planners, and forecasts a halving of planner numbers in the job losses in the industry of up to that 25,000 see how this would improve advice access. to this bill and call on Minister Shorten and at least entertain some of the coalition's help keep people across this country in a job. Just One job loss creates pressure on a family, bills activities get cut, holidays become nonwith the heavy strain placed upon them. When tax, the carbon tax and the private health rebate, thought process is. They are an alliance those that strive to better themselves and that the Prime Minister once described as not to support the member for Hasluck and to he detailed, I believe beyond doubt, the reason advice legislation is to go ahead we definitely put through the coalition amendments. If they do the bills as they stand at the moment cannot be bill in its current form cannot be supported I thanking Senator Matthias Cormann, our shadow has done in prosecuting the case as to why this very kindly came down to the electorate of talk to small businesses, to talk to the Wannon, to go through this bill and to get an idea and informing. We had 60 people at the Wannon we have a lot of small regional and rural businesses which give financial advice, or people who work in local manufacturing et this subject matter, Senator Cormann spoke very we were intending to occur as a result of the some regulatory change in this area. that what we in the coalition were looking for would focus on making things better, not just This was a message which was overwhelmingly then asked for questions, and the very first services providers was: 'Senator Cormann, do before the House, given who is taking it there, the small business providers of financial service came from the audience; that is what they were worried about. They understood who the relevant forward. They understood that he is very much union movement and that, as a matter of fact, likely to prosecute on behalf of them, he understands also understands that as he wants to step factional support to deliver the numbers for him. That was the question which came from the connection to the big trade unions and to their what this bill looks like? Senator Cormann said the case. The fact that we are standing here presented in its original form shows that that pity that the minister could not have been more it set very clear guidelines as to how this bipartisan support for this legislation in this legislation together in a form whereby it just what the regulatory burden should look like such a way that we reduce costs, simplify it in a way which actually helps the industry to flourish and the rest of it to decline.' So that is where we are today, and this is about this bill in its current form. Firstly, unclear. Secondly, it is expected to cause unemployment will occur in those smaller businesses industry funds tied to the trade union movement; especially out in the regional and rural areas are going to suffer and that is where Thirdly, it is legislating to enshrine an inappropriately favouring a government-friendly second point. This bill will mean that those changes the playing field and it does so in a I have already mentioned. Fourthly, it is likely further $350 million per annum to comply with, That is the regulatory burden that this bill in is a very important fact to remember-and I look at how the government went about examining would have on the sector, it did not follow Senate estimates has been very enlightening As I mentioned earlier, on our side we think have to focus on making things better, not that is what this bill does. What we need to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial and make a number of well-considered and government not sensibly adopt those recommendations gone beyond that? Why has it sought to favour minister was who was putting this bill beholden to and at the behest of the trade he is a former big union boss, so not only is he their requirements and their needs. He further in this place he is going to need their floor: do you think that it is going to be that industry funds that will in the end determine that he hoped not but he feared that would be tonight debating this bill and the way it has been question was, sadly, absolutely spot-on. It is a objective, because the Ripoll inquiry was, and legislation could look and how we could get place. Yet this government could not put the said: 'Okay, we have agreement across parties on when we make the changes here. We can do it in and change the nature of the regulation but do so rather than to help one part of it flourish why the coalition really wants to make four points it is unnecessarily complex and, in large parts, increased unemployment. Sadly, that increased in this sector. It will not be the big it will be the mum and dad businesses, and the suburbs. They are the ones which, sadly, the unemployment is most likely to occur. unlevel playing field amongst advice providers business model. That really draws on the mum and dad family businesses will suffer. It way favourable to those bigger organisations that to cost about $700 million to implement and a according to conservative industry estimates. its current form will place on this industry. That am going to come back to this point. When you the regulatory burden that this legislation due process. I will come back to that because when it comes to that point. that when you pursue regulatory change you more complex and more costly for everyone. Yet hear from the government is: why, when we had Services conduct a comprehensive inquiry reasonable reform recommendations, did the and take them forward? Why has it one part of the industry over another? That is the one question I would like to leave with explanation on. I think it is beholden on the why he is serving the interests of a narrow legislation which would provide the whole There are a few points that we need to touch the government's own standards. This is a very Hansard part of the transcript from Senate estimates comes to this point. Jason MCNamara is before Senate estimates, he had this to say:",257

I will again repeat what the regulatory million to implement and a further $350 million conservative industry estimates.

366,Ms LEY,BILLS," I reiterate that Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill believe that the financial services industry typical of those opposite, they have proposed legislation is particularly complex. It demonstrates defining the Gillard government, a government they fail to recognise the damage they cause place stand up and talk about the deadweight a member who has been in this place for 10 years that burden never seems to reduce, but I am delighted deadly serious about reducing red tape, and bills.

Yet looking government has failed to do. be further refined; and the implementation of will improve this piece of legislation beyond particular, the regulatory burden-that $700 million per annum compliance cost.

As we know, the It is the basis on which this legislation that is why on this side we are saying that we do in particular to all those mum and dad family the rural areas, who will be severely impacted by the coalition do not support the Corporations 2011 and cognate bill in their current form. We requires a robust framework. However, as is a framework overburdened with red tape. This the regulatory overreach that is now so obsessed with regulation and red tape that to business. Time and again, members in this loss of compliance, of regulation, of red tape. As I find it extremely frustrating that over time that right here right now the coalition is that is one of the problems we have with these my portfolio responsibilities, I have grave will result from the legislation. Under this lose their jobs since the beginning of this will further lengthen the unemployment line.

The third recommendation is: That the Opt-in arrangements contained in the Bill 2011 be removed from the Bill. As I said, the Ripoll inquiry made no recommendation disclosure statement over and above the current service product providers to their clients evidence that, based on the various consultation understanding that the government's proposal statement would be prospective-that is, it would The committee received evidence that, after process, the introduction of a retrospective that came completely out of left field when it really need to remove those opt-in arrangements. anti small business, and for that reason we will that the government be required by parliament FoFA, assessed as compliant by the government's to speak on a bill about equal opportunity this legislation and it is a pile of bureaucratic reporting requirements. The point is I do not understand why such a trivial bill-I in the House people will see why-has a regulatory not. We will also propose that the opt-in by the Ripoll inquiry.
