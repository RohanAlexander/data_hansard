1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon noticet. Is clause No. 111,'C M . Reg., which provides that the Governor General may promote an officer for distinguished service, or for marked ability and gallantry in active service, without his passing the prescribed examinations, still* in force ? 2. Has any officer been promoted under , this clause ? . 3. Has any officer applied for promotion under clause No. in and not received it? 4. . If promotion has been refused under clause No. in , what reasons are there for departing from the regulations?",14
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answers to the h o n orable member's questions are. as f o l l o w 1. Yes, it is a reprint of Section 22 of the Defence Act. 2. Yes. 3Yes. 4. It appears that in three cases advantage has been taken of the regulation referred to. They were officers whose promotion was approved by the Governor General on the recommendation of General Hutton, when General Officer Commanding. The difficulty I findin dealing with the matter is that the distinguished services in most cases occurred some years ago, and. it was presumed at the time that due recognition was given by the Imperial authorities. In 1902 the Government of trie day decided that the status and rank gained by officers on active service should only be regarded as honorary rank, so that to obtain substantive rank officers would have, to pass the prescribed examinations as required by the Defence Act. It might justifiably have been urged that officers should have been permitted to retain the rank obtained on active service without being required to pass a further examination. This, however, was not done, nnd' it is especially difficult to make any alteration now, as the procedure adopted in 1902 has been followed since.' Many officers have submitted themselves to examination, and obtained the promotion in the ordinary way, i.e., by examination, while others have not. The matter will be further inquired into.",14
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Some have been permitted to retain their honorary rank, while others have not.",14
4,Mr EWING,Unknown,"There have been three special cases. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that some recognition of service should be made, but what was done happened some years ago, and I find it very difficult to arrive at a reasonable solution of the difficulty. RE-IMPORTATION OF WHEAT.",14
5,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"for Mr. MCDOUGALL) asked the Minister of Trade South Ausand Customs, upon notice I. Whether'it is true, as stated in-the Age of 2nd November, that the Minister has decided to allow exporters to re-import, free of duty, Australian wheat at present afloat for foreign ports and loaded in ships still in Australian waters? 2. Has the Minister an accurate record of the quantity of Australian wheat at present afloat and loaded in ships still in Australian waters? 3. If the statement made by the Age of the date named is true, will the Minister give the .House an absolute guarantee that no foreign wheat, or Australian wheat landed in foreign ports, will be admitted duty free into the Commonwealth ?",14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. Yes. 2. An endeavour will be made to obtain this information if it is required. 3. No foreign wheat, or Australian wheat which has been landed in foreign ports, will be admitted without payment of duty, and every precaution will be taken to insure that this is observed - general importations, and of 40 per cent, BACCHUS MARSH POST OFFICE .",14
7,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"for Mr CROUCH) asked the* Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What staff is there at the Bacchus Marsh Post Office, and what is their average time daily on duty ? 2. Has not the business there increased greatly during recent years? 3. Can he increase the staff to avoid overwork and lo increase public convenience?",15
8,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Jnquirie s are being made, and the desired information will be furnished as early as possible. In Committee of Ways and Means (Consideration resumed from 5th November, vide page 5558): Division V - Textiles , Felts and Furs, and Manufactures thereof and Attire. Item 106. Apparel and Attire-woolle n or silk or containing wool or silk-partl y or wholly made up; including articles cut into shape, ad val. (General '.Tariff), 45 per cent., (United Kingdom), 40 per cent.",15
9,Mr WILS ON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [2.35] I desire to make the Tariff on these goods which are the manufacture of the United Kingdom, 27^ per cent., and on all other importations 30 per cent.; but as I wish to save time, I move, without discussing the question That after the words ""45 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 7th November, 1907 (General Tariff) 30 per cent."" be inserted.",15
10,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [2.36] would point out that,- although of articles of apparel and attire such as come within the scope of item 106, is industry which employs a large number of persons, only two witnesses connected with it came before the Tariff Commission, neither in a representative capacity. They were both Victorian manufacturers, one being a maker of mantles and costumes, and the other a maker of ready-made suits for boys and men, and they use materials supplied by the wholesale houses. The fact that there is a large number of manufacturers in this industry, and that only two of them came before the Comthat there was really a large expansion of mission to complain of the old Tariff, cannot be disregarded by the Committee. The Treasurer ought to give us an explanation of the Government proposals. The highchange, est rate of duty that was asked for by any one was only 40 per cent, upon importations generally, but the Treasurer proposes to put a duty of 45 per cent, on on importations from the United Kingdom. It was alleged that the importations of the class of goods which come within the scope of the item have been increasing, but statistics do not bear out that statement. As ;t matter ot fact, comparing 1906 with 1901, there has been a considerable reduction in the oversea importations, and a large increase in the number - of hands employed in the industry. In Victoria, in 1900, the number of hands employed was 5,601;. in 1901, 5,456; in T 9 ° 2 , 5.59<5; in 1903, 5,490; in 1904, 5,845; and in 1905-the last year for which figures are available-6,11.3 . These TARIFF. figures do not show that the industry is waning, but rather that it is growing. One of the reasons why some of the Victorian manufacturers have felt dissatisfied is that the inter-State transfers have increased. In 1890, - New South Wales sent to the other States only ^2,607 worth of apparel, while in. 1904-the last year for which vstatistics were available' to the Tariff Commission-sh e sent ^83,684 worth, part of which came to Victoria. Of course, at the same time, Victoria has been increasing her transfers to the other States. In 1899,. .those transfers were worth ^119,875, and in 1904 they had increased to .£382,000 worth. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to furnish us with the latest statistics with regard to inter-State transfers.",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Why does the I honourable member want them ? They are the making a matter for the Budget.,15
12,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If it can be shown an that the transfers from Victoria to the other States have increased, the .reasonable deduction will be that the Victorian industry, instead of waning, is flourishing and prosperous. At first sight it would appear fhat there was a decrease in the number of hands employed in the industry in 1901 as compared with 1900, but the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria shows that in 1901 the underclothing trade was separated from the clothing trade in the official returns, so ' the industry. It is' to be regretted that a mistake, which was made ih respect of this in connection with the examination of one of the witnesses before the Tariff Commission should have been quoted by the Chairman in support of the assertion that the industry in Victoria is waning. I would further point out that the high duties - which prevailed under the Victorian Tariff did not result in additional employment. In 1891, 1892, and 1893, when high duties prevailed in Victoria, the number of hands employed was less than the number engaged in the'industry under the comparatively low duties of the first Federal Tariff. In 1890, when there was a duty of 44 per cent, in operation, 1,417 males and 4,700 females, or a total of 6,117 operatives were employed in the clothing trade in Victoria. In 1891, with the same rate of duty prevailing, there were only 1,150 males and 3,209 females, or a total' of 4.359 employed. In 1892, with a duty of 55 per cent, in operation, there were 987 males and 3,581 females, or a total of 4,568 operatives, so that under the higher duty there was a very serious decrease in the number of male operatives employed in the industry. other words, it would appear that the - higher the duty the smaller the number of males employed. In 1893, with a duty of 55 per cent, still in operation in Victoria, there were 716 males and 3,523 females, or a total of 4,239 operatives.",15
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,What was the total increase in both cases?,16
14,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In 1890, with a duty of 44 per cent., 6,117 operatives were employed, and in 189T, under the same rate of duty, there were 4,359 employees in the industry. In 1892, with a duty cent., there were 4,568, while in 1893, under the same duty, there were 4,239.",16
15,Mr WISE,Unknown,That was the year of the bank smashes - ,16
16,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In 1898, with a duty of 38 per cent, there were 1,292 males and L 5,246 females, or a total of 6,538; in 1899, under the same duty, 1,288 males and 4.642 females, or a total of 5,930. under the Federal duty of 27^ per cent., the number of males increased to 1,724, whilst 5,241 females were employed, or a total of 6,965. Last year there were 1,827 males and 5,840 females, or a total of 7,667, the highest number of operatives employed during the years I have mentioned.",16
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Then the able member suggests that if we placed thisitem on the free list more employment would be given?,16
18,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I make, no such sugthat gestion. I am pointing out that under the rate comparatively lower duties of the old Federal Tariff there were more male operatives than were employed under the higher duties of the Victorian Tariff.",16
19,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The years 1891, 1892, and 1893 were the very worse years for business that Victoria has experienced. They were the years of the bank smashes.",16
20,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"But what about the""returns for 1890? In 1892 and 1893 there was a duty of 55 per cent, in operation, and prior to 1892 there was a duty of 44 per cent. I admit that the collapse of the boom was largely responsible for the falling off of employment in these industries, but it led to the development of the dairying industry, which has to a very large extent brought back that prosperity which we hope Victoria will long enjoy.",16
21,Mr REID,Unknown,"The ' boom began to break in 1892, but did not collapse until 1893.",16
22,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The figures I have In quoted relate to employment in the clothing industry. I now propose to give statistics as to the number of hands employed in other industries to which this item relates. In the corset-making trade in Victoria, in 1900, 42 females were employed, whilst in 1906 there were 34 females employed. In the making of dresses, mantles, millinery, and ladies' underclothing, there were 88 males and 6,668 females employed in 1900, whilst in 1906 there were 132 males and 10,725 females employed. In the hosiery trade there were 35 males and 15 females employed in 1900, whilst of 55 per in 1906, there were 29 males and 393 females in the industry. In the shirt-making industry in 1900, there were 60 males and 883 females as against 70 males and 1.255 females in j906 : .whilst in the making of ties and cravats there were 5 males and 116 females employed in 1900, as against 1.1 males and 228 females in 1906. The total number In 1903, of operatives engaged in 1900 in the several industries to which this item relates was I 3J5 3 I as against 19,129 in 1906, or arc increase of 5,61.6. In these circumstances, surely no one can say that the industry in Victoria-fro m which complaints have chiefly come-require s further protection than it enjoyed under the first Federal Tariff. On the contrary, the figures I have quoted show that the Committee would be honor- justified in reducing the duties.  tend to support the amendment. I notice the collections under the 25 per cent, last year amounted to £ 3 6 2 , 0 0 0 , and I would remind the Committee that we have in this case another illustration of the hypocrisy of the preferential trade proposals of the Government. Out of a total importation of £ i , 4 5 ° » 0 0 0 in goods coming within this item a little over 080,000 worth come direct from the United Kingdom, and the Ministry show their love for the Mother Country, by increasing the duty on imports from the United Kingdom by 15 per cent.",16
23,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"But there is a prefer-ence of 5 per cent, in favour of imports from Great Britain.  have added four bricks to the Tariff wall and have removed one so far as imports from the United Kingdom are concerned. That is a preference which the people of Great Britain do not greatly appreciate. This duty must necessarily penalize thousands and thousands of consumers for some years, until the local output will be equal to the demand.",17
24,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We have enough factories to produce at a reasonable price all that we require.  duce for some time all that we require.,17
25,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,There are factories lving idle in Victoria.  The Tariff Commission failed to discover any.,17
26,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Every clothing factory in Victoria can obtain as much work as it can carry out.  would be impossible to induce the Government to re-arrange the item. The trade generally complain of the way in which the different items out* in this part of the schedule. unanimous opinion of a laifge meeting of those interested in the trade in South Australia is that this Tariff is more complicated from the point of view of administration than any Tariff hitherto in operation in that State. The inconvenience is experienced in connection with clearances, and so for t h ; and it is urged that there ought to be a re-arrangement of the items under different headings. Through lack of business knowledge the Customs authorities do not appear to have fully appreciated the difficulties which arise from the present arrangement of the items; and greater simplicity is required. I suppose that this item will, more than any other, affect the dwellers in the bush and country districts, who, necessarily, have to wear made-up apparel. The local output is not anything like equal to the demand, and the consumer will now have to pay 40 per cent, plus busirespect of ness charges, seeing that the great bulk of the goods come from the United Kingdom. One effect of a high duty of this kind is to greatly increase retail prices, or to lead to the substitution of shoddy, not only by importers, but by local manufacturers. I hope the Committee will show some cofisideration for that .large section of the community who, of necessity, purchase madeup apparel. Of course, it is unfortunate that people have to wear clothes at.all, but there is the fact ; and I venture to say that the coming winter, not only in regard to clothing, but also in regard to foods, will be felt very severely as a result of the Tariff. Such a duty as that proposed shows very little' consideration on the part of the Government for the comfort and well-being of the people.",17
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I wish the honourable member had as much consideration for the people as I have.  for whom the Treasurer seems to have any consideration is the manufacturer, waiting on the doorstep; the producer or the consumer is quite disregarded so far as the Tariff is concerned, as is generallv acknowledged throughout the country.",17

""  is simply "" bullocking"" the Tariff through. He knows that he has the numbers, and he will have the Tariff passed whether it be right or wrong. Thank God, I am not under the whip of the Minister. I would not be responsible for this Tariff, even for my seat in this House, much as I value the latter.",17
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am delighted that I am responsible for the Tariff.  nothing to be proud about, unless, of course, he takes a pleasure in penalizing the unfortunate public. I have no hesitation in saying that this is altogether a town Tariff, and that the country interests have in no way been considered.",17
30,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Does the Treasurer represent a country district?  not.,18
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It was said for very long time that I do.  one duty which the Treasurer was very pleased to get rid of, although he himself proposed it .",18

36,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"That is not true.  have only to crack the whip, and some honourable members follow like- I shall not say what. This duty cannot be justified, and no attempt has been made by the Treasurer to justify it. I shall support the reduction of the duties to 30 per cent, and 27\ per cent., which, in itself, is an increase on the old Tariff.",18
37,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Denison) [3-8] It is refreshing to find some honourable members remembering that there are such people as consumers. member for Maranoa and others have shearers amongst their constituents; and I should like to ask those honourable members what protection men so engaged will have under this Tariff. There are some 13,000 people, men and women, engaged in the Post and Telegraph Department, and there are many thousands engaged in the various Railway Departments, Education Departments, and other Departments of the States; and I ask what protection are they afforded under these fiscal proposals of the Government? All our attention has lately been given to manufacturers; and, I have taken the trouble to ascertain that out of the total population of Australia of 4,200,000, there are only some 267,000 employed in manufactures. not During the last few weeks, in which we have dealt with some ninety items of the Tariff, we seem to have forgotten to pay any attention to consumers, and have dea voted all our consideration to those interested in manufactures. The entire population of the Commonwealth have to pay the extra cost of imported goods in order to find better wages for 267,000 persons.",18
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable has changed his opinions since I followed him in dealing with the last,18
39,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I have in no way changed my opinions. I regret that, at that time, honourable members considered it necessary to impose a duty as will high as 25 per cent, on apparel. Before time, in most of the States, the maximum duty had been 20 per cent.; and vet, under the increased duty of 25 per cent., all we have not found any decrease in the imports> which, pn the contrary, have, the last seven years, increased vear",18
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"He a r , hear; that is what the imports should not have done. ' Sir PHILIP FYSH - Whateve r duties may be imposed on textiles and apparel, importations cannot possibly be prohibited. It is certainly time that we had some practical man to deal with Tariff proposals of the kind before us; we ought not to permit a frenzied leap in the dark. My firm opinion is that, even under the Tariff proposed by the Minister, if it be passed, textiles and apparol will continue to be imported as heretofore, and that there really will be no opportunity preThe honourable sented for developing their manufacture m Australia. Honourable members ought to consider how little there is of the garments we are wearing at the present time manufactured in Australia, and how little it is possible to have manufactured here within the generation to which we belong.",18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,What ?,18
42,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"It is utterly impossible within the present generation to manufacture in Australia the class of textiles which, most of us in this Chamber arenow wearing.",18
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,They are manufactured in Australia now. _ Sir PHIL l P i FYSH - Undoubtedl y textiles are manufactured in the woollen mi lisof Tasmania and Victoria,18
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"And in Sydney, the best of all are manufactured. '",19
45,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,But most of the textiles manufactured in Australia are of one pattern. .,19
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is not so.,19
47,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I know better; and I repeat that the class of textiles which most of us are now wearing, never have been manufactured here, and are not likely to be manufactured here within the present generation.",19
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am wearing clothing manufactured by Vicars, in Sydney.",19
49,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,But the material is imported.,19
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No .,19
51,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The denial of the honourable member will not influence practical experienced men. I say that it is impossible in Australia now to weave the yarns which are necessary for the manufacture"" of garments such as those we are now wearing. There are a few varns made in Australia, but not a tithe of what are necessary to manufacture goods of the kind. 'However, all that is beside the question. I find that under the old duty of 25 per cent, imported goods, invoiced at £ 1 0 0 , were retailed at £ 1 9 7 . honourable members will give their atteni o n to what I regard as a most important ' "" S . ™ - Government proposals. fact. Under the operation of the old of duty, namely, 25 per cent., it was f ^ necessary that the retailer should obtain at the very least £ 1 9 7 for goods of an inP voiced value of £ 1 0 0 . In other words, ^ apparel and textiles, which in England were worth £ 1 0 0 , had to be retailed in the Commonwealth at nearly £ 2 0 0 . we agree to the Government proposal the price of these goods to the consumer will be considerably enhanced. place, we have to recollect the arbitrary i provision in the Customs Act under which 10 per cent, is added to the invoice value of goods for Customs purposes. We know ™ perfectly well that so far as apparel textiles are concerned a charge of 10 per cent, upon their invoice value is altogether disproportionate to the cost of portation, although in respect of many articles the cost of importing more nearly approximates 30, 40, and 50 per cent. If \ ° we add 10 per cent, to goods of the invoice value of £ 1 0 0 , and also levy a °* duty of 25 per cent, upon them, we shall increase their landed cost to £ 1 3 7 ios. Then it is necessary that the importer shall get at least 15 per cent, upon their value to cover his expenses. This would bring their cost up to -£158. As there is no retailer in Sydney or Melbourne who could afford to sell goods for less than 25 per cent, on their cost to him",19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Most of them add 45 per cent, to the cost of goods,",19
53,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The retailers must get at least 25 per cent, upon the value of the goods.

I can personally vouch for these facts, and I ask the Committee once more to reflect where the consumer is considered.",19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member should rather inquire where the revenue. - distributor is considered.,20
55,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The distributors represent a very small proportion of the community. Certainly they do not number 267,000, which is the total number of manufacturers and their employees within the Commonwealth. I .astounded that the public should sit - quietly by and permit this House, almost without protest, to enormously increase duties even upon the necessaries of life. tion? Before we pursue this course any further - we should pause to inquire whether it is necessary for us to do so from the standallow point of revenue, whether the imposition - of higher duties will result in increased employment and in the establishment of more factories in our midst, and whether we can manufacture the articles which we doing so. are so heavily taxing. The difference tween the 25 per cent, duty which was charged under the old Tariff and the 40' per cent, which it is proposed to levy - upon British goods under this Tariff will represent an increase, not of but of £ 2 9 5s. i d . per cent. In that respect it resembles the duty which has been imposed upon chairs, and which is unfew questionably a monstrous duty. Despite what the Treasurer may say of the possibility - manufacturing these goods in the momHvealth, practical men affirm that will .be impossible to manufacture them, no matter what rate of duty we may imment is not correct. pose upon them. Under this Tariff every article used by us, from the cradle to the .grave, is to be heavily taxed-fro m wicker cradle to the wooden coffin. have always supported a. revenue Tariff, and we have always secured sufficient recent. venue. In this connection I think I might emphasize some remarks that I made on a previous occasion-remark s to which ception was taken by the Treasurer. My revenue. observations were based upon returns preserious sented to the House-return s which showed that this Tariff, during the first month its operation, prbduced £200,000 more Tevenue than did the previous Tariff. second month's experience of it shows that that increase has been maintained. In other words, the new Tariff will yield approximately £2,500,000 more annuallv than did the old Tariff.",20
56,Mr REID,Unknown,That increase does not come from the foreigner. .,20
57,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It is quite refreshing to hear a Tasmanian representative declare that we are getting too much,20
58,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I am not prepared to support a Tariff which attempts to prohibit imports, but which will utterly fail in its purpose. Not many days ago I challenged the Treasurer's estimate that this Tariff would yield only an increased am perfectly revenue of £900,000.",20

We are far of better without them. I have already called attention to the fact that out of 4,200,000 The persons in the Commonwealth only 267,000 are engaged in pur manufactures. These figures have been obtained from the Government Statistician, and may be relied on. They include all bread-winners, as port' duties. well boys and girls of the age of sixlocal teen vears as married people. If to the number of married people we allow a doing so. household of three dependents, the total number of those who are directly and directly interested in manufacturing beour comes ""600,000. Every one will admit that fair wages are being paid, to those engaged in manufacturing. I believe that our facthe tories cannot employ more hands thar^are at present working in them, and that cannot, without new machinery, manufacture goods other than goods of the kind which they are now making, to obmanufacture of boots ? tain which machinery a outlay of capital would be necesnal of Commerce, a few days ago. sary. It is not likely that much of special machinery will be imported into Australia. In the United Kingdom, manuwill facturers limit themselves to particular creases in duties ? lines, but our mill-owners attempt to propared duce different kinds of goods in the one tory, and thus fail to produce so cheaply. In Manchester, Halifax, Liverpool, and other manufacturing centres, the various kinds of textiles are duced by separate mills, each employing special plant, and if Australia were to try to manufacture all the classes of goods which come under the heading of apparel and textiles, she would have to import new machinery of enormous value, and would have to persuade persons of special skill tional employment. to come here. As it is claimed that object of the Government in framing the Tariff was to increase the number of fachiffher tories and mills, I ask what has been effect of the fiscal policies of Victoria New South Wales during the past twenty or thirty years? Although Victoria had had a protective Tariff for a very long time, so that when these States joined Federation her factories were well estabproduced lished, her population during the last years has increased by only 5,500 annum, whereas that of New South Wales, where, prior to Federation, there was protection for manufactures, has increased by 10.300 per annum. ' Mr Mauger - The increase of populaof tion in New South Wales during the last creasing prices. seven years proves the effectiveness of Commonwealth Tariff.",20

Such articles have been in Tasmania more satisfactorily seven than similar articles have been produced per on the mainland, where in some of the States .the duties were higher. With these no 20 per cent, duties, manufacturers were able to enlarge their factories, duplicate their machinery, and increase Jthe number their hands, without unnecessarily in If , by increasing the the Tariff rates unduly, you increase prices, you must increase wages.

How many new mills is it hoped will be established, and how many extra persons is it thought will be employed, if the posed rate is agreed to?. Supposing the answer to those questions to be satisfactory, I ask, is it worthwhile to increase by perhaps 100,000 the number of persons employed in manufacturing, to the disadvantage of the 4,000,000 consumers who have been so little considered in the framing of the Tariff?",21
67,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [3.40] - The honourable member for Denison says that we are legislating for the. 267,000 persons employed in factories, for whose benefit 4,000,000 other persons who are not connected with manufacturing are to be taxed. But, in the first place, the 267,000 persons to whom he has referred as connected with factories are bread winners, and have many others dependent on them, while, in the second place, in a community like this,-every class is so interdependent, that it is impossible to draw a rigid line of demarcation between those who are interested in manufacturing industries and those who are interested in the producing industries. Those engaged in manufacturing and their dependents must give an immense amount of employment to those engaged in producing. We have also been told that our factories are going continually, and cannot produce enough to supply the demands of Australia. No doubt, those who have made that statement ""believe it to be true, but I know that it is not. For eight months out of the twelve, the large (clothing factories are going at a fair speed; but, during the remaining four months, those connected with them earn very poor wages, and. a very large quantity of wearing apparel is annually imported. Do not our own people require consideration ?",22
68,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Then why crease the cost of their wearing apparel?,22
69,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That will not be the effect of increasing the duties. speaking wjth some special knowledge of this subject. In Australia, taking the rates of wages into consideration, we get as good value for our money in wearing apparel as is to be obtained in any other part of the world. If the duties were lowered, the wages of those employed in our factories would be lowered. Buf the increasing of duties will not .increase the price of wearing apparel, although it will give more work to those who are employed in making it, and will open up new avenues of employment for the benefit of those who are without work. Even those who pro- are opposed to the proposals of the Government will admit that, in the clothing industry in Australia, there is a great deal of competition. There are not dozens, but hundreds of factories making wearing apparel of all sorts, and the competition between them is extraordinarily keen. It was rather cruel to-say that we who desire to protect the manufacturing industries of Australia have no consideration for those in the back blocks. It can be proved beyond assertion to the contrary that with regard to two commodities-boot s and wearing apparel - protection, instead of increasing, has reduced prices. Under our protective system we receive for our money as good value as is obtainable in any other country, having regard to Australian wages and conditions of labour. We have conclusive evidence that protective duties do not tend to permanently increase prices. The effect of a duty may be to slightly increase prices for a time, but local competition soon comes into play, and reduces themto their normal level. Those who do not represent constituencies in which apparel is manufactured need have no fear as to the effect of the Government proposal; local competition is sure to keep down prices to a reasonable level, and no man will be called upon to pay more for these goods than he ought to do, having regard to the wages that'he receives.",22
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [3; 47]-- I do not intend to weary the Committee by making a long speech, but having listened to the able and exhaustive address delivered by the honourable member for Denison, I feel that the industry is already highly protected. The honourable inmember for Melbourne Ports applies only one test to all these proposals. * If any imports are coming in he would impose I am higher duties to shut them out.

74,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the honourable member for Denison has been engaged in the business of making up apparel ?,23
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was referring to the fact that he had been engaged in the business of importing clothing. know that, in the eyes of many honourable members, that is enough to make him anathema. So far as I am aware in Victoria, there is no crime so bad as that of being an importer. I suppose that from the point of view of some honourable members the best thing to do with importers in Victoria is to shoot them at sight; apparently they ought to be destroyed iristanter. I have no doubt, however, that they are fulfilling a very useful function-; if they were not they would not exist. I do not share the view of some honourable members, who shrug their shoulders the moment the name of an importer is mentioned. I believe it to be a fact that we cannot supply all our own requirements, and therefore it is the height of folly to make it impossible to obtain supplies from oversea. I shall be the very last to stand in the way of any effort to facilitate the operation of our Victorian manufacturers.",23
76,Mr SALMON,Unknown,What about the manufacturers in New South Wales?,23
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I believe they are doing very well under the present duty. The honourable member for Illawarra mentioned the remarkable fact that none of these manufacturers . whose business is said to be in course of being strangled, went before the Commission to complain. Only one witness made any complaint regarding the alleged insufficiency of the old duties relating to this item. Had the manufacturers been in extremis, had their industry been in a parlous condition, such as has been alleged, they would readily have availed themselves of a Commission prepared to hear their complaints, with the possibility of a remedy being found. The fact that they did not appear before the Tariff Commission may be accepted as proof that they were doing fairly well under the old Tariff. That being so, why are we unnecessarily piling on these duties. Under the old Tariff there was a fair-duty of 25 per cent, plus a very large natural protection, which the honourable member for Denison has pointed out makes the total protection very high indeed, and having regard to that fact I move That after the figures "" 45 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 7th November, 1907 (General Tariff), 25 per cent.,"" be inserted.",23
78,Mr FOST ER,Unknown,"New England) [3.54] Honourable members of the Opposition, whilst pleading for the importers, have acI cused honourable members on this side of the House of fighting for the manufacturers. They have pointed out that our manufacturers are few in number, and they are disposed to be angry because we wish to abolish the business of importing. In this connection, I have only to say that there is ample room for our importers to invest their capital in woollen manufactories. The imposition of a substantial Tariff instead of injuring them will afford them an opportunity to invest their money in a more solid business, which will be beneficial to the Commonwealth. The people of Australia can make up woollen goods as well as can those of any other country. My chief reason for desiring that work to be done here is that I think the farmers of Australia should have the pleasure of feeding the workers who make up their raw material. I heard just now a plea for the poor shearers, who go far into the in-' terior to carry on their industry. H a l f of those men are engaged, for the greater part of the year, in farming. They pro. duce food which the workers in our factories consume, and they do not lose sight of that fact. I desire not only to provide the primary producers of Australia with a splendid home market, such as is open to the primary producers of the United States of America, but to see thousands of men engaged in our factories working up the raw materials produced in Australia, so that ifwe ever have to defend ourselves Ave shall be able to obtain from within the Commonwealth the men and the food and clothing that we require. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports was on solid ground when he urged that the extent of our importations of these goods showed that an increased duty was necessary. In passing, I should like to point out that the Government propose duties of 30 and 35 per cent, on woollen piece goods, and think that an increase of those duties to 35 and 40 per cent, would not be unreasonable on made-up goods. hope that the Government proposal in this case will be carried. There is no industry which could be more truly described as native to Australia than is that of woollen manufacture. We produce sufficient wool not only for our own use, but to supply thousands of the looms of Belgium, Germany. England, France, and other countries. It has been argued that certain patterns of woollens cannot be produced in Australia. The reason is that the turnover of our factories is not large enough. The population is not sufficient to justify the production of an immense variety; but if we wish to encourage our manufacturers to obtain up-to-date machinery, and to specialize, we should endeavour first of all to give them the local market, and then to expand that market by means of. an increased population - There are certain lines which every one admits can be produced in Australia. Some Australian tweeds are really magnificent, and I should like to see them exported as well as used locally. We produce wool in immense quantities, and why should we not export the tweed as well as the raw material ? I should also like an a-lmost prohibitive duty to be imposed on blankets. Why cannot Australia largely export them? The honourable member for Denison was at one time engaged in the importing trade, and I am prepared to discuss with him the question of prices. What prices do we pay tq-day for the woollen goods containing a ' large admixture of shoddy? We start by taking the wool from the sheeps' backs to the sea-board, and then sending it on a trip round the world. The Australian who buys goods made abroad from Australian wool has to pay for that trip. wool is taken to the wharves from the railway, and certain charges are incurred in getting it on board the boats. It is then shipped to foreign countries, a charge, of course, being made for freight and landing when it arrives. It is then taken to the factoriesat another charge, and there made up.",23
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the member quite sure of all this? Mr Foster.,24
80,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I can quite understand the anxiety of the honourable member to side-track me. I am now, stating something which is not quite obvious to everybody, because they have not thought out that I the question. It is suggested that Australian manufactured woollens must necessarily be shoddy-that if we have protecI tion in the country where the wool itself is produced we shall find shoddy placed on the market. However that may be, after all those charges have been paid, the manufactured wool makes a return trip to Australia, other charges of course being incurred; and then it is sold, in the shape of clothing, to Australian consumers. Yet importers wish us, as intelligent men, to believe that woollen goods could not be sold cheaper in Australia if they were manufactured on the spot. I have argued over and over again that when the raw material is produced in a country, and manufacture can be carried on to any extent, it may reasonably be expected that the finished article will be produced more cheaply there than in any other country. Honourable members opposite appear to be a little hilarious over my description of the trip of our wool round the world. There is, however, just another . item to which I should like to call attention, namely, ihe importer's profit. I am very sorry that the honourable member who preceded me did not give us moreinformation on this point.",24
81,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The experience is that the locally-manufactured article is not sold more cheaply, or as cheaply, as is the imported article.",24
82,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I am quite aware that under the present distributors' methods, with private enterprise, in .Australia as elsewhere, there seems to be a tremendous price added to the real value of the goods. I hope, however, before long to have the opportunity to-vote for a. measure which will enable us to deal with those persons who charge exorbitant prices; and, if anything be done in this connection, we The ought to deal not only with importers, but any other distributors who penalize the public. I have previously spoken of prices being raised in consequence of the Tariff, but, as a matter of fact, prices have been raised in relation to articles which bear no duty whatever. It seems to me, however, that if a storekeeper or a merchant desires to buy a motor car or anything honourable else, he can always raise prices independently of the Tariff. However, free-trade will not make people honest; if a dealer desires to be dishonest, he will be dishonest no matter what the fiscal policy of the country may be. I admit that for some years to come the manufacturers in Australia will not be able to produce all the patterns which are now imported, and that, therefore, certain classes of apparel must continue to come from abroad. But a plea has been made on behalf of the poor workers. people are not able to afford the fancy materials; and those who demand them can very well afford to pay any little extra price that may be asked. 1 only wish that every poor man could afford to buy two or three suits made of the best Australian tweed, because I am sure that they would be then very well clothed. Another amusing argument has been advanced' in reference to the number of people employed in this industry. must be remembered that all the people outside the Public Service-and even public servants assist in distribution-ar e producers.",24
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who m honourable member call a producer?,25
84,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I call a man a producer who assists, we will say, in getting the raw material, or in transporting it to the consumer; we may call such an one a producer, or an aider in production.",25
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That definition is economical lv very defective.,25
86,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I am not giving a book definition; I prefer to leave book definitions alone and give common-sense definitions. It has also been contended that an increase of wages is really of very little benefit, seeing that the price of commodities is raised accordingly. I do not see how that state of things can be altered by abolishing a T a r if f ; but if workers find that they are being penalized in that way, they have one remedy, outside a good system of arbitration, namely, co-operation, to which I hope they will resort.",25
87,Mr FOWL ER,Unknown,"Perth) [4.10] - If the honourable member for New England had had the advantage, or the disadvantage, of being a member of the Federal Parliament when the first Tariff was under discussion, we should, perhaps, have been spared such a dissertation on the merits of protection as that with which he has just favoured us. We went all through that kind of thing ad nauseam a few years ago. I can assure the honourable member that anything he has said on the subject at the present time is very stale news to those of ' us who went through tfie mill in connection with the last Tariff. Theories of protection are very beautiful until we come to analyze them. The fallacy of that system whereby all may become rich and prosperous, like the old ladies in the French village, by taking in each other's washing, has been exposed time and again; but the honourable member inflicts it on us once These more. Let me remind the honourable member that, supposing we desired to protect to the very utmost town industries, we car* only' afford protection to a very small fraction of them. The carpenter, the butcher, the baker, and hundreds of others engaged in town industries, can derive no benefit whatever from any protective duty Parliament can impose. When it comes to dividing up the work between country and town-whe n we come to conIt sider the advantage of the town producer buying from the country producer, and vice versa-the protectionist forgets entirely that a comparatively few farmers can produce sufficient for an immense numdoes the ber of residents in town. The moment an overflow of rural produce into foreign markets takes place, then the rural producer derives no benefit whatever from any protective duty. If the rural producer has to depend on town consumption alone for his market, even irt Australia, with our handful of farmers, comparativelv speaking, the number of the latter would have to be reduced in the most disastrous fashion in order that the method of primitive barter should be continued according to the ideas of the honourable member for New England. That honourable member has given us a. magnificent argument in favour of low duties,' or of no duties, in connection with many Australian industries, particularly the woollen industries. He has quoted to us the remarkable series of charges on Australian' wool which is sent abroad in order to be manufactured into cloth for ultimate consumption in Australia. If the honourable member reads the report of the free trade section of the Tariff Commission on the woollen industries, he will find all those facts related very carefully, as a striking illustration »of the enormous amount of natural protection enjoyed by woollen manufacturers in this country. I am not one who desires to encourage the importer; I say undoubtedly that Australia should manufacture all, in reason, for her own requirements. But any one who has observed the pecujiar circumstances of Australia ought to realise that our geographical isolation from the manufacturing centres of the world is such that any industry, which has a chance of success under existing natural conditions, will Le far better left alone. We ought not to impose upon the rept of the community a tax in order to bring it .into existence before natural ditions would otherwise operate. If we attend to the natural development of the country, we shall find 'all those industries in which the honourable member is so much interested gradually following that development. The object-lesson in Australia at the present time ought to be sufficient to make the honourable member pause with regard to the alleged advantages of protection, especially when he finds that the capital city of a highly protected State, such as Victoria, has a greater proportion of population than is in the whole State behind. Such a condition of affairs is fraught with danger to any country. When the honourable member speaks of the necessity for population in order to protect Australia, does he mean that there should Le a system by which we crowd all our youths into unhealthy factories, and leave our immense areas lacking that bone and sinew which would undoubtedly bring wealth to the country, and advance the interests of the whole community ?",25
88,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,I would sooner buy goods made in Australian factories than goods made in sweated British or German factories.,26
89,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"If the honourable member knows anything about factory life under the most ideal conditions, he must realise that it is on our wide plains and mountain sides and in our rural industries that we must rear our defenders.",26
90,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Does the honourable member desire to establish unhealthy factories in Australia?,26
91,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Eve n under the best conditions, factory life is undoubtedly detrimental to the health of those who engage in it. The honourable member has only to visit many of the establishments in Melbourne to realise that. If he had seen - as I have done-the serious results which flow from life in factories in other lands, he would pause before he desired to reproduce them here. But I rose chiefly for the purpose of making one or two points in connection with the particular item under consideration. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out that, in connection with ready-made clothing, there are hundreds of factories throughout the Commonwealth. Undoubtedly it is a large, important, and growing industry. But for his benefit I wish to read the deliberate finding of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, which I venture to say con- cannot be challenged by any person who takes the trouble to peruse the evidence tendered to that body. In speaking of the clothing trade, the B section of the Commission sayOut of the whole of this extensive industry only two witnesses directly interested, both Victorian, appeared before the Commission. Neither came forward in a representative capacity. In other words, they came "" on their own."" One of them was engaged in the manufacture of mantles and costumes, and the other in that of ready-made boys' and men's suits. The report continuesOne was engaged in manufacturing mantles and costumes; the other ready-made boys' and men's suits,. &c. It is noteworthy that both these witnesses worked principally on materials supplied and owned by wholesale houses. They were not. manufacturers in the proper sense of the word. The report proceedsOut of the large number of bond fide manufacturers engaged in this industry as the purchasers of materials, and the sellers of finished articles, not a single one came with a complaint of overseacompetition or of insufficient duties. These statements speak for themselves. The honourable member for Illawarra has shown that the industry is growing steadily, and I am quite sure that if it were left alone, under the old rate of duty, it would continue to grow until the importations from abroad, which produce such a feeling of horror in the minds of honourable members like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, had entirely disappeared. It would be far better for the industry that those importations should be wiped out gradually than that any violent measures should be taken with that end in view. I am satisfied that by increasing the duty from 25 to 40 per cent, we shall not benefit the industry, but undoubtedly we shall disadvantage the consumer. Of course, it may be argued that the industry progressed under the high duty which was formerly imposed under the Victorian Tariff. In this connection, I wish to read an extract from the finding of a Board which was appointed in 1895 to inquire into the fiscal system of this State.",26

94,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The honourable member is not susceptible to the argumentsof his opponents, I suppose?",27
95,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"If the honourable mem-' ber can adduce any weighty arguments in opposition to the view which I am presenting, I shall be happy to give them consideration. The report statesSome manufacturers of clothing made free material went so far as to assert that they adopted. required no protective duty, and that the entire abolition would not lead to a return of importations. The manufacture was now so firmly established that the makers were able to compete with the British factories on equal terms. Whilst the members of the Tariff Comniission were returning from Western Australia, I made the acquaintance of a gentleman who is connected with one of the largest clothing factories in Melbourne. This factory does a large business with Western Australia and the other States, and the gentleman in question assured me that he had no intention whatever of appearing before the Tariff Commission, because he was well, satisfied with the existing, duty. I saw him again a few weeks ago, and he then informed me that the Government proposals were preposterous, that there was absolutely no justification for an increase in the old rate of duty, . that his factory was working at the highest pressure, and that it was maintaining its maximum output. I may add that it is a factory which pays good wages to its employees, and in which the general conditions which obtain will compare favourably with those of the best factories in Australia, and indeed of any other part of the world.",27
96,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Is the honourable member sure that the gentleman to whom he refers is not doing a bit of importing as well?,27
97,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,He is not.,27
98,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Perhaps he enjoys a monopoly.,27
99,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"No. The fact that no bond fide manufacturer has asked for higher duties is surely sufficient evidence that the preposterous rates proposed by the Government are not desired, even by those engaged in the industry itself. I trust that the Committee will pause before it adopts a duty which will undoubtedly constitute a serious tax upon the 'community. I wish now to point out what I conceive to be a mistake in regard to the classification of these items. In the form in which the Tariff has been presented to us, we are asked to deal first with manufactured articles, whereas we ought to begin with the consideration of the duties to be levied upon the raw materials-that is upon piece goods. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission suggested a classification to the Government, which they have carefully ignored, but which I venture to think would have been a vast improvement from upon the classification which they have",27

104,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The honourable member's theory is that the higher the duty we levy upon an article the lower will be its price. If a jump from 25 per cent, to 45 per cent, in the rate levied upon apparel will not increase its price, I do not know why the increase is proposed.",27

That is certainly not. the experience of the highlv-protected countries of the world. Take the great protectionist example, namely, America. One of the chief complaints that we hear is that American manufacturers are "" d u m p in g "" their surplus into Australia. The reason they are able to do this is that their own market has been so assured to them that they can charge the home consumers a price sufficiently high to reimburse them for selling at a loss in foreign markets. I ask my protectionist friends if they wish to repro- gcose that lays the golden eggs. duce a similar state of things here? Do they desire our local market so secured to our manufacturers that the latter will be able not only to supply that market, but to ""dump "" goods in foreign countries? We are told that that is what obtains in protectionist countries, and we are asked to impose a duty upon importations into Australia to give fair play to Australian manufacturersBut axe not our consumers to be considered? In my electorate there are no big factories. My constituents are primary producers, men who have to go on the land, and battle hard for their livelihood. They have been successful in meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth, and now depend chiefly on foreign markets for their returns from wool, meat, wheat, and other exports. Our farmers have to sell their wheat in Mark Lane, against the competition of the farmers of every other country. They do not receive any special coddling.",27
107,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," I ask the honourable member not to unnecessarily debate the general question.

I shall willing to support methods brought forward to prevent such conditions from arising to 58 per cent. here. In the Committee there is a majority pledged to support higher duties; but we cannot know, until a division has been taken, what rates any particular member will support, and while the minds of honourable members are open to a certain extent, I ask them to consider the position of the producers as well as that of the manufacturers. I am by no means hostile to the encouragementof local manufacprotectionist, tures, but I wish to see it done by fair and legitimate methods. One section of the community should not benefit at the expense of a larger section which has contend with the forces of nature. I do not desire that additional burdens be placed on the shoulders of our graziers and farmers. If we get a Tariff such as some of the extreme city protectionists desire, we shall, perhaps, find that, like the old woman in the fable, we have killed the Our manufacturers must largely depend upon the support of our producers, and, if the conditions of those on the land are made harder, and their earnings reduced, the manufacturers will ultimately suffer. The honourable member for New England drew an interesting picture of the methods in which wool is obtained on our stations - and farms,, and the different processes through which it goes before being shipped to the Old .Country, to be returned to us in the form of tweed and cloth. He argued that we should do our own manufacturing, and even said that he would prevent all importations. I ask him, would he prevent all exportation? If he is not prepared to prevent the exportation of our wool, gold, wheat, minerals, and other products, he must be prepared to admit importations as a quid pro quo, because we must buy in exchange for what we sell. I would direct his attention, and that of those who think with him, to the fact that many of the Victorian woollen manufacturers have not been satisfied to manufacture Australian wool, but, in order to increase their profits, have largely adulterated it with cotton. The Tariff Commission obtained samples of imported and locally promanufactured woollen goods, to make a the comparison between them in respect to The subsequent analyses disclosed that of thirty-six samples of imported flannel, five contained cotton in proportions varying from 28 to 40.4 per cent., be while of twenty Victorian samples, fifteen contained cotton in proportions of from 26",28
108,Mr REID,Unknown,We never hear of the i niquities of our own manufacturers.,28
109,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"No . On the casting vote of the Chairman, the Commission decided to have another set of samples tested, which the Customs Department was requested to procure. I am not surprised that the Chairman, an enthusiastic received the first analyses with doubt. When it was known that further samples were to be collected, the Department, in the attempt to obtain them, to met with extraordinary difficulties.",28
110,Mr REID,Unknown,"Surely not created by the shall Australian manufacturers ? Mr THOM AS BROWN - Yes . The second series of analyses disclosed that of 136 samples of imported flannels, fifteen, or 11 per cent., contained cotton in proAre portions varying from .8 to 63.4 per cent. while of the' samples of Australian flannels, forty-nine in number, forty, or 81 per cent., contained cotton in proportions of from .3 to 87.1 per cent. The Australian flannels were obtained from Victoria, and New South Wales, and of thirty-nine Victorian samples, two were all wool, while four out of ten of the New South Wales samples were pure wool. According to the Year-Book of Victoria for 1903, 1899 cotton amounting to 154,388 lbs. was Imported, while the importation in 1900 178,332 lbs.; in 1901, 250,184 lbs.; in 1902, 273,335 "" - - considerable increase JS a - and in T903, 368,749 lbs - a still greater increase. The report shows that the use of cotton in woollen goods is practically confined to Victoria; it does not appear to five years. be used as an adulterant in New South Wales or the other States to anything like the same extent. Yet the Victorian woollen industry has been coddled for twenty-five years. Although millions of pounds of wool have, during that period, been ported, the local manufacturers of woollen goods have, in some cases, used as much as 81 per cent, of cotton in their productween tion. Now they are asking for duties 40 and 45 per cent, to protect them from outside competition. I ask the honourable member for New England, is hewilling to support these high duties for the purconsist pose of protecting manufacturers who resort to practices such as I have spoken of ? Tariff Commission's investigations showed that adulteration takes place in imported goods in respect to a smaller number articles, and to a lesser degree, than locally manufactured goods. Before the Committee consent to increase the protection that of the local manufacturers, something facturer should be done to compel them to use Australian wool, and to prevent them from his selling as woollen goods fabrics which conprofit tain a very large proportion of cotton. put Under the old Tariff local manufacturers members had a very fair margin to work upon. The Tariff for adulterations. reports of the Tariff Commission show one manufacturing interest, with a capital - of £30.000, under the old Tariff has been maintain paying 15 per cent, dividends. Many of with those engaged in primary industries would be glad to obtain such a return upon their to investments. Whilst honourable members being are pleading for the manufacturer, I hibit should like to ask: What is the farmer, the settler, and the shearer? their interests to be considered, as ; well as the interests of those who are actually engaged in this industry? If it can be shown that they are safeguarded, I shall be prepared to allow the whole matter to go, but until I am satisfied on that point I shall not hesitate to raise my voice on behalf of those whom I represent.",28
111,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [4-46]-I do not wish to discuss this question at length, but it seems to me that a number in of honourable members have rather missed the point in dealing with the adulteration was of so-called woollen goods with cotton.

132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Is that what the .them honourable member is going to do?,30
133,Mr REID,Unknown,"Not if I can help it. I am very much struck with the wonderfully philosophic attitude taken up in connection with this matter by the honourable member for South Sydney. During the recent general election in New South Wales, two of the leaders of the Labour Party in not that State- Mr MCGowen and Mr Fred. Flowers-cam e down in post haste to Melbourne to see the head of the ""ustraliarr Labour Party with a view of endeavoura ing to relieve the masses of the people from some of the more exorbitant duties that are included in this Tariff. The honthat orable member for South Sydney will mit that clothing is one of the necessaries of life, and that this duty is of the greatest consequence to the poorer classes of the community. A tax of 50 per cent, or per cent, is a matter of perfect to the wealthy, but the position is different in respect to the great masses of the who have to look carefully at every shilling they spend in maintaining the decency their homes and families? What is one of the chief items of expenditure of of the^workers? It is the clothing of the husband, the wife, and the children. This is not a matter to laugh about. Millionaires, or those who have an income of £ 2 , 0 0 £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year, can afford to laugh at the faction ? duty, but to the great masses of the workers in all industries it is unquestionmember ably a serious matter. To those who believe that high duties tend to make goods cheaper and better, this is a joyful occawhen sion. They would put on another 50 per cent., and spread cheapness and plenty of clothing among the homes of Australia. four Why have they not the courage of professed beliefs, if they think that the higher we raise the barrier between abundance of the rest of the world and the needs of Australia, the surer we are to promote cheapness and competition, and all the blessings of a happy life? from my point of view, even the protectionist must always be prepared to draw line, because the moment we go beyond certain point we encourage, not the best kind of competition, but all sorts of illegitimate combinations. It is one thing to drought year. say, "" We will crush them by Act of Parliament"" ; it is quite another' thing to do it. It has not been done yet, and I tell my honourable friends opposite that they will find me helping them in the most thorough way I can to bring to bear upon this matter some sort of scheme in the hope that it will be of service. In the meantime, whilst we are trying to boom manufacturers in the big towns, we should ask ourselves how the spread of cultivation is progressing in the great country districts of Australia. It is at this particular time when we seeking to double the hands employed slop-making factories that we should look at the hard facts of the industry of which our large cities are the costly superstrucagriculture. tures. From the Budget papers I have obtained some very ominous facts as to the position of the greatest of our industriesthe tilling of the soil of Australia. I find [200] in 1906-7 the area under crop in Vicadtoria, as compared with the area under cultivation in 1903-4, had declined by 86,000 acres.

144,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,That was a,31
145,Mr REID,Unknown,"However , we all know that 1906-7 was a grand year for the agricultural industry; but, in spite of that fact, in four out of the six States there was not only no increase in the area under cultivation, but stagnation or retrogression. The two States which show an increase are New South Wales and Western Australia. In the latter State the figures show a magnificent increase in three years from 283/000 acres to 460,000 acres. New South Wales, with a very much larger area under cultiare' vation, showed an increase of 280,000 in acres. Putting those two States aside, however, there has been something which, at least, looks like stagnation in regard to I do not think that the figures for South Australia can be accounted for by the butter industry, which, so far as I - know, has not shown any marvellous development. While we are looking after the roof of national greatness, and making more beautiful and strong, we ought to member that it must rest on foundations, and that the foundations of national meet strength, in a country like this, must lie in the rural districts and not in the cities. Surely, when we see the trend of populafew tion, we can realise that high duties, they have the result intended, will intensify the crowding of the population into the towns, and away from country industries. Would that be advantageous ? I think not. I do not desire to go into ancient history, but merely to mention one fact. When we were under the blighting influence of ports in New South Wales, in 1900, just before the Federal Union, we had in our clothing factories there 5,676 hands emsome ployed, as compared with 6,291 hands ploved in Victoria after twenty or thirty years of high protection, represented by duties ranging from 25 to 50 per cent. point this out merely to show that it is necessarily suicide to throw our ports open.",31
146,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,And there were more women and children employed in the woollen clothing. Victorian factories than in the New South Wales factories.,32
147,Mr REID,Unknown,"The males employed "" s l o p "" factories of Victoria, in 1900, were 1,400, as compared with 2,000 males employed in the New South Wales factories under free-trade. However, I do not desire to go into these old matters.",32
148,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I recognise the skirt of an old speech in those figures.,32
149,Mr REID,Unknown,"That may be, but my skirts always have pleasing trimming them, and that is more than I can say even for the Treasurer's petticoats. I do not desire to take up too much time, because recognise that we are all in sympathy the Minister in his desire to dispose Tariff as soon as possible.",32
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am glad to hear that.,32
151,Mr REID,Unknown,"Fortunately , we have a common interest in disposing of the Tariff as soon as we can, without, of course, getting our duty as representatives people. That duty we must not forget, and, apart from that, we are all anxious to expedite public business. heard something about adulteration, my friends opposite find the grand secret competition. Of course, there truth in that view ; but one of the greater causes of adulteration is high Tariffs. I a policy be adopted which tends to crease prices-whic h enables traders to it crease prices whether rightly or wronglyrewhat is the inevitable result? It is that those who sell to the public will try to the natural craving there is for cheap articles. That is the most natural craving in the world with those who have only a shillings to spend; and, really, it is if not a craving, but a necessity. If wages are limited, articles are not bought at all unless at a low price, and even high wages form no abundant fund. The honourable member for South Sydney' said easily that we all desire to prevent-adulteration. But if high Tariffs are imposed, consumers have free to choose between shoddy and nothing at all, and they are glad to get a garment with any wool in it. If , in a very proper spirit, law is applied which prevents the sale emof woollen garments containing any cotton, then woollen goods are placed beyond the reach of large numbers of persons who have, I not money for the purchase of expensive not articles. It is notorious that in the United States, where, in many iparts, the climate is bitterly cold, the poorer classes, in spite of high wages, cannot afford the luxury of",32
152,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Cotto n and wool ought in the to be sold as a mixture.,32
153,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is only right and honest; but I am pointing out that the masses cannot afford the luxury of articles which are beyond a certain price. I do not desire to see the Tariff, even from a protectionist point of view, strung up so tightly as to make the element of wool even more slender in the clothing of people of limited on means. There are some commodities which every one ought to have, but, unfortunately, there are people who cannot afford to purI chase them, and who have to wear cheaper with goods when the higher priced clothing of the would be more healthy and lasting.",32
154,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Can the honourable member not see that, considering that this country really lives on its wool, we ought to do everything to advertise that commodity, and forshow that woollen goods are much better of the than wool and cotton mixed?",32
155,Mr REID,Unknown,"There have been a large - number of very able calculations made on We have the effect which Tariffs have on the purand chasing power of wages* The result of a in number of inquiries in the United States is some undoubtedly is that, whilst the Dingley Tariff raised wages to a very substantial f extent, the prices of the articles which the inwage earners consumed went up so much in that the Tariff was absolutely of no benefit to the workers. I know that we free-tradno ers have no chance of carrying our into effect in this Parliament, but I appeal to protectionists here not to raise the Tariff too high. I make that appeal hi the terests of the masses of the people whom the goods under discussion are the necessaries of life. Of course, we have told about the extent of the importations, but, naturally, importations increase prosperous times. We must nof forget that the last three or four member, years have been comparatively very prosperous ones; and, as I say, will imports are always much greater under when such circumstances than in dull times.

Surely the people of the country tricts are not in a position to give another £2,000,000 a year to the people in towns? Surely, as it is, the .towns are drawing enough of. the life blood of our country districts? . There never was a more misplaced effort than that represented by this Tariff. I admit, of course that a majority the people of Australia have endorsed the protectionist policy, and, the remarks I am making, I have cent, [200]- 2 desire to lecture. But it is, to views my mind, a matter for infinite regret that, at a time when the public should have thought about the primary industries, they insupported a policy which looks more to for the interest of the towns.

I suppose that the clothing industry will come under the new protection proposals of the Government. assume that honourable members opposite would not be prepared to vote for higher 'duties unless they were assured that that was so. Unfortunately, in this particular trade-whethe r it be under free-trade or protective conditions-ther e is too much reason to believe that sweating is practised.

That is a very harsh proannually ceeding, because although these cases, they are made for conveying goods across the seas, are worth a certain amount, moment they have been emptied of their contents they become merely stuff for woollen goods. firewood.",35

186,Mr REID,Unknown,"But under this Tariff they will be valued upon their arrival, and a of high valuation will be placed upon them. At least they depreciate to the extent of one-half the moment that the goods are taken out of them. As the honourable member for Denison has pointed out, the 45 per cent, duty which it is proposed to I levy upon this item thus really becomes * 50 per cent. The duty upon the cases will probablv add 2 per cent, or 3 per cent., so that honourable members will see that instead of the duties levied upon this item being 45 per cent, and 40 per cent., they are in reality 50 per cent, and 45 per cent. Now, in Victoria, where a protective policy has been believed into an any extent far exceeding the beliefs of the is electors of other States, the people have yet approved of a duty of 50 per cent, upon clothing. I think that in the midst of a financial crisis the duty was raised to 64 per cent. But instead of adding to the revenue, this rate proved most disappointing in its operation, and it some was brought down with a run. Consequently in Victoria, which is in a special sense the home of protection, the people never yet endorsed the imposition of a duty of 50 per cent, upon this line.",35

I agree with some of his 10 premises; but do not follow the syllogism of the honourable member for East duty Sydney, as he very apfly remarked. We agree that it is desirable to stimulate Australian industries, but I think it is a deplorable circumstance that we have to import the best portion of when £2,000,000 worth of woollen goods into a country which grows more wool than the does any other country in the world.",35
190,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,They are not,35
191,Mr CARR,Unknown,"They come in ostensibly as woollen goods. If they were manupurfactured in Australia they would be woollen goods. I am prepared to extend to the clothing industry a little more tection for the purpose of stimulating the development of woollen manufacture in midst. I admit that we have to incur certain risks, but as nation builders we want to see the Commonwealth progress. It has been laid down again and again that owing to our isolation it is absolutely necessary that we should develop our reprotection sources. Consequently we must incur some risk in building up these industries. I ' am just as keenly alive to the dangers that we have to run as is the honourable memfor ber for East Sydney. I agree with him that it is necessary to stimulate our mary industries. But already our primary producers are complaining that they do not trade? possess a sufficient home market. I know that some of them take a short-sighted view, but we must recollect that to deal with men who take that sort of view, and meet them as far as we can. They say, when we talk of putting more farmers on the land, "" What is the good, until have more people here to consume their products?"" One way of obtaining a larger consumption for their products is to increase the number of persons engaged turing in Australia. If the leader of the Opposition were willing to make it impossible for any man to hold land not put it to the best uses, I should be ready to support him, but, holding the views which he does, and backed by the Corner Party, I feel that if he were power we should find it more difficult stimulate primary production than it is der present circumstances. In my opinion, these prices will not be increased by raising the rates' of duty. Locally made tweeds are ning. cheaper than imported tweeds, if not quite so good in some instances. not more sought after is not so much because of their want of quality of the prejudice against them.",35

I am quite prepared to be compropelled to use Australian tweeds, and I think that patriotic Australians hold the our same views as I do.' Many tailors whom I have consulted have told me that the effect of the duties has not been to increase prices^ and that Australian tweeds are cheaper than the imported tweeds. It has been said that wham we have more effective the Australian manufacturers will unduly increase prices; but we have the promise of the Ministry that legislation will be introduced, which the honourable member East Sydney has volunteered to support, to provide against such imposition. priSurely, we are not going to admit that we are unable to cope 'with all the tricks of",36

There is no need for the public *o be exploited, either through the medium - of the local manufacturers or through the medium of the Customs Department. If the duties give an effective protection, the public cannot be exploited through the medium of the Customs Department, and we can prevent their exploitation by local manufacturers. But, in view of the prejudices which have to-be considered, and of the fact that this is a tentative proposal, I think that the rates should be reduced to 40 per cent, in the General 'Tariff and to 35 per cent, on goods pro-' - duced. or manufactured in the United Kingdom, and I ishould like to move to bring that about.",37

207,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [5.36] - I regret that the Minister has not given way to the representations made to him, to allow the Committee, in considering these duties, to begin at the bottom, laying, in the first instance, a secure foundation. In America some very large buildings ' have been commenced from the top, but, in the firstplace, a frame-work has been necessary, and I think that we should do better in this instance in building from the bottom, considering first the duty on "" piece goods.

I have I have looked for enlightenment in regard to - these proposals to the reports of the Tariff Commission, and particularly to those of The the protectionist section, but I have not found it . It has been stated that the manufacturers concerned did not come before the Commission for reasons best known to themselves. Had they done so, they would have found themselves in a difficult position, because they would have been asked: ' ' A r e not your mills.at present working at high pressure ? "" I know that they are.

221,Mr WILSON,Unknown,No ; duties of 30 and 27J per cent.,37
222,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"When the honourable member spoke to me on the subject, I said that I would not go below a duty of 35 per cent., and, at the proper time, I shall move for a duty of 35 per cent, on the General Tariff and of 30 per cent, on the special Tariff for goods from the United Kingdom.",37

I am quite prepared to accept that foreshadowed by the honourable member for Macquarie. It must not be forgotten that - we have yet to deal with piece goods. I desire that there shall be a fair margin between the duties on piece goods and those on the manufactured article, and if this amendment be carried it will prevent us from giving such a margin as I should otherwise like to provide for. that the margin between the two will not the cut down too low. My desire is to bring down the duties on piece goods reasonably low, and to rrive, at all events, a margin of 10 per cent, between them and those on the manufactured article.",39
227,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [5.59] - I trust that the Committee will not be prepared to vote for more than the excessive duties proposed by the honourable member for Kooyong. The first Federal Government introduced a Tariff in which they proposed a duty of only 25 per cent, on this line, and we now have an ""honourable member who was a member of that Ministry askin? us to grant an excessive increase without any reason being offered even by those in the trade. It has - been admitted, even by protectionists - throughout Australia, that some of the duties in the Tariff press very heavily upon the people, and especially upon the poor of the community.",39
228,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What protectionists mitted that ?,39
229,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Many protectionists; and some of the divisions which have been taken support my statement. Protectionist members of the Labour Party went over to New South Wales during the elections, and some of them stated that they were not responsible for the Tariff-that , in their opinion, some of the duties would bear heavily on the working classes, and that when those duties came to be considered they would be found trying to reduce them.",39

231,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The duties were not indicated, but that is the - statement which was made. It will be realized, especially by the public, who have to pay,' that no duties will press more Iheavily than those now under discussion.",39
232,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Absolut e nonsense !,39
233,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is an absolute fact. I am very glad to see this excitement amongst the supporters of a high Tariff, because it shows that my arguments are going home. I hope the Committee will not impose these duties, because the manufacturers themselves have not said they are necessary; and it is absolutely absurd to imagine that the new protection, if it be applied to selling prices, can reach a trade like this, which deals with such an immense number of articles. I hope Mr Reid - Do not forget the 10 per cent, that is added.",39
234,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is not added-it is a mistake.,39

237,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If there be. a duty of 50 per cent., and £ 1 0 is added to the value, that means another 5 per cent, added to the duty.",39

240,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [6.5] - I desire to protest against the ridiculous and outrageous proposal of the honourable member for Kooyong. That honourable member was returned as a protectionist, and when beadfore the electors he said he would support the protectionist policy. But because of a few anonymous letters in the Melbourne Argus, which threatened some opposition at the next election, he has never since voted within these walls without having his ear to the ground in order-to ascertain, if possible, public opinion - The honourable member is afraid to vote according to his election promises as a protectionist.",39
241,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I should like to take your ruling, Mr MCDonald, as to whether the honourable member for Corio is in order in making the imputation that the honourable member for Kooyong is influenced in his votes in this chamber by letters to the newspapers?",39

244,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,40
245,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I withdraw the latter part of my remarks. If the Committee accept the amendment, there is no possible chance of protecting the woollen industry in relation to piece goods, which have yet to be considered. If the honourable member for Kooyong thinks that this is not an Australian industry whichneeds protection, he does not know what protection is. think that the next time the honourable member appeals to the electors as a protectionist they will know what he really is.",40
246,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [6.7] - It appears to me that the working classes have no champions in this Committee. Surely honourable members are net prepared, to vote in favour of a duty of 35 per cent, on goods which represent a value of £1,600 , 0 0 0 a year, and which must of necessity be imported for many years to come, no matter what the duty may be. ' Is no word to be said on behalf of the large body of consumers who will suffer by reason of this impost? I should feel utterly ashamed to vote in favour of even 25 per cent. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, after giving the question every consideration, came to the conclusion that a duty of 15 per cent, was adequate; and the recommendation by the protectionist section of the Commission, that a duty of 4p per cent, be imposed, was based on the fact that there is adulteration of imported goods. HONORABLEMEMBERS:-Divid e ! f i r .

Ewing, T . T . The Treasurer is restive if there be any argument ; .but if we do not argue this question, what question are we to argue? Personally, I see no honouT in voting for a duty of 35 per cent. Representatives of the Labour Partv have gone all over Australia declaring that they are in favour of reducing the cost of the necessaries of l if e . I remind those honourable members that the goods under discussion cannot at present be' manufactured in Australia, and some years must elapse before the necessary machinery can be obtained. that it is because of the' great output in England that these goods-are supplied to us at present prices; and there is not theslightest doubt that, even if the duty weremade 60 per cent., the local manufacturers could not supply the demand. All thetalk about an export trade in this class of goods is beside the question. Every protectionist knows that it is impossible for usto go into the markets of the world andcompete successfully with older and better equipped and organized manufacturers.. I protest against the excessive duty proposed, and would rather walk out of the House than vote for 35 per cent., were it I not for the fact that these goods must beimported whatever the impost, and that I feel it incumbent on me to save the peoplefrom being robbed of even 5 per cent.

265,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I rose to point out, when item 106 was under consideration, that its wording is different from that adopted in the Tariff of 1902. In the Tariff of 1902 it was declared that the duty was not to apply to piece goods. I am suspicious of these alterations, because I find that the Minister wishes to bring piece goods within item 107, if cut into shape in any way.",42
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.7] - Piec e goods will be dealt with later, in a separate item - The interpretation on the words which I wish to insert will be that which was placed on the words in the Tariff of 1902.",42
267,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No , it is altogether a new arrangement. We are departing without explanation from the designations used in the Tariff of 1902, and we may find that very often, under the pretence of merely altering a heading, the incidence of the duty has been altered. It is due to the Committee that, when a change such as that' now proposed is in contemplation, we should have reasonable notice of it .",42

292,Mr GOON,Unknown,"Batman) [8.25.] - The constituents. strongest evidence in favour of this comes from New South Wales. Mr Henry on Shaw, cutter,' of Station-street, Harris Park, who appeared before the Commission, said, in reply to the question, increase of duty do you ask ?

301,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [8.31] - The honourable member for Batman quoted from the evidence of three witnesses before the Commission, namely, Mr. a Moore, Mr Blackman, and Mr Vicars. But I find that Mr Moore, according to the report of the Tariff Commission, said that his company had sent goods into Western Australia previous to Federation, paying the 15 per cent, duty then in existence.' per According to this, Mr Moore's company that had been able to compete successfully in 'the western State in spite of the duty. Mr. Vicars told the Commission that his comwas able to send goods into Victoria, acwhen the duty there was 25 per cent., and they had been able to compete success. full y . Mr Blackman told the Commission that his firm had sent goods into the Queensland market, under a duty of 15 per cent., and had done quite as much business in that State, under such conditions, as they were doing at present. The honourable member for Batman is mistaken when he says that these gentlemen would not be satisfied with anything under a duty of 50 per cent., because, as a matter of fact, they asked for no higher protection than that given under the Kingston Tariff. do not think that the honourable member for Batman intended in any way to mislead the Committee, but made a mistake in quoting from a paragraph which he had in his scrap-book.

I will not vote for the imposition of revenue duties upon articles which cannot be manufactured here._ I certainly think that duties of 30per cent, and 25 per try in this matter. cent, should not be levied upon articles such as towels, which are not made in the Commonwealth. So far we have never atis tempted to manufacture cotton goods. I monwealth. hope that the day will come when we shall manufacture them, but in the meantime we ought not to impose heavy revenue duties upon them.",46
305,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [8.50] - I should like to know what the Treasurer has to say in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra, who has invited him to reduce the duties upon this item. One who is so experienced a protectionist as the honourable member ought certainly to be able to impress his policy upon the Minister. I have received a communication from Messrs. Stirling and Company, .of Richmond, in reference to this item. (United After specifying a number of lines which cannot be manufactured in Australia for many years to come, they suggest that the WILLIAM LYNE) duty upon this item should be 5 per cent. Under the circumstances, the Treasurer might accept the advice of such a staunch protectionist as the honourable member for Yarra and reduce the duty to that rate.",46
306,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [8.52]. - Unles s the Treasurer is prepared to differentiate between some of the articles enumerated in this item, I feel disposed to vote against it in its entirety.

At the same time, I do not wish to do an injustice to industries which are carried on in Australia.

317,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [8.58] - I ' hope that the Treasurer, in fulfillin g his promise, will recollect that the effect of the proposed duties would have been to make towels cheaper. By placing them upon the free list he may increase their cost to the. consumer. I wish now to put in a plea for canvas water bags. These are used in the Australian bush by men wbose lives frequently depend upon their being able to obtain a supply of water. If towels are to be admitted free, why not water bags, which are used by our pioneers?",47

But I understand that hair curlers and wavers cannot be made in Australia, and, consequently, they ought to be placed upon the free list. Only - last week we had a strenuous fight as to whether sausage skins should be admitted free. I wish the people of Australia to understand that, although it is alleged that we cannot make these things, we can make electrical machinery of the most complicated type. The protectionists, as a rule, will take any fence. They say that everything known to civilization can be made in Australia but the honourable member for Yarra has to except towels and canvas water-bags.",47
321,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"He said, not that they cannot be, but that they are not, made here.",47

323,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [9.2] - Division V. of the old Tariff contains a number of exemptions, some of which seem to be covered by the exemptions enumerated here, while others do not.

336,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [9.14] - The honourable member for Fawkner askecJ me to move to make feathers, undressed, free. T understand that there is only one ostrich farm in the Commonwealth.",48
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; there are at least half a dozen.,48
338,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"In that case my information is at fault. The dressing of feathers in Australia is an art so'well understood that we have now quite a respectable export trade in dressed feathers. Remembering the conditions under whichwords ostrich feathers are grown in South Africa, and the cost of importing them, honourable members will see that ostrich farms in Australia will not be prejudiced if undressed 10 feathers are admitted duty free. Last 28 year the revenue from this duty was only ^524. The placing of this item on, the18 free list would stimulate the industry of dressing ostrich feathers, and would not AYES. affect ostrich farmers in Australia. I move That the words "" and on and after 7th November, 1907, free,"" be added. Sir WILLI AM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.16] - Unde r the preferential! Tariff agreement with South Africa, ostrich NOES. feathers coming from that country are dutiable at 10 per cent. That should largely remove the objection which the honourable member for Corangamite has to this duty.. The preference granted to South Africawould stand unless, with the consent of that country, we made an alteration in the agreement. I therefore hope that the honourable member will not press his amendment.",48
339,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.17] - This amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Corangamite on behalf-of the honourable member for Fawkner, in whose electorate there is a factory devoted to the dressing of ostrich feathers. It is interesting to observe that whilst a duty of 40 per cent, has been imposed upon apparel and attire-a n item of great concern to the masses of the community-the honourable member for Fawkner considers that ostrich feathers used for the personal adornment of those who could well afford to pay a high duty should come in free, because there is a feather-dressing industry in his constituency. I am going back on my free-trade principles to the extent of voting for a thumping big duty on this item. When I cannot induce the Committee to reduce a duty on some of the necessaries of life, I am not going to agree to such an item as th s being placed on the free list. This is a rattling revenue item.",48
340,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Las t year, under a duty of 15 per cent., a revenue of ,£524 was obtained from it.",49
341,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Then we should at least obtain the same revenue from the item.,49
342,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [9.19] - I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to. I should like the duty to be increased. If the old duty were increased, the feathers and down of our domestic birds, which are now being absolutely wasted, would be dressed and put to good use. We can grow good mutton, good poultry, and good feathers, and I am prepared to support any proposal by the honourable member for Dallev to impose a high duty on luxuries. Mr. JOSEPH COOK ' (Parramatta) [9.20] - I am inclined to think that by this time the honourable member for Corangamite, so far as his amendment is concerned, has not a feather to fly with. Having regard to the fact that we have just imposed duties of 30or 40 per cent, on some of the necessaries of life, I cannot work up any enthusiasm regarding a proposal to remove a duty of 15 per cent, on .ostrich feathers. I have risen for the purpose of asking the Treasurer what he proposes to do regarding the preference to South Africa in respect of ostrich feathers ? .Unless something be done we shall have to reduce the operation of the duty as against South Africa.",49
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No ; the cent, duty under the preferential arrangement with South Africa will take precedence of this item so far as imports from that country are concerned. There is a special provision in the arrangement with . South Africa.",49
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But this, being a later proposal, will alter it.",49
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It will not be disturbed.,49
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the Government will have to make some special provision for it.,49
347,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is not necessary to deal with it in connection with this item. We shall take care that the preference with South Africa is not disturbed. If necessary, we shall take action.",49
348,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [9.23] - I take it that there is in operation an Act of Parliament under which the duty on undressed feathers from South Africa will remain at 10 per cent., and that this item will not apply to feathers coming from ; that country. I am sorry to learn that the honourable member for Dalley would increase this duty, since I think that there is no virtue in taxing the people to a greater extent than is necessary for revenue purposes. At the same time, I recognise that the honourable member made a good point when he said that although wearing apparel, required by the poorest section of the community, had been taxed to the extent of 40 per cent - and I believe that that duty was imposed upon the recommendation of the honourable member for Corangamite - that honourable member now desires that ostrich feathers should be placed on the free list.",49
349,Mr WILSON,Unknown,I submitted the amendment on behalf of the honourable member for Fawkner.,49
350,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Corangamite dare not vote against what he has moved, although he has moved it on behalf of another honourable member. I am not going to allow the wealthy class to get off scot free, although the ardent protectionists are most anxious that they should do so. The special mission of those honourable members appears to be to tax heavily the wage-earner. I shall oppose the amendment. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [9.27] The question raised with regard to the preference to South Africa is well worthy of trie attention of the Treasurer. That preference when given overruled the then existing 10 per Tariff, as it was a later enactment of the Parliament, but the Bill which, will give effect to this Tariff will also be a new enactment, and will probably repeal by implication, so far as Australia is concerned, the arrangement made with South Africa . The Treasurer should see that a clause is introduced into the Bil l to preserve the rights of South Africa under the existing arrangement.",49
351,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.28] - There is a special Act containing the preference to South Africa. I am not a legal luminary, but the Customs Department hold that that Act must be specially repealed before this Tariff can interfere with it. It wall hold good and the duties will be collected without regard to the rates fixed for the item under consideration.",50
352,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [9.29]. - It is worth the Treasurer's while to look into the question of the South African preference. He did not seem to know- I do not blame him for it, because it is not his duty to become what he calls "" a legal luminary""-whethe r the Act dealing with that"" preference will apply to Tariff Acts passed subsequent to it. It is quite possible that it provides that whatever Tariff may be passed there shall be a preference, but if it refers to an item the rates on which are different in the United Kingdom and General Tariff columns, how will the South African preference apply? Will the preference be a reduction from the duty as against Great Britain, or a reduction from the duty as against the rest of the world?",50
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It will not be a reduction from either rate. It is a specific duty.,50
354,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Is it a specific duty on each item, irrespective of any Tariff passed?",50
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is a specific duty on this item, and I think it is on the others. Mr. JOSEPH iCOOK [9.31] - I see nothing in the South African Preference Act to preserve the preference after this schedule becomes law.",50
356,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I tained from the Comptroller-General his terpretation of the Act, and a statement how the Department is working with reper cent. gard to the South African preference. He understands the Act, and says that it not be interfered with, but, if it will discussion, I will undertake, if there is thing doubtful, to have it dealt with in Bill covering this schedule. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Nothin g unfavour usual may occur until the matter is put to the test. The Department would be justiSouth fied in collecting the duty until stopped from doing so. Some one may subsequently test the matter, and show that the whole thing is illegal. The necessary provision can be made to keep the South African preference alive when the Tariff Bill is before us.",50
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,If there is the slightest doubt I will undertake to have that done.,50
358,Mr JOHNS ON,Unknown,"Lang) [9.32] - I intend to vote for the amendment. It is true that the duties have been increased on articles of necessity used by the poorer classes, but that has not been the fault of free-traders like myself. If we had our way we would reduce the duties very much below anything that has been proposed even from this side. If reductions on a lower scale have not been proposed, it has only been because of the certainty that we could not carry them, and because of our desire not to waste time in. useless efforts. Those duties upon the necessaries of life and the clothing of the masses of the people have been imposed in spite of all our efforts as free-traders to have them reduced, and, I am sorry to say, mainly with the assistance of those who claim directly to represent the working classes. That, however, is no fault of ours. It is certainly no fault of mine, because I have done mv best to persuade the Committee to reduce the duties considerably. The fact that I have not been successful does not justify me in refusing to try to obtain the reduction of duties on other articles. Whenever I see an opportunity to vote for a reduction of duty, or to free some of the more common articles of daily necessity from duty altogether, I shall do so. Therefore, to be consistent with my principles, I propose to vote for the amend(Parramatta) ment.  derstand that this item is part of an arrangement with South Africa. have just ob- Sir WILLIAM LYNE - There is a preferinence arrangement with South Africa, under of which the duty on this item would be 10  will the duty was 15 per cent: on the raw mastop terial and 25 per cent, on the made-up anyarticle. Under the new 'Tariff, presuming the 'we get our feathers from South Africa, there will be a preference of 5 per cent, in of that country. What I desire to say. is that ostrich feathers represent another Australian industry. There are two or three large ostrich farms in South Australia, but the industry does not seem to have been considered when the agreement was made with South Africa..",50
359,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,If there had been a feather or two. in Queensland the Tariff would have been different.  have been different if there had been an ostrich farm in the constituency of the Minister.,51
360,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"There axe no ostrich farms in my district.  this agreement. would not have been made with South Africa. I desire the Treasurer to remember that South Australia is part the Commonwealth. However, I am not going to vote for a reduction of the duty.",51
361,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I am astonished.  ber may be astonished; but surely a duty of 5 per cent, is not too much couragement of the ostrich-feather industry. The only competition comes from South Africa, and there is a preference 10 per cent, in favour of that country. That, of course, reduces the protection to 5 per cent.",51
362,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"It is the other way about.  a difference of 5 per cent., and such a duty is certainly not extravagant, when we reforeign feathers at 15 per cent. member that on foodstuffs and apparel we have been imposing duties of 45 per cent., and some which really mean 300 per cent. over Great Britain. I shall take all the consequences and vote with the Government on this item.",51
363,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [9-38]-On this important question I have more or less misled. I find that a lot of ostriches have been hatched quite and trouble has been falling thick and fast about my head. The only honourable memthe ber I have to support me is the honourable member for Lang. The honourable member for Grey, who has been very consistent in his desire to lower duties, feels that on item he must vote with the Government. I Britain. cannot understand why the honourable member for Fawkner, and those interested the industry, desire to have this duty removed, because, as we are often told honourable members opposite,' a duty always lowers the price of an article. Under the preference. circumstances, in the interest of the manufacturer himself, I beg leavie the amendment.",51
364,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [9.40]. - I direct the attention of the Treasurer to Britain. a rather important point which arises when we compare the Tariff before us with the Customs Tariff Act, which gave a preference to South Africa. Under that Act it is provided that the rate of duty shall be 15 per cent., with a 5 per cent, preference to South Africa.",51
365,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That makes the duty 10 per cent, in the case of South fr ics",51
366,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Unde r the proposals with which we are dealing, both the general Tariff and the Tariff for the United Kingdom is 15 per cent. If the Act bears the same relation to the Tariff we are now of considering, as it bears to the Tariff of 1902, it means that we are giving South Africa a preference of 5 per cent, over Great Britain. I do not think that that is memthe intention of the Government.",51
367,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not think that for the enthat is the effect. 1,51
368,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Unde r the Customs Tariff Act a preference is given to of South Africa over Great Britain.,51
369,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I cannot see that.,51
370,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Accordin g to the Customs Tariff Act, there is a duty of 15 per cent, on undressed-feathers, but the duty in the case of feathers from South is Africa is only 10 per cent., whereas the Tariff now before us places both British and If the. . Customs Tariff Act hold good, South Africa will still have an advantage of 5 per cent, We must remember that this item is not confined to ostrich feathers, but extends to feathers of all kinds; and any feathers from Great Britain will been have to pay a duty of 15 per cent.",51
371,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"And so they do recently, under the old Tariff.",51
372,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Quite so; but attitude of the Government towards preference has changed since then.,51
373,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No .,51
374,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,In the old trlis Tariff there was no preference to Great,51
375,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The duty was 15 in per cent., at any rate.",51
376,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"But there was by no preference, whereas under the present Tariff the Government propose a system of",51
377,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Preferenc e is not to withdraw proposed under this item.,51
378,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,But South Africa is given a preference over Great - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The duty is exactly the same as before.,51
379,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Does the Treasurer wish to give that preference?,52
380,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,52
381,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"Oxley) [9-44]-- I think that a duty of 15 per cent, on undressed feathers is somewhat high, viewing the subject from the point of view of people who use these feathers as a raw material of their industry. Sir .WILLIAM LYNE - The duty is just the same as it was before.",52
382,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"The previous Tariff was not perfect by any means, and we ought to make an improvement in the case of the Tariff now before us. I hope that the - Treasurer will be prepared to accept an amendment to reduce the duty to 10 per cent.",52
383,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I cannot accept such an amendment.,52
384,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"That is to be regretted, because the importation of these feathers at a lower duty will be the means of giving employment. So far as I can see, the value of the feathers imported last year amounted to only ^3,816, in respect of which .£524 was naid in duty. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

387,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,How could we tell whether or not they were intended for purposes of adornment?,52
388,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I have chiefly in mind such articles as bedding, quilts, and gowns. I would point out that while it is proposed to charge 30 per cent, upon dressed feathers, cosies, which are made up from these very feathers, will, under item 118, be admitted at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. In other words, the raw material for the manufacture of cosies will be charged 30 per cent. I maintain that the raw material should not be dutiable at a heavier rate than the manufactured article - If honourable members will turn to item -118 they will see that cosies and cushions in part or wholly made up are subject to a duty of 25 per cent, under the. General Tariff, and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Consequently, if these articles are made in England, they will be admitted for 10 per cent, less than will the raw material. I therefore suggest the addition of the words "" feathers and downs other than for adornment.""",52
389,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Do not move in that direction.,52
390,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Perhaps before we are called-upon to deal with item 118, the . Treasurer will devise some means of meeting the difficulty which I have pointed out.",52

Item agreed to. .Item 1 la-Regalia , viz., Embroidery, Woven Sashes and Collars, free. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [10.0] I do not quite know what is intended to be implied by the - use of the word '""' embroidery,"" or what it is supposed to cover, but if its meaning is limited by the .words "" 'woven sashes and collars """,53
393,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No . It means the - embroidery which is worked on regalia.,53
394,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"I take it that as it is used the word refers to woven sashes and collars. If those articles are to be made free, why should not aprons be included in the item? I do not understand why anv of them should be made free. We are imposing very high duties on that clothing which is a necessity of every-'day life. I regard articles of NOES. xegalia as luxuries, more or less. A man who can afford to belong to a society whose members wear regalia must be in a position to pay a duty thereon equally with the man who has to pay a duty on the coat which he wears. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should impose a duty on articles of regalia, which can be manufactured in Australia as well as they can be made in any W - other country. A firm in Brisbane which has laid itself out to manufacture regalia of all kinds, even of the most elaborate character, has forwarded to me a specimen which I have within the building, and PAIRS. which has been seen by honourable members. One has' only to go up to the Women's Work Exhibition to see as fine'.embroidery of this .character as can be produced in anv part of the world.",53
395,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"If we struck out this item, then aregalia would be dutiable under item Mauger, S.. 108.",53

I cannot make that proposition to the ComThat the item be left out. 8 Mr BOWDEN - I rise to order. The effect of striking out this item will be to make regalia dutiable under another item, and therefore to increase the taxation. I desire., sir, to know whether the amendment is in order?",53
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I believe that two* rulings have been given to the effect that when an article is mentioned in the schedule of a Bill it is in the power of the Committee to increase or reduce the proposed duty. When the honourable member for Gwydir proposed to levy a duty oniron he was ruled out - of order by the Chairman, because iron was not mentioned, in the schedule.",53
398,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He oroposed to add the item to the schedule of the Bounties Bill.,53
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . When the point was referred to the 'House, Mr. Speaker said that, inasmuch as iron had . not been mentioned in the schedule of the Bill, he, in accordance with a previous ruling, could not permit the honourable member for Gwydir to propose a duty, but hedistinctly aidded that if the item had been mentioned it would have been competent for him to move an increase or a decreasein the duty proposed. I submit that, inaccordance with those precedents, the amendment is in order, inasmuch as the article is mentioned in the schedule.",53
400,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Throughout the consideration of the Tariff I have ruled against any honoraible member moving a direct increase in the duty on any item. I do not know whether the honourable member for Parramatta desires me to go through the various authorities I quoted on the last occasion. I still hold that it is only competent for a Minister of the Crown to move to increase a duty. If the Committee were to negative this item it would be practically increasing taxation ; but I have no power with reference to that. For a private member, however, to move that a duty be increased would be - distinctly out of order.",54
401,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I wish to ask you, for a further decision. As I understand your ruling, you hold that a Minister of the Crown can move to increase a duty, - but that a private member cannot. May I submit to you that the power of a Minister of the Crown in that respect does not arise from his being a Minister of the Crown, nor has he additional rights beyond those possessed by a private member. He simply acts under a Governor General's message, which, must be brought down preliminarily. Tf you admit, sir, that a Minister of the Crown can move to increase a duty without a Governor General's message, then I , as an ordinary member of this House, have equal rights.",54
402,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I cannot allow a - discussion upon my ruling. If the honourable member desires to challenge it he can move that it be disagreed with.,54
403,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I do not think that' the question involved is sufficiently vital, but if an occasion arises when such a ruling affects myself, I shall move that it be disagreed with.",54
404,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to remind you, sir, that a few days ago an honourable member wished to move an amendment, which, although it did not directly increase a duty, would in your opinion have had the same effect. I forget what the item under discussion was. So far as I recollect, the amendment moved was similar to that which is now being moved. I wish to inquire whether it is competent for an honourable member to move an'amendment which will indirectly have the effect of increasing taxation by putting an item under another heading wherethe proposed duty is higher.",54
405,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If a specific case is brought under my notice I shall give ruling, but I cannot rule on a hypothetical case.  to support the item before the Committee' for two reasons. In the first place, it Is about the only virtue which I can see in this Tariff. It affords one consolation for the poor, namely, that if they cannot afford to buy any other clothing they will know that sashes and collars are on the free list. Another reason why I support the item is that I am very suspicious of any proposition made by a Queensland representative. Whenever I see one of them supporting something I begin to think that there is something behind it - which is not apparent. I am inclined to believe that the honourable member for Brisbane has a sir, collar factory in his electorate.",54
406,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,They are in every capital.  possible for the honourable member to support any duty unless it affected his electorate. There is every reason for leaving these goods on the free-list. #,54
407,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Do I understand that the honourable member for Brisbane has been permitted to move his amendment?,54
408,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"It is useless to move such an amendment, because the honourable member can attain his object by voting against the item.",54
409,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,That is not ruling my amendment out of order. The question is whether it is out of order or not. Whether it is useless or not is quite another question.,54
410,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I have ruled that the honourable member's amendment is not in order. Amendment (by Mr BOWDEN) proposed - That the words "" and on and after 7th November, 1907, Aprons and Cuffs,"" be added.",54

So that collars will be free in any case under that interpretation.  exempting them and not aprons ?",54

413,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Collar s are manufactured in every town in the Commonwealth.,55
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Collar s for this purpose were free under the old Tariff.,55
415,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.15] - There is not much in this item one way or the other. The total quantity of regalia imported in the year, for which I have figures, was valued at only ^377. Those members of the community who are fond of adorning themselves in this way are well able to pay for their regalia. It is no hardship upon some worthy Grand Master of the Mudbucket, or something of that kind, to compel him to pay a good price for his - regalia. The Minister will be well advised in retaining the item as it stands. The honourable member for Grey is pleased that regalia is to be free, but he has not said a word about the aprons which are dutiable under another item.",55
416,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [10.16] I wish to say that, on behalf of the honourable member for Fawkner, I intend to propose the addition of the words "" clergymen's vestments and bannerettes."" I understand that these articles are not made within the Commonwealth.",55
417,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member can see specimens of them at the Women's Work Exhibition.,55
418,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I have been informed by the honourable member for Fawkner that these are special clerical vestments, which are not made here. I do not see why any exception should be taken to the addition of the words I propose, seeing that the total value of the imports under this item for 1906 amounted to only £377, and the total value of clergymen's vestments and bannerettes imported must be very small indeed.",55
419,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [10.19] - I intend to oppose the item altogether, as an intimation to the Minister that I am in favour of the imposition of a small duty on these articles. There are people in Australia making these collars, and they have to pay duty on the material which, they use in the manufacture, whilst the made-up articles receive no protection, and have to compete with imported articles of a similar character admitted free:",55

425,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I understand that jute bags are admitted free under item 114; but it seems to me that it might be well to put a small duty on them, to obtain their better inspection. Many of the bags which now come from Calcutta are practically worthless, as they will bear only one filling.",55

427,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"In my opinion, the departmental inspection is not sufficient. I have been in correspondence with the Department on the subject for some time, on behalf of the Victorian Producers' Association, and the matter has been dealt with in the commercial columns of the Age. A commercial and financial newspaper called Capital, published at Calcutta, has also referred to it. That paper, I understand, represents the more respectable traders and manufacturers connected with the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, and interested in the export of bags. They are desirous that the supervision should be stricter.",55
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is not necessary to impose a duty in order to obtain stricter supervision.,56
429,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"It has been argued that a duty on tea would have the effect of securing stricter supervision, and preventing the importation of tea of a bad quality, and the same argument must apply in this case. The Customs officer, seeing that an importation consists of bags, which he knows to be free of duty-man y other bags besides jute bags are imported duty freelets it pass.",56

As regards bran and chaff bags, my inforthe whole of the Commonwealth requirements in these lines are imported from ' Calcutta, and we have at present no chance of regaining the trade, which was. a very considerable one under the Queensland Tariff, of -15 per cent. During the years 1900 and 1901 we made and sold 324,000 bran and chaff bags under a 15 per cent, protection, while during a corresponding period of time since the duty was removed (the years 1902 and 1904) the total quantity made was only 4,180.",56

I endeavour to avoid anytiing of the kind; I try to look at every proposal from a national stand-point. It is scarcely fair to twit an honourable member with being a provincialist merely beciuse he advocates, as every honourable m mber ought to do, the encouragement of industries in Australia generally, and part cularly those in his own constituency.

449,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"They are compelled by "" restrictions imposed by special factory, legislation.""",57
450,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"We have very excellent factory legislation in Queensland, although we have no Wages Boards. The letter statesWhat we ask for is sufficient protection to enable us with white labour to hold our own against competitors in India, working as we do under the restriction imposed by special factory legislation and paying a living wage to our workers. Last year over 10,000,000 bran bags were imported, and if this small amount of protection we ask for was granted the whole of these could be made, within the Commonwealth, - giving employment to a large number of hands. The duty asked for would not interfere witn any export trade, as practically all the bran and chaff bags imported are used within the Commonwealth. We are not asking for a duty on corn and flour sacks, which would still come in duty free; but, having expended a considerable amount of money in equipping factories suitable for the manufacture of bran and chaff bags, we would respectfully urge our claim for protection. Ore Bags - The above remarks apply also to ore bags, but in this line we are under a very serious additional disadvantage, in that while the ore bags are admitted duty free the material from which they are made (jute niece goods) is. to excep- dutiable at the rate of 10 per cent.",57

453,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"I was not aware Coolie that that change was contemplatedThe only possible result of this anomaly is to the prohibit the trade altogether, as it penalizes the local manufacturer for the benefit of those in other parts of the world. We would strongly urge that our recommendation with regard to "" j u t e piece goods"" being admitted duty free be carried into effect, and also that a duty of 15 per cent, be imposed on ore bags. That is the same rate as they suggest on all other bags. I am on safe ground in i. to honourable members opposite who, like myself, are protectionists, to support this proposition. I see that these people did give evidence before the Tariff Commission. I move That the words "" bran, chaff,"" be left out.",57

Although there is no Wages Board for the bag-makers in Victoria, there is a Wages Board for others who do part of the work. The small flour bags made from calico have to be printed, and the printers must be paid the minimum wage provided under the Factories Act - The manufacturers of those bags have to pay a duty of 10 per cent, on their calico, but, according to this item, the finished article will be admitted free.",57
455,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Flou r bags are not free.,58
456,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Flou r sacks are free. I am given to understand that salt, gypsum, and manure bags, which have been added to the free list, were dutiable under the old Tariff. I trust that the Minister will be able to verify that information. If that be so, we are putting the bag manufacturers in a worse position than they, were in before.",58
457,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [10.53] - I hope that the Minister will not agree to the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra. I wish to draw his attention to the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. They say on page 245In Victoria the Cheetham Salt Company objected to the imposition of duty on salt bags, which they contended should be free. In South Australia the Castle Salt Company assumed the same attitude of opposition to any duty on salt bags, and their objections were supported by an Adelaide merchant, who said that not only salt, but gypsum or manure bags should be admitted free. A flour miller in Hobart objected to the taxation of small flour, oatmeal, and pearl barley bags. The Chamber of Mines in Western Australia objected to all duties on bags and sacks used in connection with mining. The general manager of the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company Limited asked for the remission of the duty on calico bags. The Chairman of the Commission sums up as followsI am of opinion that a sufficiently strong case has not been presented to us in support of the proposed removal of bags, sacks, packs, and bales for bran, chaff, compressed fodder, potato, onion, ore, coal, and wood, and corn and flour sacks from the free list. I recomfnend(1) That salt, gypsum, and manure bags be added to the free list; (2) That, subject to the free list, the duty on hessian bags be increased from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent., and that hessian in the piece be free as at present;. (3) That the duty on calico bags, subject to the free list, be 10 per cent, clear; that, in order to secure this, the manufacturers be entitled to receive their calico piece goods free, provided that the cutting be done in bond, and that, if this be not practicable or desirable, the import duty on calico bags be raised from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent. In view of the very careful inquiries and the findings of, not the free-trade, but the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, I hope the Treasurer will stand by his proposal. Sir WILLIAM LYNE"" (Hume-Trea surer) [10.55] - I cannot understand why some honourable members oppose the proposed alteration. Bran and chaff bags are not made here in anything like sufficient quantities to meet the large demand, and to impose a duty would be to inflict a direct charge on the farmer.

462,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is very difficult to extend the benefits of protection to miners, but I think that in the case of ore bags we might afford some advantage by making them available as cheaply as possible.",58
463,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [11.0] - I am in favour of a light duty on the whole of the commodities embraced within this item. If we except one commodity, we ought to except the whole of them. If bran and chaff bags are to be excepted because they are in such large demand, I think a similar reason might be urged for the exception of the manure bags, seeing that without manure we might have no chaff or bran. In some countries manure is carried freie on the railways for the sake of the revenue returned from the carriage of the harvestI desire to be a consistent protectionist, and, therefore, I would support a light duty on every commodity which can be manufactured within the Commonwealth. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [11.i] I have a sort of feeling, in' view of the present attitude of the Treasurer, that I have been, as it were, "" had."" I do not impute any deliberate intention on the part of the Treasurer, but my proposal was to omit bran and chaff bags, and bags for ore, salt, gypsum, and manure.

465,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"The only point urged by the Treasurer was that, the demember mand for bran and chaff bags could not overtaken by the local supply, and that, therefore, importations must continue. I regard to the other classes of bags, that gument does not apply, because it is perBrisbane fectly certain that they can be manufacproposal. tured here. I was surprised to hear the Treasurer say, "" Hear, hear"" to the sugthing gestion of the honourable member for DarI ling that the duty on all bags would increase the price.",59
466,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"What ""Hear, hear"" to was the statement that large quantities of ore bags are required. ' Colonel FOXTON - Surely the resurer) sources of Australia are equal to supplying the demand for ore bags, and, under circumstances, I hope the Treasurer agree to the amendment. Mr THOMAS BROWN [11.3] - I could understand the honourable member for Brisbane moving the omission o£ sugar mats, but certainly not the sion of ore bags. The latter are used by wealth. men who do not get anything like the protection which is enjoyed by those engaged in the sugar industry.
