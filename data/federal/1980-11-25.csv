7,Mr JOHN MCLEAY ,MRSPEAKER,"Boothby) (11.50)-Mr it is a very great honour and privilege to nominate the right honourable member for Bruce ( Sir Billy Snedden) as Speaker of this House. We been friends for very many years and I trust will continue to be friends for very many more On my count, this year he joins three other members of this House who have served the Parfor 25 years. They are the right honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the present Prime Minister; the right honourable member for Lowe ( Sir William MCMahon), a former Prime Minister and, dare I say it, a computer beater; and the Minister for Defence ( Mr Kilien), the honourable member for Moreton, who sometimes chooses to call himself the member for Mortein. The right honourable gentleman whom I have nominated has served place for a very long period and has served it well. He was appointed Attorney-General in 1964 and served in that office for two years. It was ing that term that I met him, although he will remember the occasion.",12

9,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,MRSPEAKER,"There is nothing like unconscious humour, even in this place. Attorney-General, the right honourable gentlemembers man had the job of selling the trade practices legislation. Mr Barry Jones-What did he get for it?",13
10,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,MRSPEAKER,"He did very went round Australia. I think he was underpaid, as are all Ministers still. He called on businesses and business associations. That first. He had the job of selling the trade practices legislation. I did not really agree with any of and subsequently I had the chance to say so in this place; but, as all honourable members will know, that does not necessarily make He steered it through very well, and, as honourable members know, it is now law. That was in 1964, the first time we met. In 1966 he became Minister for Immigration. That was the year in which I came to this place- a vintage year, if may say so, for those who have survived. I quite a bit to do with him then because I became chairman of the Government members immiwill gration committee. During the last year for he held that portfolio some 180,000 migrants came to this country, mostly from Britain Europe. 1 would like again to see the day when the same number will come to this country. Mr Barry Jones-You are not doing anything to help. You are going the other way.",13
11,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,MRSPEAKER,"I have done my share. I have produced three-mor e than the honourable member has. Subsequently Sir Billy Snedden was appointed Leader of the House on two separate occasions- a position he occupied forfiveyears. He was appointed Minister for Labour and the National Service in 1969. That was, I would think, probably the most difficult portfolio that he held. It presented the twin problems of dealing with dustrial relations and dealing with national sertive. vice during the time of the Vietnam war. In his last two years as a member of the then Governassociated ment he was Treasurer. In 1972 he went into opassist position, as unfortunately we all did. He knows what it is like to be in opposition. Some of us this side still remember also. We hope that it not happen again. The right honourable gentleable man was Leader of the Opposition for most of the period during which the coalition parties were opposition. I think every one of my colleagues agree with me when I say that, very much on durown, he rejuvenated and helped back into businot ness not only the Parliamentary Liberal Party in opposition but also the Liberal Party organisation.",13

17,Mr SCHOLES ,MRSPEAKER,"Corio) (11.55)-It is my privilege to nominate the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) for the position of Speaker. I That position is not one which is relevant to how had well an honourable member has performed in government or how well an honourable member serve the interests of a government; it is one which which is relevant to how well an honourable member will perform the duties of representing and and speaking on behalf of the Parliamentspecifically, the House of Representatives. It is not my intention to comment on the other candidate but merely to support the candidature of the honourable member I have nominated. The honourable member for Scullin has had wide experience in parliamentary matters. Because of his fairness and objectivity, I believe he has the respect of every member of this chamber. He has served in the position of Chairman of Committees and for a significant period he was Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. He has served this country at a variety of representative functions inand has served this Parliament as its representaNotably, he has participated in parliamentary seminars and other parliamentary functions with the work this Parliament does to the smaller parliaments both inside and outside our region. He is a person who I believe on could-and will, if supported by this chamberdoes give service as Speaker which would be acceptand which would do honour to the position of Speaker and to the chamber. There are two candiin dates and therefore the House must choose bewill tween them. I propose that the interests of the his House and the interests of parliament in this country would be done a service if the House determined to choose the honourable member for Scullin as its Speaker in this Parliament.",13
18,Mr MACKENZIE ,MRSPEAKER,"Calare) (11.58)-It is an honour and a privilege for me to second the nomination by the honourable member for Boothby ( Mr John MCLeay) of the right honourable member for Bruce ( Sir Billy Snedden) to occupy the Speaker's chair in this chamber. I do so following in the footsteps of Mr Sam Calder who, honourable members will recall, seconded the nomination at the beginning of the previous Parliament. I think all honourable members would agree that his name is remembered very fondly in this chamber. New members of this House may not be aware that this is one of the few opportunities in this Parliament for honourable members to speak without fear of being told that they are out of order, or being stood down, warned or named. I will resist the temptation to prove the untested and probably fearsome powers of the Clerk. To second the nomination is indeed a pleasure because, as we would all agree, Sir Billy's record over the last five years has been quite outstanding. He has been remarkably successful in maintaining order and decorum in this chamber without constraining the rights of members. Honourable members may be interested to know that in the last five years there were only five occasions on which the Speaker suspended a member of this chamber.",14
19,Mr COHEN ,MRSPEAKER,All from this side.,14
20,Mr MACKENZIE,MRSPEAKER,"The fact that they have all come from one side of the chamber is the fault not of the Speaker but of honourable members from that side. He has maintained the decorum and dignity of this place. I believe that we should congratulate Sir Billy. We should, indeed, ensure his election to this high office. I also mention that Sir Billy Snedden has introduced or proposed some reforms for the Parliament which I think are of significance. We have seen a great improvement in the parliamentary committees. We know that Sir Billy has proposed that the Westminster convention regarding the independence of the Speaker be adopted in this place. I welcome also his suggestions that portions of the proceedings of Parliament be televised. I think that too often the public at large is not fully aware of the activities undertaken by its elected members and leaders in the Parliament. I believe that if direct television broadcasts of the proceedings of this place were provided members of the public would be in much better position to make an informed assessment of how their elected representatives perform and they would get a much better indication of how the Parliament operates. Mr Clerk, no greater accolade can be paid to a Speaker than that paid to Sir Billy by the Speaker of the mother of parliaments, the House of Commons, the Right Honourable George Thomas, who said only recently: ' Sir Billy is a giant amongst Commonwealth Speakers'. It is my pleasure to second the motion.",14
21,Mr KERIN ,MRSPEAKER,"Werriwa) (12.3)- I am very pleased to support the motion of my colleague the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) that the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) be Speaker. The electorate of Scullin is named after a distinguished Australian and it is represented by a distinguished Australian. I think the qualities needed for a Speaker are those of dignity, impartiality, consistency and control. Dr Harry Jenkins has exhibited those qualities in the times he has acted as Deputy Chairman of Committees, particularly when he was Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees in 1975. Dr Jenkins was elected to the Victorian Parliament in 1961 and was elected to this Parliament in 1969. Before he entered parliament he had a distinguished academic and professional career. In the parliaments of Victoria and the Commonwealth he has been a distinguished parliamentarian. He has had wide committee service. He was Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. He was the first chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. As a Deputy Chairman of Committees he has been associated with the legislation committees that were introduced during the last Parliament. He has exhibited fairness, consistency and impartiality every time he has been in the chair. As I said, he always exerts control; he has the respect of all members of this House. I can think of no better person to recommend to the honourable members assembled than Dr Harry Jenkins, the honourable member for Scullin.",14
22,The Clerk,MRSPEAKER,"In accordance with the Standing Order, the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. The bells having been rung and a ballot having been takenMONICA",14
23,The Clerk,MRSPEAKER,"The result of the ballot is: Dr Jenkins, 51 votes; Sir Billy Snedden, 73 votes. Sir Billy Snedden is declared elected.",14
24,Mr SPEAKER ,MRSPEAKER,Rt Hon. Sir Billy Snedden) - I thank the House for the great honour it does me. I hope I will serve the House as well as the House expects of me. Mr Speaker having seated himself in the chair,14
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,MRSPEAKER,"Wannon-Prime Minister)- Mr Speaker, I would like to offer congratulations on your re-election as Speaker. Through your years as Speaker of this House you have maintained the high standards of the office and you have done much to introduce initiatives. You have enhanced the office since you have been in that position, sir. I am quite sure that all honourable members will make a resolution for themselves that in the forthcoming Parliament they will assist you to maintain the dignity and courtesy of the Parliament. I hope that, with the resolution all honourable members will make for themselves, some of us at least will assist you in that endeavour a little more than we might have in the past Parliament. I think those of us who sit under your care and guardianship need to understand that it is we who sometimes make it difficult for you. It is the interaction of Speaker and members of parliament that will decide what reputation this institution has in the general public outside. It very important, I believe and the Government believes, that the general reputation of parliament as an institution for debate and exchange of ideas be improved and enhanced. I hope that through this Parliament we can collectively make a greater contribution to that objective than we might have in the past. Mr Speaker, I think you can be deservedly and justifiably proud of the reputation that you have earned for yourself as Speaker. I know that you carry the good wishes of all members of the Parliament through the coming term.",15
26,Mr HAYDEN ,MRSPEAKER,"Oxley-Leade r of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition, I offer my congratulations. You have taken out the hat trick-thir d time in a row. You commence this third parliamentary term with the cordial good wishes of the Opposition. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) was large enough to confess that there were members on his side of the House who could have been more helpful to you in the past. 1 congratulate him on making that confession. Let me assure you too, Mr Speaker, that we on our side of the House will do whatever we can to make your life easier-certainl y more interesting-and to help you perform your duties on behalf of the members of the Parliament. Your election today, of course, was quite convincing. I must acknowledge also that the majority has been substantially reduced as against the last two occasions. I note that that also happened in your electorate. Mr Speaker, you will celebrate a quarter of a century of service to this Parliament and to this nation this coming December. On that we all congratulate you. Quickly, as a gloss, 1 will run through some of your achievements. You have been a law student-yo u achieved that not according to the easy path-legal practitioner, conveyancer, parliamentarian, Attorney-General, Minister for Immigration, Minister for Labour, Treasurer, Leader of the House of Representatives, Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party, Leader of the Opposition once removed, Speaker and industrial advocate, knight the of the realm-and this is, of course, in ascending order-bo n vivant, international traveller and family man. It is a long and varied career. Many would wish to achieve it; few have the opportunity of doing so. Congratulations. I repeat that by this December you will have achieved a quarter of a century of public service. Of course it is your duty to clothe the office you occupy with dignity, and to add to its authority and the authority and prestige of the Parliament. is In spite of the odd difference which has erupted between us from time to time- I confess that in case it has not been noted-w e recognise your diligent efforts to achieve those things. Of course we will assist wherever we can. You have striven hard. It is not always an easy role to fulfil, certainly to the satisfaction of all members of the Parliament. But as I have acknowledged on previous occasions in this Parliament, when some rather harsh things have been said by commentators about some of the more passionate behaviour in this institution, it is a very important exercise nonetheless because it is a sort of safety valve. It allows pressure to be released within our system in a fairly healthy way. I suggest that it is far better than throwing bricks or bombs. Overall, the democratic institution functions in a fairly healthy manner in Australia. I gather from some of your observations that you have sought to emulate the proceedings and standards of the House of Commons. 1 hope 1 understand you correctly. If so, I would like to make the observation, and I do this with good will, that in your efforts to tidy up procedures in this institution- I acknowledge that there is room for tidying up from time to time-perhap s there has been a bit too much tightening up. If I may give a commercial for that non-commercial broadcasting organisation, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I have noted from its program AM that the broadcast of proceedings, and more specifically Question Time, in the House of Commons seems to show more latitude in the presentation of a question by a member of the Opposition; that is, the injection of some descriptive background in presenting the question. I believe that is essential because as things stand now there is a very uneven set of conditions applying at Question Time in that if, with the authority that rests with you, the question being put is stringently regulated according to Standing Orders - as you have properly pointed out, you follow the Standing Orders, you do not make them; it is up to the House to change them-and a Minister can enter upon a rather rambling and sometimes, would you believe it, not terribly relevant discourse in a somewhat provocative way that leads to tensions in the Parliament. I think they could be avoided with just a little more latitude. I do not want to make it sound easy. I repeat that it can be difficult at times. For all our differences, you have displayed a great deal of dignity in the way in which you have sought to conduct the affairs of the House. There will be differences between us. I remind you of a point I mentioned earlier: The expression of differences is an important safety valve within the institution. You commence your third term with the good will of the Opposition.",15
27,Mr ANTHONY ,MRSPEAKER,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Resources)- Mr Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues of the National Country Party and as a colleague of yours and a friend of long standing I would like to congratulate you on being re-elected to the high position of Speaker of this Parliament. For five years you have held that position and through that period you have brought great distinction to the office of Speaker and you have brought great credit to yourself. You have handled the task with commanding authority and with very great dignity. At all times you have been fair, unbiased and impartial. Indeed, a few of us would think that at times you have probably been too fair and too impartial. Your having been elected for the third time shows the very great respect and high regard that your colleagues have for you and the way in which you have handled this position. I can give you an assurance that my colleagues will continue to co-operate with you and support you in your difficult task. Acknowledging the position of Speaker and respecting it are probably paramount in the successful working of this Parliament.",16
28,Dr JENKINS ,MRSPEAKER,"Scullin)- Mr Speaker, may I convey my personal congratulations to you on your re-election to the office of Speaker. I know you look forward with pleasure to the Parliament which is now commencing. I know also that we share a common respect for the role of Speaker in the Parliament, something which, I am sure, at times is not understood by all honourable members. We respect it, not because of the trappings but because the office, properly conducted, does allow members on both sides of Parliament to discuss in a proper and easy way the business that is before them. I do not think it is realised how much tolerance and good common sense is needed in the chair to ensure that result. You, sir, are supported by a Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker and deputy chairmen of committees. I sometimes wonder whether we should not give the Speaker a discretion, when he needs relief in the chair, to appoint any member of the House to the chair for that temporary period. „ Then, perhaps, that member would experience the importance of the position in allowing discussion. Mr Speaker, in congratulating you I also point out that I regret that in some ways the Australian Parliament has become so bogged down in this adversary principle as far as the presiding officers are concerned. In politics, the adversary principle is not a bad thing but one of the problems when we apply it to parliamentary presiding officers is that it seems to cut off some of those improvements that could occur in parliamentary procedures if the Speaker had greater discretions with regard to matters of relevance and questions and a whole host of things. While you have been Speaker, sir, we have seen a number of improvements in the parliamentary committee system. That system is showing an all too slow evolution but I believe some interesting things have happened. I congratulate you, Mr Speaker. I wish you well in your office as Speaker in the term of this Parliament.",16
29,Mr GILES ,MRSPEAKER,"Wakefield)- Mr Speaker, may I very briefly join with other members and offer my congratulations to you, as indeed I did on another occasion. I suppose that in some ways the Thirtyfirst Parliament was not an easy parliament for you. There was a very lopsided balance of numbers in the House and I am quite sure that any Speaker in the position would have allowed as much licence as reasonably possible to members of the Opposition. I think that is right and proper. Now that the imbalance has been partially restored in a parliamentary sense, much though I regret it in the party sense, I am sure that this will be a very different House and indubitably a more vital House than the previous one. Mr Speaker, your record of wisdom, tolerance and patience has not been exceeded in my experience in this House over some years and I congratulate you very much on it. I think it has been apparent to all members of this House over past years that those qualities have been discernible in their application, to the great benefit of ing of this chamber. On occasion-and this is particularly so prior to elections-thos e of us who have a love of the institution of Parliament have seen it used as a whipping horse for party political purposes. I do not think there is any solution to this. I guess it will always happen. Nevertheless, I hope that over the ensuing period members will remember, as their tempers tend to rise, that they are only passing actors on the scene of parliament and that the institution will remain. I hope that on those occasions members of this Parliament will help you, Mr Speaker, and will remember that we have within the Standing Orders of this House freedoms which in many ways are incomparable. I hope, sir, that members of the Opposition will do as I am sure members on this side of this House will do; that is, make your job much easier over the next three years.",16
30,Mr SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"I would like to say a few words to the House. Firstly, I thank all members for their kind words to me and for the friendship which I have received. I thank especially the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) with whom I have formed a very close personal affinity, as he knows. Of course, I thank my friend the honourable member for Boothby, Jack MCLeay. His family and mine have become close friends. It was a pleasure for me to have him propose me for the occupancy of this chair. I also thank the honourable member for Calare ( Mr MACKenzie) who I know was a close friend of the person who seconded my nomination on the last occasion, that is, Sam Calder who is now no longer in the House. I thank the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the words he used. I appreciate them. Mr Charles Jones-Don' t turn your back on him.",17
31,Mr SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"The honourable member will remain silent. I remind the House that the reforms which have occurred over the last five years, which have not so far been terribly great but which are a major advance, could not have occurred without the support of the majority in the Parliament and its leader, the Prime Minister. I thank also my colleague and friend the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) with whom I had the honour to serve for many years, as I did with the Prime Minister and other members on the front bench whom I see now. I am very greatly pleased that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) has spoken in the way in which he has. I share many of the thoughts that he has expressed. I would also like him to know that I feel towards him a very considerable sense of friendship. 1 apthe work- preciate very much what he has said. I believe the Standing Orders are in need of considerable revision. I hope that the Standing Orders Committee will apply itself to this task. I will press the Leader of the House ( Mr Sinclair) and the Manager of Opposition Business to apply themselves to that matter. I believe it is important to try to mitigate, if it is not possible to eliminate, the use of quorums and divisions as a tactic of ambush by one party against the other party. Mr Innes-What about the gag?",17
32,Mr SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"The tactic is used on both sides. It is that tactic which produces bad tempers. It produces, from action, reaction. It is when the House is stimulated into anger by the use of those tactics that the public, hearing the broadcast of the proceedings, wonders whether we in the national Parliament are conducting ourselves as we ought. The two devices to which I referred were divisions and quorums. I heard an interjection-no t suprisingly from the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Innes)-'What about the gag?'. Of course, I covered the use of the term 'gag' when I referred to divisions. It is a curiosity indeed that the people of Australia can hear a Minister in the House of Commons deliver an answer or hear a question asked and yet they cannot hear a question and answer in the national Parliament. For instance, on the morning program AM one frequently hears a question by a member of the Commons and the answer by a Minister. Under the provisions of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act that cannot be done here. I think we ought to examine the practice in this Parliament to see whether we can emulate it. I hope that in this Parliament we will find debate as strong as we would wish and that that debate can be pursued with strength, vigour, passion and complete conviction, without its carrying innuendoes against any other member of the House. Within this Parliament I have always believed that it is the function of the member to speak the truth and to demand the truth. I hope that that will be done fearlessly in the future, as it has been in the past. I wish to see the adoption of the Westminster convention of continuity of the Speaker. By that convention the Speaker withdraws totally from membership of any party. He is not opposed in his electorate. His going back into the chair after an election is not contested. This is no great privilege for the Speaker because he must undertake in return that in no circumstances will he belong to a party, that in no circumstances will he engage in any public controversy, that when he leaves the chair he will resign from the Parliament and that outside the Parliament he will accept no appointment which it is within the power of government to make or to influence. Such a man or woman who forwent the prospects of the future in that way would undoubtedly attract from all members of the House total confidence in his or her impartiality, fairness and willingness to act at all times on behalf of all members of the Parliament. When that convention is adopted, as I believe it will be- I hope sooner rather than later- I do not wish to be considered for the position because I cannot both advocate a change and appear to be the beneficiary of it. But while we have our present system I wish to assure all honourable members that it will be my intention, and I hope my achievement, to be impartial, to maintain my independence and to act and speak at all times on behalf of all members. I thank the House. NA GOVERNOR-GENERAL",17

42,Mr SPEAKER,COUNTRY PART Y OF AUSTRALI A,"I have to report that the House this day attended His Excellency the Governor General in the Senate chamber when His Excellency was pleased to make a Speech to both Houses of the Parliament. The Speech will included in Hansard for record purposes. The Speech read asfollowsSenators and Members of the House of This 32nd Parliament assembles following a election in which the people of Australia have again returned my Government with a subOpposition stantial majority. My Government regards this manifestation of the people's choice as a mandate to maintain the basic thrust of the policies which have been followed over the past five years. These policies are designed to work for the well-being of all Australians and to develop a society which maximises the rewards of individual effort and initiative, and which also respects the right of individuals to shape their own lives. The Government's program is set out comprehensively in the policy speech which the Prime Minister delivered to the nation on 30 September of this year and in the supplementary statements which accompanied that speech. My Government is committed to the whole of that program and will work with determination to implement it as fully and rapidly as possible. 1 emphasise this because in this speech I shall focus on some of the key elements of that program rather than merely recite the whole of it in bald form. The fact that I do so should not be employment. interpreted as meaning that areas not mentioned by me are in any way downgraded my Government. A selection is made in order to keep the speech within reasonable limits, but program stands in its entirety. Unemployment and Youth The first element of that program to which wish to draw particular attention is the it contains for overcoming unemployment in general and particularly for stimulating the employaging ment of youth. This is placed first because of great importance my Government attaches to it. In recent years, and for a number of reasons, the question of jobs for young people has emerged as a crucial one, not only in Australia but in tually all Western countries. It economic problem but a social one. Indeed, for the young people involved and their families it is major psychological and human problem. My Government believes that the long-term solution to it undoubtedly lies in the creation of new jobs by restoring healthy economic growth, and in this respect Australia is much better placed than many other industrial countries. Over the next few years, resources and manufacturing development projects will certainly create tens thousands of new jobs. But the matter cannot be left there, has not set been left there, and will not be left there. During the last five years over half a million Australians have received specific help through my Government's manpower and training and programs. Nearly another quarter million will repayers ceive assistance during this year. My Government has a clear and firm commitpublic ment to youth, exemplified by its announcement of new initiatives, including the introduction of a new allowance to encourage young unemployed persons to take advantage of training opportuniwhich ties, the expansion of its work experience programs and the provision of improved counGovernment's selling services. All of these initiatives will be in place February next year. During 1981 my Government will take action to place increased emphasis on employment and training schemes. A framework is being established within which the Government's training programs will provide a wide range of incentives and allowances to increase the supply of skills required for economic development, and to assist the unemployed, particularly the young and disadvantaged, to obtain or discarded by The Economy I turn now to the economic policies of my the Government. These policies are determined by and given coherence by an economic strategy which is designed to restore economic stability and improve growth within a medium term I framework. Sudden large changes in economic provision policies will continue to be avoided. This strategy has already resulted in an encourpick-up in activity and employment and a the marked strengthening in business investment. There is, however, a continued need for the firm application of consistent policies to reduce infiation and to allow our national resources to be viremployed in areas where the highest economic reis not only an turn can be obtained. A primary objective of my Government will be a to continue thefightagainst inflation. Inflation results in fewer jobs and lower living standards for everybody. Firm anti-inflationary fiscal and monetary policies are therefore essential to any lasting solution to the problems of unemployment, the achieving of higher growth and the more rapid raising of living standards, on a sustainable basis. My Government believes that there is no reof alistic alternative to such policies, and that alternative policies, including those which are inappropriately described as stimulatory, would back the economic recovery now under way and create renewed uncertainty. My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector to increasing the freedom of choice of taxin spending their own incomes. It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain expenditure so as to provide scope for reducing the burden of taxation. Improved private sector growth will require further improvements in business profitability, still provides insufficient incentive to increased investment in many industries. My policies will, therefore, seek to contain wage increases in the short term, in the by interests of expanding aggregate employment and income over the medium term. Private sector growth is dependent on secure supplies of energy. My Government will continue to pursue this objective by allowing the price of liquid fuels in particular to reflect so far as possible the operation of market forces. This policy is encouraging the development of a diversified energy base, which will minimise Australia's reliance on imported liquid fuels, and is helping to conserve scarce Australian energy resources for future generations. My Government's economic policies have considerably improved Australia's international competitiveness and enhanced export opportunities for Australian industries. A sustained lift in exports and a higher level of capital inflow will increase Australia's capacity to import and to undergo the structural changes which allow economic growth to build upon itself as resources move to areas of higher profitability. My Government will encourage this process within an economic environment in which industry can invest for the future with confidence. In the context of the economy, my Government wishes to make a simple but vital philosophical point. Discussion of the economy and of economic policy has become so abstract, so specialised, so dominated by statistics and rarefied concepts that the connection between it and the lives of ordinary people is in danger of being obscured if not lost sight of altogether. It is essential that it be understood that economics and people are linked, that economic policy must serve human objectives and that the discussion be conducted in such a way that it becomes clear that what are being talked about are the jobs, incomes, assets and prospects of men and women. My Government will make a serious effort to give a lead in this respect, recognising that continuing public understanding and support are vital to the success of its policies, not least in the contribution they can make to the urgent task of improving industrial relations in this country. Caringfor People In what I have said about unemployment, youth and the economy, I have stressed my Government's concern with the human dimensions of the issues involved. It only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology, not the strengthening of the state, but the effectiveness of policy in enhancing the lives of people. This is the fundamental concern of my Government. This concern expresses itself in a diverse range of measures to which my Government is maintain committed: It is evident in the commitment of my Government to a range of social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and through it the basic social fabric of this country. My Government has already introduced a number of measures designed to assist families. It will be looking closely at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. It is evident in programs to subsidise accommodation for aged persons, to assist homeless persons, to assist low or moderate income earners in house purchasing, and in the strong commitment made by my Government to welfare housing. It is evident in the programs developed in the context of the International Year of Disabled Persons 1981 to assist the education of severely handicapped children and to increase employment opportunities for the disabled. It is evident in the commitment to improve aboriginal health standards. It is evident in the area of ethnic affairs, in the commitment to provide services both to help migrants adjust to life in Australia and to help them to maintain in Australia the cultural heritages of the countries from which they came. It is evident in the commitment to encourage excellence in a number offields-for example, to provide greater support and improved facilities for research, to encourage the arts and to provide greater opportunity for young Australian athletes. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. My Government sets it out to establish that it cares deeply about the quality of life lived in Australia and that it is determined to give practical expression to that care. In doing so, my Government's objective will be not to increase long-term dependence on the Government, but, consistent with its liberal philosophy, to provide the means whereby people can become more independent and freer to choose the lives they want to live. believes that the The Public Service I have mentioned the liberal philosophy of my that Government. My Government wishes it to be clearly understood that it is in terms of that philosophy that it approaches the questions of growth in Government expenditure, in the public sector, and in the size of the Public Service. Its concern to strict control over that growth is not based on any animus against the Public Service, lt does not subscribe to the crude and usually uninformed hostility towards that Service which sometimes receives popular expression. It recognises and appreciates the contribution which the Public Service as a whole makes to the life of this country. But my Government does believe profoundly that it is vitally important that the power and functions of the State should be limited and contained. It does believe that the State is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and that many services can be better supplied in other ways. And it does believe that the expansion of private enterprise is the best means to achieve the well-being and health of a society. For these reasons, my Government recently announced the establishment of a Committee of Senior Ministers to review the functions of all Commonwealth Departments and associated agencies. The review will recommend to the Government which functions might be reduced, eliminated or altered so as to achieve a more efficient and economical administration. The review will also examine areas where Commonwealth activities overlap with those of the States or unnecessarily intrude into areas of activity capable of being performed efficiently by the private sector. The review is part of a continuing process of restraint on the public sector which has been maintained since my Government came to office. In that period the number of Commonwealth employees in areas subject to staff ceilings has been reduced by over 10,000. This has been achieved without weakening those areas of the administration where there are special needs. In fact, the numbers employed by the Department of Social Security have actually increased by 3,000 in the last five years, and the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service has grown by about 1,000 in the same period. My Government will continue to ensure that Commonwealth activities are concentrated in areas of greatest need and that the adequacy of those services, appropriately provided by the Commonwealth, is maintained. Foreign Affairs and Defence The last area of policy to which I shall refer that of Foreign Affairs and Defence. The past year has seen a significant of international tension and uncertainty. While we must hope that it turns out to be mistaken, it must be recognised that the consensus of informed opinion, at present, is that the period enment compassed by the life of this Parliament is likely to be a troubled and tense one in international affairs. The foreign policy priorities of my Government are clear. It is very conscious of the need for a strong and united Western stance towards the Soviet Union and to this end it will work to maintain its already strong ties with its traditional allies, and in particular with the United States. It should be clearly understood that it will do so out of an appreciation of Australia's needs and interests and for no other reason. Beyond this my Government will concentrate its efforts heavily within the region, broadly defined, and on the Commonwealth of Nations. Through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting, my Government has succeeded in linking these two areas of interest in a new and advantageous way-and of linking both in turn with our interest in Third World matters. Australia has been chosen as host of the 1981 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This will be the largest and most important international conference ever to have been held in this country. It will take place at a time when discussions of north/south issues will be receiving a new impetus and it should be able to make a valuable contribution to the discussion of those issues. In the present state of international tension, my Government is mindful that its first responsibility is the nation's security and it has taken appropriate steps to enhance Australia's defence preparedness. The 1980-81 Budget provides for a real increase in defence spending of about 7 per cent. Further substantial real increases in resources are planned in the years to 1984-85 by which time defence expenditure is expected to have risen to about 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. My Government believes that it is imperative that Australia should move to improve its defence self-reliance and should play its part in strengthening the international forces working for stability at the global and regional levels. Conclusion I have outlined important parts of my Government's program and policies for the next three years. In doing so I have made some passing referis ences to the beliefs which provide the underlying rationale of these policies and give them heightening coherence. My Government believes that this-a n explanation to the Australian people of the ideas, principles and values in terms of which the Governof the day shapes its policies-is something which has been somewhat neglected in Australia and that this neglect has diminished the quality of political life of the country. It believes that this should be remedied. During the life of this Parliament, therefore, my Government will be making a serious and sustained effort to explain to the Australian people the philosophy on which it bases its approach to governing- a philosophy which it sees as liberal in its principles,flexibleand undogmatic in its application of those principles to the realities of Australian life and conservative in its distrust of abrupt and sweeping changes as a means of achieving desired ends. EmptyHere Mr Speaker, Members of the House of Representatives I now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the Australian people.

50,Mr LUSHER ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Hume) (5.2)- Mr Speaker, it is an honour for me to nominate the honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr Clarrie Millar, as the Chairman of Committees in this Thirty-second Parliament. This is a position of great responsibility in the Parliament and Mr Millar has demontrated, over the last three years, that he has all the attributes necessary to carry out the duties of this high office. He brings dignity and impartiality to the Chair and maintains its authority without the threat of the exercise of the powers available to him. Mr Millar is a completely conscientious chairman, dedicated to the service of this House. His knowledge of the Standing Orders is prodigous and he has developed a style which balances authority with good humour and which has bought him the respect of all honourable members in this chamber. When the National County Party submitted the nomination of Mr Millar to this House on 21 February 1978 it was natural that honourable members should have reserved their decisions on the capacity of one so inexperienced. With the passage of three years there is now no doubt about his capacity. In fact it is now difficult to imagine another member who could match Clarrie Millar's performance in the chair. Speaking on his do re- acceptance of this office three years ago, Mr Millar said that he had come to this Parliament to serve this House and the nation and by electing him to this high office the House gave him an opportunity to serve in a capacity given to few COMMITEES others. Mr Speaker, the position of Chairman of Committees has a long and distinguished history. It was established by the House of Commons in an effort to resolve conflict between the King and the Parliament on money matters. In 1853 the Chairman of Committees became the Deputy Speaker. In fact in 1855 an Act was passed in the House of Commons conferring all of the powers of the Speaker on his deputy in the absence of the Speaker. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the job that has been done by Mr Millar in his capacity as Chairman of Committees and Acting Speaker over the last three years is without equal. I also have no doubt that he will continue in that position to distinguish himself and to bring honour to this House during the term of Parliament which is ahead of us.",23
51,Mr LES JOHNSON ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Hughes) (5.4)-It is my pleasure to speak in support of the nomination of my colleague, Mr Armitage, the honourable member for Chifley. Mr Armitage is certainly no novice to parliamentary affairs, since he was first elected in 1961 and has been re-elected on six other occasions. In a very significant career in private life he has served on the administrative staff of the Reserve Bank of Australia and as a senior officer of the New South Wales Department of Decentralisation. In 1965 he achieved political notoriety when he was elected Deputy General Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party. He served in that capacity for four years. He has had other service as well that distinguishes him. For example, he was a member of the Citizen Military Forces and of the Second Australian Imperial Force for four years; he has travelled on portant parliamentary missions to the Middle East, United Kingdom, China and Japan; he has had extensive committee experience which involves four years' experience on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and he has also served on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Library Committee; and he has had other responsibilities of that kind. He is Chairman of Labor's great and powerful Economic Committee. In every sense he is a complete parliamentarian. He is a vigorous debater and is unrelenting in his pursuit of tax dodgers. It is often said of him that he is one man whom the Prime Minister ( Mr here Malcolm Fraser) would prefer to avoid in debate. Yet he has also been able to demonstrate his supporting. impartiality when he occupies the position of Deputy Chairman of Committees. He has, in fact, been a Deputy Chairman of Committees since 1970. He has held that position for more than years. One can say that that is a double apprenticeship, a post-graduate degree in tact, tolerance, understanding and the art of chairmanship. obviously an extremely accomplished parliamenyears. tarian. He has chaired Estimates committees and legislation committees and despite the strength his political conviction, he has always been cable in his impartiality when occupying the chair. I contend that he would dignify the office Chairman of Committees and I believe his elected appointment would embellish the parliamentary institution. I have much pleasure in advocating vote for John Armitage, the member for Chifley.",23
52,Mr DOBIE ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Cook) (5.8)- Mr Speaker, lars simply and sincerely I stand to support the nomibreakthrough. nation of Percival Clarence Millar the member for Wide Bay, as Chairman of Committees of this House in the ensuing Parliament. The honourable member for Wide Bay does not need to have promises made about his performance in this House. Since 21 February 1978 he has, in fact, performed his duties as Chairman of Committees with a rare distinction. As one who was privileged in the last Parliament to serve as one of his ties, I believe the House should be told not only of his capacity in the chair in this chamber, which should have been obvious to all, but also of his administrative ability and capacity in making certain that the chair was occupied appropriately at all times. I wonder whether the House is aware to what extent the administration of the chair is a formidable task. Clarrie Millar- I seek your indulgence in describing him so, Mr SPEAKER - is a man who came into Parliament with a real mission. He came in with distinction, as was evidenced by his contribution to the debate with im- regard to the Fraser Island dispute which reigned in this House when he first came here. Despite his vigorous party political attitude on this subject, when he occupied the chair as Chairman of Committees he executed his duties with a fairness and an impartiality which had the respect of us all. Mr Speaker, the Parliamentary Handbook tells us the history of this man in parliament. I shall not go through that again, except to say that the House will be richer if Clarrie Millar can serve as Chairman of Committees in this place for the ensuing Thirty-second Parliament. It is with great pride and with a great deal of pleasure that I stand to support him. It is a fact that this is one Lusher motion which I have no doubt about",24
53,Mr LES MCMAHON ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Sydney) (5.10)- I am very honoured and proud to second the motion 10 moved by the honourable member for Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson) for the appointment of Mr John Armitage as Chairman of Committees. I He is have known John Armitage for more than 20 No one else in this Parliament surpasses his impartiality when presiding over parliamentary of debates. John Armitage has a long history as a impecmember of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales. He was first elected to this Parliaof ment in 1961, was defeated in 1963 and was rein 1969. He is a reformer. I remember that he had discussions with you, Mr Speaker, on dress a reforms for honourable members in this House. He tried to change the rules governing dress to allow members to wear safari suits instead of coland ties. You, Mr Speaker, agreed. That was a In other words, he is a person who gives us change. If this afternoon every honourable member were able to have a conscience vote for the person who he thinks would do a good job I know that everyone would vote for the honourable member for Chifley. But we are caught up in the party machines on both sides. However, sometimes honourable members are allowed to register a conscience vote. It would be lovely if that hapdepupened today. We could share some of the jobs.",24
54,Mr COHEN ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,We would do it.,24
55,Mr LES MCMAHON,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Yes , we would do it if we were given permission. I know that John Armitage has the necessary capability and would like to be the Chairman of Committees. Without elaborating I support what the honourable member for Hughes stated. The record of John Armitage in this Parliament indicates that he would be fair and give every honourable member a fair go. One of his attributes is that he is a good Australian. I hope that honourable members will give John Armitage their vote for the position of Chairman of Committees. If honourable members' consciences were their guide, I know they would give John Armitage their support.",25

Mr Speaker, this morning, comments were made about the role that you have played and will continue to play over the life of this Parliament in maintaining the dignity of the Parliament and in improving and enhancing its public image as an institution. But you, course, need to be backed by a chairman and deputy chairmen of committees who, under your guidance, will make sure that the Parliament appropriately guided and assisted in those times when you are absent from the chair. The Chairman of Committees has a very nificant role to play in the whole institution and am quite sure that the honourable member has the good wishes of the whole Parliament in the duties that will be in front of him. He has demonmittees strated a very considerable capacity to carry those responsibilities with all those attributes which are necessary for chairmen of this first Parliament-dignity , impartiality and, occasionago ally, a degree of gentle firmness which has proved to be necessary. I offer him my warmest congratuany lations and those of the Government and best to wishes for the years ahead.",25
60,Mr HAYDEN ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Oxley-Leade r of the Opposition)-On behalf of the Opposition I extend congratulations to the honourable member for Wide Bay ( Mr Millar) on his election as Chairman of Committees. It is often a testing task and often the Parliament decides to test the incumbent of the office; I expect that things will not be different in the course of this three-year term. However, the office does call for skills, competence, firmness, good humour and a sense of what the Parliament is about and where it should be going. Overriding all that, of course, is a commitment to impartiality in the application of the appropriate standing orders of the Parliament. Those are things which, in the past, the honourmember has sought to achieve in the discharge of hiq office when he has been occupying the chairmanship of this Parliament. I look forward, as do all members of the Opposition, to his similarly contributing as best he can in that reand seeking to improve the performance of the Parliament by the quality of what he contributes in the chair over the three years of this new parliamentary term. I repeat that the honourable member has the good wishes and congratulations of the Opposition.",25

On behalf of his party colleagues I would like to congratulate him. when there is a coalition government the position of Chairman of Committees goes to a member of the National Country Party; therefore, we look with a great deal of pride on the person who is elected to this position. During the past three years the honourable member for of Wide Bay has proved his worth as Chairman of Committees. He has shown a great deal of capacity and skill. We wish him well in the continuis ing position that he holds.",25
62,Mr ARMITAGE ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Chifley)- I would like to sigcongratulate the honourable member for Wide I Bay, Clarrie Millar, on his election as Chairman of Committees. 1I have worked with him for the last three years as a deputy chairman of comand I can say that undoubtedly he is a perout son who is very easy to work with and one who has effectively organised the job. When he was elected Chairman of Committees three years I think we all wondered how he would perform. He was new in the job and he had not had experience in it. Without a doubt he brought the position a great deal of capacity. He fitted into it very quickly and became a very effective Chairman of Committees with great capacity. I give him my most sincere congratulations. He might be interested to know that the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party yesterday elected the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones), the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) and me to the panel Deputy Chairmen of Committees from this side of the House. I am quite sure that this will be of some assistance to him. We will be able to tutor some of the rather raw Deputy Chairmen of ComTo mittees from the Government side of the House. ition Nevertheless, I congratulate the honourable showeth member most sincerely on his election.",25
63,Mr MILLAR ,ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF,"Wide Bay)- I thank the House has been for the confidence that it has shown in me.

(b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without growers and consumers. (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats. 2. Recognise that maintenance of (he genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands. 3.

97,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Wannon-Prime Minister)-Honourable members will know that Library; a short while ago the Right Honourable Sir John MCEwen died. I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 20 November 1980 of the Right Honourable Sir John MCEwen, G.C.M.G., a member of this House for the Divisions of Echuca from 1934 to 1937, Indi from 1937 to 1949 and Murray from 1949 to 1971, Leader of the National Country Party for 13 years, a Minister of the Crown for 24 years and Prime Minister of Australia for a short period at the end of 1967: places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of this House will join me in paying tribute to a great Australian. Sir John MCEwen gave many years of dedicated and distinguished service to this country. He was born in Victoria in 1900. He entered this Parliament at the age of 34 as the member for Echuca. From 1937 to 1949 he the Presiding Officers as joint represented Indi. From 1949 until his retirement in 1971 he was the member for Murray. His 36 years of parliamentary service included membership of several parliamentary committees, including the Bankruptcy Legislation Committee in the 1930s, the Australian Advisory War Council during the war years and the Standing Orders Committee from 1962 to 1971. He became Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party in 1943 and remained so until he became Leader in 1958, the position he held until his retirement in 1971. His ability was recognised early in the ParliaAustralia. ment. In 1937 after only three years in the Parcoalition liament he was appointed to his first post, Minister for the Interior, which he held for one and a half years. His first reaction to getting that post was a typical one and different from which could be expected now. I am advised that as Minister for the Interior responsible for Northern Territory and Aboriginals he camped out and moved around the Northern Territory for six weeks with his permanent head to learn somepart thing of his responsibilities. In these times would move more easily and more quickly but maybe get a not so good understanding of the responsibilities and problems that had to be faced. His next post, that of Minister for External Affairs, he held for seven months during the early months of World War II in 1940. In 1940 he was appointed Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation and held those portfolios for a year until the defeat in Parliament of the Fadden Ministry. On the election of the first post-war Menzies istry in 1949 he became Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, a portfolio he held until 1956, when it was renamed Trade. He held the portfolio of Trade from 1956 to 1963 and the portfolio Trade and Industry from then until his resignation from Parliament in 1971. Following the disappearance of Prime Minister Harold Holt in December 1967 Mr MCEwen, as he then was, was sworn in as Prime Minister for a short period. Thereafter he continued to serve as Deputy Prime Minister until his retirement in 1971. But this list of achievements, impressive as it is, is only a part of the MCEwen story. He was a man who towered physically and politically above many of his contemporaries. His political career from its very beginning bore the hallmarks of a man who, once he believed in a cause, would back his judgment to the hilt. For example, at the time of his first election to this House in 1934 as member for Echuca the Victorian Country Party was in open conflict with the Federal Country Party Leader, Earle Page. It demanded that all its candidates sign a pledge to refuse to support a coalition Federal Government or to take part in a coalition ministry without its approval. John MCEwen signed the pledge, as I am advised, won the seat but quickly realised the necessity for an anti-socialist coalition. In 1937 he became a Minister. He was consequently expelled from the Victorian Country Party for refusing to resign from the Lyons-Page Government. The Victorian Country Party remained in turmoil for a while but it was a further mark ofhis leadership that he subsequently re-united that party and committed that party to the support of the coalition which was then recognised to be in the interests of all of He remained firmly committed to the cause- a cause, I might add, which is as ministerial important today as it ever was. When one rises in this place to mourn the passthat ing and honour the memory of a member of this House one cannot help but search for a word or a the phrase which encapsulates that person's character. In Sir John MCEwen's case one word immediately springs to mind and it tells a large of the MCEwen story: That word is determiwe nation. As a young man during the Depression when others turned away from the land he was determined to turn his soldier settlement grant at Stanhope into a first class property and he did. He also recognised that governments had a role to play. He soon became involved in industry politics and later in national politics. As a member of the Parliament he was determined that his own constituents would receive the best representation possible. They acknowledged his ability by supMinporting him for 36 years. As a Minister of the Crown in successive coalition governments he was determined to put Australia first. His 21 years as Minister for Trade and Industry, as the portfolio subsequently became known, bear witness to his breadth of vision and to his capacity as a politician. During a period when Australia's economy was broadening he developed the trade and industry portfolio, establishing close contacts with leaders in primary and secondary industries. He was convinced that Australia needed strong, broadly based manufacturing industry and he dedicated himself to achieving that goal. As Minister for Trade and Industry he had the responsibility of reconciling what many people saw as contradictions inherent in the portfolio-the need for protection, as it was then seen, to develop local manufacturing against the free trade favoured by rural and mining interests. That he reconciled those differences in accordance with the times is further testimony to his own political skills. To some it might seem ironic that a leading Country Party member should devote so much of his parliamentary life to encouraging and supporting Australian manufacturing industry, but that was the mark of a man who was dedicated to Australia as a whole. Under his stewardship Australian manufacturing industry developed more than it probably has under any other single Minister, and for that Australia needs to be grateful. However, Sir John felt that he attained one of his greatest achievements-and I think it is an achievement about which history will record he may well have been right-when , for a short time as Minister for External Affairs in the wartime Menzies coalition ministry, he foresaw the danger to Australia should the Axis powers gain a base in New Caledonia and the Pacific. Working with other allied leaders he was foremost amongst those who successfully sought to deny the Axis powers that important location and a base in the Pacific. It might have made a very considerable difference to the subsequent history of the war and it could well have made an even greater difference to the part that Australia was able to play in the war if the Axis powers had gained a base and a significant military installation in Caledonia. Sir John's service to this country ited only to service while he was in government. During his years in opposition he was a member of the Australian Advisory War Council but it was upon the Menzies coalition's return to government in 1949 that Sir John MCEwen began his long association with trade and industry, an association that will long be remembered. Sir John MCEwen was a great Australian. His long and distinguished service was acknowledged through the honours that were awarded to him. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1963, a Companion of Honour in 1969 and just before his retirement he was created a Knight Grant Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. Sir John retired from the Parliament and the Ministry in January 1971. I was honoured and privileged to serve liament with him and to serve in government with him. There was much that all members who served in the Parliament during his time could learn from him. And he was a good friend. I am sure all honourable members will join me in offering our deepest sympathy to Lady MCEwen. The National Country Party, this Parliament and all Australians share her loss.",35
98,Mr HAYDEN ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Oxley-Leade r of the years Opposition)-Thre e great statesmen have spite moulded the fabric and guided the destinies of National Country Party over 60 years-Earl e Page, Arthur Fadden and John MCEwen. It is largely through the efforts of these three men the party remains a forceful and viable influence on contemporary Australian politics. I doubt whether any three other Australian politicians have attracted such a fund of anecdotes, perhaps even from time to time influenced in the telling, 1 suspect, by some rather free-flowing hyperbole; but for all that, fascinating stories. Doc Page and Artie Fadden have become mythicalfiguresin Australia's political folk lore. I have no doubt that Black Jack MCEwen, as he was widely and affectionately known, will join them in a legendary trinity as part of Australian political history. John MCEwen was born with the century and his long and distinguished career reflects many of the turbulent currents which have swirled through Australian public life. A boy of extremely humble circumstances, he became a highly successful farmer and gradually built a great public career-on e of the most colourful and distinguished in the history of the Australian Commonwealth. His career spanned the 40 central years of the Country Party's 60-year history in national politics. He was appointed to the Lyons Ministry when he was a relatively young man of New 37 and thereafter he was always close to the centre of the Australian government as Minister, party leader, Acting Prime Minister and, all too was not limbriefly, Prime Minister. The Australian Labor Party recalls with appreciation his very close association with the Curtin Ministry through the Australian Advisory War Council. During the 1950s and 1960s he was closely identified with the development of trade and commercial policy. I would like to record an observation similar to that made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his comments; namely, that it is a testament to Sir John's remarkable political agility that he was able to build a highly protected Australian industrial sector while retaining the loyalty and largely satisfying the aspirations of a demanding rural constituency. I know of no greater example of political adroitin the Par- ness in our political history. John MCEwen's life, despite its distinction, was not without its disappointments. He waited much longer for leadership of his party than might have been expected, given his qualities. An unswerving loyalty to the minority party meant that our nation's highest political office was withheld, except in a transitory sense. Even given this, his career remains one of the most refulgent in the 80 record of the Australian Parliament. Dehis austere demeanour, Sir John was a man the of great personal warmth and accessibility. Members of the Australian Labor Party recall this great and redoubtable Australian with respect that and affection. I am honoured to place on record today our thanks for the long and distinguished services to Australia of John MCEwen. On behalf of the Opposition, I place on record our sincere condolences at the passing of a distinguished Australian.",37
99,Mr ANTHONY ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Resources)-This is a specially sad occasion for me and my colleagues in the National Country Party. I thank the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) for their very kind and sincere remarks about my former leader. We mourn the passing of a man who was, to all of us, a giant, and to a number of us almost a father-and certainly a political father. If it can be said that any of us in this party know something of the art of politics, of the duties, the sacrifices, the responsibilities, the challenges and the fascination of politics, it can also be said that we learned those things from a master practitioner in John MCEwen. MCEwen was a strong man. He was at times a hard, tough and demanding man. He had a commanding presence, a personality of great force. He was a man of integrity and a man of honour. He was a powerful negotiator. He was a persuasive advocate. He knew how to put his views and to win his arguments. His toughness and his resilience came, perhaps, from the hardships he endured as a child and as a young man. He had lost both his parents by the time he was seven. He was earning his own living at 13. He joined the Army at 18, shortly before the First World War ended. As a soldier settler, it has been recorded that his only assets, apart from 80 acres in the Goulburn Valley, were a horse, a cart, 50 shillings, good health and a determination to succeed. In politics John MCEwen always made sure that he had the fullest information about the matresponse ters he dealt with. He put enormous effort into his speeches and into the preparation of material that he used in the House, in Cabinet and in negoParty tiations. When he was Minister for the Interior the 1930s, as the Prime Minister mentioned, he toured the Northern Territory by horse, camel, truck and aircraft. He visited the Ord and Kimand berley regions decades before anyone thought the great developments that were to occur John MCEwen once admitted, when asked, that he would have liked to have been Prime Minister. He said honestly that he sure would have liked that, but also said that he had been unwilling make the sacrifice of his political independence that such a step would have required of the leader of a minority party. His partnership with and his loyalty to Sir Robert Menzies made, I believe, of the most successful and significant combiister nations that have ever existed on the Australian political scene. In 1921 John MCEwen was married, but never had a family. His wife, Annie, worked with him through all those early years. In the early part of the Second World War, when he was Minister for Air, his wife set up a program in Melbourne to help young airmen in transit. Many is the time the MCEwen flat in Melbourne was jammed with young airmen sleeping onfloorsor anywhere else they could find space. Mrs MCEwen also did great work in helping to care for the wives of Australian airmen serving overseas. In fact, it was very much as a consequence of the sacrifices she made at that time, during the war years, that her health deteriorated, and that she suffered so much serious illness after the war until her death in 1967, by which time she had been made Dame Anne MCEwen in recognition of her wonderful public service. The resolution and determination which John MCEwen displayed as a young man were seen by many of us in later years. He had the capacity to devise policies and the personal strength of character and the determination tofightfor those policies and to see them put into practice. He had the character and strength that allowed him to do things others would not even try to do. I recall one day in the House when he was asked a long question about a very sensitive personal and political dispute he was involved in at the time. The House was hushed as the question was asked and there was a great air of expectation and tension while we waited to hear the answer. But MCEwen simply ignored the question. He did not even move in his seat. He treated the question with complete contempt, stared straight ahead and said nothing. In the end, the Speaker was required to call on the next question. In its way, MCEwen's was of the kind that only he could give. In the 60 year history of the National Country there have been only four leaders. Those in four leaders have been Sir Earle Page, who served for 18 years, Sir Arthur Fadden who served for 17 years, Sir John MCEwen who served for 13 years, myself. So far I have had the job only for a of mere 10 years. Page, Fadden and MCEwen-al l of there. whom have now passed on-were towers of strength around which the Party grew and carried on its work on behalf of all Australians, but mainly on behalf of country people. But, to more to recent generations, it was the name of John MCEwen that most clearly symbolised the Party's post-war work, and the growth of Australia's export industries in the 1950s and 1960s. When I one succeeded him as Leader of the Party and as Minfor Trade and Industry in 1971,1 found that everywhere I went in the world the name MCEwen was respected, trusted and admired. He formulated the policies and led the battle to change attitudes so that Australia could become an even greater trading and industrialised nation after the war than it had been earlier. In Japan a few years ago, my hosts proudly showed me a plaque on a wall of an hotel and a photograph commemorating the signing in that hotel in 1957 of the first trade agreement between Japan and Australia. That historic agreement provided the formal basis-the framework-for the massive trade growth between Australia and Japan in the years that followed. That agreement stands, along with many similar treaties, as a landmark, a testimony, to John MCEwen's enormous influence on the development of Australia's trade, and Australia's influence and respect in the world. John MCEwen's energies and determination were devoted, over virtually the whole of his life, to meeting the needs of Australia's primary producers. He saw very clearly their importance to Australia's economic well-being, and he fought on their behalf with tremendous vigour and success. It would take far too long to detail the things he achieved but I will quickly run through a brief He negotiated international trade agreements with Japan, with New Zealand-the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement was his-wit h Britain and a host of other countries. He negotiated the international commodity agreements for wheat, sugar and dairy products and the industry stabilisation schemes which have given great stability and strength to so many of our rural industries. He worked for many years to help put Australia's wool industry on the sound and secure footing that it enjoys today. He negotiated the subsidies and bounties that have proved to be so valuable to our rural industries. He negotiated emergency aid in times of disaster, devaluation compensation, complex multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva, fuel freight subsidies, the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, and realistic taxation concessions for rural interests. He negotiated money for beef roads- I was with him in 1961 at Windorah in western Queensland when he conceived this idea-and money for water projects for rural research. He negotiated probate concessions, achieved export incentives, led the fight against agricultural protectionism and secured the entry of Australian flag vessels in the container trade. These are just a few of his achievements, in partnership with his ministerial colleagues of both parties. We remember the fight he led on behalf of Australia's primary producers at the time when Britain was negotiating to join the Common Market. We remember the fight he led to ensure that Australia's farmers suffered the minimum possible loss from that historic and most significant event. John MCEwen never opposed Britain's entry to the Common Market. He sought rather to ensure that our access to an enlarged Market was in accord with the international commitments that had already been accepted by all the parties concerned. But do not let anyone think that John MCEwen's concerns were only for the interests of farmers, as important as those interests were and are. He had a wide-ranging view of, and concern for, the interests of all Australians. Nowhere was his concern stronger than in his commitment to keep Australia secure through strong defences and strong alliances. In many respects, John MCEwen was more commercially and private enterprise oriented than most in the various coalition governments he served. Although he was leader of a party strongly committed to serving the interests of the rural community, he will be remembered in history as the man who did perhaps more than any other to list. encourage the development of manufacturing in this country. He put the Australian Trade Commissioner Service on a firm footing, with its members drawn in the main from experienced businessmen. He constantly advocated that only with growth could Australia sustain its living standards, employment and security. He developed a continuing basis of co-operation with all sectorsrural and industrial. For instance, the Manufacturing Industry Council provided the basis for developing policies covering monetary, fiscal and tariff measures designed to achieve, and achieving in his time, sound growth and prosperity. This was similarly the case with the Export Development Council which grew out of his understanding of the needs of business. He was the first to perceive that the importance of the United Kingdom as a trading partner must decline and the first to see the opportunity and advantage of establishing a partnership with Japan. He did this at a time when feeling against Japan was extremely strong. He knew that trade, not just aid, was important for the developing countries, and conceived, against the opposition of all industrialised members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the first system of tariff preferences for less developed countries. John MCEwen was a great nationalist. He conceived the Australian Industry Development Corporation as a body complementing existing financial institutions and designed to assist industry and development and, to the degree possible, Australian ownership of that development. Mr Speaker, I have spoken of loyalty. If we want to see the loyalty John MCEwen could command, the respect and affection he could earn and the service he could inspire, we need look no further than the people who, over the years, served on his personal staff. Some have passed on. Others who are still with us no doubt would like, if they could, to pay their own tribute to their old boss whom they admired and loved. I cannot possibly remember or mention all of them, but let me refer to just a few of the longest serving ones. In earlier days, there was Ray Gullick, who was John MCEwen's campaign manager for his first election and who served him over many years. There was Leo Maroney, Ken MCKernan and Fred Schwinghammer. There was Fiona O'Connor, who worked for John MCEwen for something like 25 years. There was the late Maureen O'Dea, whom we remember with affection. There was Bill Carew, who was one of his Press secretaries and who served him over a number of years. There was also Margot Girle, who now is on the staff of my colleague the Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt). Those are just a few of the many people who loyally served John MCEwen and Australia. Of course there was Mary Byrne. Mary Byrne worked for John MCEwen for, I think, about 14 or 15 years. Today, as Lady MCEwen, she mourns the passing of a husband she loved and admired and whom she cared for with tremendous devotion. To Mary-Lad y MCEwen-ou r sympathy and love go out today. Of course there are many people around that Australia today who worked for John cies, MCEwen-as personal staff and as departmental officers. I think of the fruitful relationship tween Sir John Crawford and John MCEwen; beannual tween Sir Alan Westerman and John MCEwentwo examples which, I think, deserve special mention. There are legions of other people today into throughout the Commonwealth Public Service cated activity, and throughout Australian commerce and indusmill or try who are products of what might be called the MCEwen era. They, too, have been saddened by of the passing of their old chief. The Public Service Australians, and other great areas of Australian life have been tralians made richer by their work and by the inspiration mostly which John MCEwen was able to give, through we them, to others. Mr Speaker, John MCEwen House stands in Canberra as a practical, working memorial to this great man. The real memorial to John MCEwen is to be seen in the nature of Australia today: A great trading nation, a respected nation, a secure nation, a nation whose primary producers have secure, stable markets and strong domestic industry marketing arrangements-primar y producers whose importance and contribution to the well-being of the nation are understood. John MCEwen was not just a politician or a political leader, but a statesman. He looked like a statesman. He behaved like a statesman. He spoke like a statesman. He had a statesman's bearing. He was a statesman. Above all, he was an Australian, and Australia was the better for his presence.",38
100,Mr UREN ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Reid)- I join the three leaders in paying respects to John MCEwen. I can think of no conservative member of this Parliament whom I have respected more in the 22 years that 1I have been a member of this place than John MCEwen. As has been said, he was a great Australian. He was also a great nationalist. I want to comment only on two brief aspects of his career. I refer firstly to his contribution to the creation of a diverse manufacturing base in Australia. John MCEwen experienced the Depression of the 1930s. He knew what unemployment was all about. He believed that we really needed a diverse manufacturing base for the employment of the Australian work force, and he committed himself to bringing about that situation. The other aspect about which MCEwen was concerned was the sell out of Australian resources and their takeover by foreign investment. As Leader of the Country Party, John MCEwen spoke on many occasions contrary to the policies of the coalition government of those days. When questioned about this inconsistency, he would say he spoke always according to his party's polias leader of the party, but when he came into the ranks of government he had to adhere to begovernment policy. Speaking in 1963 to the conference of the Victorian branch of the Country Party, John MCEwen said: There has been an increasing tendency Tor capital to How Australia, not to establish some new and highly complibut to come into buy out an Australian flour an Australian dairy factory, sometimes a co-operative. I make it quite clear that I can't welcome the transference ownership to overseas people of these simple foodprocessing activities, which have been actually established by and in many cases successfully operated by Ausfor more than half a century. We in this room are established farmers. If we earn enough annual income, can live by selling a bit of the farm each year, and that is pretty much the Australian situation-w e are not earning enough, and we are selling a bit of our heritage each year. That was said 17 years ago, and all of us in this Parliament know that we have sold our heritage bit by bit every year. There are two ways for a country to be conquered. One is by military means and the other is by economic means. John MCEwen foresaw that we could lose our sovereignty by economic means, and that is why he stood firmly by his principles. He was a skilled politician. It was said by the leader of my party that although John MCEwen represented rural interests, and in most cases rural interests wanted free trade, he was able to build up that diverse manufacturing base. What is the situation under the present leadership? The present leadership of the party which MCEwen lead so successfully has built up an alliance with the rural and mining sectors, and I might say that it is to the detriment of the small farmer and the small manufacturing sector. That is the sad thing about the Country Party sell out of MCEwenism. John MCEwen was not only a great political leader but also a great Australian. I am very pleased to be able to pay tribute to such a great man.",40
101,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Lowe)- I thought for a long time about whether I should say something about John MCEwen because the previous speeches have been rather long. I was associated with him longer than anyone else in this House and I knew him probably better than anyone else here, too. Many of the things which happened between us are matters of recird. Many of them are recorded in Alan Reid's book. Shortly after I became a member of the Menzies Cabinet I became a very firm friend of John MCEwen. We would go to the theatre together, talk together and play billiards, which I had never played before. There was nothing we would not do if we could find amusement and, above all, if we could find opportunities we would talk together about the world's problems. I shall never forget him. He earned my respect the hard way. He had that until the day he left Parliament and he retained it afterwards. I well remember him during my years in the Menzies Cabinet. In the first place, he asked me on two occasions whether I would be his represenagreement. tative when he went overseas. In fact, one such period was six months. It was divided by two weeks in the middle. That in itself shows friendship that existed between us. He came to me on one occasion and said that he did not want remain with the Department of Commerce and with Agriculture. He wanted something that permit him to spread his wings and to do the kinds of things that would expend the energy, of which he had an abundance. I remember suggesting that he look at placitum (i.) of section 51 of the Constitution. I said: 'John, would it not be better if you took over Trade and Commerce together? Trade would give you a wonderful opportunity see the world and to be able to exercise your influence on behalf of Australia. Secondly, Commanent merce would mean that you would probably responsibility for the banking community together with other commercial areas such as retail trade'. When he was ill I played an important part in forming what became the Department of Trade. We had a lot of difficulties in that respect because Sir John Crawford had one kind of view and the gentleman who acted in his position while he was away took a totally different one. Sir John MCEwen asked me whether I would become the Minister for Primary Industry. I said that I would provided that I remained in the Cabinet. He confirmed that, as did Harold Holt and Eric Harrison. From then on I struck trouble. I mention two examples tonight, particularly because the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) is in the chamber. While Sir John MCEwen was away when I was Minister for Primary Industry I decided that as we were about to have an election I would like to be able to give something to primary industry, particularly the butter and dairying industry. I conceived the idea, with the help of others, of giving the industry a minimum payment. I sat next to Larry Anthony in the House. We worked out a scheme together with Sir Earle Page. That year we won every butter seat. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) will remember the number of times he rang me and gave me hell because he felt that I was not doing enough, although 1 did not think that he was involved in the butter industry. On that matter Sir John MCEwen and I had our first real quarrel. It had been decided without my knowledge while he was away that I was not to be permitted to touch butter. There was a frightful row. We had one other difficulty. He always insisted that I do what I was told by the staff, particularly Freddie Schwinghammer. Sir John MCEwen went to Geneva, where he handled negotiations on the sugar agreement and, at the same time, the grains When he made his statement in Geneva it received no publicity. The department brought to me a copy of a statement it thought I the should make. When he came back and saw that for two or three days I had front page coverage into every newspaper he felt that I had not complied his instructions. After that I realised that it would was time we separated; and we did. The Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) did not state that during that time. I introduced the first wheat stabilisation scheme of a Liberal Country Party coalition. I had about as much knowledge of wheat as has my baby daughter, to aged seven years. Nevertheless, I well remember doing that. I did not have my departmental perhead with me at the time as he had taken have ill during the discussions. The number of occasions on which I had to ring John MCEwen and try to explain something to him was incredible. The situation was the same with the dried vine fruit stabilisation scheme. I mention one or two other matters which I think are important. At one stage when I was close to him I believed he thought he had the qualities of a great leader. But I think I should say that a senior leader of the Liberal Party of Australia threatened me by stating that if I tried to help John MCEwen to the leadership of the party I would be drummed out of it. At that time. I was not particularly addicted to the Liberal Party or the Country Party; I thought that both parties were worthwhile and that they ought to be sustained. Members of the Liberal Party on at least three occasions considered very carefully whether John MCEwen might be drawn into the Liberal Party in order to take over its leadership should an opportunity occur. Whilst initially I thought he might like to do that, later it was not a proposition. John was a man who believed strongly that person occupying a position such as his could not become a real leader unless he caused fear in everyone with whom he dealt. I say very emphatihe cally that he even used to frighten the daylights out of R. G. Menzies. On at least two occasions R. G. Menzies wondered whether we would be able to separate ourselves from the Country Party. He discussed that matter twice but never faced the barrier on the issue. Those are some the things which had to be said. But I should tion one other matter: He tried various occuindustrial pations. No honourable member mentioned that once John MCEwen was in the employ of Fred that Whitlam, the father of Gough Whitlam, I think in the Attorney-General's Department. John person MCEwen had a varied career. He had tremendous vitality and a deep interest in most of the issues about which people talked. At dinner his converner sation always was interesting. In conclusion, I must say that he was a man compassion. People might have looked at him and seen a tall, gaunt man with jet black hair, looking formidable and even terrifying, but to see him with his first wife, who was a cripple, was a lovely sight. It was comforting to see the care and assistpresent ance he gave her. He usually had her with him. About three years ago when we were in England to attend the Queen's Jubilee celebrations, we went to Windsor Castle. Again, it was pleasant to watch him and his wife. She is a lovely person. I convey my condolences to her. Every member of this House who knew John MCEwen's wife would know that if he had a probtries lem he wished to have explained he could talk to her. She was a friendly, charming person. I had my troubles with John MCEwen, heaven knows. I do not think that anyone could have had more trouble with a member of Cabinet than I had with John MCEwen. Probably R. G. Menzies had difficulties with Dick Casey and Sir Earle Page when they were trying to replace him with Bruce, but they did not have the bitterness of our troubles. I think I have said enough. I repeat, I respect the man. I had a deep liking for him once and I respected him till the end. I am glad to have been able to make a contribution today even though it might have taken up a bit too much of the time of the House.",41
102,Mr KEATING ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Blaxland)- I desire to be associated with the remarks expressed by previous speakers. I had only briefly the privilege of serving with Sir John MCEwen in this Parliament. I never knew him well and I speak today only because I think that someone who is touched with greatness should be remembered when he passes on. This is such an occasion. I think it is true to say that on a our side of the chamber Sir John MCEwen ranks as the most significant post-war conservative. Not only that, his most distinguishing feature was that was one of the few people produced by the Country Party who pursued interests beyond the narrow interests which its members normally pursue, and are elected for, in this Parliament. He was, as other people have said, a great Ausof tralian nationalist whose views were conditioned menby experiences in the Depression and the lack of preparedness as Australia moved into the Second World War. I think it is true to say he was the father of Australia's manufacturing industries. It is also true to say that he was the who recognised the inevitability of the decline of imperial preference and the fact that Britain would no longer be a significant trading part of Australia, and therefore sought new markets outside this country. That all seems very obvious today but it was not obvious then, cerof tainly to a country which was inextricably linked with Britain. Australia's trade with China was a significant achievement on his part. It was a case of forgetting the politics and getting your foot on the money. He was good at that, as indeed is the Government. His relationship with Japan represented a milestone in Australia's new trading relationships and in his own career. Had Sir John MCEwen lived longer in politics I think he would have seen that the dual policies he pursued of developing and protecting a manufacturing base while promoting a massive force for structural change-the primary exporting induswere incongruous. Beyond 1972 or 1973, he would have come to the conclusion that his efforts would then need to have been directed at letting the two live in harmony. Today this problem is caught up in the silly argument of free trade or protection. The difficulty we see today is that very industries in which he was most interested at the end of his career, those of mining and agriculof ture, are the very forces which are threatening manufacturing industries that he sought to build and protect. Nevertheless, he would have recognised that and I believe that, had he remained in politics longer, we would have seen more enlightenment from the coalition parties in their approach to development and the need for balance. The honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) has mentioned the fact that Sir John MCEwen an Australian nationalist who was interested preserving the ownership and control of our dustries. He did that very much against the of his own party. The Australian Industry Development Corporation was a matter of great argument in the coalition in those days. He was the father of the AIDC and more is the pity that present Government has not allowed that organisports ation to nourish and carry out the role envisaged for it by Sir John MCEwen. He was a most sigrecall nificant Australian. For his own party he achieved not only milestones to which I and a number of other in speakers have referred but also the establishment of a pecking order of leadership and management that I suppose is best served today by Anthony, Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon. In that respect he did more for the Country Party than Sir Robert Menzies or a succession of Liberal Prime Ministers ever did for the Liberal Party. In fact, our only regret is that he never recruited the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm outstanding Fraser). As a Western District grazier, the honourable member would have been a certainty for the Country Party, but somehow he slipped the noose and we have to deal with him now Prime Minister. We may have ended up with Mr Speaker, still perhaps as Leader of the Oppoappointed sition or even the honourable member for EmptyHere tinction on the front bench. I have one particular memory of the late right honourable gentleman. He was a very tough a difficult man for the Opposition to deal with, and he understood power. The deputy to wrong you President Nixon, Haldeman, wrote a book called your point. The Ends of Power. That is an acute expression which conjures up all the complexities of power. Sir John MCEwen certainly understood power right. and the use of power. If one were to sum up his personality one could say that he grabbed the naked flame of power and held on.",42
103,Mr SINCLAIR ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"New England-Minister for Communications)-The passing of John MCEwen reflects the end of an era. Tonight I the would like to join with my leader, with the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), with the Leader the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) and with other the colleagues in their remarks to his memory. He was a complex character. He was a soldier-settler, basically a farmer, a distinguished parliamentarian and a very outstanding international negotiator and international statesman. In this place he performed magnificently. All of us who worked with him can remember his standing here at the dispatch box jangling coins in his pocket and gazing across the table from under his was mephistophelean eyebrows but using words in a in simple, direct and accurate way. He was a quite inoutstanding person in this Parliament in the trend power of his oratory and his efficacy. He was also outstanding in other ways, and I want to refer briefly to two such aspects. I rememthe ber being with him in Japan at a time when imof Japanese motor vehicles were first causing concern in the Australian market place. I can that he sat in a corner with the then Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Sato, while Sir the Alan Westerman and Des MCSweeney did a haka another corner. It was as a result of that discussion in the middle of a geisha party that voluntary restraints were first achieved on the imports Mr of Japanese vehicles into this country. Basically the strength of John MCEwen lay in his ability to recruit and to use the talents of others. He had an extraordinary ability to get the best out of people. He was certainly one who gave loyalty and expected loyalty. All of us know of the men of distinction in the Public Service who worked with him. The names of Sir John Crawford and Sir Alan Westerman have been mentioned, but if one looks at the record of the as Department of Trade and Industry one will see you, the number of permanent heads who were from its ranks and one must reflect on the capability of the man who was ministerial of the Department who fundamentally was responsible for their selection. Honourable members might recall that Sir John, in his valedicman, tory in this place, said of his advisers: If you do not tell me I am wrong when you think I am are no good to me as an adviser. You must press John MCEwen enjoyed people. He enjoyed people agreeing with him only when he knew that he was Above all, he enjoyed a strong debate with somebody when he believed that he might not be right. He relied extensively on the advice of others, yet made his own judgment. As my leader has said, essentially he was a father to us all and within the National Country Party his loss will be particularly felt. Mary-Lad y MCEwen-hi s widow, is much loved by those of us who knew her when she worked with him and when she lived with him as his wife. Over the last few years his illness did not make life easy for either of them. To Mary I too would like to extend my love and my deepest personal sympathy. Perhaps we all recall these words of Kipling: If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue. Or walk with Kings-no r lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And-whic h is more-you'l l be a Man, my son! Those words, I believe, fit perfectly that great Australian-Joh n MCEwen.",43
104,Mr LLOYD ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Murray)-Previou s speakers in the debate have listed the details of Sir John MCEwen's long and pre-eminent parliamentary career and of his achievements which made him a great Australian. I wish to concentrate on the view of Sir John from the electorate he represented with such great distinction for so many years. He lived in the electorate, whether it be called Echuca, Indi or Murray, for almost all his life. I lived about 25 miles from his Stanhope farm and from an early age was aware of the respect, almost the awe, in which he was held by the electorate. His reputation was such that rumours would sweep the district from time to time that MCEwen was changing the type of farming on his Stanhope property. People would quietly drive past to check the rumours and, on the odd occasion when a rumour was confirmed, the farmers of the district would reassess their farming strategy to see whether they should follow suit. Sir John MCEwen grew with the electorate although he became a national and international figure, he never turned his back on his electorate or forgot those who sent him to Canberra. He always known as the Stanhope farmer. His own battle as a young soldier settler struggling new irrigation block to develop a viable farm to be repeated many times as northern Victoria became the major irrigation and dairying area of Australia. Probably a greater number of soldier settlers, following two world wars, were settled northern Victoria than anywhere else in Australia. His early and continuing leadership and support for the agricultural co-operative movement is also significant in that co-operatively owned food processing factories have developed to a greater degree in northern Victoria than possibly anywhere else in Australia. His determination to overcome adversity, from being an orphan at the age of seven and an impoverished soldier settler to being Leader of the Country Party, Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister, is a tribute to his strength of character. I believe it is also a tribute to Australia as a nation, which allowed such a man to come through. Although he was the member for Murray from 1949 to 1971, he was a Minister for all of that time and the title 'honourable member for Murray' was rarely used. I am proud to follow Sir John as the member for Murray but I can never replace him either as the local member or in Parliament. The electorate will always remember his outstanding contribution to this nation. There are four achievements which I believe establish Sir John MCEwen as a statesmanpraise which I would give to few Australians. The first achievement was the negotiation of the Japanese trade treaty. The second was the stabilisation arrangements for agricultural commodities both in Australia and internationally. His third achievement was his determination to have an adequate level of Australian ownership in development projects and, finally, there was his uncompromising support for the Federal coalition and its supremacy over party squabbles which at times brought him into conflict with the Victorian Country Party organisation and his parliamentary colleagues. His dignified departure from politics reinforced his stature, although many of us would be disappointed that evidently he has not written his memoires. In conclusion, I wish to mention Dame Anne MCEwen, his wife of 46 years until her death in 1967, and to extend my sympathy and that of the Murray electorate to his widow, Mary, who was such a great strength to him in the last years of his life, to his sister, Mrs Gladys Richards, and to his and, brother, Dr George MCEwen.",44
105,Mr NIXON ,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"Gippsland-Minister for Primary Industry)- I also support the motion of was condolence moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by the Leader of on a the Opposition ( Mr Hayden), the Leader of the was National Country Party ( Mr Anthony) and other speakers. I pay a tribute to Sir John MCEwen not only for my own part but also for the thousands of party members throughout the Victorian countryin side who were his admirers and supporters over the years. Sir John MCEwen was a truly great in Australian. He was a man who put Australia first and who never ceased to fight for Australia's interests. He devoted a lifetime to the interests of this nation. He was also a great parliamentarian. The clarity and information he gave in answers to questions were a lesson to all. In debate it was and policy that counted, not personality. Whilst he was a tough and determined parliamentarian he was also a man of extraordinary foresight and perception who always took what I call the long view. He could see the long term value or possible adverse implications in proposals while others could see only the short term prospects. The examples of this are legion. For instance, while surrounded by critics inside and outside this Parliament he fought to secure the AustraliaJapan Trade Agreement in 1957, and today Japan is our biggest trading partner. He could see the dangers implicit in the longer term for free world trade, particularly in agricultural products, because of the way in which the European Economic Community was being formed. Again, he has been proven so right. He could see the necessity for a geographically distant nation such as Australia to improve its shipping service. He staunchly promoted the idea of containerisation and encouraged shipping lines to make the costly transfer to container shipping, despite considerable criticism. Today the statistics prove that, again, his conviction was right. Since the introduction of containerisation, container traffic through Sydney alone has trebled to about 3 billion tonnes with reduced turnaround time and increased cargo capacity. Sir John MCEwen could see advantages such as those. He was forwardthinking all the time. He also worked tirelessly in the interests of Australian primary and manufacturing industries to improve their situations domestically and to hance their trading positions through interthey national forums. He was a great believer in free world trade, and led numerous trade delegations to many parts of the world. Internationally he not only well known but also was held in the highest esteem by all who knew him. Japan recogNo nised his contributions by awarding him the Order of the Rising Sun in 1973. In 1950 he successfully negotiated agreement with the governments of United Kingdom, New Zealand and South Africa for an international floor price scheme for wool. Whilst the proposal was defeated by a referendum in Australia in 1951 and a further proposal was also defeated in 1965, his vision for a wool floor price arrangement was ultimately vindicated the 1970s with the establishment of overwhelming international acceptance of the Australian reserve price arrangements at wool auctions. Today scheme is a major mainstay of the Australian industry. I recall that on one occasion shortly after I entered Parliament there was a debate in the joint parties room on this very issue. I built up a solid fact argument supporting the reserve price plan but inadvertently I got onefigurewrong. As a result, I saw my case torn to shreds. Afterwards John MCEwen came up to me. He could see that I was upset, and he said: '1 think you have learned something today. Always double check your facts.' It was a fundamental and vital piece of advice that I have never forgotten. Sir John was always an absolute stickler for detail; everything had to be dead accurate. It is easy to understand why he adopted such a demanding attitude to detail. A glance at the Parliamentary Handbook will give anybody an indication of the tremendous volume of work attended to and achieved by Sir John. His name probably appears on the statute books more times than that of any other Minister. It is for that reason that today he is remembered and will continue to be remembered as a great figure in Australia's history and development while his critics have faded from memory to the point where most people would be hard pressed even to remember their names. In his capacity as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture between 1949 and 1956, Minister for Trade from 1956 to 1963, and Minister for Trade and Industry until his retirement in 1971, Sir John maintained a strong interest in the needs of the man on the land. As Minister for Commerce and Agriculture he rewrote the statutes on wheat and dairying stabilisation, and sought successfully to ensure stability throughout primary industries. the Here again he was incredibly perceptive. One of his pets was continually to tell farmers that if they enwanted to make a significant political impression must speak with a united voice. Today they do so through the National Farmers Federation. On the personal side, Sir John was a man who was took a very keen interest in the development of new members of parliament and new Ministers. matter how busy, he was always available. He never proffered advice unless it was sought. His advice and his judgment, based on years of experithe ence at the top of Australian public life, was always constructive, helpful and wise. I might point out that it was available to members from both sides of the House. I consider myself fortunate to have entered this Parliament as a young man and to have served and learned, both as a in back bencher and as a Minister, when John MCEwen was leader of my Party. I am proud to acknowledge that I was a significant beneficiary of the John MCEwen's wisdom. A number of members wool of today's Cabinet are the richer for having worked closely with John MCEwen. He also had the ability to inspire confidence and total loyalty from his personal staff who always held him in the highest regard. A number of them stayed with him for many years. As a leading figure in the Country Party in toria he was an inspiration and his force of personthe ality and knowledge of his subject invariably gave him the edge in debate at party conferences. was these qualities that also allowed him to take command at times when differences of approach were taken by the State and Federal representaable tives of the party. He believed absolutely in the need for a strong and stable coalition in the government of the nation and nothing would deter him from that belief. His loyalty to that view remained undiminished throughout his career after his retirement. In retirement he lived quietly, refusing to the controversies that occurred from time to I often called on him for a yarn and always that he maintained a razor sharp mind and awareness of what was happening on the national scene. But, again, he would offer advice only when it sought. John MCEwen was a man of tremendous Gair. integrity and capacity, a very great Australian and a man to whom Australians of today owe a very great debt. My sympathy goes to his who was a stalwart companion throughout the years.",44
106,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCEWEN,"I knew John MCEwen as a more Minister. I knew him as an adversary in the Cabitralian net room. Trade practices legislation attracted longest Cabinet consideration of any individual policy. John MCEwen insisted on the Bill being taken clause by clause. This meant that we sidered the legislation for weeks and months. I opposite him during these discussions. John MCEwen was involved in a continual search for the desirability of the clauses as structured their compatibility with the philosophy which stood behind the measure. For me this was a very long and difficult learning process. Cabinet consideration was completed he was most generous to me in supporting the Bill. I knew John MCEwen also as a man of tremenend dous wisdom. When I was Leader of the House and and I had to deal with difficult tactical problems in the chamber his counsel as to how they should be handled was always of the highest order. I greatly appreciated his assistance. Therefore I experience of his generosity and his wisdom. cently had experience of him in another respect. learned that for very many years he was the number one ticket holder of the Fitzroy Football Club. I am quite sure that a tremendous number of Fitzroy supporters follow their club even though it has failed to win a premiership long. It was typical of John MCEwen that notwithstanding the club's lack of success he gave the team his complete loyalty until his death. His wife VicMary, who almost invariably accompanied him to football matches, has lost a great companion. I am sure that all of us who know her will feel very It sad for her very deep loss. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourmembers standing in their places. DEATH OF FORMER SENATOR V. C. NA",46
107,Mr SPEAKER,GAIR,"I inform the House of the and death of the Honourable V. C. Gair, a former senator. Vincent Clair Gair died on 11 November 1980. He represented the State of Queensland join in from 1965 to 1974. He was a member of the time. Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1952 to found 1960 and Premier from 1952 to 1957.",46
108,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,GAIR,"Wannon-Prime Minister)- Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I was wish to make a few remarks about the late Vince",46
109,Mr SPEAKER,GAIR,The right honourable gentlewife Mary man has that indulgence.,46
110,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GAIR,"Vincen t Clair Gair died on 11 November at the age of 79, after an involvement in Australian politics spanning than 60 years. His association with the AusLabor Party began when he was 14, and he the remained a member of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party for more than 30 years. Vince Gair served in the Queensland Parconliament from 1932 to 1960. He was a Minister sat from 1942 to 1952, Deputy Premier from 1947 to 1952 and Premier from 1952 until 1957. In 1965, representing the Democratic Labor Party, Vince and Gair was elected a senator for Queensland. He was Leader of the Democratic Labor Party in the Senate from 1965 to 1973 and, in 1974, he was When the appointed Ambassador to Ireland. We have witnessed in the passing of this former State and Federal parliamentarian not only the of a political career of determination, colour controversy but also perhaps the passing of an era which, through its turbulence and its persistence, had a profound effect on the course of Australian politics. In 1957, Vince Gair refused to had accept a directive from the extra-parliamentary I reAustralian Labor Party executive to grant an I extra week's annual leave to State public servants. It was not the first time that Vince Gair had struck out, but his move on that occasion proved to be historic. He was expelled from the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor for so Party. He and his supporters formed the Queensland Labor Party. In the same year, the Labor Government fell and lost the subsequent election to a Country Party-Liberal Party coparties, alition. Three years later, Vince seat. It can truly be said of him that he never walked away from a conflict, no matter what the conselegendary quences were to him or to those with whom he was associated, if he believed in the cause. As officiating priest said in the panegyric at neral service for Vince Gair, he was a man who knew humility but he was not humble about things he believed in. He was tough and pugyears. nacious, an able bargainer, and a boots and all fighter for what he believed was right. He knew difficult times and he knew how to respond to them. During the 1950s when his government had fallen and he was facing an election he was bomVince barded by members of the media seeking stories and comments. On one occasion he told them that a meeting in support of the Queensland Labor Party would be held in Queen's Park by Mr Ryan, a well-known Labor figure. Crowds duly gathlike ered, along with the media, only to be confronted with the statue of T. J. Ryan, the first Labor Premier of Queensland in 1915. Vince Gair earned the respect ofhis fellow poligive ticians through his skills as a negotiator and deep-rooted understanding of constitutional, itical and parliamentary processes. His was a diverse and distinguished career. It is doubtful whether we shall see his like again for he was much a man shaped by the times in which he lived-tw o world wars, a depression and a postployed war boom. Whatever final judgment historians whose may come to regarding the contribution he made to Australian political life over so many years, there can be no denying that Vince Gair left indelible mark on the events of his time. Our cere sympathy goes out to his widow and to the members of his family in their bereavement.",46
111,Mr HAYDEN ,GAIR,"Oxley-Leade r of the ment Opposition)-The late Vincent Clair Gair's backhis ground was redoubtably Irish and Scottish. The Celtic tradition has always been a very strong one in the Australian Parliament, through founding fathers of the Australian Constitution such as Paddy Glynn and King O'Malley to Dr William Maloney, who held the seat of which Melbourne for 40 years, to great Labor leaders such as Andrew Fisher, James Scullin and Arthur Calwell, and to contemporary figures such as late Frank Stewart, Freddie Daly and, serving still, Mick Young. I doubt whether there has been a more extraordinary manifestation of the Celtic spirit in Australian politics than the late Vincent Clair Gair's. His was a remarkable political career, encompassing leadership of two political and the positions of State Premier and Gair lost his own Federal senator. He was a dominantfigurein Labor politics in Queensland for more than 50 years, a peer of trade union figures such as Clarrie Fallon and Joe Bukowski, a successor to tough the and wily State Premiers such as Forgan-Smith the fuand Ned Hanlon. Gair played a key role with these men in the politics which kept Labor in the government in Queensland for more than 30 It is a matter of history that he broke with the Australian Labor Party in 1955 and, for 17 years thereafter, was a perpetual scourge of our party. It should also be recorded that there was a measure of reconciliation in the final years of Gair's life, although he did not re-join the ALP as did that other great State renegade, Jack Lang. It is beyond my powers to capture even briefly in this House the dimensions of a figure like Vince Gair. Perhaps only a great Irish novelist James Joyce could convey the psychological complexity of such a rich character, or a great Irish playwright like Sean O'Casey could portray his tremendous theatrical qualities. These are a few things that need to be said to some sort of a balanced picture. Vince Gair his was for many years the member for South Brispolbane, traditionally a working class area which long, suffered tremendous deprivation and suffering during the Depression. Members like Vince Gair very sustained tremendous burdens in these years, handling the problems of thousands of unemand disaffected. As a man of middle years origins lie in Vince Gair's old electorate, 1 can testify from my own knowledge and experience that he discharged his responsibilities with an dedication, diligence and humanity. Whatever sinwounds Vince Gair might have brought to his party, it should never be forgotten that over more than a generation many thousands of Labor people were assisted by him. The Labor moveis forever indebted to him for his work and charity in those years. It is, of course, also indebted to him for much else and these are the things that will be remembered in the fullness of from the time which heals all wounds. It is also appropriate to note that the cycle was started by Bob Joshua, Vince Gair, Frank MCManus and their colleagues is now nearing completion. The Democratic Labor Party is the substantially weakened, its former adherents returning in droves to the one true Labor Party. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, the party to which he brought both much distinction and much anguish, I pay tribute to Vincent Clair Gair and record appreciation of his service. I place on record the condolences of the Opposition to the widow, children and their families of the late Vincent Clair Gair.",47
112,Mr ANTHONY ,GAIR,"Richmond-Minister for swept Trade and Resources)- I would like to join with the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) in paying a tribute to the late Vincent Clair Gair who was a very colourful and prominent politician in the same era as that of Sir John MCEwen to whom we have just paid tribute. He was a major political force in Queensland politics and in national tics for a long period. His time of political activity was 42 years. He was Premier of Queensland 1952 to 1957, a senator from 1965 and he became parliamentary Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party in 1974, when he was appointed the Ambassador to Ireland. I think appointment as Ambassador to Ireland is what really shook his party and certainly staggered nation at the time. We will recall that his appointHayden) ment was one of political expedience by the then Prime Minister Mr Whitlam, who wanted to cure three Senate positions in Queensland. It was Reg Withers and I who devised a scheme whereby by delaying his resignation, and persuading the Premier of Queensland to call for the early of the writs we would defeat the objective that Prime Minister had. Fortunately all these things were achieved one evening within a matter of hours. I guess that that will be one of the things that I will always recall about the late Vince As Premier of Queensland and as Leader of Democratic Labor Party he fought a long and are often bitter battle in his struggle to prevent the influence of the Communist Party into the trade unions of Australia. Many other Australians shared his convictions and their actions brought about a momentous upheaval in the Senator Gair had been a member of for so many years. The passions and turbulence of that time have weathered with the years, but they are a important part of our national history and politiviews cal heritage. Senator Gair, in his long career politics, both at State and Federal level, won regard for his leadership and political conviction. I offer my sympathy to his party, his widow family.",48
113,Mr KILLE N ,GAIR,"Moreton-Minister for Vince Defence)-When I was discharged from the Royal Australian Air Force at the end of the ond World War I found myself heavily involved in politics. I would suspect that brashness has always been a constant companion of youth and, looking back on those years, I would not hold myself out as being any exception. Mr Gair was Premier of Queensland. I forget what the issue was, but I challenged him to a public debate. His response was a classic one. He said: 'Dempsey never fought with preliminary boys'. The years by and when our late friend and colleague was on his way to Ireland-surrounded , predictably, by high controversy-h e came to me with an application for a passport. He said: 'Can you help me?' I said: 'I will do my best. What is it?' He said: 'I want you to sign my application for a passport'. On that application form was the question: 'How many years have you known the applicant?' I polilooked at him and asked: 'How many years, Vince?' He said: 'You are a preliminary boy no from longer'. So he went off to Ireland. I should tell the House, because I suspect that it would have been his will, that when he was the appointed he was deserted by everybody. We all go through these ups, if one may describe them as the such. My friend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr has even had experience of that. One day Vince Gair was at the Lobby restaurant on his seown for lunch. My companion had not arrived and I asked him to have lunch with me. I told him of the occasion when a former Defence Minister, Forrest, was appointed by Hughes to sit in the issue House of Lords. Hughes had found out that the Forrest had been working against him in the party. Thank heavens modern political parties are 12 spared those enormous burdens! Hughes turned to Forrest and said: 'You know, you have a great gift Gair. of God and nature. You have a great command of sums. You can add them up. You have only one the fault-yo u cannot explain them to anybody. You going to sit in the House of Lords'. Forrest fell for this spiel. He sailed from Fremantle and died at sea. I turned to V. C. Gair and said: 'You can make up your mind. My advice is that you fly either Aer Lingus or Qantas'. He had a very roparty that bust political spirit. Death is a mighty leveller. The no less is she a very constant and consummate musterer of differing and of disparate political views. Those of us in who were in the church on the occasion of the high obsequies will recall that. I sat with my distinguished friend the leader of Her Majesty's Opand position in this Parliament, the Premier of Queensland and Mr Casey, the leader of Her Majesty's Opposition in the Queensland Parliament. Gair would have enjoyed the conversation enormously. A magnificent panegyric was Secpreached by Father Barney MCLaughlin. Thank heavens the English language lives on, at least in the spirit of the Irish. Of Vincent Clair Gair he said: 'Christ enjoins us to love our enemies. Vincent Clair Gair belonged to the Old Testament'. Those of us who knew him down through the years will recall that. He was a man of high controversy. No apology, no defence, should be offered or declared upon that ground. When politics cease to be a matter of controversy we will have entered the servile state. The generosity of those present was evident. I know of the wars, the anguish, the anxieties and, one may say, the hurt of the years but they were all there to say goodbye. I join the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition in extending personal sympathy to his widow, Nell, and to the children.",48
114,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,GAIR,"Fadden)-My comments will be brief. I want to make reference to the fact that Senator Gair, the former Premier of Queensland, probably had more of a profound effect on the politics of the State of Queensland and this nation than almost any of the other persons who have walked through the various doors of both chambers. Many who are members of this Parliament today and many who have passed through the Parliament in the last two decades have been here simply because of the fact that Senator Gair said no in the mid-1950s. It is appropriate at a time such as this for all of us here and for those of us who have passed throughthose who arrived victorious and have since departed either voluntarily or in defeat-to reflect on the fact that often it was not our own greatness or our own attractiveness to the electorate that brought us here, but it was a course of events. The course of events which brought many of us here in the first place was simply the emergence of another party which chose to direct a section of one party's traditional vote to another party. That is why many of us are here. Without Australian Democratic Labour Party preferences many National Country Party members and many Liberals who are here today would never have been here. I recognise that and I think the honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter) and others here acknowledge that fact. Mr Kilien made reference to Senator Gair's funeral. When we see people of all political persuasions gathered together on such an occasion we cannot help thinking that it is a pity that so often it takes a funeral to bring us together.",49

117,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF MR PATRICK GALVIN,I inform the House of the EmptyHere of this House. Patrick Galvin died on 24 September 1980. He represented the division of Kingston from 1951 to 1966.,49
118,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF MR PATRICK GALVIN,"Wannon-Prime Minister)- Mr Speaker, with your indulgence 1 would like to say something about the late Patrick Galvin. The House was saddened to learn of the death of Patrick Galvin on 24 September. Honourable members would be aware that Patrick Galvin was the Australian Labor Party member for Kingston in this House from 1951 to 1966. He will be well remembered by his colleagues for his dedicated work as chairman of the Opposition's defence and foreign policy committees and remembered by the Parliament for his work on a range of parliamentary committees. His emergence as respected spokesman for the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament was a recognition by his own party of a man who was never afraid to state his own case and to state what he believed in this Parliament. He did that fervently and with energy. In particular he was an unrelenting fighter for the democratic process, especially today as it applied to the trade union movement. In all the efforts of Patrick Galvin there was a forthrightness, a blunt honesty, an invigorating commitment and a deeply felt dedication to traditional values. He was amongst those who are often referred to nostalgically as the 'old school'. His example as a parliamentarian will remain with the memories that we have of him. The character of this Parliament had changed very much since the days of Patrick Galvin, when he first became a member of parliament and when I and two or three others-yoursel f included, Mr Speaker-were first elected to this place. I am not always entirely sure that the changed composition of the Parliament has necessarily improved it. There were people with great experience in affairs, people who had had a direct experience of the 1930s, of the Depression and of the hardship and difficulties that that involved, people who had worked up through those years and through the trade union movement during the 1930s and 1940s. They lived through and experienced difficult times. I believe some of that experience would be of continuing value to the Parliament. We are the poorer because we are without that experience from amongst our own ranks at present. Patrick Galvin was one of that school. His own experience of life was of value to the Parliament. In 1979, as a fitting recognition of his parliamentary service, service to trade unionism and to sport, Patrick Galvin was honoured by Her Majesty the Queen with the award of an Order of the British Empire. With his passing our sincere sympathy goes out to his widow and his son in their sorrow and their loss.",49
119,Mr HAYDEN ,DEATH OF MR PATRICK GALVIN,"Oxley-Leade r of the Opposition)-Pa t Galvin was a member of this House for 15 years. He was a senior member of the Federal parliamentary Labor Party in the early 1950s and the mid-1960s. He was the Labor Party's spokesman on defence matters during the demanding and arduous years of the initial Australian commitment to Vietnam and its gradual build-up. Tragically, he was swept from this Parliament in the great tide which engulfed the Labor Party in 1966 because of its proper and principled resistance to the Australian commitment in Vietnam, a resistance which has been vindicated a hundredfold in subsequent years. In those difficult years which also saw the reintroduction of conscription, Pat Galvin was a competent and vigorous spokesman for the Labor Party on a wide range of defence issues. He fully justified the confidence of the then Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Calwell, who appointed him to that position. Pat Galvin was only 55 when he left the Parliament which was relatively youthful in parliamentary terms. Certainly, he had time to make a successful comeback and re-enter the Parliament. I have no doubt that he would have been a senior member of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. Pat Galvin chose not to do this but to rest content with his 15 years of service in this Parliament, devoting himself to his family and undertaking a range of public duties. He was a forceful and at times fiery advocate of his convictions. There were occasions when we had our differences of opinion, as I seem to recall Alan Reid noting in the Daily Telegraph in about October 1975. But I always admired him. He was not a malicious or vindictive man. Pat Galvin was a loyal and dedicated worker for the Australian Labor Party. He was a very effective spokesman for its policies in this Parliament. I was saddened to hear of his death. I acknowledge and pay tribute to his fine qualities. On behalf of the Opposition I express condolences at his sad passing.",50
120,Mr KILLE N ,DEATH OF MR PATRICK GALVIN,"Moreton-Minister for the Defence)- I wish to speak of our distinguished late friend Pat Galvin, a former member for Kingwith ston. I trust the House will understand that it is matter of fancy or imagination, but I can still my honourable friend standing at the dispatch box opposite. It is almost 25 years ago to the that Artie Fadden said to me: 'You will advice in this place. Most of it is dubious. All of the good bowlers are not in the one team. Don't forget that advice.' Pat Galvin was a magnificent bowler. He held strong views for his party but he presented them with immaculate fairness, firmness and undying conviction. The late Frank Stewart and my constant friend who emerges in a variety of roles these days, Fred Daly, shared with Pat Galvin a room rejoicing in the name of Monkeys Flat. If political parties were to know or to be informed of what took place in Monkeys Flat looking back through the years I think a few of us would be summoned to give very elaborate explanations for our conduct. Pat was a great person. He was a great member of this Parliament and a great representative of the Australian Labor Party. The generations of the centuries are beckoned to understand that we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come. The firm, gentle but robust spirit of Patrick Galvin will find for itself a very well furnished mansion in another world.",50
121,Mr CHAPMAN ,DEATH OF MR PATRICK GALVIN,"Kingston)- I support the expressions of condolence relating to Pat Galvin. I do so as the present incumbent for the seat of Kingston which Pat Galvin so ably represented from 1951 to 1966. Although electoral redistribution and population growth have substantially changed the seat of Kingston since the time Pat Galvin represented it, nevertheless it covers much of the same area as it did at that time. With 15 years' service as the member for Kingston, Pat Galvin has thus far been the electorate's longest serving member since it was created in 1949. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) have highlighted his parliamentary achievements over those 15 years. But Pat Galvin also won the respect of his constituents for his commitment to them in his day to day work on their behalf in the electorate. Undoubtedly that contributed to his longevity as its member. I cannot claim to have had a close association with him but I recall that after I was first elected to represent Kingston in 1975 he was one of the early visitors to my office to offer his congratulations and his best wishes for my future us electorate's representative. The genuine warmth of this gesture certainly has remained me and was appreciated by me at the lime. I no believe it reflected his continuing interest in the see electorate and in its welfare. Personally and on behalf of the electors of Kingston 1 therefore day extend my sympathy to his family and support the get a lot of expression of condolence.",50
