Is it not a fact that each of the area officers to be appointed will, before appointment, receive a thorough military training in the Military College? 3. Is it not a fact that the complete training of the first batch of area officers designate will not terminate until five years after the establishment of the Military College? 4. Is it not a fact that the area officers to be appointed in the meantime to train the new Military Forces are not called upon for a similar high standard of military efficiency? 5. Is it not a fact that, in consequence, the real training of the new Defence Forces will not begin in real earnest until the first batch of graduates from the Military College take up their duty as area officers (say, in 1916)? 6. Will the Government take steps to obtain the services of as many highly-qualified Imperial oflicers as can be secured, to act as area officers pending the training of those afterwards to be appointed from the Military College? 7. If not, will the Government explain how, if an efficient military service is urgently necessary, the beginning of its efficient training can with safety be deferred six years? 8. In what year will the Military College have turned out fit for duty the last batch of area officers to fill the remaining positions awaiting permanent occupants?",15
10,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence has supplied the following answers to the honourable member's questions1. The efficiency of the Military Forces under amended Defence Act will depend upon the of all the officers of the Defence Force, not upon that of the area officers only. For the first few years of the system the work of the area officers will consist chiefly of adduties and supervision of the training of recruits and senior cadets by the non-comofficers of the Instructional Staff (Permanent). 2. The permanent area officers will be trained at the Military College. 3 and 4. Yes. 5. No. There are now 132 officers of the Permanent Force, and 1,500 officers of citizen troops in the Defence Force. When officers from the Military College take up duty they will assist the existing permanent instructors to meet the increasing requirements of the growing force. 6. Not while there are members of the Defence Force in Australia capable of temporarily performing the duties necessary at the present time. 7.

Is it true that the conditions imposed by the Board are so stringent that the manufacturers are afraid to tender? 3. Is he aware that the mills are quite capable of doing the work for the Government if the conditions are slightly modified? 4. Will he lay a copy of the conditions on the table of this House?",15
12,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The answers to the the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. It was never intended that the making up of uniforms should be done outside the country. The Department has not received tenders tor enough cloth to meet requirements, and further steps are being taken to ascertain whether sufficient supplies can be obtained in Australia. 2.

13,Mr MATHEWS,CENTRALIZATION OF,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Did he promise some time ago that he would look into the question of erecting a building in Melbourne to accommodate all the Ministers and central staffs, and thus obviate much public inconvenience? 2. If so, will he state what is the result of the inquiries into the subject? 3. What is the total amount paid annually as rents by the Federal Government for the present inconveniently situated offices in Melbourne? 4. How much would it cost to acquire land in a central position and put up a Federal building to accommodate these officers? 5. Would there be a saving in rent by such a transaction; if so, what would be the amount so saved ? 6. If such a building were erected, would accommodation be likely to prove excessive for the requirements of the Federal Departments after the establishment of the seat of Government in New South Wales? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1 and 2. The matter has not yet been definitely settled. 3. Â£6,824 per annum is being paid for offices in Melbourne. A return of all rentals was printed and circulated on the 15th ult. 4. The amount cannot be definitely stated; everything depends upon the site selected. 5. It is probable that a saving might be effected, but the exact amount cannot be stated; the cost of the proposed building, as well as that of the site, has to be considered. 6. This question is hardly susceptible of a definite answer. But the whole matter is being now diligently inquired into, and I hope to be able to lay definite information before the House at an early date. REMOVAL OF TELEGRAPH POLES. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that a letter was sent to the Sutherland Shire Council from the Department demanding payment of the cost of removing certain telegraph poles at the coiner of Illawarra-road and Railway-parade, Sutherland, and threatening legal proceedings unless the amount was paid within fourteen days? 2. If so, is it the intention of the Department to insist on payment by the shire council for correction of a Departmental error in erecting the poles on the carriage-way ? 3. With reference to the foregoing questions, is the Postmaster-General aware that, as a result of the placing of a telegraph pole on the carriage-way at Sutherland an accident occurred to a motor car, which collided with the pole, wrecking the car. the occupants of which sustained painful injuries? 4. Would it not be more economical for the Department to pay for the cost of rectifying its own mistakes, and removing telegraph poles to Ihe proper alignment of the road, than to incur the risk of having to indemnify persons who may suffer loss or personal injury resulting from Departmental mistakes in encroaching on carriage ways ?",16
14,Mr TUDOR,CENTRALIZATION OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Yes. 2. The Department does not ask shire councils to pay for Departmental errors; but there appears to be no reason why shire councils should not pay, as private individuals have to do, for expenditure necessitated by their action, and it is, therefore, the intention to insist on payment in this case. 3. The Postmaster-General is aware that a motor car accident occurred at the spot mentioned. The pole,, however, was not in the carriage way when erected by the Department. It only became so through the action of the shire council in altering the width of the roadway and the position of the water table. 4. See answer to No. 3, which shows that a mistake was not made by the Department in this case, and that the present position of the pole is due to the action of the shire council. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The answers to questions 3 and 4 are absolutely incorrect. NA STATIONS.",16

16,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"The answer to the question is:Tenders have been accepted for wireless stations having ranges of 1,250 nautical miles, to be erected at Sydney and Fremantle, and tenders are about to tie invited for stations to be erected at Port Moresby and Thursday Island. The question of the further stations to be opened to give more complete effect to the resolutions of the House has received, and is still receiving, close consideration. With regard to the equipment of the merchant marine service, clause 234 of the Navigation provides"" The regulations may require the master or owner of every ship registered in Australia, or engaged in the coasting trade, and of every foreign-going ship carrying passengers from Australia, passengers to the number prescribed, to cause the ship to be fitted as prescribed before going to sea with apparatus transmitting messages by wireless graphy.""

Has any arrangement been considered as to when the matter will be finally dealt with and disposed of? 3. How is it proposed to pay for these properties""?",17
18,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable members' questions are:1. The policy of the Government is that agreed upon at the Inter-State Conference, held in Melbourne in August, igog. 2. A complete valuation of ""Transferred Properties "" has been made by the Commonwealth. 3. It was agreed by the Conference that the adjustment in regard to "" Transferred Properties"" should be dealt with simultaneously with the Public Debts. Pending the taking over of the Public Debts, the question of the manner in which these properties are to be paid for has not been finally decided. MAIL STEAMERS AT HOBART. Mr VV. ELLIOT. JOHNSON (for Mr. MCWILLIAMS) asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeHave the Crown Law officers given an opinion to the effect that the Government has no power to compel the mail steamers to call at Hobart during the months of February to May inclusive, under section 8, sub-section (9), of the Mail vice to Europe contract?",17

(2) Will blind persons without any trade or calling, and unable to earn a living be entitled to the invalid pension?",17
21,Mr FRAZER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the Bill honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Forms of application are being drafted. Advertisements will be inserted in the Commonwealth Gazette and leading newspapers when they which carries are available. 2. Yes, unless they are now in a State institution, or an institution subsidized by a State. for I intend to make a statement through the telepress when the pensions are available. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",17
22,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.45] - move1 That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday next. The purpose of the adjournment need hardly be stated; that it is known is abundantly clear from the pleased expression of the faces by which I am surrounded. I do not think that an apology is required for the motion. The House has been kept very busily at work of late; indeed, it.has been too busily occupied for those who have regard for their health. While we might pretend to work for three hours and a-half on Tuesday afternoon, it would be best to be honest, and adjourn until the evening, so that those who wish to see the Cup may do so, while others can enjoy themselves as they please in other ways. Those who wish to sacrifice themselves on the altar of their country to a greater extent than we have done will be offered every facility to do so in the following week. If it be desired, we can meet on Monday week, and so make up the time thus lost. That being so, there need not be any talk of wasted opportunities. Indeed, there will be no wasted opportunities this session. Since we move by precedents in British-speaking countries, let me state very Ser- briefly the action taken by this Parliament in regard to Cup Day adjournments from the inception of Federation. In 1901, the House met at 7.30 p.m.; in 1902 and 1903, the House was not in session. In 1904, it adjourned over Cup Day, and did not meet until Wednesday, at 2.30 p.m. In 1905, a motion was carried on the Friday preceding Cup DayThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next at half-past 2 o'clock p.m., or such time thereafter as Mr Speaker may take the In 1906 it was not in session. In 1907, a motion similar to that which I have just read was ""carried, and the House met at 3 p.m. In 1908, under a similar motion the House met at 3 p.m., and in 1909 a motion was carried that the House meet at 4.30 p.m., or at such time thereafter as Mr Speaker should take the chair. It met at 4.32 p.m. It therefore appears that we are wanting in precedent for a consistent policy.",17
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,Did the House adjourn by motion over Cup Day in 1904?,18
24,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"It adjourned over Cup Day until the following Wednesday, at 2.30 p . m .",18
25,Mr DEAKIN,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"There are no less than seven Bills on the notice-paper, the second reading of which could be moved by Ministers on Tuesday afternoon.",18
26,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"I do not deny, for one moment, that we might put in the threeand-a-half hours, over which we propose to adjourn on Tuesday afternoon next, and that there would be some sort of discussion. It would be, however, of an aimless character, and could not possibly advance the interests of the country. It would be purely mechanical; it could not be, in the best sense of the word, deliberative, and would not he in the presence of the vast majority of honourable members. I am not inclined to play a part in a farce by assisting in business of that kind. If there is the slightest expression of regret that we are to adjourn until 7.30 p.m. on Cup Day, then I repeat that I am perfectly willing that the House should meet on the following Monday instead of on Tuesday as usual, and so more than make good the time lost. I feel, however, that this little holiday do us all good. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.48] - I am surprised at the extraordinary speech made by the Acting Prime Minister in view of the attitude adopted by some members of the present Ministry when this question was discussed last year. Has the Postmaster-General been consulted ?",18
27,Mr TUDOR,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,He is ill in bed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I wish to know whether he approves of this proposition.,18
28,Mr TUDOR,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"He could not be here. He is ill. Mr W. ELLTOT JOHNSON - As it is a Government proposal, he. as a member of the Government, is responsible for it equally with his colleagues in the Cabinet. I am entitled to know whether he concurs in this motion, having regard to the attitude which he, in common with other honourable members opposite, took up when the following motion was proposed, on 29th October last, by the present Leader of the OppositionThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next at half-past 4 o'clock p.m., or such time thereafter as Mr Speaker may take the chair. We were thus to meet two hours later than was usual, not because of the Melbourne Cup, but - because, as was pointed out, a number of honourable members had gone on a visit to Oodnadatta, and could not return in time to be here at the usual meeting hour. It is now proposed, without any good reason on the part of the Government and their supporters, that the House shall adjourn until Tuesday night, in order that honourable members may attend the Melbourne Cup meeting. There is no pretence of any other purpose in view. Last year several honourable members of the Labour party said that there was no excuse for the National Parliament to adjourn for a single hour merely because a race meeting was in progress. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am going to the Cup. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member may do so, but that is no reason why the business of the country should remain at a standstill. For two months we have been sitting from twelve to sixteen hours per day, because the Government said it was necessary for us to do so in order to clear the business-paper. In spite of the fact that the House has been sweated day after day-man y honorwill able members of the Opposition attending these long sittings at great personal inconvenience and to the detriment of their own private business-w e are asked now to lose several hours on Tuesday next merely in order that some honourable members may go to the Cup meeting. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member looks bad. He needs a rest. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I needed it two months ago, but the honourable member then was in no way disposed to let me have it. Several honourable members interjecting",18
29,Mr SPEAKER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,I appeal to honourable members to cease these continuous interjections. It is almost impossible to follow the honourable member.,18
30,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,We do not want to follow him.,18
31,Mr KELLY,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Do not try to "" Apple Pie '-' the honourable member's speech.",18
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"The member is giving them "" Apple Pie.""",19
33,Mr SPEAKER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Order ! Scarcely a moment has passed since I appealed to honourable members to cease interjecting. I ask them to remember the position they occupy, and to discontinue interjecting. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - When the present Leader of the Opposition, on 29th October last, moved the motion which I have just read, the honourable member for Barrier-the present Postmaster-Generalvery strongly objected to the course proposed, and said I do not think it is right that the National Parliament should adjourn, even for an hour, because the Melbourne Cup is being Tun. That was not the reason given by the then Prime Minister for the proposed adjournment. He stated thatA number of honourable members will be away this week-end on a visit to South Australia, and it is necessary to provide against the possible absence of a quorum at the usual hour of meeting on Tuesday next. The present Postmaster-General did not think that was a sufficient reason, and in the course of a speech in opposition to the motion, quoted the following paragraph from a Methodist journalRaces are mere instruments of gambling. All the sunshine of an Australian November day, all the sheen upon the green sward, all the glitter of vice-regal presence, and the display of dresses by fair women-ofte n at the expense of men who cannot afiord it-and all the superb grace of horses that are fit for nothing else, like some of the patrons of the course, are but tools that serve the gambling instincts and interests of a set of social parasites. There can be no denial of the fact that the Melbourne Cup is only the occasion for gambling, and that, apart from the gambling which it serves, it would not be held. He then said If that extract expresses the truth-an there is a good deal to be said in favour of the view that it does-ther e would be practically no races if there were no gambling. More than once during that speech he emphasized the point that he would never be a party to the National Parliament adjourning for a single hour in connection with racing festivities. I , therefore, ask whether the Postmaster-General concurs in this proposal that the House shall not meet on Tuesday next until several hours after the usual time of assembling, for no other purpose than to allow some honourable members to attend the Melbourne Cup?",19
34,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,No j he did not concur in the proposal.,19
35,Mr JH CATTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Cook) [10.56] - I was one of those who objected last year to [191] honourable the House meeting later than usual on Cup Day, and if a division be taken on this motion I shall vote as I did then. I recognise, however, as the Leader of the Government has pointed out, that when the House does meet on the afternoon of Cup Day the serious business of the country is but slightly advanced. A representative vote cannot be taken on the questions submitted, and a few honourable members simply indulge in a "" stone-wall "" to allow their friends to go to the Melbourne Cup and get back in time to record their votes. I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that we should forego the usual sitting on Tuesday nextthat we should adjourn until Wednesday and meet on the following Monday. The extra sitting day would make up for the loss of time, and honourable members from other States who, like myself, take no interest whatever in the Cup, would be able to spend the week-end at home, instead of having to wait about in Melbourne.",19
36,Mr MATHEWS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,I am going to a picnic. Come to the picnic with me.,19
37,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,I have never heard it called a picnic before.,19
38,Mr SPEAKER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,I again appeal to honourable members to assist me by refraining from interjecting and conversing in loud tones. It is impossible for the business of the House to be properly conducted while these interruptions continue.,19
39,Mr JH CATTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"My suggestion would allow those of us who have no desire to go to the Cup an extra day at our homes at the weekend. We have been in session for a considerable time, and many of us are away from our homes a great deal. Victorian members, and those from Western d I think Australia and Queensland, who live in Melbourne during the whole of the session, might meet the convenience of New South Wales members in that regard. We could make up for the adjournment in the following week without inconvenience to anybody. I understand that the Acting Prime Minister is agreeable to the House voting on the question of an adjournment until Wednesday morning, and meeting on the following Monday. The Leader of the Opposition interjected when the Leader of the Government was speaking that the House could meet as usual on Tuesday, and that certain second-reading speeches could be gone on with to fill in the time. That simply means that the Speaker and the whole of the officers of the House will be kept here with their noses to the grindstone while other people go to the races. The races have no interest for me, but is it a sportsmanlike attitude for those who like races to go to them and tie the officers cf the House to work here? If an opportunity is to be given to members who take an interest in racing to go to the Cup, it is only fair that the officers of the House should have an equal opportunity. I understand that the Leader of the Government has no objection to a vote being taken as to whether the House should meet on the following Monday.",19
40,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"No , we cannot meet cn the Monday.",20
41,Mr JH CATTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"As objections are raised to a meeting on the following Monday, I shall certainly take the opportunity to vote against the motion, because it seems that ' some honourable members like their convenience to be studied regardless of the inconvenience to which other honourable members are put, and that another section ot honourable members, while they want to give an opportunity for their sporting friends to go to the races, object to Ihe same opportunity being arranged so far ?s Ihe officers of the House are concerned. As objection is raised even to a vote being taken regarding the exchange of the Tuesday for the following Monday, I shall take the opportunity to vote against the motion.",20
42,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Balaclava) [11.4] - I was rather surprised at the spirit displayed by the honourable member for Lang. He had not the slightest argument of his own against the motion, but simply quoted the speech of a political opponent to make capital out of it, instead of dealing with the question fairly and squarely on its own merits. Although I am sitting on the same side as the honourable member, I am not proud of the argument he used. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It was fair argument.",20
43,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"It was not the honourable member's own argument. had none of his own. I commend the action of the Acting Prime Minister, who has come out in the open and said fairly what he is going to do. Last session we had a sort of milk and water scheme of meeting at 4.30. We all know why an adjournment is wanted. Tuesday is the great national holiday of Victoria, and it is a compliment to the people of Victoria lhat we should adjourn over that day. No one is forced, or even asked, to go to the Cup. Those who like to go are welcome to go. Men can behave themselves just as respectably and well on the race-course as on the cricket or football ground, and perhaps a little better, to judge by some of the scenes which have taken place in connection with the latter game. Tuesday is a general holiday in this State, and it is only fair and reasonable that an adjournment should take place until half-past 7.",20
44,Mr LIVINGSTON,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Barker) [ n . 6 ] - I asked that the House should adjourn over the opening day of the Agricultural Show, but the Government did not see their way at the time to agree to that request. I am very proud to know that the Acting Prime Minister is asking the House to adjourn over Melbourne Cup day. In doing so he is setting a good example. 1 do not see why the reporters, the messengers, and every one else connected with the business of the House should be kept here on Tuesday, or even brought back at half-past 7. If men are to be given a holiday, they should have a proper one; and sometimes they enjoy themselves much better in the evening. I am sure that when the Acting Prime Minister said half past 7 in the evening he meant half-past 2 next day. I should be very pleased if he made that alteration. I see no reason why a great public holiday should be disregarded by the Commonwealth Parliament. If it is to be a public holiday, the whole of the people should be allowed to share in it. I stayed here on the last Agricultural Show day, and heard a beautiful exposition addressed by somebody in the Ministerial corner to somebody on this side. It sickened the whole Parliament, and would sicken the whole of Australia today to read it. I hope that sort of thing will not happen again for a long while. I commend what the Acting Prime Minister is doing, and hope he will be successful. a Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [11.8] - I should not have interposed in this debate but for the very unfair attack of the honorHe able member for Balaclava on the honourable member for Lang. We very rarely hear that sort of attack made by one honourable member upon another member of his own party, with so little justification. The honourable member for Lang followed an ordinary parliamentary precedent in showing the House exactly how members had viewed the same proposition on a previous occasion, when not faced with Ministerial responsibility for their action. The honourable member was thoroughly entitled to take that course, and was doing service as a member of the House",20

That is the fairest way out of the difficulty, and will put honourable members from all States on the same footing. With regard to the Cup itself, I hope we shall not have any hypocrisy about thing.

ELLIOT JOHNSON - What did I say by way of attack ?",21
59,Mr ROBERTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"It seems unfair to a degree that this attack should be made with the sole purpose of gaining a petty and party advantage over an individual, who is suffering from ill-health. I desire to place on record the fact that I approve of the adjournment; and I am only sorry that the Government should ask us to sit at all on the Tuesday. I suggest that the Attorney-General accept an amendment to adjourn from today until Wednesday afternoon. I should then be able, as 1 usually do at the week-end, to visit my district, and overtake a large amount of public business which has got into arrear because of the long, and, in fact, sweating, hours that we have been sitting. The majority of honourable members, and some hundred persons engaged in other capacities in this House, have a right to the general holiday in Victoria; and they ought not to be dragged back to listen to one or two second-reading speeches that will be delivered during the two or three hours of what is termed public business on Tuesday night. I believe that the great bulk of honourable members would approve of my suggestion rather than make "" two bites of a cherry,"" and thus allow members from New South Wales and Adelaide to visit their homes.  from the more distant States ? Have they to kick their heels about here?",21
60,Mr ROBERTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"The constituents cf members from more distant States do not expect them to visit their districts every week, whereas it is the custom to do so in the case of members from New South Wales and South Australia. A very small percentage of members will be left to ""kick their heels"" about the House, because the majority will take advantage of the holiday to go to the races. Of course, (he honourable member for Maranoa may know nothing about horses, and have no love for them. Doubtless he will go down to the river bank and smile complacently f t the pretty flowers.",22
61,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"I do not think we should be justified in adjourning over Tuesday, unless honourable members consent to sit on the following Monday.",22
62,Mr ROBERTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"That would not get over the difficulty I have indicated. Mi. HUGHES - We must do the work. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I desire to make a personal explanation. In the course of my speech I said not a single word which, by any stretch of imagination, could be distorted into an attack on the Postmaster-General. I merely quoted a portion of a speech made by that honourable gentleman against a proposal of this nature on a previous occasion to show how inconsistent is his present position with the opinion he then expressed; and I did so because he is now a member of the Cabinet from which this motion emanates, and merely asked if he was cognisant of it, or a party to it. I said not one word which could be correctly construed into a personal SL ttcick",22
63,Mr SPEAKER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,Order ! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Surely I am in order in denying the accuracy of allegations levelled at me.,22

I know, of course, that the question is settled in the minds of honourable members, and that we might as well vote at once; but I must say that it is not consistent with the dignity of Parliament, or with the truest ideals of nationhood, that we should be asked to adjourn for the Melbourne Cup, or a horse race of any kind. I do not blame the Attorney-General for submitting the motion, because it was inevitable that it had to be submitted by some one; but I dissent entirely from his contention that this adjournment is for the purpose of giving a holiday to honourable members.",22

68,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Apparentl y it is not the sin, but the fact of being found out that is the trouble! . Mr FINLAYSON - We all know that the proposed adjournment is for the purpose of a horse race. While I am as anxious as any one for a holiday, and believe there are reasons for one, I suggest that it should be on some other day. The National Parliament should not so far forget its dignity as to encourage, not a great "" national "" holiday, but a great "" national "" gamble, because to do so is a prostitution of our ideals and the degradation of national character.  not gamble unless he likes !",22
69,Mr ROBERTS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,-What is the difference between gambling on horses and gambling on bananas?,23
70,Mr FINLAYSON,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"I am not in the least inclined to criticise honourable members who choose to go and see the horse races. I do not pretend to be a conscience for those who believe there is no harm in doing so; I have enough to do to look after my own conduct. But the principles by which I try to guide my life refuse to allow me to encourage in any way what I consider to be one of the greatest dangers to the nation. We have to look forward with considerable dread and fear in regard to the future, owing to the fact that our young people are being encouraged to speculate and gamble in such a way as to destroy that love for honest work which, after all, is the proper foundation on which to build our national prosperity.",23
71,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Is it honest work to come at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and pretend to do something with the majority of honourable members away ? To do so is neither work nor play.",23
72,Mr FINLAYSON,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"That is not the question. Is this National Parliament going to so far abrogate its proper funcattention tions and to neglect its duty as to adjourn for a horse race? The argument that it a general holiday in Victoria does not appeal to me. Such an argument would induce me to hurry to Yass-Canberra as soon as possible. If it is right to adjourn for the Melbourne Cup, it would be quite proper at Yass-Canberra to adjourn cause the local jockey club were holding their annual meeting. We are not a Vicwithout torian Legislature, but the Australian Legislature; and the Government would just as much justified in asking us to journ for some special event in Brisbane as on the present occasion, because of the accident of our meeting in Melbourne. I is beneath our honour and dignity notice of local, parochial, State affairs. The whole of our efforts here should be directed to the widening of our views and to removing local-and parochial influences, which, perprefer haps, affect us too much. We have nothing to do with precedents set by past Parliaments ; we are here to set our own precedents. If precedents are to be followed, two-thirds of the legislation we have already passed must be abandoned. We are here to do what we think is right for the Commonwealth. I am not opposing this motion on any other than personal grounds, in view of what I consider the right and proper thing to do; and, while I would cheerfully enter into a "" stone-wall "" against the Government proposal if it would serve any purpose, I am satisfied to enter my protest against this Parliament so far forgetting what is due to itself as to adjourn for a horse race in any State.",23

It is my intention to take advantage of the holiday to go home; and, as I shall not be here on Tuesday, it would not, perhaps, be proper to vote against the adjournment, as I should do under other circumstances. It would, I think, be very much more honest to have a straight adjournment over the Tuesday than follow the practice of former years.",23
74,Mr FENTON,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,That was humbug !,23
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is quite right. It has been arranged, for instance, that the House should adjourn until half-past 4 on Cup Day, with the understanding that, should only some half-dozen or eight members attend, no should be called to the state of the House. If members wish to go to the Cup is let us adjourn, and allow the officers of the House to have the day free. Do not let us continue the hypocritical pretence that has prevailed in the past, when the afternoon proceedings have been a farce. I suggest an adjournment until Wednesday, beto give members from States like Tasmania, who rarely are able to get home wasting a day, - the opportunity to visit their homes. But whatever we do, let be us be straightforward. Under ordinary adcircumstances I should oppose an adjournment, because I do not think that a National Parliament should adjourn on act count of a horse race, but do not let us be to take hypocritical in the matter.",23

Personally, I do not care whether we adjourn or not, and I shall vote against any adjournment, but if the majority wishes to be away on Tuesday, I do not see what good will be served by assembling in the evening, and bringing back honourable members and the officers of the House for four hours. If we meet in the evening, honourable members will, probably, be excited, and talk about the Cup, instead of attending to serious business. I should like the Attorney-General to either propose an adjournment until Wednesday, or oppose any adjournment at all.",23

There are thousands of adults in Melbourne who, on Tuesday, will not go to Flemington, but will accompany many thousands of juveniles to our various pleasure resorts and picnic grounds. I shall be absent on Tuesday, not at Flemington, but enjoying a good time with the youngsters. Cup Day has become a general holiday, and I shall be ready at any time to take part in a movement to provide a counter attraction to the race meeting. I do not wish to bring back Mr Speaker, the officers of the House, and the press reporters, to an afternoon sitting on Tuesday, at which there will be barely a quorum. The arrangements of the past have been a hypocritical humbug. I have been at Flemington only twice-onc e when the present King was there, and once during the visit of the American Fleet. If the honourable member for Brisbane, or any other honourable member, thinks that he will have time on his hands next Tuesday, let him take the. train to North Essendon, and I will promise him as happy a day's sport as he ever had in his life.",24
78,Mr WEBSTER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"Gwydir) [11.39] - As one of the rational men in the House, I compliment the Acting Prime Minister on the manly way in which he has tackled this question.

82,Mr WEBSTER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPH,"I know more about the matter than the honourable member does. Those who have never been anywhere, or seen anything, are ready to take narrow views. I admit that there is room for reform in regard to the proprietary courses,whose owners make big fortunes out of racing, and do hot treat the public fairly, but where the only concern is legitimate sport, for public amusement and recreation, no evil is done. It is hypocrisy for men to play up to those who sent them here by pretending that they are the pure merinoes. I have never supported meetings on Cup Day, because I have felt that they make a' farce of the business of the country. Those who attend do so in the hope that there will not be a quorum, or that some one will call attention to the state of the House, and that there will be a count out. I hope that the adjournment will not be for the whole of the Tuesday, because this is a business session, and we wish to have a' prorogation as soon as we can.

In my opinion, it will be a mistake to bring every one back for an hour or two in the evening, after we have been holiday making all day. If we adjourn until Wednesday, it will afford many honourable members an opportunity to visit their homes. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he will agree to an adjournmenf until Wednesday.",24

Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.",24
87,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [1.1.53] Despite the close attention that honourable members have given to this measure, we - cannot claim to have covered much of the enormous area or anything like all of the manifold considerations that require to taken into account before pronouncing judicial verdict upon it. It is idle at this hour to attempt more than a brief summary before us. of the general views that most, if not all, honourable members.on this side hold in spect to this great proposal. During short debate several major issues have relatively ignored while side issues, as is uncommon, have engaged a large proportion of our attention. At the same time, in general way, most of the salient points have either been seized or touched upon. to Those who examine the debates hereafter will find that in some particulars, at least, 45 the Bill before us has been examined as well as could be expected in view of the pressure under which we are working. 33 The public have not realized, and probably will not, the full effect of AYES. these propositions which are to form a permanent part of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Those of us who uphold the existing Constitution as, with some faults, a most effective and invaluable development of the Federal principle, applied with very general appropriateness to the conditions of Australia, must realise that the battle to be fought in the country will be apt to turn upon considerations in no degree as important or of as much real substance as those to which we have endeavoured to direct attention. The necessary insufficiency of the criticism we have been able to offer has been due in part to the circumstances of this House, with its block vote on the other side and a distinct minority on ours; and also to the consequential effects of the rate at which we have been legislating. The Government are eviNOES. dently anxious to take the tide while running at its strongest, and to utilize the force generated during the late general election to the last pound of pressure to the square inch that can be brought to bear in this Chamber. Unfortunately, in this as in other Parliaments, there is no speed limit. There is no measured legislative mile by which we can test the rate at which we are travelling.",25
88,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And not even the danger of the speed to the public is regarded.,25
89,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The danger to the public is disregarded, nor have we even an unsympathetic constable, with a more or less reliable stop-watch, to test our gallop. We have neither land-marks nor log to enable us to determine the rate of our progress, as compared with previous sessions, but it is be obviously quite exceptional. It has never a been equalled in relation to measures of such magnitude as those which we have had In the circumstances, therefore, despite certain disabilities, we are redoing our best. Although the Attorneyour General has not occupied more than the been proportion of time due to him in such a not debate-has , indeed, curtailed his remarks on many points unduly-on e could wish a there had been some authority in this matter, before which he could have been brought for putting the five cylinders of his present political motor up to the reckless rate at which we are now travelling. Could any speech be more ostentatiously curt than that which he delivered when moving the third reading of this Bill? It consisted of a gracious bow to you, Mr. Speaker, and a pleasant smile to the House. Apparently, there is no argument that the honourable gentleman feels it necessary at this stage to address to us, and, indeed, for him argument is wholly unnecessary. One of the very few new aspects developed in the course of the debate shows that this measure is principally justified, in the opinion of a great number of honourable members opposite, by the misdeeds and neglect of the State Governments. whole measure might be fitly described as a comprehensive vote of censure against the State Administrations, collectively and severally.",25
90,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is certainly not intended as such.,26
91,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Instance s of what are considered offences committed by one or other of the States have been repeatedly elaborated, although those given were particular, and applied only to single States. The kaleidoscopic conditions which have generally attached to State Legislatures, as well as to the Commonwealth Parliament, suffice to explain most. Although the Attorney-General has not put any such explicit contention before the House, it came in set terms from the lips of the few honourable members opposite who have addressed the House. The bulk of their speeches consisted of charges of derelictions of duty on the part of one or more States, with the demand that this Bill should be passed, because it affords us a remedy. Amendments of the Commonwealth Constitution were never intended to be passed with an eye to our dictating to Legislatures which, like ourselves, are chosen by the electors, receive directions from them, submit their policies to them, ancl are held answerable by them. It is no function of this Parliament to shape its measures, and, above all, its Constitution, in order to control the course which representatives of the majorities of voters in the States think fit to sue. If that were so, we should have a continually changing Constitution, sought to be adapted and re-adapted to the varying circumstances brought about by hosts of different conditions in different States. We each receive direct instructions from the people. No more unsound principle could be pursued than that of justifying amendments of our Constitution by the various changes of political weather in the various State Governments. When considering possible amendments of the Constitution, we should be governed by a far larger view and by a far more serious recognition of the intended permanence of that instrument and the purposes for which it is created. The ground of this line of argument is utterly unsound. With respect to the gradual discovery in this Parliament, during the past few years, of the principal limitations of our powers, one retrospective observation deserves to be made. I do not wish to return to the past, The except in one particular, in which allusion even to State Governments comes fittingly and naturally in this debate. Undoubtedly some, and, I think, on some occasions, all the State Governments in the early days of Federation adopted a distinctly aggressive attitude, which had to be rigidly and sternly resisted in this Parliament. Having been frequently the subject of adverse criticism for the stand we took against such attempted invasions of Federal rights, I can point to our conduct then as justifying our claim to be equally Federal now when resisting attempted Federal aggressions upon the privileges of the States. Those who take a consecutive view of the various phases through which the relations between the Commonwealth and the States have passed, will realise Uiat for some years we were occupied in resisting unjustifiable inroads upon our domain. Now, owing to the swing of the pendulum, the natural duty of consistent Federalists is to be equally active and plain spoken in order to discourage aggressions by the Federation on the preserves of the States. Having borne the brunt of battle then, we should be entitled to a more considerate hearing now from those who advocate unfair invasions of State authority. Again, taunts have been made during the debate in respect of my responsibility for having proposed three, and carried two, amendments of the Constitution. We have held from the first that the Constitution pur- was no stereotyped sacrosanct document, beyond improvement. On the contrary, our persistent assertion has been that it was a living Constitution, growing and intended to grow, and that our duty was to assist its legitimate growth from time to time by every means in our power. Consequently those taunts are timely, since they balance the unjustifiable assertion that the present proposals for amending the. Constitution have met with our dogged, stubborn, and unqualified resistance. Both statements are equally erroneous. The first charge is that we treated the amendment of the Constitution as an easy matter to be readily and hastily resorted to ; the second that we have taken up a position of determined resistance to any attempt to allow it to develop. Neither charge can be in the least substantiated. On the contrary, I claim that the history of this Parliament during the last few years shows, as regards the great majority of its members, a distinct line of policy seeking to avoid both extremes, not treating amendments of the Constitution lightly, but recognising that they lequire special justifications, and proceeding, unhasting and unresting, to face every emergency as it arose. We have never feared to readapt the Constitution either tc new circumstances, or to the more clearly seen demands of old circumstances, in order to make it effective. We have kept the straight and equitable path. Without claiming to be free from mistakes, looking backwards I think the majority of the members in this House must recognise that our party have pursued a thoroughly straightforward and consistent Federal policy. Nor is it true, as some honourable members have been careless enough to allege, that we have exhibited an unreasonable antagonism to the proposals submitted by the Government in this measure. contrary, to every one of its four distinct propositions we have submitted alternatives which were as far as possible definite. I do not claim the existence of an absolute uniformity of opinion upon all points among all members on this side, but their disagreement, if any, has certainly not imposed new disabilities on the free consideration by honourable members of the situation before us in the light of our past knowledge and experience. Although we have acted together, there has been no rigid partisanship, and no appeals to party feeling or party unity. The whole Bill, and all its branches, have been studied freely, frankly, and independently by members on this side, and except in one or two important instances with what may be termed practical unanimity. I should have preferred to see the Government amendments of the Constitution limited to specific propositions, adapted to specific ends. I do not say that those ends should be detailed in the Constitution, but that new departures proposed in the existing Constitution should all be framed as far as possible to permit of the achievement of the specific ends for which amendment is iiow needed. The door should not be thrown wide, as appears to have been the case in several of these clauses, without any clear idea of what may pass through it. AVe must, of necessity, in constitutional amendments, adopt more or less general statements of principle, rather than expressions pointing to particular kinds of legislation. While complying with that necessary condition, the amendments can be so shaped as to exclude to a large degree any entirely unexpected uses of or developments from them. This risk has been by no means provided against in these amendments. That being our view, the opposition which has been offered to the Government proposals has been measured, defined, and express, not based upon vague terms, but concrete. Those who take pains to sift the criticisms which have been offered on this side will find that, so far from shutting the door to improvement ancl advance, we have sought to open it in each case as wide as necessary. Of course, a further question of the urgency of the need for amendments in particular cases would disclose some differences of opinion. There are propositions for the amendment of the Constitution which can be theoretically justified, but for which no pressing need has On the yet arisen. Towards these our attitude is necessarily one of reserve. So far as we can tell, improvements would be possible in those directions, but as no necessity for them has yet arisen, they are capable cf postponement, not only without injury, but to the advantage of the people and of the many interests involved. Unfortunately, the chief amendment we sought to make is not now within our reach. At the very outset we would have severed from these five particular amendments the general issue whether the Constitution can admit such amendments under present circumstances and yet survive. If it had been possible to do this without deciding whether the immediate objects of these alterations are good or bad, we could have settled the prior question simply as affecting the proper theory and practice of Federal government. If such an amendment could have been framed directly-unfortunately , it could not, although it involved, and is in itself, the most vital issue now before uswe should have had an opportunity of asking the people of Australia whether the amendments now proposed in the Constitution, taken all together, were really federal or unfederal-whethe r they involved such a disturbance of the balance of power as would or would not tend to destroy the federal character of the Constitution. That preliminary question is, even now, the greatest issue to be decided in this Bill ; but, unfortunately, it cannot be submitted at all. These amendments may be fatal to Federation, though some of them desirable in themselves. But the voting will be decided by the four or five propositions for specific legislation, without regard to the constitutional results of dealing with them in this fashion. With the programme of the Labour party in their hands, the supporters of that party know what those powers are to be used for. Consequently, as I have said twice before in the endeavour to make this obvious but disregarded point a little more plain, the vote we shall get will disregard the federal and constitutional consequences of those amendments in order to attain certain definite dustrial and business aims.",26
92,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Coul d that not be obviated?,28
93,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The general question could not now be submitted separately. Before popular audiences one will not be able to effectively discuss the distribution of Federal powers while concrete propositions are also at stake. Yet in the particular Bill before us, so great is the invasion that it could have been brought home to the great bulk of the people how violent and unexampled were the changes it meant. They could have been asked whether they were prepared to sacrifice the Federal principle in order to secure industrial alterations in this wholesale way.",28
94,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The people would draw their own deductions.,28
95,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unfortunately , we shall not have this separate, broad, Federal issue in an effective way before the electors. Then there is another difficulty which also the creation of the Government, and also raises a serious obstacle to the free expression of opinion by the electors. That is the launching of these five proposals in a single measure, to which, as a whole, the people are required to say "" Yes"" or "" No."" Having developed this point to some extent on the second reading. I shall not weary honourable members with repetition ; but there is no doubt that, with these five separate and independent proposals, we increase the already existing confusion ol issues. There is first the issue as to the preservation of the Federal principle in the Constitution, and next the issue as to each of the five particular purposes to which these amendments are intended to be applied. Here we have as complex and variegated a set of issues as can be put before the country deliberately confused in one question. That, I venture to say, is distinctly to the disadvantage of the country - whic h is denied, not only a constitutional verdict, but any distinct choice between five different propositions. It has been a defect in our Democracya defect for which the referendum was believed to be a cure-that at general elections there are perhaps a score of different issues, of different subjects, before the people. As they are confined in many cases to the necessity of returning one of two candidates opposed tb each other, they must accept the whole programme of one and reject the whole programme of the other. The electors are thus deprived of in- a discrimination that they should have an opportunity to exercise. In a small country like Switzerland that discrimination has been rendered possible by the continual remission of measures, confined to specific subjects, to the verdict of the electors; but the extent of Australia, and our conditions, render that impossible. Manifestly, then, the referendum, if it is to act as the corrective to the wholesale forcing of party policies upon the electors, must be a referendum on specific subjects. Every man and woman must be invited to say "" Yes "" or "" No "" on each separate issue. But the course adopted by the Ministry deliberately sacrifices the chief virtue of the referendum. It is no corrective; electors are denied that freedom of choice which is their undoubted birth right. There is no necessity whatever in the nature of these proposals why they should be robbed of their free choice. It is perfectly true that these subjects can be said to is be allied; but so could every power for which authority must be sought in this way from the people; it is only a question of more or less. In the present instance the questions are distinct, not in their nature, but in their effects and operation. Each contains very important elements of its own, quite distinctive, and quite effective, if taken by itself. To bunch them together, treating them as though they form part of one whole, while, in fact, they only form a part of the very extensive and varied programme of the Labour party, is to multiply, without any justification or excuse, the disabilities already imposed 011 electors at each general election. Ministers are enforcing their pet projects upon the community in an artificial bunch for party ends and to the denial of the right of discrimination which should belong to every elector of Australia.. The subjects comprised in this Bill lead one very far afield, but my desire is to compress my remarks in the shortest possible time; and I pass on to say a few words on the particular proposals before us. My principal purpose is to indicate clearly in each case the broad alternative that the Opposition desires to be placed before the country. The first amendment relates to Federal trade and commerce; but in fact both the clause relating to corporations and the clause relating to combines also come within this trade and commerce power. In America they would be treated under that head. proposition of the Government destroys as far as it is possible any line of demarcation between the Federal trade and commerce jurisdiction-and that of the States; the former is enormously wide-her e they are merged, whether vested in the States or vested in the Federal Parliament. No doubt, by judicial decisions, some boundary will probably be established between their respective spheres, though the remnant preserved to the States will be relatively trifling. But ignoring the powers relating to corporations, trusts, and to combines, the trade and commerce power of the Commonwealth proposed to be enlarged by the - Government did not call for any distinctive amendment of ours at that point. Any amendment framed by us would have meant a specific proposition, such as the Government have submitted already in relation to - corporations and trusts and combines. It - could have extended the powers of the Commonwealth under the trade and commerce provision without attempting the impossible task of delimiting the power otherwise than as it is delimited under the Constitution. The argument for recognising State boundaries appears on the face of the Constitution. It has been attacked from various points of view, but it is of the very essence of Federation that a central Government should comprise within itself independent, and only in a sense, subordinate bodies, which retain a certain area to themselves. What other bounds could be put to the trade and commerce power, except those of the several States, each of which possesses a territorial domain of its own within that of the principal Government ? No other division is possible; and if the States are to exist as States, I venture to say some such division is essential. If we sweep it away, we shall have nationalized an area so vast that it must fundamentally alter, not only the relations between the Federal partners, but of the States themselves. The present boundary is the natural and necessary concomitant of a Federal Constitution, is which the existence and activity of the States is in their way and within their domain as important as that of the National Government. The life principle of Federation demands the perpetual cooperation of the central and national power with responsible and effective local powers.",28
96,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hav e we not been trying all through to remove these State lines ? This Mr DEAKIN - Yes , wherever that is essential to the better working of the federal system; but, in my opinion, the removal of boundaries here proposed would be fatal. The advantages gained would not compensate by any means for the impoverishment of our local governing bodies, and we should impede, in a very short time, the future development of Australia. Although the precedent of Canada has been quoted, most of us never considered that the Dominion enjoyed a really Federal Constitution. If now, at this stage, we try to adopt the Canadian principle, we shall not be following it exactly, but only so far as to throw the whole trade and commerce realm of the provinces open to the Commonwealth Government so far as it can take it. We shall be departing from that classic definition of federal government which endows the central government with none but limited and enumerated powers. It is all very well to say that we enumerate a ""power"" over ""trade and commerce,"" and, in a certain sense of the word, we do; but in act and in fact so wide and vague is that sphere that the words "" trade and commerce"" cover without defining them a large group of powers, many of them still undefined, and nearly all of them capable of development. Within that very wide range such an endowment can scarcely be called limited. Limits will be discovered, at some time; but, in fact, it is not strictly an ""enumerated"" "" power,"" nor is it a power which, in the Federal sphere, is fairly described as "" limited."" In respect to the second amendment proposed by the Government-that relating to corporations-w e took the objection that the transfer of the whole authority over such bodies was not called for by any evidence laid before us, and was also in the teeth of a very strong decision by a Justice of the High Court, quoted in extenso by the honourable member for Flinders. The late Attorney-General proposed, in the memorandum which was issued last year, a very effective, though limited, authority over corporations, which could have been vested in the Commonwealth without impairing the efficiency of State legislation, or bringing about the chaos which Mr Justice Higgins' judgment sho\ys will be the sequence of the step we are now asked to take. As to the amendment respecting trusts and combines, the Opposition has given the Government its support, though desiring that restraint of trade should be a material condition rendering them amenable to our law. We have given the Government a broad and general assurance that any power which it can show to be required to enable this Parliament to cope in the most effective manner with trusts, combines, and monopolies, would be heartily supported. Ministers have not chosen to accept our overtures. We have thus offered two trade and commerce alternatives, to which they did not give the fair consideration which their practicability demanded.",29
97,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The High Court will have to decide as to the effectiveness.,30
98,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am satisfied, especially since hearing the arguments of my learned friends, that these two would have been absolutely effective. By the adoption of either we should have done all that is necessary now in its sphere, and prepared for a good deal that may be foreseen, though remote. As to the very important industrial amendment, the honourable member for Parramatta put forward a proposition expressing in general terms the alternative of the Opposition. He wished to insert the wordsIn the opinion of this House the industrial provisions of the Constitution should not be altered except to regulate conditions of ment in all industries that are federal in operaand tion, or which cannot be effectually regulated by any oue State, further enabling the Inter-State Commission to prevent and remove unfair competition between the same industries carried on in different States. The proposal is not drafted in the technical language necessary for embodiment in the Bill, but it makes clear the intention of the Opposition to enable the Commonwealth to regulate conditions of employment in all Inter-State industries which cannot be effectually regulated by the States, and to prevent unfair competition between the same industries carried on in different States.",30
99,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member provided for the same power as the Government asked for, but in a different way.",30
100,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The power the Government asked for goes far beyond what was proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta. It is unconditioned. The proposal of the honourable member beside me would meet the actual needs of today and provide against the disabilities in sight, whereas the Government proposal is not bounded by any visible horizon, and is therefore capable, in the opinion of most of us, of being very seriously misapplied. We claim that amendments of the Constitution should be carefully adjusted to the particular evils of which we know. Until now our endeavour has been to treat industrial differences and dissonances extending beyond State limits by judicial or semi-judicial processes, and to establish an independent Court to deal with industrial causes as legal causes are dealt with, but without the technical restrictions of Courts of law. Our Arbitration Court, as such, has done all that could be expected. Part of its duty was to discover the legal limitations necessarily implied as a corollary of the Constitution interpreted as a Federal whole. That, unfortunately, has resulted in a serious curtailment of the powers which we thought the Court could exercise, and makes amendment necessary. The Court must be equipped for the work which it is intended to do, and was thought capable of doing. We have always looked forward to the extension of its jurisdiction to all the Federal industries of the country conducted by private enterprise. Form first to last we resisted all attempts of the Commonwealth to interfere in the management of the railways through the employees of the States, just as we resist any attempt by the States employ- to intervene between the Commonwealth its employee's; both invasions are inconsistent with the Federal principle, and involve the destruction of the balance of power between them. On that subject have no wish to repeat myself. At no time have 1, either directly or indirectly, sanctioned an invasion of this kind. Government of which 1 was the head retion signed rather than consent to such an inover vasion. But this proposal of the Attorney-General is, not simply to follow the old road of judicial determination, securing industrial peace by the arbitration of an independent and qualified Court, sitting aloof from political and party influences, interests of employers and employed. He asks us to follow a new road. Under proposal, not only may our present judicial authority continue over industrial differment ences, but also that of this Parliament, apart from any Court, except so far as ordinary interpretation of its statutes concerned. We are to be empowered to dictate by Act all the conditions of employare ment of all or anv of the employees in the railways of the States. It is proposed to take specifically this far-reaching invidious power to legislate respecting State railways. This point has been missed by critics outside, but it will the chief 'thing to impress on the electors when they are asked to arrive at a deciThe sion. If the authority that is asked for granted, this Parliament will be able pass laws declaring how many hours should be worked each day by any or each of the various classes of railway employees, the wages which they shall receive, holidays which they shall enjoy, the terms of apprenticeship in the service, and hundred and one other matters.",30
101,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable ber think that it would _ do that without the absolute necessity arising?,31
102,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No Federal Parlianow ment should claim a power over its States which even those who ask for it declare ought not to be exercised. Parliamentary powers are given for use, ancl can only granted on such a supposition. This Government wishes to give this Parliament a power which now belongs only to the State Parliaments. a transfer would be fatal to the sovereignty of the States, as well as to the proper conduct of the railways, since their control into the hands of a body in no way responsible for the proper, managenished ment of a business in which ^150,000,000 has been invested. This Parliament would incur no financial or practical responsibility for the working results of a law that 11 I passed with respect to State railways. Consider the effect upon the discipline of those engaged in the service whose appeals One would be to this Chamber. Our assumpofâpower to decide such questions all Australia would cause such a shifting of the centre of gravity in our Constitution as would in itself, quite apart from the other proposals in this Bill, destroy the Federal character of our government, and obliterate the true line of demarcation between the spheres of the central and the studying the local Governments.",31
103,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has not every sovehis reign power in the world got it ?,31
104,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Every Unitary Governhas, of course, the control of its employees, and so has every Federal Govern the ment of its Federal employees. But we is must not forget that the States have borrowed money to build their railways and responsible for it. They tax their elecall tors to maintain tliose railways, and to them they are first responsible. They adand just their railways to their own local policies of land development and other considerations. This greatest of governmental be enterprises is related to and intertwined with all the practical functions of the State. railways are their largest investment is and best means of their development. If lo we take from them the power of their control we beggar them at once. There can be but one outcome. The only justification for this proposal would be an the intention on die part of this Parliament to take over the whole of the railin a ways of Australia as its property, and with them the whole responsibility for memthe debts incurred. Even then the Commonwealth would be vastly inferior as an agent for local development to the agencies existing in the States; but it would, at all events, have assumed the responsibility properly associated with this legislation. This power ought not to exist be divorced from that responsibility. The great transcontinental lines which it is proposed to build can be undertaken federally without any such ruthless inroads. Such Mr HUGHES - How does the honourable member distinguish between the maintenance of national peace generally and industrial it would put peace generally?",31
105,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already fura sufficient answer for this stage. That can be secured by Federal means. There is a gulf between private enterprise, in any form, and public enterprise under the control of Parliaments, Federal 01 State, elected by the men and women, responsible for the whole cost and charges of that enterprise, and dealing with it freely subject to their responsibilities. Such enterprises dealt with, not by an outside body, but by the State electors, who are all shareholders in their railways, are sure to adjust themselves to the equities of employment. The State railways are conducted in the interests of the electors who build them, pay for them, man them, and bear the responsibility for them. The gulf between State railways, owned by the electors, including the employees, and those which are owned by another body altogether, consisting of private shareholders, or, as in America, perhaps, of a few capitalists, is unbridgable. Over private railways the law requires to be mandatory in the public interests, but not for State employees, nor from one Federal centre. Add to your vague extension of the trade and commerce and industrial powers this power of specific industrial legislation with its other incidentals overriding our State electors in State affairs, and you arrive at results that I shall not attempt to calculate. They will prove very much more serious to the electors when the full scope of Federal authority in these matters is finally measured. It is far wider than even the members of the legal profession appear to have realized. I note in passing the one little humorous gleam that can be detected in the Government measure now before us. If it be passed and accepted by the people every restriction imposed upon the Federal powers conferred by section 51 of the Constitution will be removed with one exception. The State sovereignty will be proudly asserted against the overmastering Commonwealth in one sphere. Their Legislatures will retain the right to govern the privileges of their citizens when fishing within territorial waters. Within three miles from the shore, the fishermen of a State, as fishermen, will be beyond our authority. I do not say that they will be beyond our trade and commerce, or navigation powers. Fishermen in the act of baiting their lines, throwing them in, and drawing them up again may be for the moment sovereign State citizens. That ought to be a consolation and comfort when the whole of their remaining independence has been swept away. Between the time that they hook a fish and draw it upwhile the fish is on the hook or getting offMr Deakin. they may be in most circumstances free citizens of a free State. I have thus hastily endeavoured to deal broadly with a measure which effects more important changes in the government of Australia, and contains more potentialities than any other that this Parliament has had before it. No other Bill, however long, complex, or high-sounding its title, has contained as much as this single sheet of print. The remedy is out of all proportion to our complaint: Its effects may be likened to that of a surgical operation on the vital organs in a case in which the ailment might be met by simple treatment, without resort io any dangerous expedient. Whether the patient-the public-wil l realise this risk in time it is unnecessary to prophesy, but certainly the measure is more heavily freighted with the fortunes of the people of Australia than any other which has come before this or any other Parliament in Australia. The consequences, if it be sanctioned, will be fatal to Federation. If it be not sanctioned, this Parliament can soberly return to its task of devising more practicable and immediate measures to meet our existing needs-w e have ourselves pointed to a certain number which require to be met-bu t they can be coped with cn well-beaten ground without hazardous and reckless excursions into the immeasurable hinterland of dangers and destructions that must be associated with this short measure.",31
106,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cook) [12.55] The Leader of the Opposition has been busily engaged in placing some scarecrows on the end of poles with a view of frightening the people when they are called upon to vote upon this question. I desire to refer briefly to a few points made by the honourable member in what I may describe as his scarecrow speech. In answer, apparently to the criticism levelled against him in the newspapers that he simply offered a destructive criticism of our measures, and suggested nothing to take their place, the honourable member came along this morning with a lengthy and cunningly drawn suggested alternative which he desired to have placed upon the records. When viewed dispassionately, it must be seen that it would be simply a menace, and could be used as an engine of interminable disputes to be referred to the High Court. It would eventually land us in the same idiotic position in which we find ourselves today, because of the fact that, although there is an arbitration power in the Constitution, whenever we endeavour effectively to exercise it, believing that we can do that which the people thought we could when they accepted the Constitution, it is found that our power is reduced to a nullity. The honourable member complained that although previously we had sought for an arbitration power in regard to industrial disputes, we were seeking in this Bill for power over labour and employment. He complains that we are not proposing to place in our Constitution the machinery by which we intend to deal with these questions. I would remind him that even a friendly society does not place in its constitution the whole of the means by which it seeks to carry out its fundamental objects. Friendly societies broadly state their objects in their constitutions, and by means of bye-laws and other machinery seek to give effect to them. And so in our national Constitution we cannot place the whole of the machinery by which we propose to give effect to the policy of the Labour party, or by which it is proposed to meet the various evils in connection with the body politic. The Leader of the Opposition knows that perfectly well, but because we propose to take power over labour and employment he says at once, "" Look what dreadful things you will be able to do by the exercise of. that power."" Because we do not seek to limit the Commonwealth to a Conciliation and Arbitration tribunal for the adjustment of industrial disputes, the honourable member suggests that we shall be able to do numerous things of a terrible character. The same argument might be used against everv power for which the Constitution provides. Since we have exclusive power over marriage we could pass an Act forbidding a man to marry before reaching the age of forty years ; but we do not propose anything of the kind. The honourable member suggests that because we have power to do certain things we are going to do them. That is an idiotic suggestion. He might just as well say that our unlimited powers to pass laws with respect to marriage must lead to the same results. Our power of taxation is unlimited. We could practically tax every man off his holding; but to say that because we have the power to do so, we should exercise it, is to go to the most ridiculous length. The honourable member's argument SIKWS the extremes to which the Opposition are prepared to go in their efforts to scare the people in regard to the effects of this measure. We have unlimited power over immigration, and could pass a law declaring that not an immigrant should place his foot on our shores; but are we going to do anything of the kind? It would be just as reasonable to say that we intended to pass such a law as it is to say that if we obtain this power we shall do all the dreadful things which the Leader of the Opposition has suggested. Sitting suspended, from 1 to 2.30 p.m.",32
107,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [2.30] - I am sorry that I cannot bring to bear upon' the consideration of this important question the ripe experience that I believe is absolutely necessary to form an adequate judgment upon the great issues involved. It seems to me that, to any alteration which it is desired to make in the Constitution, we should apply the test of whether it makes for the true government of Australia from a Federal stand-point. We must bear in mind that the compact into which the States entered was Federal. That is to say, certain powers were delegated by the States to the National Parliament, others were left absolutely to the States, and the control with regard to certain others was bisected. There appears to be in the minds of a number of honourable members, and also in the country, an idea that there can be no true national growth, or development along national lines, unless further powers are given to the National Parliament. I believe that we shall have the truest form of national growth and development by a development of the Federal ideal. Let us then apply that test to the proposals of the present Government. In the alterations of the Constitution which they have put before us for our consideration, they have not attempted to develop the Federal ideal so much as to take over complete powers. It is not a question of whether this Parliament will exercise those complete powers or not. The point is that it is now taking over the whole of the powers in regard to trade and commerce and industrial matters. I believe that the only result of this will be to shift the great' difficulty which has existed up to the present from one point to another. It has beencontended throughout the debate on this measure that the great difficulty arising from the bisection of those two powers is that it is impossible to ascertain the precise point where the Federal jurisdiction ends and that of the State begins. But the Government are simply creating the same difficulty in probably a worse form. Honourable members opposite have said over and over again that they do not desire to take over the control of industrial matters, or complete powers in regard to trade and commerce, and that they have not the faintest intention of exercising them if they do take them. They seem altogether to forget that the State Governments will still continue to exercise those powers in relation to trade and commerce and industrial matters, and all that will have been achieved by this Parliament taking over the whole of the powers in question is"" that in the future, instead of the Courts having to determine whether the Federal Parliament has overstepped its constitutional limitations, they will have to decide from time to time whether the legislative powers which the States are continuing to exercise have intruded, in any respect, into the domain over which the Federal Parliament is by this legislation taking jurisdiction.  member know that all Federal powers are paramount to State powers?",33
108,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is precisely my difficulty. The Federal power is paramount, and while the supporters of the Government claim that they do not wish - to take over the whole of the industrial power, they forget that the States will go on exercising a certain amount of power in regard to certain industrial relationships, and, therefore, the time must come when State legislation will clash with Federal. It will then be for the High Court to determine whether the State laws have intruded upon or interfered with the legislation passed by the Federal Parliament. I , therefore, do not see that by passing this measure the Government are in any way getting away from the legal difficulties and technicalities which surround the whole of these great questions. I do not regard the Constitution as in any way sacred. In regard to industry and trade and commerce, I believe it is absolutely necessary for this Parliament to pass legislation to enable the country to give us additional powers. That, however, is not to say that it is necessary for us"" to take over the whole control iii regard to both trade and commerce and industry. think we must have additional power to enable us to deal effectively with trusts, combines, and monopolies in restraint of trade, because none of us wishes to see in Australia the state of affairs that exists in America. I have, however, waited very patiently throughout the debate to hear why, in order to do this, it was necessary to abandon altogether the Federal ideal, and take over the whole power in regard to trade and commerce. Throughout this long argument I have not heard a single reason advanced to justify that course. I have heard it stated, over and over again, that we must take over the whole trade and commerce power in order to be able to deal with trusts, combines, and monopolies, but no one has attempted to prove the necessity, and it is because it has not been proved that I feel bound to vote against the passage of this measure. I believe it is also necessary that we should have additional power over industrial matters to enable us to legislate in such a way as to bring into line, in relation to industries in different States, awards which are productive of unfair competition between State and State. But why, to achieve that object, is it necessary for us to take over the whole industrial power? Why should the control of such industries as baking, butchering, and bricklaying, pass into the hands of this Parliament? I can quite understand the anxiety of honourable members opposite to avoid the difficulties that have arisen in the past, necessitating different industrial bodies spending their money in constant appeals to the Courts, and ^involving the employers in a like expense, only to find that, in regard to the matters in dispute, this Parliament has no power to legislate. But I cannot understand why honourable members do not approach this question from a truly Federal stand-point, and honestly endeavour to carry out the compact we entered into ten years ago. Why is it not possible to look at this matter from a common-sense point of view, and face the responsibility that ever devolves on this Parliament, placing issues before the people m such a manner that they will know exactly for what they are voting? A great'deal has been said during the course of the debate that is altogether wide of the mark. The actions of Legislative Councils, and so forth, have absolutely nothing to do with - the subject-al l these it ' is within the power of the people to alter I from time to time as they see necessary. The States all enjoy the same suffrage; and even Tasmania has it within her power to alter her industrial conditions. I see no reason why, because Tasmania has not answered to her responsibilities, New South Wales, where the people have done everything possible to bring about fair industrial conditions, should be called upon to practically sacrifice her rights.",34
109,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has not studied the Tasmanian Constitution !,35
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not a question of studying the Tasmanian Constitution j the Tasmanian people have it in their power, if they set themselves to work, to make any alteration they think necessary in their Constitution to carry their will. There is no reason whatever why, because Tasmania may not have done her duty in this respect, the rights of the other States should be swept away. In my opinion, no one can be a true Federalist who does not believe in State rights. The whole Federal ideal and principle rests on the recognition of the rights of both Commonwealth and State j and it is essential for the development of the Federal ideal that those rights should be preservedI have stated as concisely as I can the objections I have to the measure before us. I only hope that when the questions are submitted to the people the true issues will be stated in such a way""as to show clearly what is really at stake, namely, the entire sweeping away of the rights of the States in regard to the two great fundamental principles of governmentI trust that the people of Australia will adhere to the true Federal ideal, and reject these proposals, because It is only possible for Australia to advance unchecked along the pathway of national development and national growth in accordance with that principle",35
111,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"North Sydney) [2.50] - If any apology were necessary for speaking on the third reading, it would be found in the fact that this Bill is one for the amendment of the Constitution. But there is a second reason in the fact that I had no opportunity of speaking on the second reading. I was to have spoken this day week, but, to suit the convenience of honourable members on both sides, who desired to get to their homes, I waived my right. There is even a third reason presented in the very nature of the measure, in regard to which it was impossible to express a final opinion until it had emerged from Committee, so much depending on how far the proposals might be modified before being submitted to the people for their opinion. I am, therefore, going to exercise my right to speak on the third reading; and I have to admit that my position in regard to the measure is somewhat peculiar, and demands explanation. I yield to no one in my veneration for the Constitution. The citizens we sent to the Federal Convention did most admirable work, and the Constitution has stood the test of ten years' experience, and the criticism of some of the ablest writers in the world. We have all to admit that, excepting certain known defects and slight blemishes, the work of the Convention was well done; and it behoves us to be very cautious and discreet before deciding on any amendment. An amendment might be desirable, and yet it might be still more desirable that the fullest consideration should be given to ihe question before it was rushed before the public. Our Constitution is such that we ought not only to yield to it a very large measure of respect, but also to inculcate a veneration for it in the minds of the young; indeed, I should go so far as to say that copies ought to be hung on the walls of our schools and in our marts so that the children and those actively engaged in the work of the Commonwealth should see it day by day and learn to reveraice it as representing the freedom they enjoy. On the other hand, one of the most important features of the Constitution, for which we can give credit to its framers, is its flexibility and the power of amendment should occasion arise. The one absolute defect in the United States Constitution-whic h was lauded so much more highly than ours when it was launched on the world-is that it is practically incapable of amendment. Were it not for what has been very aptly termed the "" judicial audacity "" of certain great Chief Justices of the American Supreme Court that Constitution would have proved so inflexible as to have caused its utter abolition j in fact, it did bring about a rebellion which, had it been successful, would have meant a revolution and a new form of Constitution. That rebellion cost an immense amount of money, and was defeated at great loss of life on the part of the Union. We are happy in the fact that our Constitution enables us to amend it if occasion arises; but I say again that we should regard with the utmost caution any proposal to that end. Even if we think it necessary to take steps to place proposed amendments before the public, we should so defer and delay them as to secure the fullest criticism and consideration. Although we may retrace our steps at any time, the question is so serious that adequate opportunity should be afforded for testing all the powers we have under the Constitution. We should not endeavour ruthlessly to amend it in a form the ultimate effects of ' which we can not foresee. But there is nothing sacrosanct about the Constitution; it is there to be altered. I am inclined to agree with the honourable member who preceded me that, within certain limits, a case has been made out for the serious consideration on the part of the Legislature and the public of the amendment of the Constitution. That was impressed on my mind, and that of many others, long before this session of Parliament. Recent events, including the decisions of the High Court, have accentuated the feeling that an amendment is growing day by day more necessary, and that, within certain limits, Parliament is fully justified in taking the 'question into consideration with a view to legislation for the prevention of industrial disputes. How should an amendment of the Constitution be approached? It cannot be too strongly impressed on us that it ought to be approached with an entire absence of party spirit. It has been stated by honourable members on both sides of the House that the measure was being approached with a total disregard of party allegiance; but I have watched the debate closely for the last fortnight, and I regret to say that this question, as every other question, has been dealt with almost entirely from a party point of view. It was impossible that it could be otherwise. The - developments that have taken place in the organization of parties and their relations and differing ways of managing affairs, have still more restricted this serious tion to the influence of party feeling and party limitations than ever liefore. One section of the Legislature, upstairs, has been considering this question day by day, fettered by their relations to a party organization, and another section, less numerically, has been considering it downstairs, more or less fettered by the fact that they were opposed by a party which was plainly a stone wall-no t to be moved, not to be appealed to, in any respect in regard to these proposals. Is that the proper way in which this House should grapple with the question of an amendment of the Constitution, the object of which is to meet admitted defects, seen by some of us from the first? Have we approached this, matter in the right spirit, or can so? For my part, I admit that we cannot, and I deeply regret that the ConstiMr G. B. Edwards. tution did not provide some other means of amendment. It would have been far better to summon another Convention to consider serious amendments of this kind. That would take it out of the hands of members of Parliament, on whom are imposed party loyalty, and the consideration of party advantage. The Convention appointed to frame the Constitution was composed of men who met without preconceived ideas. Their determinations were arrived at without party heat, and their three sessions were separated by considerable intervals of time, during which the full blaze of public and press criticism was poured on their work, of which criticism they were able to take advantage. Here we are doing now still more important work. The Constitution has been tested, and has been found in working to possess certain defects. During the last election, in the heat of the party conflict, certain proposals were made by the Labour party, and others by the present Opposition, and members have come to this House determined to amend the Constitution, not in the light of reason, and the sober consideration of the facts, but influenced by the desire to achieve a party triumph, so that if the proposed amendments be made, attempts to remove them from the Constitution again must follow. The measure provides for four important amendments of the Constitution. But if we seek for a clear expression of the public will, we must put before the citizens simple questions, each standing by itself, and capable of being answered by a "" Yes "" or a "" No."" The Government, to insure the success of its four proposals, has quesgrouped them together, so that the public will be compelled to answer "" Yes "" or "" No "" in regard to all of them. Should the electors have no better grasp of the effect of the proposed amendments than honourable members have displayed, they will be puzzled as to how to vote. If the four questions were put before them separately, there would probably be an almost unanimous affirmative vote for one amendment, and a very large majority for another. One, and, possibly, two, of the amendments would almost certainly be agreed to. As it is, we may how have the whole four carried, or may lose them all. I have, from the first, been aware of certain defects in the Constitution, of which one of the most marked is the provision of section 51 emwe do powering the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the preservation and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. Long before the lawyers had pointed out the many diffiment culties in this provision, I said that I not understand the logical or grammatical meaning of the word ""extending,"" nor the true limitation of the preceding words, These difficulties have since been admitted by the High Court itself. The Leader of the Opposition, in one of the most splendid speeches he ever delivered, a speech so fine that the honourable member for Parkes said that it should have been set to music, ushered in proposals for industrial peace which I felt should achieve one of the greatest ends of our national government, But after eight years' trial, the measure has broken down. That, in itself, calls for an amendment of the Constitution, State legislation and tribunals are not cient to preserve industrial peace. must have a national tribunal sitting above them to compose the differences between State and State. Unless our Court powerful enough to do that, we must leave the field, or make it more powerful. I am in thorough accord with the proposal the amendment of the Constitution to enduties, able us to increase the powers of the Court, but honourable gentlemen opposite remind me of Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who, having discovered the merit of roast commenced to burn down house after house to enjoy it. Having obtained sufficient power to deal with industrial disputes, should we go further and take all power . Does not this defeat our own ends? The settlement of industrial turmoil should left at first to the State authorities; Commonwealth should step in only when is necessary to compose differences State and State, or where the operations industry extend beyond any one State. have always been ready to go as far as son would dictate, and yesterday voted the third clause of the Bill, not because - thought that it did not go too far, cause it went further than the majority my party would go. I do not need to reminded that in 1904 I supported vision for bringing within the conciliation and arbitration law the railway employees of another. the States, it still being my conviction if the national power is to be used - serve industrial peace, it must apply State employees, and particularly to railway employees. If there is anything Australia liable to bring about far-reaching Industrial warfare, it is a dispute nexion with railway management. It argued by some that the Victorian railway strike was a matter for the State Governalone, it being responsible for the could management of the lines and the repayment of the moneys borrowed to build them, I held, however, that all means of transport by land or by water are the concern of the whole of Australia, and that there could not be a general strike in one State without great loss to the whole continent, We are all interested in keeping the wheels going round, a stoppage in Victoria affecting passenger traffic and goods transport all over Australia. It is all very well for honourable members to say that the proposal under consideration strikes at the heart of State rights. We do not wish to interfere with State rights, so long as these do not obscure national rights. When a consuffiflict affecting the whole Commonwealth Vou arises, it is the duty of the National Parliament to put an end to it. Indeed, before such a conflict can arise we should pass laws is to prevent it. It must not be forgotten that we haye the right to impose import duties on the rails which are used for the construction for of the State lines, and do impose such and there is no great difference between doing that and increasing rates of wages to bring the remuneration of all employees to a uniform standard. The pig, day has gone by for opposition to laws for the preservation of industrial peace and the settlement of differences between masters why and men, but such legislation cannot be ? successful unless it is universal. If a Victorian Wages Board increased the pay of be bootmakers from 8s. to ios., and a New the South Wales Board refused to follow suit, it the boot manufacturers of the latter between State could undersell those of the of former, both within and without the ComI monwealth, and thus discontent would arise, reaThe very ideal of our Federal government for is that just and uniform laws shall prevail I throughout Australia-that we should not but beallow that there is the least difference ot in our legislative duty between one be State and another-and that there shall a probe no privilege _ favouring a merchant or manufacturer in one State as against We need, therefore, as far that as we can obtain it, an appellate or to preFederal _ Court to try to bring about to uniformity of industrial conditions throughState out the States. Then, again, we have the in argument that was advanced here yesterday, and was received with laughter by in consome honourable members, that since Taswas mania lags behind and will not introduce industrial legislation it is useless to say to those who desire a prosperous and justlynecessary. governed nation that Tasmania can pass such laws if she chooses to do so. To serve the character of the legislation of other States we must insist upon Tasmania taking action, and if she refrains from doing so, we must act for her, and secure uniformity of industrial legislation by means, perhaps, of some common rule. The Government having gone as far as any one could desire-and a good deal further than I should have gone under clause 3- t0 bring about a change in respect of what admit are the essential difficulties of Constitution, I felt constrained yesterday to vote in accordance with my convictions for that proposal. At the same time not endorse that clause in its entirety. It was only on Wednesday night'that the vernment submitted to us a perfectly new set of proposals to take the place of clause 3 in the Bill as originally introduced, on the following morning we were called upon to deal with them. It was imposextension sible in a matter of such extreme importbelieving ance tor any one to frame an alternative that would give adequate play for the pression of one's opinions. I felt that was impossible for me to suggest an ternative to which I could pin my faith, and consequently I was compelled to for that which went in a direction of which I approved, although it went further than thought necessary. But now, having reached the last stage of the Bill, I have to ask myself whether I can endorse it. It matmaining ters little whether I do or do not. The Bill is going to be passed by this House, and the people will be called upon to for themselves whether or not these posed amendments of the Constitution shall be made. I have, however, my own rethe sponsibilities. I strongly desire to see amendment of the Constitution providing for an effective measure of conciliation arbitration, and affording us a satisfactory method of settling quarrels between ployers and employees. But I have to ask myself, "" Can I swallow the whole of these four propositions with their wide-reaching effects?"" And I am obliged reluctantly to confess that I cannot. It is not right to call upon the public to say ""Yea"" "" Nay"" to the whole of these four questions, submitted to them as one proposihonorable tion. I feel, with many honourable members on this side of the House, that we need wider power to enable us to deal effectively with trusts and combines; but the Governvision or. G. B. Edwards. ment are going further than is absolutelyI f it were proposed to submit these four questions separately to the preelectors, then, although I am opposed to the three of them, I should vote for the third reading of the Bill. Believing as I do in the principle of the referendum and the initiative, I should not by my vote prevent questions being submitted to the electors for their decision. But when I am asked to agree to a proposal that four questions shall be submitted as one to the people, and that they shall be called upon to sav I "" Yea "" or "" Nay "" to the whole of them out - whe n I know that only a. lame and impotent verdict can thus be obtained- I am obliged to say tiiat I must vote against the I do third reading of this measure.",35
112,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [3.21] - I Gohave expressed in Committee my views on the several clauses of this Bill, and wish now to make only one or two observations and before we are called upon to vote upon the measure as a whole. I supported an of our trade and commerce power, it desirable that we should widen the basis of our future legislaextion, and that, in the words of the Leader it of the Opposition, we should transfer to althe Commonwealth some of that vast reservoir of residuary power which now rests vote with the States. The Commonwealth is certainly entitled to share some of that reI serve of power, and, believing so, I voted for the trade and commerce clause. There are several features in connection with the reprovisions-thos e relating to corporations, trusts, and combines, and industrial matters-wit h which I agree, and I say regret very much that they have been all progrouped in one Bill, so that honourable members are compelled to accept or reject whole of them. In the circumstances an I am sorry to say that the extremes to which the Government have gone in connection and with the provisions relating to industrial matters, corporations, and trusts, and more emparticularly the very serious blow which"" they have aimed at the sovereignty of the States in connection with their railway proposals-fh e result of which must mean the subversion of all discipline in State services - wil l compel me to vote against the motion or for the third reading of the Bill.",38
113,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [3.23] - The member for Wimmera intends to vote against the third reading of this Bill a chiefly because of the clause relating lo railway employees. That is_ the one proto which I take a decided objection. and I have now to consider whether my opposition to that clause, and the dangers that I foresee in it. would justify me in ing against the third reading of the Bill. All the other provisions meet with proval, and upon consideration I think that the advantages of the measure genemember rally greatly outweigh the disadvantageswhich, after all, may be regarded as problematical-of the proposal to bring railway servants under the Federal power. In the circumstances, therefore, justified in voting for this motion.",38
114,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Maribyrnong) [3.25] Like the honourable member for North Sydthat strike? ney I had intended to speak to the motion for the second reading of this but as there was a desire to come to speedy division, I , in common with a ber ot other honourable members, waived right to do so. Since I understand that is proposed within a few minutes to take a division on this motion, I shall do nothing to interfere with that arrangement, but desire, before the Bill finally passes, a few observations. I was struck with"" force of the arguments used by the honorattention able member for Flinders in support of the trade and commerce clause, concerning which he did not express the doubts and fears to which the honourable member for Ballarat and others associated with him have given utterance. His arguments in favour of that clause were both eloquent and forcible, but when we reached the clause relating to industrial matters, seemed to turn to the "" right-about."" To my mind, the arguments that apply to trade and commerce clause must apply wjth equal force to that relating to industrial matters. I am one of those who thoroughly believe in the extension of our powers State railway employee's. I have not the slightest fear that in taking this step shall trench upon the preserves or rights the State Parliaments. Indeed, I strongly hold the view that it is only right that there should be established a Federal authority able to deal with disputes rebe lating to our railways. I ask honourable members to consider for a moment the great industrial dispute in France. The thought has been running through my mind during the last few minutes, "" What would have been the position had France been divided into States? What would have happened if there had not been one big national power to deal with that industrial disand pute?"" The disaster, instead of costing rtie nation only 1,000,000, would doubtedly have meant an infinitely greater loss. If secondary or State Parliaments vothad been called upon to deal with that great industrial dispute with its ramifications my apspreading throughout the country",39

117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member believe in the suppression of,39
118,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am speaking, not of Bill, the strike itself, but of the methods a adopted in dealing with it.

The word that attracts my above all others in this Billthe word in which I believe most strongly - d s the word "" prevention."" To my mind prevention is better than cure, and when we have the control of disputes affecting all industries, in my opinion there will be no recurrence of the serious strikes that have besmirched the National escutcheon.",39
119,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [3.29]. he - I understand that there is a general desire to proceed to a division, and for that the reason, and also because it seems to me that the merits of this particular Bill have passed beyond the region of discussion in this House, I shall occupy the attention of to honourable members for only a few minutes. The discussion must be left now we to another arena, and anything further that of may be said here can really be of no avail Notwithstanding the remarks which have been made by certain honourable members opposite, I have enough human nature to rather strongly tempted to reply to some of the criticisms levelled at me, but I am going to repress the desire to do so. I intend absolutely to repress the old Adam within me at present, but perhaps I may be permitted to_make a few brief remarks on the general aspect of the Bill as it now stands. The speeches that I made on the motion for the second reading in Committee, were sufficiently distinct to convey to the minds of honourable memunbers on both sides of the Chamber, and to the country at large, what my views are on the principal parts of the original Bill. I said that that Bill, in the form in which it first came down, contained defects, that some of the clauses were badly drafted, and that others would produce great inconvenience unless remodelled, but that no amendments of ours would be accepted. For all that, I said the two main provisions in the measure-the general extension of the commerce clause and the general extension of the industrial power of this Parliament-were advances in constitutional development which I thought would be full of benefit and advantage to this continent, and must come sooner or later. But the Government, for its own reasons, has, at the very last moment of the debate, seen fit, either of its own volition or under pressure, to attach to those principles a provision which, in my opinion, is pregnant with mischief for the future of this country, and pregnant with strife of the worse kind between the Commonwealth and the States. The attempt to sever a certain power and the responsibility for the exercise of that power would, I pointed out, produce the same result as all similar attempts have done. I can only infer the facts from the time at which this alteration was brought down, from the immense delay that took place, and from the fact that the responsible head of the Government has never, since he assumed the reins of power, put forward this particular thing as part of his policy. So far as I know, he is at this moment absolutely unaware of this momentous addition which his lieutenant and his Ministers have made to a Bill for which he must be mainly responsible. Not only is that so, but I believe that, in pressing this proposal forward now, the members of the Government are really acting as the spokesmen of the FederalAssociation of Railway Servants, a body which I have no hesitation in saying I believe to be far the most powerful combine in existence on this continent. T shall not press that question further. That we should, at this last moment of the debate, be compelled, or that the people of Australia - should be invited, to pronounce an opinion "" Aye "" or "" No "" upon all these matters joined together, without any possibility of severing them, is contrary to the best - ciples of representative government, and, no matter how highly I think of the other parts of the Bill, I believe, and cannot help hoping, that that circumstance will Ur. W. H. Irvine. defeat the whole of the measure when it is put before the electors next year.",39
120,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gwydir) [3.34] - I feel that, as a representative of the people of Australia, and especially as one attached to that great army of toilers whose interests we claim to have at heart, it is my duty to express my admiration for the measure now before the Chamber. If the 13th April last produced nothing more than the passage of this Bill, broadening our powers for the purpose of controlling those conditions which are specified in, and yet not provided for, by the existing Constitution, it would still have done for this country a work which no other election day has even approached. I entertain no such fears as those which have been expressed by other honourable members regarding the inclusion of the railway men in the measure. It is absurd to say that, because we include railway men within the scope of this constitutional amendment, we are going to take the control of the railways out of the hands of the State authorities and assume their administration. The whole matter is clear enough to any one who knows why it was asked that the railway men should be included. On a former occasion, this Parliament endeavoured to bring the railway servants under the arbitration laws, and the High Court decided that that could not be done. The whole argument in this House was, not in the direction of showing that those men should not be included, but related more to the question of the powers which the Constitution gave us to so include them. As we are in a majority today, we ""are carrying out our promise to make it possible for these men to have the same protection from the Industrial Courts of this country as is extended to other men who are earning their livelihood in other and different occupations. The effect of this measure will simply be, when a dispute arises in a State, or in more than one State, to give the Federal Arbitration Court the same right to decide it as was exercised by that body under constitutional authority in the shearing dispute. If the Federal Arbitration Court had never done anything but settle for four years the periodically-recurring trouble among the bush workers of Australia, and allay the constant strife, bitterness, and prin- hatred engendered between employer and employee"" in the great pastoral industry, it would have fully justified its creation. If railway men go out on strike, and it will only be in the last extremity that they adopt any such course, the Federal Court will intervene simply for the purpose of allaying the friction, and not to increase it. This will be an instrument whereby we can bring to bear the pressure of the Federal power, in order to restore peace and conbecause tentment in the service. I a'm heartily accord with the full text of the amendments moved by the Acting Prime MinI ister. I believe that the fears been expressed on the other side of the House as to the operation of this law will in time evaporate, but the good that come out of this measure, not only for those engaged in industries, but for consumers as a whole, by remedying insovereign justices and controlling monopolies, will be incalculable. In fact, this is the important piece of legislation that has been brought forward, or even suggested, this Parliament. Its ramifications reach to ways does. the farthest ends of all matters affecting the daily life of the community, whether toilers, employers, or the public generally. Believing that the measure will where there is now warfare, bring justice where injustice now exists, rectify intruth. equalities, alleviate suffering, and make Australia the most happy and prosperous nation on the face of the earth, I give it my heartiest support.",40
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) to [3-39]-- I agree with the honourable memjections. ber for Gwydir that this is the most important piece of legislation that this Parliaruling, ment has so far had to consider. Perhaps that is why there has been what amounts almost to a conspiracy of silence on other side of the House with regard to With the exception of the able speech from the Acting Prime Minister, honourable dresses members on that side have contented selves with more or less irrelevant interjecpowers tions. They have made no attempt bate the question on its merits. Let it on record that, during the whole course the consideration in this House of these great fundamental changes, those honourable members who are the means of sending the facts? them to the country have never deigned to enlighten the country regarding their effect. The little that has been let fall has all been in the direction of showing how absolutely unnecessary many of these coal ? changes are. For instance, the honourable member for Cook today criticised the repeat what I said. speech of the Leader of the Opposition. I heard him for about five minutes, and that time.

148,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I must ask the honourable member for Melbourne Ports not to over the continue his interjections.,42
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why does the honourable member for Maribyrnong compare France with Australia, seeing that the their State of New South Wales alone is one-third larger than that country? What for analogy can there be except that which points to the wisdom of controlling these industrial affairs over small areas? The two illustrations in favour of the exhontension of this power would seem to show that it is required for the purpose of reto depressing strikes by unionists. Honourable members are asked to support proposals in which they do not believe, and, 'on the other hand, to vote against proposals atin which they do believe; and that is fair neither to the House nor to the country. The honourable member for Flinders cordially supports the first proposition, and the honourable member for North Sydney supports the third just as heartily; and yet both are compelled to vote against the Bill, because they disagree with the other totally is distinct propositions. How, under the circumstances, can this be regarded as a fair referendum? This means of appeal to the people should be used only for the purpose now of enabling them to express their opinion in a clear and definite way, and so receive from them a definite instruction, and to that end the proposals should be separated, leaving the alternative of voting for or against To use a popular slang term, this referendum is being "" faked,"" but I fancy lhat, before the fight is over, the facts will tell more against the supporters of this proposal than against those who oppose it. In judgment, this referendum would give definite result of a useful character. It Â«ill not give us merely, as stated by the Government, the power to grant new Proand regulate prices; that is only an infinitesimal portion of the power sought. honI t will not only give power to control tmsts, because very much more is asked for. We, on this side, are as strongly in favour of a power to control trusts and from monopolies as are honourable members opposite. If there is one thing on which we are all agreed, it is that those huge monopolies shall not get thpir tentacles into as they have, unfortunately, got them into the United States. But we are not given an opportunity to vote on that question alone, and the referendum is being loaded for the Socialistic purposes of honourable members opposite. Combines, in themselves, are not invariably harmful, but are sometimes good, seeing that they embody the co-operative principle which honourable members opposite are always lauding, but which they will not leave free of interference, even when it is operating harmlessly. The proposal of the honourable member for Angas to limit this power to monopolies which operate in restraint of trade, was not accepted; all combines, good or bad, must be put under the Socialistic ban. The Ministry are not concerned whether they get this strong central power for the purpose of usefully governing Australia. Their concern is whether this power will help them in conjunction with their confreres in die State Parliaments, to further the Socialistic ends they bave in view. That, in my judgment, is the fiist and last object they have in view, and not the balance of the constitutional machinery having regard to the requirements of a free and progressive country. They are seeking to make this Constitution an engine for the realization of their Socialistic projects, and, believing that to be the case, I shall, with the greatest cheerfulness, vote against their proposals this afternoon.

The alignment of the road in which the poles have been erected has, I understand, not been altered, nor has its original width been increased. It is the practice in sparsely-populated districts to align the roads to the full statutory width, but to make only so much as is needed for immediate traffic, extending the traffic space to the full width as necessity requires and finances allow.

Evidently a great, new gold-field has been discovered, and within a few weeks there will be an enormous and rapidly-increasing population there. I need say no more to impress upon the Minister of Trade and Customs the importance of immediate action.",44
158,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Capricornia) [4.11] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Trade and .Customs a telegram that I have just received from the Mayor of Gladstone, informing me that the Town Council has passed a resolution protesting against the abolition of the office of subcollector of Customs at that town. Gladstone is an excellent port, but its progress has been retarded, and it has been kept from public notice, mainly by the political and other influences at work in Brisbane, which have also prevented the advancement of other Queensland ports. I can understand the abolition of a sub-collector's office where all that is to be done is merely to examine Inter-State certificates, but Gladstone is oversea port. I do not know whether the Minister in agreeing to the abolition of office has overlooked that fact, but in any event I should like him to explain the ciradvantage cumstances to the House, and to give assurance that this office will be continued.",44
159,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yarra-xVIiniste r of Trade and Customs) [4.13] - In reply to the hontake orable member for Lang, I have only to say that I read the official reply furnished a Department with which I have no connection. It was given to me as correct, and I assumed that it was so. The honourable member for Coolgardie can rest assured that the Government will do all in its power to sec that the people of Bullfinch are brought into direct communication with Perth as soon as possible.",45
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has nothing been done yet?,45
161,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Honourable members will recollect that on Tuesday last I stated that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia visited the field about a week ago. I think that he went there some three days before the honourable member for Coolgardie raised the question in the House, with a view to ascertain what facilities could be afforded. Since the honourable member for Coolgardie brought this matter forward, I have been informed by the Minister of Home Affairs that he has authorized the setting apart of a certain sum for special services in this locality. The money will be paid out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, I presume, and I am sure that the House will endorse such a payment in view of the extraordinary conditions that we have to meet.",45
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the money to be spent to provide a telegraph line?,45
163,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot say at the moment, but I promise the honourable mem- . ber for Coolgardie, and the right honourable member for Swan, that I shall bring before the Postmaster-General-whom , I am sure, we were all pleased to see in his accustomed place for a few minutes this afternoon-the representations that have been made. My honourable colleague realizes the importance of bringing this new field into direct touch with the rest of Australia as soon as possible. In reply to the honourable member for Capricornia I wish to explain that, with the abolition of Inter-State certificates, the Department of Trade and Customs is dispensing with officers whose services are thus no longer required. Within the last few weeks we have closed MI six-offices in Victoria, and are not pursuing in Queensland a policy different from that this . adopted in the other States. Where the services of an officer can be used to better at one port' than at another, it an is the duty of the Department to make a transfer. But, if Gladstone is an oversea port, I think the honourable member may it for granted that the office there will not be closed, and that proper facilities by will be afforded for the convenience of practically the trading community. Question resolved in'the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.16 p.m. _",45
