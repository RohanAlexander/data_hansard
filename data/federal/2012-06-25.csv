3,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systematic torture. Such conduct stands in blatant violation to all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific; David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net). We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to openly and forthrightly call for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China. from 2,627 citizens Human Rights: West Papua To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Justice for West Papua This petition sponsored by the Australia West Papua Association draws to the attention of the House the ongoing abuse of human rights of the people of West Papua by the Indonesian authorities. There is a disproportionate military presence in West Papua and the Indonesian military and police conduct ""sweeping operations"" throughout West Papua in which they burn houses, beat and kill civilians and force hundreds of civilians to flee into the forests. Peaceful demonstrations by West Papuans are brutally dispersed by security forces and participants are arbitrarily arrested and sentenced to lengthy jail terms. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report that there is widespread torture and abuse of political prisoners. Foreign journalists and the Red Cross are denied access to the region. and residents of We ask the House to:  Request that the United Nations review the New York Agreement of 1962 and the 1969 Act of Free Choice, and conduct a genuine, UN-monitored referendum on self determination in which all adult West Papuans are allowed to vote without duress.  Stop all Australian financial support and training of Indonesian military and security personnel until human rights abuses by military and security personnel in West Papua cease.  Request the Indonesian government to remove the media blockade and allow international journalists free access to West Papua. from 122 citizens Mental Health Youth Mental Health Petition To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the concerned residents of outer eastern Melbourne Draws to the attention of the House the high incidence of mental illness among young people in the Knox area. Over a third of young people in Knox will be affected at some stage by depression, severe anxiety or worse before the age of 25. The impact of a mental problem can be devastating on the individual affected and their family. We therefore ask the House to call upon the Federal Government to provide additional services in Knox to assist young local people with mental problems. In particular, we request the funding of a Headspace Centre in Knox (a onestop-shop that focuses on 12-25 year olds) to reduce some of the current gaps in service provision and assist thousands of young people in our local community. from 200 citizens Marriage NA NA NA To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the definition of marriage as ""a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life"" is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex ""marriage"" would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children: We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that you protect the unique institution of marriage as traditionally understood and actually lived as the complementary love between a man and a woman. And, as in duty bound will ever pray. from 61 citizens Marriage To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the Marriage Act 2004 states “marriage means the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntary entered into for life” which is the foundation upon which families are build and on which our Australian society stands. To amend the definition of marriage to include same sex homosexual or lesbian “marriage” would be to change the very structure of our Australian society, especially the education system to the detriment of all, particularly children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that any Marriage Equality Amendment Bill be opposed. And, as in duty bound, will ever pray. from 1,061 citizens Social Security Act To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of a citizen of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Assessment (or nonassessment) of income under the Social Security Act. A person with an Account Based Pension (formerly called an Allocated Pension) has a reduced income amount assessed compared to a person with similar investments outside an Account Based Pension. I therefore ask the House to: The current method of income assessment for Account Based Pension allows for a deductible amount based on account balance at investment and life expectancy. This is unfair to those who have not had access to superannuation and the Account Based Pensions should be assessed under the deeming rules as ""Financial Assets"". That way investments are assessed in the same way whether inside or outside Account Based Pensions. This would be a fairer assessment and would also be simpler to assess for Centrelink. from 1 citizen Social Security Act To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of a citizen of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Assessment (or nonassessment) of income under the Social Security Act. A person under Age Pension age can have substantial funds in superannuation and receive full Newstart Allowance, Disability Support Pension etc. If the person is over 55 years of age, they can access preserved superannuation funds if they have been in receipt of a Centrelink payment for over 39 weeks (does not have to be consecutive weeks). I therefore ask the House to: If the person has been in receipt of a Centrelink payment for over 39 weeks since turning age 55, the balance of the superannuation funds should be assessed as income producing using the deeming rules. That is, the funds become ""Financial Assets"" subject to the deeming rules, not exempt as they are now. The funds should remain asset test exempt as the asset test in the case of Allowances is a cut off point rather than a scaled reduction like it is for Pensions. This action would reduce payments to people who can support or partially support themselves and provide an incentive to return to work. from 1 citizen Human Rights: West Papua To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following facts: a) the 1969 Act of Free Choice in West Papua was not a free and fair referendum, because only a small proportion of adults were allowed to vote, and those selected to vote were subjected to threats if they did not vote in favour of integration with Indonesia. b) Indonesian military and security personnel in West Papua have carried out and continue to carry out human rights abuses such as torture, murder, arbitrary detention, house-burning and rape, with impunity. c) International media are restricted from reporting in West Papua We therefore ask the House to:  Request that the United Nations review the New York Agreement of1962 and the 1969 Act of Free Choice, and conduct a genuine, UN-monitored referendum on self determination in which all adult West Papuans are allowed to vote without duress.  Stop all Australian financial support and training of Indonesian military and security personnel until human rights abuses by military and security personnel in West Papua cease.  Request the Indonesian government to remove the media blockade and allow international journalists free access to West Papua. from 3,383 citizens Public Holidays To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:  Weekend and shift workers are disadvantaged whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a weekend and the public holiday substitutes (is moved) to the following Monday or Tuesday.  When substitution occurs workers rostered to work on the actual special day falling on the weekend don't receive a public holiday whilst workers rostered to work on the substitute day do.  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Some States have legislated for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day to be public holidays when they fall on a weekend plus provide an additional public holiday on the following Monday. or Tuesday.  Weekend and shift workers are also disadvantaged because Good Friday, Easter Saturday (in most states) and Easter Monday are public holidays but Easter Sunday (except in NSW) is not. (The NSW Parliament unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday.)  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Parliament should legislate a uniform standard across Australia. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act to include: 1. An additional public holiday (not a substitute day) on the following Monday and/or Tuesday whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day fall on a weekend. 2. Easter Sunday as a public holiday. from 23 citizens, 91 citizens and 197 citizens NA Responses",19
4,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"Reid) Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Medicare Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 19 March 2012 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding restoration of the Extended Medicare Safety Net (EMSN) for obstetrics. The EMSN provides an additional rebate for Australian families and singles who have out-ofpocket costs for Medicare eligible out-of-hospital services once an annual threshold in out-ofpocket costs has been met. In 2012, the annual threshold for Commonwealth Concession Card holders, including those with a Pensioner Concession Card, a Health Care Card or a Commonwealth Seniors Card, and people who receive Family Tax Benefits (Part A) is $598.80. For all other singles and families the annual threshold is $1,198.00. Out-of-hospital services include GP and specialist attendances, as well as many pathology and diagnostic imaging services. Once the relevant annual threshold has been met, Medicare will pay for 80% of any future out-of-pocket costs for Medicare eligible out-of-hospital services for the remainder of the calendar year, except for a small number of services where an upper limit or `EMSN benefit cap' applies. An independent review of the EMSN, the Extended Medicare Safety Net Review Report 2009, clearly showed that in certain areas (such as obstetrics and IVF) the EMSN has been used by some specialist doctors to raise their fees, knowing the taxpayer would cover 80% of the cost of the fee rise. This meant that EMSN benefits supported high fees without necessarily providing patients with benefits. From 1 January 2010, an upper limit was placed on EMSN benefits for obstetrics items. To offset the impact of these changes the Government has invested over $157 million (over four years) for the introduction of three new obstetric attendance items and to increase the base rates for 15 obstetric items, including antenatal appointments, labour and delivery services, and the planning and (10:03): management of pregnancy. The Medicare rebates for a standard package of maternity care with a private obstetrician have been increased by about $300 per patient. The following points apply:  For a standard course of antenatal care, the Medicare rebates and EMSN benefits available total more than $1,700. Extra rebates apply for more complicated pregnancies and confinements.  The Medicare rebate for a private delivery is now 30% higher than previously. The inhospital rebates for delivery items were increased by between $250 and $280.  The fee for the existing planning and management of labour item (16590) for medical practitioners who intend to undertake the delivery of a privately admitted patient was increased by 150% (from $122.50 to the $306.30) and a new planning and management item (16591) was introduced for medical practitioners who do not intend to be involved in the delivery. These changes have been introduced to directly support patients, without providing an incentive for specialists to increase their fees. Since I November 2010, the Australian Government has also provided Medicare funding for obstetric services provided by midwives. Pregnant women are free to choose whether they access public or private sector obstetric services and the provision of Medicare rebates for midwives to provide these services supports that choice. The petitioners assert that the 1 January 2010 changes have led to a significant shift of births into the public system. No data has been provided to support this claim. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Petition: Breastmilk Substitutes Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 15 March 2012 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding a petition calling for the full implementation of the World Organization's International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk substitutes (WHO Code). The Australian Government recognises that breastfeeding contributes to good health and is committed to assisting breastfeeding mothers and their families, promoting the value of breastfeeding and improving breastfeeding rates in Australia. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments are implementing the Australian National Breastfeeding Strategy 20102015 which was endorsed by Australian Health Ministers in 2009. Under the Breastfeeding Strategy, the Australian Government has committed significant funding to breastfeeding initiatives, including $2.5 million over five years to enable the Australian Breastfeeding Association to provide a toll-free 24 hour telephone helpline providing information and peer support for mothers and their families. This service is available on 1800 mum 2 mum (I 800 686 268). Australia's response to the WHO Code is currently being considered as part of the implementation of the Strategy. Australia currently implements the WHO Code in a number of ways that are considered appropriate for the social and economic environment in Australia. These approaches, which are a mixture of regulation, agreements and guidelines, have review mechanisms to ensure they continue to meet community needs. Australia's primary means of implementing the WHO Code is the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formulas: Manufacturers and Importers Agreement 1992 (MAIF Agreement), a voluntary, self-regulatory code of conduct between manufacturers and importers of infant formula in Australia. All major manufacturers and importers of infant formula in Australia are parties to the MAIF Agreement. Compliance with the MAIF Agreement is monitored by the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula (APMAIF), a non-statutory panel appointed by the Government. Other measures used to implement the WHO Code include the Infant Feeding Guidelines for Health Workers and mandatory labelling and composition provisions for infant formula, Health included in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Standard 2.9.1). The Australian Government has commenced an independent review of the MAIF Agreement which will also assist in informing Government policy in relation to the WHO Code. Further to this the Australian Government recently commissioned an international comparison study into the implementation of the WHO Code, other breastfeeding initiatives and breastfeeding rates in Australia and comparable developed countries, including New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, Norway and others. The findings of this study, available at www.health.gov.au/APMAIF, indicate that breastfeeding rates are influenced by a number of factors, including social and cultural attitudes as well as support networks. The findings of these two projects will be used to appraise Australia's current measures in response to the WHO Code and to inform consideration of the merits, possible mechanisms and scope of any further measures to support breast feeding in Australia. On a personal note and as the mother of three children who were all breastfed for at least the first year of life, I can assure you that I am aware of the benefits of breastfeeeding for both my children and myself and will work to increase breastfeeding rates in Australia. I am proud of our 24 hour Breastfeeding Helpline and of the introduction of Australia's first National Paid Parental Leave Scheme, which helps mothers recover from the birth, establish breastfeeding and bond with their new baby, while providing families with more financial security in the first months of a new baby's life. the mother wishes to return to work early, she may transfer some or all of the unused Parental Leave Pay to her partner or co-parent, enabling the baby to visit for feeds. From I January 2013, the scheme will be extended with two weeks Dad and Partner Pay. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Superannuation Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 19 March 2012, regarding a petition lodged with the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning the investment of superannuation contributions into owner-occupied homes. Superannuation receives generous taxation concessions designed to encourage individuals to save for their retirement. Superannuation benefits are generally preserved until a member's retirement, on or after reaching preservation age (between 55 and 60 years of age, depending on a person's date of birth). Restrictions are placed on the early withdrawal of superannuation savings to ensure they are available for genuine retirement income. The superannuation legislation provides for the early release of superannuation benefits only in very limited circumstances, such as: severe financial hardship; a limited number of compassionate circumstances; incapacity; and for individuals suffering from a terminal medical condition. These arrangements attempt to balance the need for superannuation benefits to be protected for retirement purposes against the need for access to be provided where superannuation fund members experience personal emergency situations. The Government considers that using superannuation savings to purchase a home would negate the benefits of regular superannuation contributions and compounding interest, and result in lower retirement incomes than would otherwise be the case. On this basis, the Government is not in favour of allowing access to superannuation savings for this purpose. Nevertheless, the Government recognises the If impact that rising housing costs can have, particularly on families, and is committed to improving the availability of affordable housing across all communities. One of the issues that has impacted on housing affordability is that the supply of housing has not kept pace with strong growth in demand in recent years. As such, the Government has announced a number of initiatives to help tackle this problem. The Government is investing nearly $450 million in the Housing Affordability Fund to help lower the cost of building new homes. This program focuses on improving the supply of new housing and on making housing more affordable for home buyers entering the market. It is helping address two significant barriers to the housing supply, namely holding costs incurred by developers as a result of planning and approval waiting times, and infrastructure costs relating to water, sewerage, transport and open space. The Government's Building Better Regional Cities program will assist the construction of more affordable homes in regional cities. This will help relieve pressure on our major capital cities so that Australia can grow sustainably. The Government will fund participating councils to invest in local infrastructure projects that support new housing developments, such as connecting roads, extensions to drains and sewerage pipes, and community infrastructure such as parks and community centres. permanent The Government's First Home Saver Accounts are also helping first home buyers to save a larger deposit for the purchase of their first home. The Government will make a contribution of 17 per cent for all individuals on the first $5,500 of personal contributions made each year. These accounts complement the Government's policies to increase the supply of affordable housing. I trust this information will be of assistance you. from Treasurer, Mr Swan NA Statements",22
5,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," Madam Deputy Speaker, as we near the end of this financial year, and in this last sitting week of the winter sittings, I would like to give a brief overview of petition trends over the last 12 months. Please note that I am speaking to the statistics collected up until today, which includes today's announcement; but there is a good possibility that petitions will also be tabled by members during this sitting week. There has been a 41 per cent increase in petitions tabled in the House this financial year compared to the previous one-that is, 183 petitions tabled this financial year, compared with 129 in the previous period. These figures are encouraging in that they demonstrate the continued confidence the general public have in the petitioning process. It appears that petitioning remains a method that Australian citizens embrace to put their views forward within the community, to the House and to the federal government, and to request action. Of the 183 petitions tabled, 40 petitions, or 22 per cent of all petitions tabled, were tabled by members. These statistics echo the ongoing, and often very direct, participation of members in the petitions process, despite the option for petitions to be presented by me on sitting Mondays. Ministerial response letters tabled have also increased in this period-from 79 tabled in the 2010-11 year to 134 tabled in this financial year. Much of this increase reflects the increased volume of petitions, rather than a significant increase in the number of petitions responded to. Ministerial responses have been one of the notable successes of the to petitioning arrangements introduced in 2008, as they have proven to be thorough and timely. However, I would like to point out the exceptional strength of the ministerial response process as exemplified in statistics collated over the last 12 months. A crude statistic of the ministerial response rate can be calculated from the number of response letters tabled, in comparison to the number of petitions tabled in the same period. This rate approximates 74 per cent, which compares favourably with the rate of 61 per cent in the previous period. However, this calculation underestimates the true rate of responses to petitions because one response letter may address more than one petition of the same or similar ilk. This is illustrated in statistics, which have been retained by the committee secretariat since February 2012, which document not only the number of ministerial response letters tabled but also the number of petitions these letters responded to. Fifty-four response letters have been tabled since February 2012 but which have responded to 72 petitions. This discrepancy occurs because some petitions with identical terms, or those petitions tabled on the same subject matter within the same period of time, are not re-referred to a minister after a recent referral. Therefore, one response letter may respond to more than one petition, and each principal petitioner will receive the recently tabled response to that petition matter. I would expect the trend in the last six months to be present across the full year. However, if we merely add these 18 responses from the last six months which are not reflected in a simple count of tabled letters, plus allowing for the 33 recently tabled petitions which have not yet received responses, the total responses approximate the total number of tabled petitions. Thus, the ministerial response rate is actually closer to a full 100 per cent. There is no doubt that this is an excellent result from a system introduced only in the previous parliament. In summary, the statistics over the last 12 Relations. months tell a story of confidence, commitment and consideration-continued confidence by the public in a parliamentary process which has been used by generations of Australians; continued commitment by members and the House in supporting this long-enshrined activity; and consideration given to each petition which is tabled in the House. NA Education and Employment Committee Report",25
6,Ms RISHWORTH,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I present the committee's advisory report on the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012, incorporating additional comments and a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",26
7,Ms RISHWORTH,COMMITTEES,"On 16 February 2012, the House Selection Committee referred the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 to the employment and education committee for inquiry and report. The bill was introduced by the member for Melbourne, who was subsequently appointed to the committee for the purposes of this inquiry. The inquiry received 23 submissions from employee and employer groups, carer organisations and others with an interest in flexible arrangements in Australian workplaces. On 23 March, the committee held a public hearing in Canberra to explore some of the themes raised in submissions with stakeholders as well as with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace The bill proposes substantive and formal changes to the current right to request flexible working arrangements. The substantive changes to the right to request include: increasing the scope of the right to request flexible working arrangements to all due national system employees; increasing the scope of arrangements that define a carer in relation to requests for flexible working arrangements; and strengthening the grounds required to refuse a request for flexible working arrangements for the purposes of caring from 'reasonable business grounds' to 'serious countervailing business grounds'. The bill also proposes empowering Fair Work Australia to make flexible working arrangements orders and provides for the imposition of penalties on parties that fail to implement these orders. Submissions to the inquiry were divided on whether they supported or opposed the proposed extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements. These arrangements are currently subject to a number of reviews outlined in the report. These include an independent review of the Fair Work Act 2009 and a consultation by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on expanding the right to request flexible working arrangements under the National Carer Recognition Framework. Additionally, the General Manager of Fair Work Australia is currently conducting research into the extent to which individual flexibility arrangements under modern awards and enterprise agreements are being agreed to, and the content of those arrangements; and the operation of the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to employee requests. I note that, while the majority of members of the committee agreed with the principles outlined in the bill, the committee has recommended that the bill not be considered until the results of these reviews and government responses are released. As well as extending the right to request flexible working arrangements, the bill proposes to alter the formal status of the right by removing these provisions from the National Employment Standards. Only one organisation provided evidence to the inquiry that supported the proposed removal of the right to request flexible working arrangements from the National Employment Standards. Others either questioned or opposed this element of the bill. I understand the member for Melbourne has provided additional comments on the purpose of such a change. However, there was considerable argument against the proposed removal of flexible working arrangements from the National Employment Standards. That was certainly a concern of government members of the committee. The National Employment Standards set out clear minimum conditions that must apply to employees and it is appropriate that the right to request flexible working arrangements is included. This was the view held by government members of the committee. The inclusion of the right to request, as a minimum condition of employment, contributes to an awareness that benefits both employees and employers. Removal of the right to request would also mean that agreed individual flexible working arrangements could be overridden by a collective enterprise agriculture agreementa situation described by the Ai Group as 'counterintuitive'. In closing, I thank all those who provided evidence to the inquiry for making the trip to Canberra and my committee colleagues for the work they put into it. I also note the work done by the secretariat, in particular Glenn Worthington. I thank them for their input and I commend the report to the House.",26
8,Mr RAMSEY,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the advisory report of the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 as proposed by the member for Melbourne. The coalition members-the members for MCPherson, Aston and I-of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment support the recommendation of the committee and recognise the views of some, at least, who gave evidence to the committee that they support some action in this area. We were keen to point out that, whilst supporting the recommendation, we do not necessarily endorse the general thrust of the legislation, which is to pass further enforceable responsibilities onto the employers. Further, we are of the opinion that better results will be achieved if employers are encouraged to work in a cooperative fashion with their employees rather than engaging in an environment of confrontation by government regulation enforcing particular outcomes. To that extent, we took some note of the evidence given by the Australian Industry Group where, firstly, they discussed the conditions in the economy that are affecting business and placing many under strain at the moment. Australian industry perspective business conditions are very tough under the two-speed economy. Mr Callahan went on to say: Costs of doing business are highly significant at the moment. In the context of this bill before the parliament I think it is important that members take that on board from the perspective of our concern, in particular, that other jobs are potentially under threat at the moment and it is a very difficult time for doing business in Australia. He went on to say: The right to request provisions, in their current form, are a very important feature of the act as they encourage cooperation though open dialogue between employees and their employers about achieving meaningful flexibility in the workplace that works on both a personal level for the employee and an operational level for the employer. Unfortunately, the bill as it currently stands would undermine this very important principle and purpose. The coalition members were concerned that this bill may bring about further confrontation in the workforce and, in that case, be counterproductive to a good outcome. Mr Callahan went on to say: We believe that the right to request flexible working arrangements as it currently exists under the Fair Work Act is effectively fulfilling the government's intention and we have not identified any problems necessitating a change to the act in this regard. He also said: 'It would convert a facilitative mechanism that encourages open dialogue at the workplace into an adversarial mechanism.' We also took evidence from Carers Australia which would somewhat confirm this opinion. In fact, the possibility of this legislation becoming a new point of conflict between employers and employees was conceded by Carers Australia, who showed a preference for a cooperative approach rather than compulsion. They said that, if the legislation is passed, it may become an effective disincentive to employing people from groupings more likely to have caring responsibilities. We do support the recommendation, because it defers action at this stage, but the driving force behind that is that we do not necessarily accept that this is the correct way to engage with carers, and the people they care for, for the employers. We do not have a special confidence in the Fair Work review. Our concerns with the Fair Work review are that it will not go to some of the things that are affecting conflict in the workplace at the moment in a broader view-not, in particular, with this situation with carers but that the Fair Work review may have some deficiency. But we are more than prepared to wait and see what it says and what the government's reaction to that review is.",27

12,Ms RISHWORTH,COMMITTEES, by leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS International Arms Trade Treaty,28
13,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES," I move: That this House: (1) calls on Australian parliamentarians to endorse the Global Parliamentarian Declaration on the Arms Trade Treaty; (2) recognises: (a) that the poor regulation of arms: (i) results in tens-of-thousands of lives needlessly lost every year; (ii) undermines peace and peace building processes, human security, poverty reduction initiatives, and prospects for sustainable socio-economic development; and (iii) facilitates gender-based violence against women who disproportionately endure the indirect, longer-term consequences of armed conflict; and (b) the immediate need for a legally binding international agreement on the regulation of the global trade in arms; (3) congratulates successive governments for their demonstrated commitment to an internationally binding arms trade treaty; and (4) calls on the Australian Government to continue strong advocacy for an international arms trade treaty at the upcoming United Nations negotiations on the matter in July 2012. It is difficult to overstate the devastating effect of illicit weapons on individuals and communities around the world. In fact, it is estimated that 1,500 people are killed each day from conflict and armed violence. Incredibly, around 12 billion bullets are produced every year-that is about two for every person on the planet. Part of the problem is that the multibillion dollar global trade in arms is largely unregulated. As Amnesty International and Oxfam Australia have noted in a letter to all MPs and senators, the trade in arms is more poorly regulated than the trade in bananas or coffee. Weapons are often traded irresponsibly between countries, with no consideration of whether they will be used to commit human rights abuses or diverted to those who will. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, for example, weapons continue to pour into the country despite clear evidence of human rights abuses, fuelling ongoing conflict and human suffering-weapons are diverted to war lords, women are raped at gunpoint and children are recruited as soldiers. In the DRC the asking price for an AK-47 is reported to be just US$50. Most human rights violations are not committed with tanks or other heavy artillery; they involve small arms and light weapons. In small communities, such as in the Pacific, it is easy to imagine that just one armed gunman could hold a whole village hostage. During July, UN member states will meet to negotiate a new treaty to regulate Australian international transfers of conventional weapons. The purpose of the treaty is not to limit or reduce legitimate arms transfers but, rather, to prevent irresponsible transfers by requiring states to undertake risk assessments of each transfer to determine if they will be used to commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or seriously impair poverty reduction or socio-economic development. This is the fundamental purpose of the treaty, and specific criteria achieving this must be included in the treaty text. A robust treaty should include all types of conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, and ammunition. Ammunition is likely to be a sticking point, particularly for the US, which argues that it is too onerous to track. However, ammunition must be included in the scope of the treaty. Some weapons, such as the AK47, are virtually indestructible. So their use continues for decades, by one group after the next as they are traded around, because ammunition for them is readily available. The treaty should also cover all types of trade activity, including transhipments, brokering and gifting. Critically, the treaty should be legally binding and require national implementation with clear reporting provisions. Successive Australian governments have strongly supported the establishment of a robust treaty. Australia has co-authored every United Nations resolution on an arms trade treaty since 2006 and has played an active role as Friend of the Chair. Australia has advocated widely for the arms trade treaty in the Pacific, the Caribbean and Africa. I encourage the Australian government delegation, led by Foreign Minister Carr, to continue to champion a robust, comprehensive and legally binding instrument. There is no doubt that negotiating this treaty in four weeks is an ambitious task. However, considering the staggering impact irresponsible arms transfers have on humanity, there is certainly an urgent need for a positive outcome. And, where there's a will, there's a way. The deepening crisis in Syria is indeed a poignant reminder of the critical need for an arms trade treaty. Amnesty International's latest report on Syria, Deadly reprisals, provides further evidence that deliberate and unlawful killings are part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, are carried out in an organised manner and as part of state policy, and therefore amount to crimes against humanity. And yet some nations, such as Russia, continue to ship weapons to Syria, despite the high risk they will be used to commit atrocities. The international community now has a historic opportunity to negotiate a treaty will prevent weapons getting into the wrong hands and could save hundreds of thousands of lives. I would like to pay tribute to Amnesty International and Oxfam Australia for their campaign to raise awareness and support within the community and among parliamentarians. I note the briefings conducted by Amnesty International last week in the parliament on this subject. I also note and welcome the efforts of the Parliamentarians for Global Action, or PGA, to promote the new treaty as one of its major campaigns, including asking parliamentarians to sign the Global Parliamentarian Declaration on the Arms Trade Treaty. So far, more than 1,500 parliamentarians from all over the world, including more than 50 Australian federal MPs and senators, have signed the declaration. I thank colleagues for their support of this important arms trade treaty that will play a role in promoting regional and global security and save tens of thousands of lives needlessly lost each year.",28
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Yes, I second the motion. I am appreciative of the opportunity to speak on this important motion and I thank the member for Fremantle for bringing it to the attention of this parliament today. Each day the scourge of war directly affects millions across the globe. Countless more continue to suffer the indirect effects, decades after conflicts subside, through human rights abuses, poverty and human trafficking. Weapons are more easily finding their way into the hands of non-state actors, fuelling decades-long conflicts and creating new ones. The toll on civilians continues to rise with each passing year, and women and children are that disproportionally affected as existing inequities are magnified and they are exposed to sexual violence and exploitation. Whilst the causes of each conflict are complex, there is a simple truth: wars require weapons. Limiting the flow of arms into conflict regions would help stem violence. But, unfortunately, arms easily find their way though because the trade has very little regulation. In fact, regulations applying to bananas are greater than those applying to the global arms trade. To remedy this situation, from 2 to 27 July, the United Nations will host discussions for a global arms trade treaty. The treaty is the culmination of six years of investigation and has involved extensive consultations with countries and nongovernmental organisations. I am also pleased to say that the treaty has had strong bipartisan support though successive Australian governments. The arms trade treaty is intended to outlaw the transfer of arms if there is a substantial risk they could be used in breaching international humanitarian law, be diverted from the legitimately intended recipient, affect regional security or be used by terrorist networks. A revolutionary and welcome aspect of this agreement is its broad scope; covering all weapons, transfer types and transactions. That means any weapon, from helicopter gunships to handguns, will be covered. Transfer types will include import, export, temporary transfer, state sanctioned, commercial transactions, technology transfer, plus so-called gifts and aid; and transactions will also cover brokers and dealers, whether state-sponsored or not. While there is strong support for the treaty move: in general, Amnesty International is urging parliamentarians across the world to show their support and ensure that the substance of the treaty is not watered down during the upcoming negotiation process, as so often happens. Last week the Parliamentary Friends of Amnesty was privileged to host Widney Brown, Amnesty International Global Director of International Law and Policy, who outlined the status of the negotiations and the issues still to be resolved. Of particular concern are calls to remove ammunition and technology transfer from the treaty. Some countries have objected to ammunition on the basis that it is too hard to track. But it was pointed out that Australia already has a system tracking its ammunition, and there is no reason why other countries could not adopt a similar process. The restriction on technology transfer ensures that a more recent and disturbing trend is stamped out. It has come to the attention of Amnesty that in order to bypass arms embargoes, weapons factories are being built in conflict regions. Such factories intensify conflict though easy access to arms, destabilise regions and place even more women and children in danger. The process should be stopped and must certainly remain an area regulated by this treaty. In conclusion, I would urge all members of this place to sign the Global Parliamentarian Declaration on the Arms Trade Treaty. Once again, I would like to thank Widney Brown and Amnesty for their continued advocacy on this important treaty, and thank the member for Fremantle for moving this motion in this place today. Debate adjourned. International Year of Cooperatives",30
15,Mr HARTSUYKER,COMMITTEES," I That this House: (1) notes that: (a) 2012 is the International Year of Cooperatives; (b) there are two million more cooperative members in Australia than retail share investors; (c) cooperatives create diversity in the Australian economy; (d) cooperatives play an important role in delivering services to regional and rural communities; and (e) some Australian Government industry assistance is not available to enterprises with cooperative structure; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) support the role of cooperatives in Australian communities; and (b) continue working with the States and Territories to implement nationally consistent laws governing the operation of cooperatives. Cooperatives play a key role in the Australian economy but are often overlooked as a business model and not appreciated for the benefits that they bring to regional communities. 2012 is the International Year of Cooperatives and 7 July is the International Day of Cooperatives, so it is very appropriate for us to be debating this motion at this time. A cooperative is simply an alternative business structure which operates for the benefit of cooperative members, rather than for the benefit of investors or shareholders. To put it simply, a cooperative is just a group of people cooperating for their mutual benefit. Cooperatives around the world operate in accordance with seven guiding principles: firstly, voluntary and open membership; secondly, democratic member control; thirdly, member economic participation; fourthly, autonomy and independence; fifthly, education, training and information; sixthly, cooperation among cooperatives; and, finally, concern for the community. Community is a very important issue in relation to cooperatives. There are around 1,800 cooperatives in Australia, with more than 7.5 million members. Cooperatives operate in many areas of the economy including agriculture, financial services, fishing, insurance and even child care. Many people would not be aware that cooperatives have a unique top-level domain which is .coop, instead of the traditional .com. The top 100 Australian cooperatives, credit unions, and mutuals turned over $14.7 billion in 2011. a Many cooperatives are well-known brands in Australia, including Cooperative Bulk Handling, or CBH, in Western Australia, which turns over $2.63 billion; Murray Goulburn Cooperative, which turns over $2.24 billion; Australian Unity, which turns over $656 million; Dairy Farmers Milk Cooperative, which turns over $497 million; and the NRMA, which turns over $456 million. Other notable cooperatives in Australia include Norco in my electorate, the RACV, RACQ, Credit Union Australia, and a range of credit unions including the Banana Coast Credit Union, or BCU as it is now known, in my electorate. I would also like to note the Macleay Regional Cooperative and the Coffs Harbour Fishermen's Cooperative. Both are located in my electorate and both are in the top 100 cooperatives in Australia. The Macleay Regional Cooperative has been operating in the Macleay Valley since 1905. It operates and owns the Kempsey Supa IGA supermarket, Macleay 5 Star Fitness and key commercial real estate in Kempsey. The Coffs Harbour Fishermen's Cooperative has been operating since the 1950s. It is owned by 45 local professional fisherman and is a significant part of Coffs Harbour's economy, providing significant local employment opportunities. The Nambucca River Cooperative also operates in my electorate. It started in 1903 and has served the Nambucca Valley ever since. In the north of my electorate is the Clarence River Fishermen's Cooperative, which is a very important part of the Maclean community. I should also mention Oz Berries in Woolgoolga. The housing, blueberry industry has provided a significant boost to our region with hundreds of jobs and continuing investment in the area. The cooperative allows local farmers to focus on growing and picking berries while marketing and sales are left to the cooperative. Around the world, one billion people are cooperative members and cooperatives collectively employ 100 million people globally. The 300 largest cooperatives in the world are worth a combined value of US$1.6 trillion. Because cooperatives operate in the best interest of members, not shareholders, they are able to provide a range of services that may not be available from organisations with traditional company structures. You only have to look at the role that credit unions and building societies play in regional communities to realise the importance of cooperatives. Mutual banking institutions are accountable to their communities and can often be found serving regional communities long after the major banks have closed their branches and left town. Australian mutual banking institutions hold about $83 billion in assets and serve some 4.6 million Australians. Despite the significant size of the mutual sector, credit unions and building societies have the flexibility to meet the needs of their members because they do not answer to shareholders demanding ever increasing profit growth. The International Year of the Cooperative secretariat explains the benefits of cooperatives by saying: Co-operatives' democratic structure often allows for more prudent business decisions to be made. Not being tied to the merry-go-round of shortterm profits means co-operatives can invest in their businesses and their people. Co-operatives have strong links to the communities in which they operate and in which their members live. As such they promote self-reliance of communities and are of general benefit to society. In short, cooperatives often serve a dual role as both business entities and social enterprises. For this reason, cooperatives are a significant contributor to many Australian communities and they should be recognised. Unfortunately cooperatives do not attract the same recognition or benefits as organisations with a company structure. In the past, cooperatives have missed out on some benefits available to companies. I have been advised by some cooperatives that the federal government's Enterprise Connect program will only provide advice to organisations with a company structure; likewise, some state government industry advice programs are only available to companies. A number of other government programs, including the Social Enterprise Development and Investment Fund, do not appear to include cooperatives as eligible to receive assistance. Cooperatives are also disadvantaged by the current accounting standards, which treat members' shares in a cooperative as a liability; in contrast, a shareholder's investment in a company is seen as equity. The difference may materially impact on a cooperative's ability to raise finance. Cooperatives have also struggled to manage the range of different state based regulatory regimes and laws. The states and territories are gradually moving towards nationally consistent cooperative laws but the process is taking some considerable time. I am pleased to note that New South Wales has recently passed new, nationally consistent cooperative laws. The law change will benefit around 680 cooperatives in New South Wales with a combined total of more than 1.5 million members. New South Wales is the lead jurisdiction for cooperative national law and it is now up to the other states and territories to get on board and pass similar laws. Once operating nationally, the new cooperatives national law will remove barriers and encourage growth in the cooperative sector. We need to have a seamless regulatory regime that does not punish cooperatives operating across state borders. I call on the states and territories to pass the new cooperative laws just as soon as possible. Cooperatives provide diversity and opportunity in the Australian economy. It is entirely appropriate that we recognise and celebrate the contribution made by cooperatives in Australia. I will conclude my remarks with a quote from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who said: Cooperatives are a reminder to the international community that it is possible to pursue both economic viability and social responsibility. I call on all members of this House to support this motion. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson): Is the motion seconded?",31
16,Mr Keenan,COMMITTEES,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,34
17,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES," It is a pleasure to speak on this motion. I thank the member for Cowper for putting it forward and for his contribution on the matter of cooperatives in this country. The government greatly values the social and economic contribution that cooperatives make to this nation. Cooperatives do some excellent work in our community, and the government does some great things to support them in their work. As the motion notes, the United Nations declared 2012 the International Year of Cooperatives-the IYC-in recognition of the valuable contribution made by cooperatives to global social and economic development. This is a truly valuable contribution, and it operates not only at the global level but also very much on a local and national level. The national peak body for cooperative businesses, Co-operatives Australia, has argued that the strong performance of member owned enterprises around the world during the global financial crisis has led in Australia to renewed interest in the cooperative business model and the benefits of doing business with a member and community focus. It is a little bit surprising-though maybe it is just a sign of a more sophisticated and complex worldthat we drifted away from the cooperative model and the type of business focus that cooperatives have, which is often community based. But it is good to see now that people are once again returning to the cooperative model. The International Year of Cooperatives provides a fantastic opportunity for Australia's cooperatives to celebrate and promote their work. According to Australia's (Ms International Year of Cooperatives Steering Committee, Australia has over 2,000 cooperatives and 113 mutual banking institutions owned by more than eight million people. So there is a very strong cooperative base and a very strong cooperative community, both of which are well supported here in Australia. Cooperatives are defined by their member-ownership and member focused way of doing business. Former federal Labor Minister for Home Affairs and former New South Wales Attorney-General and minister for cooperatives Bob Debus AM is patron and supporter of the International Year of Cooperatives and has noted that ethical investment and corporate social responsibility are at the very heart of what cooperatives do. Ethical investment and corporate social responsibility are great things, and the former minister did a very good job of promoting them. I am sure that the member for Cowper had corporate social responsibility and social investment in mind when he drafted this motion, and I am sure that he shares this government's strong commitment to promoting them. Australia's cooperatives operate across a diverse range of industries, including book sales, clubs, cotton growing, dairy produce, fishing, fruit marketing, grain handling and marketing, labour hire, plumbing supplies, property sales, recycling, rural grocery and petrol supplies, sugar milling, taxis, tourism and wine sales. I am sure there are probably one or two others as well. Certainly cooperatives are diverse and significant, and certainly they form part of the basis of a very strong Australian economy. The former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and number for Lindsay launched the International Year of Cooperatives on 22 November last year. To celebrate the role that cooperative organisations play in Australia, the government, through the Royal Australian Mint, released a commemorative one-dollar coin in January 2012. One of the goals of the International Year of Cooperatives is to 'encourage governments to establish policies, laws and regulations conducive to the formation, growth and stability of cooperatives'. I look forward to outlining some of the things that this Gillard government is doing to support cooperatives and the good work they do in our community. The motion notes that some Australian government industry assistance is not available to enterprises with a cooperative structure. Industry assistance programs within the Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education portfolio do not explicitly exclude cooperatives from eligibility; however, program guidelines sometimes restrict eligibility to incorporated bodies or bodies that are required to pay income tax, as most people would expect. For example, the R&D tax incentive can only assist individuals or bodies which are subject to tax, as entities obviously need to have a tax liability in the first from the program. If a particular cooperative is not incorporated or is exempt from paying income tax, it will not be able to access most industry assistance programs. I can understand that most people would think that that is fair, because organisations which are not paying income tax already receive assistance and therefore an incentive. That said, the government recognises the valuable role that cooperatives play in the Australian economy and is working to ensure that future industry assistance programs do not unreasonably exclude from eligibility business structures of any particular type. In the meantime, the government has introduced a number of key reforms across a range of areas such as not-for-profits, banking and regulation. These reforms will go a long way to assisting cooperatives in the valuable work they do. Most cooperatives are not-for-profit entities, and the government has an ambitious not-for-profit reform agenda which implements the most significant reforms the sector has experienced over the last century. As of September 2009, there were 1,726 cooperatives registered across Australiathree-quarters of them established as nonprofit entities. As part of the 2011-12 budget, the government announced that it would establish a regulator for the not-for-profit sector, the Australian Charities and Not-forprofits Commission-the ACNC. The government released draft legislation to establish the ACNC in late 2011 and has engaged in extensive consultation with the not-for-profit sector. This has included targeted consultation meetings in Sydney and Melbourne, attending ACNC task force road shows across the country and working with the Australian Taxation Office's Clubs Consultative Committee and Charities Consultative Committee and the Not-forprofit Sector Reform Council. Try to say all place to benefit that in one breath! While initially only tax-endorsed charities will be regulated by the ACNC, the forthcoming ACNC bill establishes a regulatory framework which can be extended to all not-for-profit entities, including cooperatives, in the future. This will help to cut red tape and reduce regulatory burdens for cooperatives so that they can get on with the important work they do-and of which we are all supportive-such as delivering services to rural and regional communities. In addition, as part of its Competitive and Sustainable Banking System package, the government is taking action to facilitate the competitive power of Australia's mutual credit unions and building societies. The government has introduced a governmentguaranteed deposit symbol which informs consumers that the government guarantees deposits of up to $250,000 with any authorised deposit-taking institutionADI-such as a credit union, a building society or a bank. Basically it means that the government guarantees that your money is safe. The seal is primarily aimed at supporting smaller institutions, like credit unions and building societies, in accessing and retaining depositor funding. The government's guaranteed deposits seal has been available from 31 January 2012. I am advised that, as of 21 June 2012, 97 ADIs have approached Treasury for information on the seal and 67 ADIs have been provided with the seal for use or display. Related to this, the Financial Claims Scheme applies to all ADIs that are incorporated in Australia and take deposits. The FCS provides certainty to Australian depositors in credit unions and building societies that their deposits will be protected in the same manner as they would be if they were held by a bank. The government has introduced a new, permanent FCS cap of $250,000 per account holder, per ADI, which has applied since 1 February 2012. This will also help smaller institutions, like credit unions and building societies, by enabling them to demonstrate the safety of most of their deposit products. As at 21 June 2012, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, has approved the applications of six mutuals, which are now marketing themselves as mutual banks-bankmecu, QT Mutual Bank, Defence Bank, Heritage Bank, Victorian Teachers Mutual Bank and Teachers Mutual Bank-while others are actively considering rebranding. By allowing mutual lenders to market themselves as mutual banks, the government is helping to educate consumers about the safety and competitiveness of mutual lenders. In the end, better competition means better value and better products for consumers, and that drives consumer protection as well. Finally, I assure the member for Cowper that the government will continue working with the states and territories to implement nationally consistent laws governing the operation of cooperatives. In the past, discussion between the cooperatives sector and regulators about the need for reform of the current cooperatives legislation, including the need for improved consistency and simpler requirements for cross-border operations by cooperatives, led to the development of the Australian Uniform Cooperative Laws Agreement. We have also set up a consumer affairs forum and through that forum the states and territories have agreed also to work towards the introduction of Cooperatives National Law or alternative consistent legislation. While the Commonwealth is not a party to that particular body-we will have no regulatory role under the Cooperatives National Lawthere are numerous points of interaction with Commonwealth corporations legislation for which we are responsible. Once passed, this national legislation will greatly assist cooperatives in the work they do and in making sure they comply. This is why government is encouraging the states and territories to work together to implement this national legislation as a matter of priority. I thank all the speakers who will speak on this motion and support the good work being done by the government.",34
18,Mr TEHAN,COMMITTEES," I rise today to support the motion of the member for Cowper, which notes: 2012 is the International Year of Cooperatives; there are two million more cooperative members in Australia than retail share investors; cooperatives create diversity in the Australian economy; cooperatives play an important role in delivering services to regional and rural communities; some Australian government industry assistance is not available to enterprises with cooperative structure; it calls on the government to support the role of cooperatives in Australian communities and to continue working with the states and territories to implement nationally consistent laws governing the operation of cooperatives. My electorate of Wannon has some wonderful cooperatives in it. For instance, we have the Murray Goulburn Co-operative, which has its largest processing plant in Koroit, in my electorate of Wannon. Murray Goulburn was established in 1950. It is 100 per cent controlled by Australian dairy farmers and is our No. 1 exporter of dairy products. Its plant in Koroit, which I have visited, is state-of-the-art and enables milk to come into the plant straight from a dairy farm and, within 24 hours, that milk is on a truck and on its way to the Port of Melbourne to be exported. It is a very good cooperative. Wannon also has the Terang Co-op, which was made famous a few years ago by the two students who stood up to Julia Gillard and the Labor government and said 'you should not take our jobs away from us' after they were stopped from working after school for an hour and a half. As history has shown they fought that in court and won, and we got the employment rules changed for students working after school. It employs 110 full-time people. It creates wealth for the local region and distributes the profits it gets to local organisations and clubs. The Terang Co-op does a wonderful job. Wannon electorate has the Casterton Community Co-operative, which is being set up, hopefully, to get the hardware store back and operating in Casterton. The Casterton hardware store closed down, sadly, a year and a half or two or three years ago now and so a group of volunteers has set up a cooperative, which they hope will get the Casterton hardware store up and operating again. It would be very beneficial to the town of Casterton. We also have the Bendigo Community Bank operating in the electorate of Wannon. It has some cooperative branches at Avoca, Beaufort, Cobden and district, Coleraine and district, Dunkeld and district, Heywood, Maryborough, Willaura and Lake Bolac. The Avoca branch of the Bendigo Community Bank was so successful that it enabled it to expand into Maryborough. Once again these Bendigo Bank community banks do wonderful work because the profits that are made from these banks are fed back into the local communities and help strengthen these liquid local communities. On the whole these cooperatives are operating in smaller rural and regional towns and pay money back into those communities, which is absolutely important. I would like to commend the member for Cowper because the one thing we do need when it comes to cooperatives is for the states and territories to implement nationally consistent laws governing their operation. We also have to make sure that we do not see the current government put more red tape on this sector because, as we have seen with their work of trying to reform not-for-profit organisations and charities, it is becoming a regulatory nightmare what organisations are being confronted with. We do not want to see this government's penchant to overregulate every part of our society also creep into this area. That would be disastrous. I would like to commend all the cooperatives in Wannon and also commend the member for Cowper for this excellent motion.",37
19,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," I am really pleased to rise to speak to this motion, and I thank the member for Cowper for moving it. I have no doubt that in moving it he is aware of the work that the federal government has been doing in this area, and again I acknowledge his commitment to the sector in moving this motion. I doubt that there are many of us in Australia that are not involved with one cooperative or another, although we may not understand exactly what that means. This International Year of the Cooperative is a really good opportunity for us as a community to improve our understanding of how extraordinary the contribution of this sector is. If you are or ever have been a member of a credit union, you have been associated with a cooperative. If you have been a member of the RACQ or the NRMA or called roadside assistance, you have also benefitted from some of our strongest cooperatives. There are about 1,700 cooperatives in Australia, and it is amazing how large some of them are. In the top 100, we have co-ops like Co-operative Bulking Handling Ltd (WA), which turns over more than $2.63 billion; the Murray Goulburn Co-operative, which turns over $2.24 billion; HBF, which turns over $1.1 billion; and the Royal Automobile Club of WA, which turns over $656 million. So these are very, very large cooperatives. As you go down the list you those see the RACV, the automobile club for Victoria; and the New England Credit Union, which comes in at number 52. It is really quite an impressive list in which you will see most of the credit unions, the names of which you would recognise: the Teachers Credit Union, at over $100 million, and the Police and Nurses Credit Society. It is an incredibly impressive list. It includes housing co-ops and some food co-ops. I had the pleasure of being a member of a food coop once, many years ago, up in the Blue Mountains and I used to go up there from time to time to buy from it because it focused on local supply of very fresh organic food. Again, across almost every area where people have an interest you will find co-ops forming. I would like to talk a little bit about the issue of regulation, because the member for Cowper has included that in his motion. I would just like to reassure the member for Cowper that the government will continue working with the states and territories to implement nationally consistent laws governing the operation of cooperatives. In the past, discussion between the cooperative sector and the regulators about the need for reform of current co-op legislation, including the need for improved consistency and simpler requirements for cross-border operations by cooperatives, led to the development of the Australian Uniform Cooperative Laws Agreement. I have said before in this place how amazed I am sometimes at the inability of a person to cross a state border without running into a whole stack of new regulation. This was and still is another area where we have that concern. The agreement requires that all states and territories apply proposed national template legislation or pass legislation which is consistent with the national legislation for the regulation of cooperatives. New South Wales is the host jurisdiction under the agreement, and I have seen some commentary on some of the co-op sites recently about the work that the New South Wales government has done in this area. The uniform template legislation, Cooperatives National Law and its supporting regulations, was developed by the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs. The initial legislation, the Co-operatives (Adoption of National Law) Act 2012, containing the Cooperatives National Law, was passed by New South Wales and received assent very recently, on 18 May. I note this development was welcomed by peak body Co-operatives Australia and their state based members. Again, I have seen how much traffic there has been on the websites that are dedicated to reporting on cooperatives in the last few weeks. While the regulation of cooperatives responsibility of the state and territory governments, the Australian government has supported the progression Cooperatives National Law through the Council of Australian Governments, which we know as COAG, Legislative and Governance Forum on Consumer Affairs, and the states and territories have agreed that they will continue to work towards the introduction of the Cooperatives National Law or alternative consistent legislation. It quite appropriate that this work is being done this year, which is the International Year of the Cooperative. It is valuable work. It is work that supports an incredibly important part of our economy, one which I hope we will see greater recognition of this year.",38
20,Mr COULTON,COMMITTEES," I too rise this morning to speak in support of this motion moved by the member for Cowper. I also acknowledge the contributions made by other members. It is important to note that 2012 is the International Year of the Cooperative and that there are over two million more cooperative members in Australia than retail share investors. Cooperatives create diversity in Australia. They play an important role in delivering services to regional and rural the communities. Some Australian government industry assistance is not available to enterprises with cooperatives, and we need to call on the government to support the role of cooperatives in Australian communities and to continue working with the states and territories to implement nationally consistent laws governing the operation of cooperatives. This is the International Year of the Cooperative, and it is: … an acknowledgement by the international community that co-operatives drive the economy, respond to social change, are resilient to the global economic crisis and are serious, successful is the businesses creating jobs in all sectors. That was a quote from the website of the International Year of the Cooperative. To of the quote Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of the UN: Cooperatives are a reminder to the international community that it is possible to pursue both economic viability and social responsibility. One of the three goals identified by the UN in the International Year of the Cooperative was to encourage governments to establish is policies, laws and regulations conducive to the formation, growth and stability of cooperatives. This is exactly what the member for Cowper's private member's motion calls on the government to do. There are three main areas where cooperatives have been found to have the most value: (1) poverty reduction, (2) employment generation, and (3) social integration. In my electorate, one of the largest cooperatives was established way back in 1962 at the start of the fledgling Australian cotton industry a group of growers at Wee Waa. The Namoi Cotton Co-operative is now Australia's leading cotton processing and marketing organisation. Namoi Cotton has a mission statement to 'deliver quality products and services to our customers and members'. Namoi Cotton employs 120 full-time staff and over 300 seasonal and casual employees. In 1998 Namoi Cotton was the first entity to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange while retaining its cooperative status. In 2010 Namoi Cotton ginned 516,000 bales and in 2011 1,058,000 bales-that is including the ones they did with joint ventures. The social engagement of Namoi Cotton extends to industry groups such as Cotton Australia, the Australian Cotton Shippers Association, the Australian Cotton Ginners Association, the Regional Cotton Growers Association, Moree Trade Show, Agquip, and water users groups. Namoi Cotton also encourages staff to participate in charity causes. I have to say that in the Namoi valley area, Namoi Cotton are very much part of the local community. In 2011 Namoi Cotton's achievements were: effective maintenance of margins through efficient and sustainable ginning operations; extensive recruitment and retention of industry-leading cotton-ginning employees; increased throughputs and efficient turnaround times for growers despite the large volumes; successful implementation of its patented round module handling technology at a further five ginning sites, providing uninterrupted handling and seamless processing of 36 per cent of ginning bales in round cotton module formand that will soon be up to 80 per cent and then, with the changes in technology, it will probably be up to 100 per cent before much longer. Namoi Cotton is predicting a record year in 2013 with an Australian cotton crop of 4.6 million bales-so cotton is doing very by well at the moment in my electorate. Another important role of cooperatives in my electorate is in the finance sector. The member for Parramatta mentioned some of the credit unions, and some of those that she mentioned operate in my electorate as well. One of the success stories is the Bendigo Bank. It has come into communities-the one that comes to mind is Gilgandra, where some of the mainstream financiers had left the town-and, with its community engagement, it has become very much part of the community-in that case, the Gilgandra community. The credit unions that come into communities right across my electorate are also very important.",39
21,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES," I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his motion and for giving us the opportunity to speak on the International Year of Cooperatives. I am pleased to be able to talk about some of the excellent work that cooperatives do in our community, and also to speak about some of the good work that the government is doing to support cooperatives. The motion correctly draws our attention to the fact that the United Nations declared 2012 the International Year of Cooperatives. This recognises the valuable social and economic contributions made by cooperatives at local, national and global levels, particularly in the area of development. Some of the comments that I make will closely echo what others have said in this place, because we share the same sentiments and the same views about cooperatives. There is sometimes a view that cooperatives are a bit old-fashioned and that they are no longer relevant in our day and age, yet when we have a look at what they do, how many of them there are, and how many people own them and are represented by them, we see that that is just not correct. According to the United Nations International Year of Cooperatives National Committee-Australia, 'Australia has over 2,000 cooperatives and 130 mutual banking institutions that are owned by more than eight million people.' That is a lot of people. We have just heard the honourable member for Parkes speak about some of the financial institutions with reference to the contribution by the honourable member for Parramatta referring to the Bendigo Bank. That is an institution that I know well, as the Bendigo Bank also operates in my seat of Page. Not only is it providing a good financial and banking service but also it is very involved in the community and in various community initiatives. I am sure that when the honourable member for Cowper was drafting the motion, he had in mind that it was the International Year of Cooperatives. Australia's cooperatives operate across a diverse range of industries including agriculture, services, rural grocery and petrol supplies, sugar milling-a very important industry in my area-taxis, tourism and wine sales. I also note that the Australian government through the Royal Australian Mint released a commemorative one dollar coin in January 2012. I would like to talk about industry assistance. The honourable member for Cowper notes in his motion: … some Australian Government industry assistance is not available to enterprises with cooperative structure … Industry assistance programs within the Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education portfolio do not explicitly exclude cooperatives from eligibility; however, program guidelines sometimes restrict eligibility to incorporated bodies or bodies that are required to pay income tax. If it is a question of guidelines, they can be changed. But, for example, the R&D tax Steering incentive can only assist individuals or bodies subject to tax, as they obviously need to have a tax liability in the first place to benefit from the program. Where a particular co-operative is not incorporated or is exempt from paying income taxes, it will not be able to access most industry programs. That said, the government recognises the valuable role that cooperatives play in the Australian economy and is working to ensure that future industry assistance programs do not unreasonably exclude any particular business structure from eligibility. I note in relation to the clean energy programs that the cooperatives in my area, Norco and Northern Co-operative Meat, are both eligible to apply for assistance under these particular programs and packages. I was involved in checking that they were eligible. So it is not restrictive across the board. In the meantime the government has introduced a number of key reforms across a range of areas. Debate adjourned. Pension Assistance",40
22,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) after almost 12 long years of inaction by the former Australian Coalition Government, the current Australian Labor Government has delivered historic pension reforms that have a provided increases of $154 per fortnight for maxrate single pensioners and $156 per fortnight for max-rate pensioner couples; (b) the NSW Government increased public housing rents for pensioners in 2011, taking away some of the Australian Government's 2009 pension increase; (c) the Australian Government is delivering extra assistance to millions of Australian pensioners through the Household Assistance Package; (d) this new assistance is being delivered as a stand-alone pension supplement, separate from the base pension rate, so that pensioners living in public housing could receive the full benefit of this assistance without it affecting their social housing rents; and (e) the NSW Government has announced that it will include this assistance when calculating social housing rents from March 2013, meaning pensioners living in public housing will not receive the full benefit of the Australian Government's assistance. (2) condemns the NSW Government for increasing rents for about 84,000 NSW pensioners and taking away part of their pension increase; and (3) calls on the Opposition to guarantee it would not take away the pension increases as part of the Household Assistance Package if in government. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson): Is the motion seconded? I recognise the member for Hayes.",41
23,Mr Hayes,COMMITTEES,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,42
24,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"I rise unexpectedly, I guess, given the calibre of our new state government in New South Wales, to condemn that government for increasing rents for about 84,000 New South Wales pensioners in public housing and taking away part of their pension increase. Unfortunately, this is standard behaviour for this particular government. After almost 12 long years of inaction by the former Australian coalition government, the current Labor government delivered historic pension reforms that have provided significant increases to pensioners: $154 per fortnight for the maximum rate single pensioners and $156 per fortnight for maximum rate pensioner couples. That was delivered in 2009. Then, in 2011, after Premier Barry O'Farrell became Premier of New South Wales, he put his hand in the pockets of those pensioners and took some of it for himself by increasing public housing rents. Now we have a supplement coming through to pensioners of $250 for singles and $380 for couples, paid as a separate pension supplement because it is designed to compensate pensioners of all kindsincluding disability pensioners and seniors pensioners-for what will be a modest increase in costs due to the price on carbon. In fact, it is due to overcompensate them for that modest price. But, once again, we have the Premier of New South Wales putting his hand into the pockets of pensioners and declaring that once that supplement becomes part of the base rate, in March next year, he will claw some of it back for himself. It is without any doubt a grubby cash grab on the (Ms part of this Liberal New South Wales government. Many pensioners are doing it tough-we know that. They live on fixed incomes. They are aware every day of which prices are going up and which prices are not. For many, many years they were neglected by the Liberal government at the federal level. It is only since the Labor government came to power that their interests have been considered and large increases have been given. And, once again, we see the true character of the Liberal government in New South Wales in their willingness to put their hands into the pockets of pensioners and rip out whatever small benefit we might give them. The irony in this is that if we gave this as a cash upfront supplement, in the way that the Howard government did from time to time, it probably would not be anywhere near as easy for a state Liberal government to rip some of it away. It is also in many ways politically more beneficial to pay it as a lump sum, because when the cheque arrives in the mail or the money arrives in the bank account you get the absolute recognition that this government did it or that government did it. So, politically, it is probably smarter to do it as a one-off payment rather than build it into the base, and that would also prevent the New South Wales government from making this grubby cash grab. But it is better for the pensioners if you build it into the base. That recognises that pensioners need to manage their budgets, and if it is built into the base they know exactly what they are getting on a weekly basis and can make their own choices about how they do that. So if you do it the best way for the pensioner you get a grubby New South Wales government doing their best to take some of it back. This is appalling behaviour and I can tell you that the pensioners in my electorate-and there are over 3½ thousand of them-are very angry about this. I have also talked to my colleague Michelle Rowland, the member for Greenway, who is at home at the moment with her quite gorgeous new baby. She has been working very hard in her electorate on this, visiting public housing estates, writing to the Premier and talking to her pensioners, as I have been talking to mine, and I can tell you that the anger out there among pensioners in public housing is quite extraordinary. What an act from a state government that pretended in the election campaign they would be a warm and fuzzy government-the minute they were elected they put their hands into the pockets of pensioners to take money out. This is a money-grubbing act from a money-grubbing government. I condemn the New South Wales government for it. And I call on the opposition to guarantee that they will not take away this pension increase as part of the household assistance package if they are elected. (Time expired)",42
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Before calling the next speaker I apologise to the member for Fowler for incorrectly calling his title.,43
26,Mr Hayes,COMMITTEES,I was flattered.,43
27,Mr SECKER,COMMITTEES," I think 'the member for Hayes' has a very good ring to it, and perhaps we may see that one day; it would be great recognition of the present member for Fowler's contribution to this parliament. Turning to the motion, I think it is extraordinary that the member for Parramatta talks about this increase as being somehow unique to a coalition New South Wales state government when in fact the previous state government in New South Wales, a Labor government, did the same thing for 16 years and the present South Australian Labor government has been doing the same sort of thing for 10 years. That is why the Howard government on many occasions used lump sums and special allocations-to avoid state governments taking their share of any increases in pensions. So this is nothing new. This has been around for a long time, and if you look at the New South Wales government, they are saying that they are actually $5 billion worse off in GST payments in the latest budget figures, and of course they are not getting compensation for the carbon tax. If we did not have a carbon tax, none of this would arise anyway. Let's look at 1(a) of the member for Parramatta's motion, talking about how, supposedly, the Howard government ignored pensioners for nearly 12 years. It was, in fact, the Howard government that changed the pension system to 25 per cent of the MTAWE, the male total average weekly earnings, instead of the old CPI increases. The MTAWE rate was a much higher rate. That built up, and, by the time the Howard coalition government lost power, that would have meant in real terms over the period of those increases $80 a week more than if we had stuck to the old Labor Party system. We had increases twice a year at higher than the CPI and so in real terms we increased pensions continually. Politically, it might have been smarter to do that every six months and say, 'Here we are, we are giving you a bit extra,' but we put it into the so that pensioners always got that increase. If you want to look at how Labor has acted, in 2008 the coalition proposed a private members' bill to provide a $30 a week increase in the single age pension, and guess what-the Labor government with all its numbers opposed this bill and used its numbers in parliament to defeat it. The coalition's ongoing pressure eventually forced this government to award pensioners an increase in the 2009 budget, leading to the permanent increase in the pension to 27.7 per cent of MTAWE. It was only under our pressure that they actually folded, because we remember the present Prime Minister saying in cabinet that we should not give increases to the pensioners because they were going to vote for the coalition anyway. That is the sheer hypocrisy of this government. It talks about giving pensioners increases when the present Prime Minister said, in a dirty political attitude, 'We shouldn't give them increases,' because they were only going to vote for the coalition. So let us not get too high-handed or uppity about who is doing the best job for pensioners. I believe that every member of parliament wants to look after pensioners. Sometimes you can afford it and sometimes you cannot, but that does not seem to worry this present government. The coalition certainly has huge concerns with the proposed carbon tax for pensioners and self-funded retirees, because they will be the hardest hit as they are on fixed incomes. There will be a huge hike in electricity bills; we know that. In New South Wales there will be an increase of 18 per cent, and 18 per cent is forecast for South Australia. The problem with this situation is that self-funded retirees on over $50,000, which is not a huge amount of money, will not get any increase whatsoever. (Time expired)",43
28,Ms HALL,COMMITTEES," Firstly, I would like to congratulate the member for Parramatta for bringing this exceptionally important motion to the House. Secondly, I would like to encourage the New South Wales government to rethink the position that they have taken on this issue. In doing this, I would have to acknowledge that the New South Wales government has blatantly disregarded pensioners living in public housing. I suppose I should also add that the coalition side of politics really has blatant disregard for anyone on a low income and has not delivered to pensioners in the past. The previous speaker was talking about pension increases. I would have to say that it is the Rudd-Gillard government that has delivered the biggest increase to pensioners since the pension was introduced in this country, and on this side of the House we are extremely proud of that. We are very proud because we know that pensioners have served our country well over the years and, as such, they deserve to have a decent standard of living. This brings me to those pensioners that are living in public housing in New South Wales. As I have already said, what is happening is a disgrace, a cruel cash grab by the New South Wales government. It demonstrates the difference in the way the Labor Party and the coalition parties think about pensioners and their commitment to pensioners. When the historic increase in the pension came into being, the New South Wales government, then a government, did not include the increase and hike up the rental for people in public housing. They realised that pensioners have been doing it hard and, as such, they recognised the fact that pensioners deserved this one-off increase in their pension to be left out of public housing rent increases. Now how different it is with Barry O'Farrell in government in New South Wales. Instead of accepting a payment that is put in there actually compensate for the cost increase that pensioners will incur due to the introduction of a price on carbon, what is Barry O'Farrell doing? He is including it as income when calculating rental. I have before me a letter that the state member for Swansea sent out to one of my constituents, who was extremely upset about the tone of this letter. In this letter the state member for Swansea highlights the fact that that money is needed for vital maintenance of public housing. I share with this parliament the fact that the Rudd and Gillard governments' record of investing in public housing is second to none. Under the previous Howard government public housing was ignored and there was no investment in public housing whatsoever. What the Howard government did was put in place programs and strategies that made it harder for pensioners and did nothing to help the people that were living in public housing. They did nothing to cut the waiting list. did nothing but cut the amount of money that was being given to the states for public housing. Public housing tenants were ignored. I think the bottom line is that those on the other side of this parliamentary chamber think that public housing tenants are second-rate citizens and they feel that they are not going to vote for them so they can totally disregard them and rip out of them every bit of money they can. I can tell them that the more than 1,800 pensioners Labor that live in public housing in the Shortland electorate deserve better. They deserve better than what Barry O'Farrell is doing, and I will certainly be in there fighting for them to see that they do not have to suffer this sort of(Time expired) Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (11:24): This motion that has been moved by the member for Parramatta is just another example of a Labor government that simply to does not get it. They simply do not have a clue. The first part of this motion refers to the so-called 'almost 12 years of inaction by the former Australian coalition government'. Well, something that this current government conveniently and continually overlooks is that when the former coalition government came to office they inherited $96 billion worth of Labor debt. And the former coalition government paid back every single cent of that $96 billion. What often gets forgotten is that they had to pay back the interest as well-close to $40 billion in interest. So for members of this current Labor government to have the call to come into this chamber and talk about the inaction of the previous coalition government is an absolute disgrace. If it were not for the reckless and wasteful spending of previous Labor governments, the last coalition government would have had an additional $140 billionplus to spend on the social programs and They vital infrastructure we need around the nation. Further, for members of this government to try and make a song and dance about increasing pensions-when what they have had is the four largest deficits in our nation's history and a cumulative $175 billion debt that future generations will have to pay back, and pay back with interestonly further demonstrates how completely clueless this current government is. This motion also refers to 'historic' increases. Pensioners have experienced historic price increases since this Labor government has come to office. Let us have a look at a few. Since Labor came to power, pensioners have seen health costs increase by 25 per cent. Since Labor came to power, pensioners have seen gas prices increase by 39 per cent. Since Labor came to power, pensioners have seen water and sewerage prices increase by a whopping 59 per cent. Most shamefully of all, since Labor came to power, pensioners have seen electricity prices skyrocket by an incredible 66 per cent, driving many pensioners into fuel poverty, being unable to afford to turn on their heater on a cold winter night-and certainly recently we have had some cold winter nights. In fact, here in Canberra, the last May was the coldest May in over half a century. As for this massive, 66 per cent, increase in electricity prices, this the carbon tax even hits-the carbon tax that the Prime Minister promised before the last election she would not introduce. The second part of this motion cries crocodile tears about the New South Wales government increasing rents for about 84,000 New South Wales pensioners. But why have the New South Wales government been forced to make this difficult decision to increase housing rents while they try and fix up the mess that they have inherited from the previous state Labor government? It is simple: it is because of the carbon tax. The entire premise of this motion is another example of a government in denial about the effects of the financial burden of the carbon tax. The New South Wales state government currently provide social housing for around 290,000 people, including pensioners, and after 16 years of Labor's mismanagement there are still an additional 56,000 households on the waiting list. These homes provided by the New South Wales certainly government have to be maintained and modernised on an ongoing basis. That is what this Labor government simply does not understand. This ongoing maintenance will be made more and more expensive by the carbon tax. Take every nail, every screw, every can of paint, every bag of cement, every tap handle, every piece of timber, every sheet of plasterboard, every tile and every kitchen upgrade: the carbon tax will make it more and more expensive. That is why, unfortunately, housing rents have got to go up. But, of course, it is only going to get worse. Under a Labor government we will see the carbon tax go up and up every year, forever. It starts at $23 a tonne but by 2050 it will be $350 a tonne. So if members of this government are truly concerned about the pension the answer is simple: get rid of the is all before carbon tax. (Time expired)",44
29,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the appalling actions of the New South Wales coalition government, led by Premier Barry O'Farrell, actions that rip much needed cash out of the hands of struggling pensioners. It was, after all, the Australian Labor Party that first introduced the age pension, and our federal Labor government is proud of the reforms we have delivered since forming government in 2007. In 2009 we delivered the greatest increase to the pension in 100 years. Since this time we have increased the maximum rate by $154 per fortnight for singles and $156 for couples combined. This is definitely helping pensioners with essential items and essential bills such as food, electricity, water and rent. Pensioners have recently received a lump sum supplement payment from the federal 84,000 Labor government over the past few weeks of $250 for singles and $380 for couples as part of the household assistance package. Pensioners will also receive a permanent increase to their regular payments in March next year. Altogether, single pensions are increasing by an extra $338 a year and couples are receiving an extra $510 a year combined. The increases Labor has delivered are historic and will continue to assist immensely after years of social welfare neglect by the Howard government. For pensioners living in public housing in New South Wales, 25 per cent of their pensions go towards rent. Our supplement payment was delivered as such to ensure that it would not be included as income for rent payments. Premier O'Farrell and his coalition government have announced that from March 2013 they will erode federal Labor's pension boost and household assistance by increasing public housing rents, taking money straight out of the pockets of public housing tenants. These are people who we know are already doing it incredibly tough, and Premier O'Farrell should know that. After all, he and his family lived in a New South Wales housing commission flat in the mid-1960s. He knows there is nothing glorious about such living and that those living in public housing need all the help they can get. These are not people who live in excess. If anything, they barely scrape through to make ends meet. This grubby cash grab by the O'Farrell government means that a single person on the maximum rate of pension will now pay an extra $84.50 a year in public housing rent. Around 84,000 pensioners across the state will be affected by this indefensible The member for Shortland made the point that we have invested so much in public housing. It was neglected in the Howard government years. In my electorate alone it is $30.8 million. A lot of that was for affordable rental housing and a lot of it was to maintain and restore state government properties. I wonder about the New South Wales government already being serial offenders. Wherever we put in funding, they withdraw, and I suppose that is one of the things that has led the member for Parramatta to put this motion forward. We are becoming increasingly frustrated by the continuing neglect of the state government in very important areas. In my region there are 8,500 pensioners living in public housingpeople who will have part of their assistance payments taken away. But pensioners are not the only people under fire. The recent state budget included nothing for improved oncology services for Newcastle's Calvary Mater Hospital, even though a report commissioned by the New South Wales government found that it was in absolutely serious need of additional funding. Cancer patients in the Hunter region are typically waiting around four or five weeks to access treatment that is available the next day in Sydney. That is a shameful snub for our people but it is also tragic. That is the sort of example that increases our frustration with the O'Farrell government. Again, $93 million has gone into my electorate for Building the Education Revolution improvements to schools, so what does the O'Farrell government do? It reneges on its promise to replace demountable buildings. The Junction Public School, where I was proudly once a teacher and a parent, had so many demountables after the earthquake and they are still there. They have been waiting much too long, and they will continue to wait under this New increase. South Wales O'Farrell government. The New South Wales government is driving us nowhere, apparently. Not only is it ripping cash out of the pockets of pensioners but also it is ripping cash out of the roads budget by not matching the Pacific Highway funding of the federal government. We all know the O'Farrell government's below-thebelt attacks on workers' compensation will never be forgotten either. With just over a year of government I can only say that the people of my electorate have been very sorely served by the O'Farrell government. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (11:34): For this government to be standing here and giving itself a big pat on the back for giving pensioners some assistance is the latest in a long line of the world's best examples of hubris. Overbearing pride and arrogance are at the heart of this poor government. The fact is that the government has introduced pension increases, as the member for Parramatta has outlined in her motion. However, it is also a fact that this government has belted pensioners around the head with rules, regulations and extra taxes that have made them worse off than before. It is interesting to note that the compensation for the carbon tax will be taken as income assessment for public housing, so the rents will go up in accordance with income assessment from the carbon tax. To give the ministers of this government another movie quote that they can use, 'What we have here is failure to communicate.' Let us see them come in here and tell the truth. We have seen the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations laud himself that that side of the House deals in the truth. Look at the millions of dollars used by this government to tell people about the free money they are going to receive. Look at the as which do not mention the words 'carbon' or 'tax'. Why not come clean and just tell them that you think they will fall for this handout? Why not just tell them in an ad that says: 'Look, the Greens said they would support us if we introduced a carbon tax. that simple. It was either that, or they would take their support and go to the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and tell him that they would help him form government.' And we laughed and we laughed and we laughed. Yes, that was going to happen! Of course they would not. This was okay by the Prime Minister all along. It was no deal they had to make to remain in government. They knew that to go to the electorate to tell them they would introduce an economy-wide tax on carbon, which would eventually drive electricity prices up so high that solar and wind power would become competitive, would lose them the election. So they stood there and covered the media with great big porky pies straight down the barrel of the camera. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer kept a straight face when asked whether they would introduce a carbon tax. 'No, no, no,' came the response repeatedly in the last week of the campaign. I was contacted by a self-funded retiree recently. She was listening to a radio interview between Mr Shorten, the Minister for Employment Workplace Relations, and Alan Jones. Mr Jones was asking about the plight of self-funded retirees. The member for Maribyrnong duly assured Mr Jones that he would raise these concerns with the Treasurer. This was some weeks ago. We are now six days away from the introduction of the carbon tax and we have heard nothing from either of these men on the plight of self-funded retirees. What is the truth? The truth is that compensation for tax is not compensation at all. Extra money paid out by borrowing is not compensation; it is a yoke around the neck of the next generation. This government, and the Labor state governments of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, have racked up It is huge amounts of debt and they have to be repaid. This government and the member for Parramatta simply cannot have it both ways. You cannot continue to borrow against future generations and then decry attempts to rein in spending-much like government's last budget, where it claims to have cut things to the bone while lifting spending to a new high. The truth is that this government is attacking pensioners with the world's biggest carbon tax and with red tape and regulation which are making it harder to make ends meet. Let's be very clear about this: the compensation being offered to some stops at the front door, even for those people who are getting it. Who pays compensation to the Townsville City Council for the carbon tax? No-one pays compensation to the Townsville City Council for the carbon tax. No-one pays compensation at all to the shops, building firms or house builders. You have to be in a marginal Labor electorate for industry to be given any sort of assistance by the government. The Leader of the Opposition railed about the dangers being faced by the steel industry. The government has come forward with another $300 million for the steel industry, but only for those places controlled by the AWU. Places in my electorate like Pacific Coast Engineering and Wulguru Steel get nothing, but they have to pass their costs on. My butcher does not get any compensation for the carbon tax, so the pensioners who go to my butcher because they get good service get nothing back. Those costs have to be passed on. Tropical Ice in my electorate are facing huge increases to their electricity costs. Those costs are passed on to the occupants of public housing. All those small business expenses will be added to the costs of being a pensioner in today's society. Australia has an ageing population and the challenges we face are huge. We need leaders who will provide hope, reward and opportunity to all in this society. (Time expired) this Mrs ELLIOT (RichmondParliamentary Secretary for Trade) (11:39): I am very pleased to rise today to support the motion by the member for Parramatta. I start by saying how proud I am to be a member of this federal Labor government, which has delivered the most comprehensive and unprecedented increase in the age pension in its 100-year history. We are very proud of this achievement by the federal Labor government. Since 2009, this government has delivered increases to the maximum pension rate of about $154 per fortnight for singles and about $156 per fortnight for couples combined. Why did we deliver these historic increases? We realised that after nearly 12 long years of neglect by the Howard coalition government action had to be taken. The federal Labor government understood that our pensioners, the people who built this country, needed greater support to make ends meet. We listened to their concerns and addressed them by increasing the pension. It cannot be overstated that these increases are an unprecedented and unrivalled reform that could only have been delivered, like all the great social reforms in this country, by a strong federal Labor government. The reforms have continued. As part of our household assistance package, pensioners have received a lump sum payment over the past few weeks of $250 for those who are single and $380 for couples. Pensioners will also get a well-deserved permanent boost to their regular payments in March next year. In total, single pensioners are receiving an extra $338 a year and couples are receiving an extra $510 a year combined. What is the coalition's response to all of that? Of course they are opposed to it. Like everything else, they are opposed to all of these increases and opposed to helping pensioners. What is worse, if we look at the very scary prospect of the coalition getting into government federally, we see that they will take away these increases. In my electorate, that will affect nearly 30,000 pensioners, who will have their pensions ripped away from them by the federal Liberal and National parties if they get into government. Certainly many locals in my area know that is the reality if they get into government. We see the same degree of callousness from the New South Wales state Liberal National government. Recently, we had the Premier, Barry O'Farrell, telling pensioners in public housing that he is going to take away their payment by incorporating this well-deserved increase into the calculation of their public housing rents. It is absolutely appalling. It is not enough that in the federal parliament we have the Leader of the Opposition voting against historic increases; now we have his state Liberal-National colleagues ripping this money straight out of pensioners' hands already. In fact, the New South Wales state Minister for Family and Community Services, Pru Goward, in a media release dated 14 June 2012 stated: … from March 2013 regular fortnightly carbon tax payments will be taken into account for the purposes of calculating heavily subsidised social housinghousing rents. The New South Wales state government knows full well that the federal government has delivered this increase as a separate pension supplement so that it would not be included when the state government calculated public housing rents. What does this action really mean for pensioners? It means that a maximum rate single pensioner will now pay an extra $84.50 a year in rent. That really is an appalling imposition on people in public housing. In my area, the local National Party MP, the member for Tweed, Geoff Provest, blatantly denies what he and his government are doing. First of all, he does not listen to the plight of pensioners, who are doing it tough, but then he contradicts his own government. In a statement to the local press  contradicted Minister Goward and denied that supplementary pension payments would be included in the calculation of public housing rents by stating: … the lump sum carbon tax compensation payments have not been counted as income for rent purposes. This is completely untrue and a total lie, but that is what he does-contradicts his government. It gets worse when we look at the history of a local state member like Geoff Provest and at some of the comments that he made in the New South Wales state parliament prior to his government being elected. On 22 June 2010 in the New South Wales state parliament, the member for Tweed, Geoff Provest, condemned the then state government for doing exactly the same thing and increasing public housing rents. He stated: There is simply no way the Commonwealth will tolerate a clawback of that one-off pension increase by the states for pensioners in public which is exactly what they have done. To quote further, and this really is appalling: Aged pensioners need our support. They do not need people from both sides of this House trying to take their last cent and trying to erode their quality of life. That is it exactly what he and his government are doing. It shows what a total hypocrite he is that they are now trying to take that money away from people in public housing. The New South Wales Liberal-National government should hang their heads in shame for what they are doing. It is a dirty, grubby backflip that is impacting on many pensioners in my electorate. We are seeing very harsh actions at the state level, and we would see these actions also at a federal level if the Liberal-National coalition were ever to form federal government. In contrast to all that, the federal Labor government delivered historic increases to pensions. (Time expired)",46
30,Mr MCCORMACK,COMMITTEES," For a motion such as this to be put up by a government such as this smacks of hypocrisy, it reeks of negativity and it is unnecessarily unhelpful at a time when this parliament could and should be using its valuable time discussing matters of importance to Australia. Today we should be finding a solution to the illegal boat problem, given that we have already had 4,568 people land on our shores this year and authorities are presently undertaking the grim task of finding up to 90 bodies in the latest tragedy. We should be talking about constructive ways to help the taxpayers of this nationworking families; regional families. Instead, Labor is trying to muckrake, and the trashing of the New South Wales government continues. In recent weeks, without justification and without warning, federal Labor has gone on an all out attack against the state coalition. Not content with trying to smear the federal opposition at every opportunity, Labor has turned its sights on the Barry O'Farrell-Andrew Stoner Liberal-National government, which has been in office only since March last year after 16 years of the worse, the most inefficient and the most corrupt government this nation has ever known. Pensioners always need more to keep pace with the increasing costs of living. We did our best as a coalition from 1996 to 2007, yet Labor, by racking up huge debt and deficits, has not helped pensioners since taking over the treasury bench under Kevin Rudd, who was unfairly ousted two years ago yesterday. To suggest that Labor-under either the member for Griffith or, since the 2010 coup, under the member for Lalor-has done better than the Howard years is simply false. The current Prime Minister said Labor was the party of truth sellers. Not so. But do not take my word for it. The member for Parramatta, instead of peddling misleading motions with mischievous intent, ought to be out asking pensioners what they think. Certainly the pensioners I listen to tell me they are doing it tough lately. This government is in no position to lecture anyone about what the Howard government did or did not do when it has overseen four record budget deficits, when it is looking at net public debt for 2012-13 of $143.2 billion, when the interest on its debt for the next financial year will be $12 billion and when taxes for the coming 12 months will be up by $39 billion. Australian pensioners-the aged, the disabled, the unemployed and the underemployed-are very nervous right now. They are deeply worried about where this country is heading. They are anxious about how they will afford groceries, petrol or the power bill. They are concerned about how they will pay their rent. And they have reason to be upset. Federal Labor inherited a massive surplus in 2007 but has sent Australia a long, long way into the red-so much so, it will take years to undo the damage. Conversely, the New South Wales coalition was left with a mess after 16 years of Labor government under Bob Carr, Maurice Iemma, Nathan Rees and Kristina Keneally-16 years of Sussex Street factionalism that saddled New South Wales with an economic malaise the pieces of which no incoming government should have to pick up and repair. But the O'Farrell-Stoner government and its dedicated and enterprising team are getting on with the job of making New South Wales No. 1 again. The state coalition has made some tough calls because it has had to do so. Balancing the books is the coalition way-at both state and Commonwealth levels. Labor governments are renowned for out-of-control spending like there is no tomorrow because they know they will not pay it backprudent, resourceful coalition governments would do that and the hard working taxpayers will pick up the tab as they always do. This discrediting of what the New South Wales coalition is trying to achieve after it was burdened with such a debt, such a big clean-up to do, such an atrocious state of affairs, is typical of this federal Labor government. If it can see a chance to politically point-score, it will doing so because it hopes it will save seats in New South Wales at the next election? Is it doing so because the Sussex Street powerbrokers have demanded it be so? Is it doing so because it likes to meddle with the truth? Probably all of the above. Next Sunday the biggest slug Australian pensioners will face comes into effect. Not surprisingly, Labor cannot say the words 'carbon tax'. Its members call it 'carbon pricing'-because they have to. They have been given their riding orders from Sussex Street and the Greens, to whom they are beholden. The carbon tax will not save the planet but it will make everyday living so much more expensive for the pensioners of the Riverina and pensioners right across Australia. It is a disgrace, and the carbon will be repealed when the federal coalition wins office at the next election.",51
31,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES," I rise on behalf of the 2,742 pensioners living in public housing in my seat of Banks to support the private member's motion proposed by the member for Parramatta. In September 2009 the Labor government delivered the biggest increase to the pension in its history and delivered a fairer system that made sure the pension kept up with living costs. Since 2009 Labor has increased the maximum rate pension by $154 a fortnight for singles and $156 a fortnight for couples combined. The 22,800 pensioners living in Banks have received a lump sum payment from the federal government over the past few weeks of $250 for singles and $380 for couples. Pensioners will also get a permanent boost to their regular payments in March next year. In total, single pensioners are receiving an extra $338 a year and couples are receiving an extra $510 a year combined. This includes people in the local community receiving age, disability and carer pensions, as well as veterans' income take it. Is it support recipients. Pensioners in public housing in New South Wales pay 25 per cent of their pension as rent. We have recently heard the announcement by the New South Wales government that it is its intention to increase public housing rents. This federal government, a Labor government, delivered the increase as a separate pension supplement so it would not be included when the state government calculated public housing rents, which has been the accepted practice for many years. The New South Wales Liberal government's decision means a maximum rate single pensioner will now pay an extra $84.50 a year in rent. I have to ask myself where the local state members for Oatley and East Hills were when this tax decision was proposed. This increase was imposed and, at the same time, they crow about what they have done for their electorates since the election-much of which was misleading because it was Commonwealth money. That is now evident-it has been completed-but they claim credit for it. In reality, when it counted, they could not genuinely assist the vulnerable in their electorates because they were missing in action. We must not forget that it has been the Labor government that have taken the lead in introducing profound social security reform. The conservative side of politics has no such proud history-rather, the contrary. The reason this is a pernicious grabtheft-by the state Liberal government is that the supplement that has been given to pensioners in public housing is to offset and to compensate for increases that they may pay as a result of the introduction of the carbon tax. It is not a situation where we are looking at increases as a result of CPI. In past, the net result has been that 25 per cent of those increases are grabbed by the state government in relation to public housing rent. What you are going to have here is a situation where pensioners in public housing are actually going to be worse off because they are going to have the impost of costs that flow from the introduction of the carbon tax-we have said that from day one; we have been honest-but they are also going to cop that 25 per cent increase on that extra money that they have got with the state government increasing their housing rent. That is theft, in my mind. That is why it was made a supplement. It is not a net increase per se; it is an increase given to them to offset perceived and actual costs in the future. Who pays? The most vulnerable in our community, those on disability support and carers pension, pensioners themselves-not the rich, not the people not in public housing. There are many who are not living in public housing that the state government cannot reach out to. But, you see, this is the Liberal formula: go after the vulnerable and have your middle-class, upper-middle-class and business welfare. That is what makes this increase by the state government so pernicious. We are not talking about a CPI increase that is flowing on to pensioners; we are talking about a supplement given to them to compensate, and they are copping it in the neck on top. The state Liberal government should desist. What else did they do it in relation to the budget? Ten thousand Public Service jobs are to go. That is also the future under the current opposition at a federal level if they actually get government. This is a portent of what will come in the future. (Time expired)",52
32,Mr HAWKE,COMMITTEES," I rise to oppose this motion and the absolute nonsense we have just heard from the member for Banks in relation to the so-called the 'theft' of money from vulnerable people in New South Wales. First of all I want to outline in response that the cost of this to the average person affected would be between $1.50 and $2 per week in public housing rents, already heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. By the government's own admission, the government has increased pension payments to $154 per fortnight and $156 per fortnight. What costs is the member for Banks referring to when he says that was to subsidise an increase in costs? It is completely disingenuous of this government. They are putting in a carbon tax which will increase prices-in New South Wales the forecast for increase in rents is 1.7 per cent, which would be a cost of $50 million over four years to the New South Wales government. If the federal government did not understand that that cost would be passed on, not just by government but by every industry sector, every small business, every operation in this country, why are they increasing compensation payments? These pension increases are not some historic reform-this motion says 'historic pension reforms'. This did not come out of the blue. These increases in the pension are to subsidise people for the cost of the carbon tax. That is what these are for. They are not for any other reason. The 1.7 per cent increase in rents has to be paid for by somebody. It is not going to be subsidised by the taxpayer because, as the New South Wales government has outlined, they have a program to improve public housing in New South Wales-to increase the number and quality of available places and ensure that more people can access it. Under this budget there will be more private rent subsidies, with around $50 million of support; $19 million for 21,000 householders to access affordable tenancies in the private rental market; and $134 million to provide specialist homelessness services. The government wants to come in here and pretend that the state government should not pass on the costs that the federal government have imposed on them. That is completely unrealistic. It is not happening in any sector. In the electricity sector, for example, we know New South Wales prices have increased by 18 per cent-electricity bills this year are up 18 per cent. The estimate, conservatively, is 8.9 per cent because of a carbon tax. Almost half of the increase in prices from 1 July is because of the carbon tax. If it is good enough for the electricity sector and every other sector to pass on and the government to say, 'We are increasing your pension by this much to pay for it,' then they have got to say that 1.7 per cent in the matter of rents is going to be passed on by the state government as well. It is going to happen all around the country. It is completely disingenuous for this government to suggest otherwise. It is disingenuous for the member for Banks to come in here and say, 'We've been honest from day one.' 'Honest from day one' prior to the last federal election would have been for the Treasurer or the Prime Minister to look into the camera and say, 'We are introducing a carbon tax that will push up the price of public housing rents by 1.7 per cent.' That would have been honest. Instead we heard from this government: 'We will not be introducing a carbon tax,' and, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That was the message before the election. Wayne Swan said it was absolute nonsense that we would be introducing a carbon tax prior to the election. Yet they bring it in, and costs will be ratcheted up across the economy as a deliberate result of their carbon tax and their policy. Then they have the hide to come to this chamber and put a motion up like this saying: 'People are going to pay more. This is outrageous! Oh, isn't this terrible?' It is a direct result of the government's own policy that these vulnerable people will be paying more. For the first time in New South Wales we have terms like 'energy poverty' coming into use across Sydney. I know that some of the members sitting opposite on the backbench understand what I am talking about. We have energy poverty coming into Australia because of the mismanagement of our public utilities, the mismanagement of government enterprises and, now, the world's biggest and most punishing carbon tax. If the member for Parramatta wanted to really do something to assist Australian pensioners then she would propose, of course, standing by the member for Griffith, abolishing the carbon tax and moving to an emissions trading scheme or another model. That is what the member for Parramatta would do-not stand by this failed government with its failed carbon tax. The New South Wales government is to be commended for being realistic and for keeping their finances on a sustainable footing. In particular, the Minister for Families and Community Services is to be commended for doing her job to ensure that all vulnerable people in New South Wales get a fair deal. Everything has to be paid Governments can only continue to provide services on a sustainable footing. The carbon tax is an unsustainable tax for Australia. It ought to be removed, and vulnerable people will suffer if it is not. Debate adjourned.

34,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (12:01): I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2012 contains a number of vital measures to restore trust and confidence in the financial advice sector, including implementing an advisor-charging regime where advisers are required to obtain their clients agreement to charge ongoing fees, annual disclosure of ongoing fees, a statutory duty to act in the best of the client, and a ban on conflicted remuneration and enhancements to ASIC's capacity to supervise the financial services industry and boost its ability to protect investors. The government recognises the significance of this legislation for the financial services industry. Amendments to the legislation passed by the Senate will provide more flexible application arrangements for the future of financial advice reforms. Under these amendments, mandatory application of the reforms will occur from 1 July 2013, but entities will have the ability to voluntarily elect to comply from 1 July 2012. The amendments replace the previous application arrangements whereby the reforms were mandatory from 1 July 2012. The amendments go further than those of the opposition and provide more flexibility by giving early industry movers the opportunity to opt into the reforms. Amendments (1) to (7) make changes that will ensure the requirements relating to ongoing fee arrangements and fee disclosure statements apply from the date specified in a notice lodged by the financial services licensee with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. If the licensee does not lodge a notice the requirements will apply from 1 July 2013. Amendment (8) implements the transition arrangements for those who elect to comply with the reforms from a date during the transition period, being 1 July 2012, until 30 June 2013. Amendment (8) sets out the requirement to lodge notice of this election with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and when notice of this election must be provided to certain clients. In terms of the amendments to the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures), which I will move shortly, amendment (1) sets out when a notice must be provided to clients impacted by the licensee's election to comply with the reforms from a date during the transition period. Amendments (2) to (10) make changes that will ensure the requirements relating to the best-interest obligations and the ban on conflicted remuneration. Volume based shelf-space fees and asset based fees on borrowed amounts apply from the date specified in the notice lodged by the financial services licensee with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. If the licensee does not lodge a notice, the requirements will apply from 1 July 2013. In essence, the government has listened to the concerns from the business and financial planning committee that they need more time to prepare for these changes. The government introduced amendments in the Senate to revise the application arrangements for the reforms. The reforms will still commence from 1 July 2012 but compliance will be voluntary until 1 July 2013, when they will become enforceable against all industry participants. The more flexible timetable balances the needs of industry and consumers, as it gives early industry movers the opportunity to provide commission-free products from 1 July 2012. The amendments will, however, allow licensees to opt into the reforms early if they are ready to do so before 1 July 2013. The revised implementation arrangements will lower industry implementation costs as they will allow the FoFA and Stronger Super reforms to be synchronised. I commend the amendments to the House.",57
35,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," The coalition's position has not changed since it previously considered this package of legislation. We are disappointed that our series of detailed amendments last time have not been adopted by the government. Our amendments, firstly, sought to delay the implementation of the legislation until 1 July 2013. We thought we nearly had the government's agreement on our proposal for that. Instead they have gone down their own path in the Senate. Secondly, we sought to remove opt-in arrangements. Thirdly, we sought to make annual fee disclosures prospective rather than retrospective. Fourthly, we wanted to ensure that antiavoidance provisions only prospectively. Fifthly, we wanted to ensure that commissions are not paid on life risk insurance inside MySuper products or within superannuation if the cover is automatic. Sixthly, we sought to ensure that superannuation funds retain the ability to offer intrafund advice. Seventh, we wanted to provide a clear definition of a 'funds manager' to ensure that fees are not caught in the ban on volume based shelf-space fees and to permit rebates from fund managers to product providers and retain consumer scale benefits discounts. Eighth, we wanted to allow scaleable advice. Ninth, we wanted to instil a robust bestinterest duty recommendation to enhance and improve consumer protections. Tenth, we wanted to provide express exemption on general, over-the-counter advice. Eleventh, we wanted to amend an unintended consequence to ensure that there is a causal link between the payment for and provision of financial advice. Twelfth, we wanted to ensure that a financial advisory business can be sold to employees of the business without the sale proceeds being caught in conflicted remuneration provisions within legislation. And lastly, my lucky number, 13: we wanted to ensure that counterproductive geographical limits were removed from the legislation. These, you would agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, are all sensible amendments. They are all wise, they are all carefully considered-and they have all been rejected by the government in its wisdom. The coalition are of the opinion that we are unable to support this legislation in its current form, without passage of our substantive amendments. I note that the government have chosen to move an amendment in the Senate on the start date of this legislation. The government have done this because they did not have the legislation ready when the legislation was applied before the House in March and despite the fact that the coalition moved an amendment which would have had the same effect as the government's amendment. We put forward amendments in the House of Representatives; the government rejected them here and then made one of those same amendments in the Senate, and they are now saying, 'What a great idea.' I urge the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Financial Services and Superannuation, who is the minister at the table: pick up the other 12 proposed coalition amendments. It is not too late, Bill. Forget what the Treasurer thinks. He is the same Treasurer who was out there this morning saying that the claim about the denial of water to schoolkids was in fact a great big lie. I would not believe anything that the Treasurer says, especially on this legislation. Do not take his advice on FOFA.",58
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for North Sydney should not transgress that one, because it might fall under the purview of the chair, and I mightthe Mr HOCKEY: I will bring you back to the amendments",59

39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"He knows more about that than you do, so don't go there, Member for North Sydney!",59
40,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"The government's amendment to the start date for the legislation proposes a soft start date of 1 July 2012 with a hard start date of 1 July 2013. We view this as a poor outcome for both consumers and advisers. It will create enormous confusion and uncertainty, like everything else this government do. It is absurd to expect people to be in a position to implement radical changes to their existing business practices, including significant and costly systems changes, in-how many days are there until 1 July? Mr Shorten interjecting",59
41,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"There you go! Even if people did want to comply with the FOFA requirements from 1 July 2012, it would be impossible to do so in practice. There are no regulations in place, we have no indication as to when the necessary regulations will be made, ASIC is unlikely to issue guidance notes on many aspects of FOFA until the end of 2012 at the very earliest (Extension of time granted) and the code of conduct required for the government's latest version of opt-in will not be in place until sometime in 2013. How can people be expected to comply with regulations, ASIC guidance notes and a code of conduct which will not be in existence on 1 July 2012 or for some time after that? What is worse, given the retrospective nature of parts of this legislation, compliance becomes even more difficult. Once again the Labor government and the minister at the table have acted far too slowly to implement some very major changes, and they have been caught short. Mr Shorten interjecting",60
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The minister,60
43,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"No, keep going-keep going. They should simply admit that they have bungled the introduction of FOFA and run out of time to implement the changes by 1 July 2012. For the next 12 months there will also be a complete lack of certainty for consumers, as there will not be a level playing field for provision of financial advice. It will be practically impossible for consumers to know which adviser is complying with the old rules and which adviser has already moved to the new requirements. A single start date, with an appropriate lead-in time to implement the necessary changes, would provide certainty for consumers and financial advisers. Sadly, as with so many of the FOFA changes, the government have created more confusion and more uncertainty rather than fixed a problem-that is, not providing an appropriate state date in the first placeof their own making. The best way to remove this uncertainty would have been for the government to support the sensible coalition amendment to provide one clear and unambiguous start date of 1 July 2013, together with the other 12 coalition amendments. I know that the heart of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Financial Services and Superannuation is in the right place; the problem is that his head is not in the right place. Sadly, this additional legislation means more red tape for financial advisers and the financial services industry. Like so much of what this government do, this legislation is mired in complexity and mired in the confusion of a government who do not understand the impact of what they are doing, even if it is a thing as simple as handing out water bottles to the 100,000 kids who come to Parliament House each year. The FOFA reforms are complex, but why can't this government get anything right? It is simple; it is not hard. You need to consult and engage with industry, and, once you have consulted and engaged with industry, you take on board their concerns about the red tape and the complexity and give them fair warning about the change that will occur rather than giving them a soft start date and a hard start date and leaving it to decisions the which are going to be made in a handful of days before the new financial year. All of this has a cost. That is what the government just do not understand. The member for Chisholm has previously been very engaged in the financial services industry. If the member for Chisholm were to speak on this legislation, she would be absolutely appalled at the complexity of it. fact, I think that the member for Chisholm used to be a member of the Finance Sector Union. I would have thought that the Finance Sector Union would be appalled at the complexity associated with this legislation. The member for Chisholm, if she were able to speak on this legislation, would be truly appalled at the complexity and at the",60

47,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"I was suggesting that, as any fair-minded person who has had any real-life experience in the financial services industry, or who, as in my case, has been a lawyer to the financial services industry, would know, when you have regulation change-when you have ASIC guidance notes changed and when you change codes of conduct-it just adds to the complexity and cost of financial services. This is an industry that now accounts for over 10 per cent of GDP, and it cannot afford poor regulation.",61
48,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am pleased to rise to speak in relation to the amendments made in the Senate to the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2012 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2012. Throughout the consultation process with the financial services sector in the lead-up to this legislation being introduced into the House, it was clear that there was considerable disquiet within the financial services sector In about the very substantial degree of work required to be undertaken to comply with the detailed and onerous requirements in this legislative package. There are two issues which are quite distinct. One issue is the merits of the amendments. It is not really appropriate to be discussing the merits of the substantive legislative scheme which is being enacted here today. But the other and distinct issue which it absolutely is appropriate to discuss-because it emerges very directly from the terms of the amendments which have been moved in the Senate and which the House is now considering-is the practicalities of implementation of the very complex legislative and regulatory scheme set out in the future of financial advice bills. The scope and complexity of the changes to information technology systems which will be required to be made by the financial services sector in respect of accounts held by many millions of Australians in many different kinds of products-in many cases products which have been on foot for 10 or 20 or 30 years and the statements for which are provided using legacy IT systems which will need to be reopened and amended to give effect to this policy scheme-are enormous. That has been the constant theme of those who appeared before the parliamentary committee which was considering this bill, and that has been the constant theme of those in the financial services sector who have been to speak to many people in this place over recent months. The government presents to us the amendments which have come back from the Senate as offering the solution to this problem. We are told that relief has been granted and it will no longer be necessary for participants in the financial services sector to achieve compliance with this detailed scheme, with effect from 1 July 2012. Instead, strict compliance has been deferred until 1 July 2013. But on even the most cursory analysis the method which has been adopted to achieve this outcome is ludicrously and unnecessarily complex. What is proposed in the amendments which have come back to the House from the Senate is that the obligations under the law will be in place from 1 July 2012 but there will be relief granted from compliance with those obligations until 1 July 2013, unless of course an entity which is subject to those laws lodges a notice between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2013 indicating that it now regards itself as being subject to compliance with these laws. It is difficult to conceive of a more complex, confusing, opaque method of dealing with a fairly straightforward problem. Why is this being done? It is being done for one simple reason. It is being done for political reasons. It is being done because the minister at the table wants to be able to say, 'This package of reforms will take effect from 1 July 2012.' That is his sole and only motivation in coming up with this ludicrously complex scheme so that he, on the one hand, can say, 'I have delivered an outcome and this adds to my glittering and already extensive curriculum vitae.' Regrettably, costs will be incurred by many millions of Australians and by many financial institutions in complying with this unnecessarily complex set of arrangements. There will be deep confusion on the part of Australians who are provided with products by the financial services sector because they will not know, without making detailed further inquiry, what their rights are and what the obligations of the provider are. This is a messy, unsatisfactory compromise and it should be rejected.",61
49,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (12:20): In terms of the government amendments to the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2012 and the comments made by the opposition, I just have a few points to set the record straight. The opposition failed to amend the FOFA bills. The amendments they proposed included to remove the opt-in arrangements entirely. That failed because the opt-in requirement was recommended with respect to superannuation advice provided to MySuper members by the Cooper super system review. It stayed in because it is a good idea. The amendment of the opposition concerning the removal of the disclosure arrangements for existing clients failed because the disclosure arrangements for existing clients are not retrospective. They only apply from the date of commencement. The proposition that the opposition will vote against delaying the compulsory compliance date until 1 July 2013 is ludicrous because it would deny the industry the opportunity to comply with the laws on a voluntary basis during the transition period, yet they will not support a completion date by 1 July 2013. The opposition proposes removing the requirement that advisers take any step in circumstances that could be reasonably regarded as in the best interests of the clients. Our concern is that the opposition amendment, if it successful, would allow a tick-a-box approach to compliance with the best interest duty rather than a genuine consideration of what is in the best interests of retail customers. But the opposition has made some further points in their contributions on the amendments proposed by the governmentthat is, the idea that people are not ready change. We accept that for some organisations in financial planning it will take up until 1 July 2013. These are complex reforms. But many organisations in the financial planning world are already ready. Many of them advise me that they are FOFA ready. The Financial Planning Association of Australia advises me that they believe that a lot of their members are already ready. Indeed, if that does not satisfy the opposition and allay their concerns, I would draw attention to the fact that there are plenty of commission-free products coming on the market right now in anticipation of our FOFA changes. The opposition also made some references in opposing our amendment by saying that what we were doing was not good for consumers. How do they then explain away Choice supporting what we have done in the future of financial advice reforms? In other words, members of the House, through the Deputy Speaker, a whole lot of people in financial wealth management, in consumer groups and even the Financial Sector Union have supported our FOFA reforms. The final observation I have to add to this debate is that on one hand the opposition say that the changes are being rushed and are complex. Yet on the other hand, if the opposition when they were in government back in 2001 had done what we had done, then arguably some of the problems we have seen arise out of Trio and other financial service areas would not have occurred. To me the question is not, 'Are we taking this too quickly?' to me the question is, 'Why didn't this occur 11 years ago?' Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (12:23): As I have previously touched on in the debate around this bill, one of my biggest concerns with this proposed, massive new amount of regulation for the financial services industry is that, in effect, it is not going to deal with the issue of poor advice to clients. It deals for predominantly with issues to do with fee disclosure, risk insurance inside superannuation funds and intrafund advice. It is an enormous amount of regulation that, according to the industry, is going to cost some $700 million to implement for $350 million per annum to comply. In the scope of this legislation of seeking to reduce the cost to consumers, the actual affect is probably that it is going to increase it. It does not deal with the underlying issue that the Cooper review and other reviews of the financial services industry have touched on, and that is the matter of advice. The industry already has significant amounts of regulation and one of the key components in that regulation is the know-your-client rule. One of my arguments for some time has been the effect of lack of enforcement of existing regulations on planners doing the wrong thing in the industry, which has led to some of the issues we are facing and discussing today. Equally it is also a failure of product. None of this legislation deals with the product providers that have failed to look after the interests of the investors. It is always the advisors, the easy targets, that are subject to this increasing and onerous regulation. Not only is it creating concern for them personally but also it is creating enormous difficulties and problems in their businesses. As the member for North Sydney has pointed out, the coalition has proposed a number of amendments which have not even been touched on by the government.",62
50,Mr Shorten,BILLS,"They're not even being debated. Mr VAN MANEN: Well, they are being ignored for the want of actually getting better regulation.",63
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for Forde needs to speak to the amendments before the chair. Mr VAN MANEN: Things that add to the complexity are matters such as opt-in, providing a clear definition of what a funds manager is and ensuring that the fees are caught up in the ban on volume based shelf space, allowing scalable advice, instilling robust best interest duty recommendation and enhanced improved consumer protections. If you looked at the know-yourclient rule, applied that properly across the financial planning industry and actually enforced it, we would not need much of this onerous new regulation. We acknowledge that it is important to have a sound and robust financial planning industry that is transparent in what advisers charge their clients. They are managing the wealth or future wealth of Australian citizens. Particularly with respect to superannuation, the amount of wealth invested is going to continue to grow significantly over the years to come. Adding complexity, regulation and cost to the system is not going to achieve those outcomes. Far better outcomes could be achieved through improving training",64
52,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The member for Ford will resume his seat. The minister on a point of order.,64
53,Mr Shorten,BILLS,I have listened to the member for Forde. I do not know if he is voting for or against the amendments.,64
54,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The minister will resume his seat. The member for Forde will ignore the unhelpful interjection from the minister and continue on the amendments. Mr VAN MANEN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the unhelpful interjection is along the lines of unhelpful regulation and impost on the financial planning industry. As a member of the coalition, and as I have previously stated in this chamber, I will be voting against this legislation. (Time expired)",64
55,Mr CIOBO,BILLS," I am pleased to rise to speak to this bill because in many respects it symbolises many of the not problems that are incumbent with this government. The issue is that the bill and the a amendments incorporate an approach to regulation on the financial services sector that is entirely inconsistent with the best interests of Australian consumers. The minister at the table would make out that this is all about providing a better framework, more transparency and better regulation. He has Choice on board, he has the FPA on board and maybe the FSC. The reality is that you cannot escape the fundamental connection between the amount of regulation and the compliance costs associated with that. From that you also cannot escape the fact that increased compliance costs mean increased costs to consumers. The extraordinary thing about the minister at the table is that this is all about him having a tick-a-box. The tick-a-box the minister is after on this occasion is the chance to stand up before the Australian people and say, 'Look what I delivered. Look what I have done. Aren't I a great visionary when it comes to financial services regulation,' as part of his tick-a-box approach in getting to the highest office in the land. But the reality is that this is not good for consumers and it is not supported by financial planners that I talk to in my electorate, as well as those more broadly when it comes to personal interactions that I have. I bring to the debate a childhood with a father who was a financial planner for 30 years-in fact, one of the best financial planners at AMP, the fifth biggest in the country. That was during an era when there was not this raft of regulation that has existed prior to this point but now is being exacerbated in wholesale terms by this government. There is one fundamental thing that this minister and this government cannot escape, and that is that nothing-no amount of regulation-can deal with the fact that some people make bad choices. No amount of regulation can deal with the fact that there will always, unfortunately, be some bad financial planners, and the reality is that those that make poor choices, like those that are bad financial planners, can never be stopped by regulation. It is analogous to road rules: you can have all the road rules you want, but at the end of the day people make bad choices and people will break the law. So the question is one of balance: what is the appropriate level of balance in a marketplace so that we can ensure that there is civil order and a framework in place that provides optimum outcomes for consumers, but not so much so that we tip the critical mass of regulation too far. What the legislation before the chamber today does is take it too far, and the net impact of all of this is that Australian consumers will simply not go to financial planners in numbers as large as they have historically because it will simply be too expensive for them. That is my concern as someone who believes in smaller government, believes that the market should reign supreme and believes that consumers ultimately need to take responsibility for how they manage their money. This government has done more to send Australians to the poorhouse and impoverish a number of small business Australians than any government preceding it, as far as I am concerned, with some of its reckless policies. Mr Shorten interjecting",64
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Moncrieff will return to the amendments before the chair.,65
57,Mr CIOBO,BILLS,I return to the,65
58,Mr Shorten,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I did not want to interrupt, because he has made some points, but he is more lost than Burke and Wills now. Can we get back to relevance?",65
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The minister will resume his seat. The member for Moncrieff does need to refer to the amendment before the chair.,65
60,Mr CIOBO,BILLS,"The rationale of the government's approach to this bill is that it is going to protect Australians from making imprudent financial decisions or being led astray by financial planners. My point is that Australians have needed protection from this government more than from just about anything, so it goes very directly to the rationale, because there have been many Australians who have lost their life savings who have been involved in, for example, roof insulation businesses that have been destroyed by this government. So that absolutely goes to the rationale of this bill. The reality is that good governance is about getting the balance right. These amendments and the legislation before the House do not get the balance right; they take it too far. Fewer Australians will, in fact, solicit the expert financial advice that they need, and the reality is that a great gulf has widened between those involved in financial planning and those involved in other industries where people often put their life savings, such as real estate.",65
61,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," Given that the House is presently in the consideration in detail phase, this obviously presents an opportunity for the minister to explain to the House the merits of the amendments which were made in the Senate and why it is that he is putting to the House that the House ought to adopt these amendments. I note in passing that it is therefore entirely inappropriate for the minister to be asking the member for Forde or anybody else, 'How are you voting?' It reveals a disturbing lack of understanding of the procedure that we are presently going through, because the procedure we are going through is for the minister to explain the merits of the amendments to the House so that the House can then make an assessment. But let me turn to the specific question which I raised in my previous contribution and which was sadly overlooked in the magnificent collection of non sequiturs with which the minister entertained the House some time ago. The question that I would like an answer from the minister on is a very specific one. I want to understand the rationale for the legislative strategy which has been adopted in proposing the addition of proposed sections 966, 967 and 968. These proposed sections give effect to the legislative scheme under which there will be the operation of the substantial provisions of both of these bills when they pass into being acts",65
62,Mr Shorten,BILLS,Thank you for that assumption.,66
63,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS,"On the assumption that they pass into being acts. But the proposed sections which I have just mentioned, together with the effect of the amended proposed section 962D, will have the effect that the provisions are not operative with effect from 1 July 2012; they only become operative with effect from 1 July 2013, unless a relevant party lodges a notice saying, in effect, 'We accept the operation of these provisions.' The question I am seeking to get some clarification about from the minister in this consideration in detail phase is: what is the rationale for this legislative scheme? If it is accepted by the minister, as I understand it is, that there is time involved in financial institutions going through the detailed planning work and the detailed information technology implementation work to be able to comply with these new provisions-the minister earlier said that it may well take some of these organisations up until 30 June 2013and if it is accepted that time will be required by a number of participants in the marketplace then what is unclear is what benefit is served by the minister's complex two-track approach, with the soft start date from 1 July 2012. What is the substantive benefit which is served, other than the immediate specific benefit to the minister of being able to say to the world, 'Look, my package of reforms has taken effect'? The assessment this House has to make is to weigh up the costs and benefits associated with the amendments which it is presently considering. And it is clear that the cost includes confusion on the part of citizens, and particularly consumers, who are trying to work out the set of obligations which the financial services institution or adviser with which they are dealing is subject to. There is confusion which will be faced by consumers and there will be extra cost and complexity because of this two-tier approach. But what we do not know is the benefit to the broader Australian community, excepting, as I think we all do in this chamber-I think it is uncontentious-that it has career benefits for the minister. But what are the broader policy benefits? That is really the question which the House should be informed of, and that is the question I specifically put to the minister.",66

NA Offshore Oil and Gas Resources Sector Security Inquiry Report",69
66,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:52): by leave-I rise today to recognise the recent retirement of Mr Michael John Palmer AO, APM from his role as the Inspector of Transport Security, a role he has discharged admirably since his appointment in 2004. I also table the most  oil and gas resources sector security inquiry, which I received on 7 June 2012. NA NA NA Firstly, I would like to take some time to discuss this important report which I announced in February last year. I have previously updated the House on the importance of this inquiry-the first-ever comprehensive review of the security of the oil and gas sector that employs more than 10,000 Australians, contributes 2.5 per cent of Australia's GDP and generates an impressive $28 billion in revenue. The reserves in the north-west of Australia, the Bass Strait and the Timor Sea provide employment for our nation, income for our economy and energy to the world. In fact, Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer. We need to ensure that we have effective security arrangements in place and the right response capabilities in the event of an incident or attack on offshore oil and gas exploration and production infrastructure. This is all the more important as current and future exploration continues to push out into deeper and more distant waters to satisfy the increasing worldwide demand for oil and gas resources. The report is thorough-drawing on detailed input and consultation with state territory governments, industry and peak bodies such as the board of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA). Indeed, industry's input was critical to the development of this report and I would like to thank them for their generous and honest interactions and contributions. Simply put, the report would not be of the quality it is today without the access, aid and assistance they provided.  and his team undertook extensive Australian and international consultation to better understand, review and assess security planning and preparedness, recruitment, training, government and industry interaction, command and arrangements, response capacity and clarity, and communication and information-sharing arrangements in the oil and gas resources sector environment. In preparing the report, the team conducted 31 offshore and onshore visits and over 50 consultations in Australia as well as eight offshore and onshore site visits and 45 consultations internationally. These spanned Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland, the Bass Strait, and the Joint Petroleum Development Area in the Timor Sea through to site visits organised by the United States Coast Guard to facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The inquiry also benefited from a legal framework, research and discussion paper prepared by the University of Queensland, which was considered as part of the preparation of this inquiry report, informing the inquiry on the current and relevant international and Australian maritime law. The final result is an impressive depth of inquiry for an important issue-with 10 detailed recommendations spanning issues ranging from onsite security audits and and inspections, security access, exercise and exclusion zones through to government and industry interaction and relationships, incident response and, importantly in the current computer age, cybersecurity. In addition to the recommendations, the report details possible options in response to the recommendations raised. Furthermore, drawing upon the learnings from the offshore and international consultations, the report details a further 10 possible approaches for consideration, based on United States, North Sea and our own experiences as to what has worked successfully and what could be improved. In summary, the report highlights an important point. We can be confident that our security control measures are international best practice. However, it also highlights areas where current security related practices and arrangements could be improved, and it suggests options which will warrant further consideration by government. I thank Mr Palmer for his work on this important issue and for his detailed report, which I table for members and commend members to read in detail. NA NA  like to acknowledge his wider contribution.  is a 35-year career police professional. He brought to this report and to his role as the Inspector of Transport Security extensive experience in policy leadership and reform in the community, national and international policing sector. It is a difficult role, requiring the investigation of transport security matters, including major transport incidents, or, where necessary, patterns of incidents which may indicate possible weaknesses in our transport security systems. It is also a position that requires significant vision to proactively identify where transport security arrangements could be further improved.  It has certainly been a busy time during his tenure, during which a number of very important inquiries were undertaken, in addition to the offshore inquiry. His work included the surface transport security assessment, the Sydney Airport security screening review, and the ferry security inquiry. Of particular importance was Mr Palmer's international piracy and armed robbery at sea security inquiry, which looked into the worldwide issue of maritime piracy and armed robbery at sea, and considered the effectiveness of security arrangements of Australian ships in light of this threat. This work has directly resulted in Australia making a significant contribution to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime Counter-Piracy Program. Indeed, the report has been used by a number of nations when developing their response to piracy and has ensured that Australia has in place an appropriate security framework to deal with maritime threats. Of course, these inquirespast and current-were in addition to his inquires conducted for other portfolios such as the inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau and more recently the Risdon Prison Complex inquiry, undertaken for the Tasmanian government.  beyond his most recent work inquiring into matters of national importance. I mentioned he has had 35 years as a police professional; a career which started as a member of the Northern Territory Police in 1963 where he served Territorians for 16 years. In 1983, after having acted as barrister at law in Queensland, he returned to the Territory as a commissioned officer, before being promoted to Commissioner of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services in 1988. It was also at this time that he received the Australian Police Medal. In 1997, he was selected as the member for Asia to the Interpol Executive Committee where he served for three years. Here he worked as part of the executive committee to supervise the delivery of the decisions of the Interpol General Assembly and prepare the agenda and program of work for the general assembly's consideration. It was also during this period that he was rightly recognised for his work in introducing far-reaching anticorruption processes in the Australian Federal Police, receiving the Officer of the Order of Australia in 1998. It was of no surprise that upon his return he was promoted, this time to commissioner in the Australian Federal Police, where he served for a further seven years. Finally, before taking up the role as Inspector of Transport Security, he worked for a number of years as a private consultant and as an associate professor at Charles Sturt University's Australian Graduate School of Policing, providing a valuable opportunity to pass on his wealth of knowledge and insight into both the law and law enforcement to the next generation of leaders. Indeed, his academic pursuits have been notable, from being conferred a Doctor of Letters for his advancement of policing to his extensive writing on modern police practices, including as the co-editor of the authoritative law enforcement text, Police Leadership in Australasia. In closing, it is always very sad to lose from this position such a wealth of experience and judgment. However, I am pleased to note that he will continue to contribute to public life through his ongoing work in the human rights and not-for-profit sector, and through future engagements in the public and private sectors. I sincerely thank Mick Palmer for his many decades of service to the safety of the nation and wish him all the very best in his future endeavours. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wide Bay to speak for 9½ minutes. Leave granted.",70
67,Mr ALBANESE,OF TRANSPORT SECURITY,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss (Leader of The Nationals) speaking for a period not exceeding nine and a half minutes. Question agreed to.,73
68,Mr TRUSS,OF TRANSPORT SECURITY," Protecting Australia's $28-billion-a-year oil and gas industry is vital for Australia's future energy security. As the minister notes, the industry employs some 10,000 Australians across the country and accounts for 2.5 per cent of Australia's GDP. Offshore oil and gas production provides a major input into our economy and its infrastructure is of critical national importance. There are around 170 oil and gas production platforms in operation around the Australian coast from the Timor Sea, the North West Shelf to the Bass Strait. Australia's gas production for domestic and export markets continues to increase every year. However, petroleum liquids production is still falling. In 2000-01 Australia produced 272.4 million barrels of petroleum liquids. By 2009-10, this had fallen to 186.9 million barrels. There is further scope for exploration and appraisal drilling to address the growing demand for petroleum liquids. While Australia accounts for approximately 0.6 per cent of world oil supply and 1.5 per cent of worldwide demand, oil and natural gas accounts for nearly 56 per cent of primary energy consumed in Australia. In fact, Australia is the ninth largest energy producer in the world. With the rise in international piracy and the threat of terrorism, it is certainly timely to revisit the security requirements in place to protect our offshore oil and gas assets. I note from the minister's summary of the report being tabled today that he said we can be confident that our security measures are international best practice. However, I am alarmed to read in the report: … it is understood no on-site offshore facility security assessments have been conducted since 2007. That is indeed an alarming gap. It suggests the gaping security assessment gap is indeed real. Indeed, the report highlights and recommends: In the opinion of the Inquiry, the current Australian situation is unsatisfactory and arrangements should be implemented which provide the capacity for an effective offshore security audit program to be introduced and maintained. What in fact is happening-to use the minister's words-is best practice in the world is indeed at risk. That is hardly world's best practice. If asylum seeker boats can turn up every day, often unobserved, it is clear that our security is as open as a sieve. In recent years, pirates have been involved in unsuccessful attempts to attack and take over an oil rig off the coast of Nigeria with a firefight erupting between the Nigerian Navy and the pirates. As the minister has noted before, while there is no suggestion of a particular threat against any specific oil and gas platform, vigilance is essential. It is clear that any potential security threat would be extremely damaging to our national economy and affect our energy security. I refer the minister to today's report finding: While within Victoria and Western Australia relevant state police engage on a regular basis in joint exercises with industry on near-shore offshore facilities, it is understood that no Commonwealth agency has participated in such exercises since about 2004. There are other unsatisfactory findings. The report stipulates: Industry has emphasised the constructive relationship it generally enjoys with government agencies. There is, however, common agreement that increased engagement between industry and government security agencies, aimed at enhancing mutual levels of understandingindustries' knowledge of the intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination processes of government and government's knowledge and expertise of industry-in the security space, is necessary. Moreover: While this initiative will make a positive contribution to the improvement of the nature and quality of intelligence sharing and the interaction between government and industry, the broader current levels of engagement and communication would benefit from further and ongoing improvement … The Australian Security Organisation (ASIO), which were already playing a constructive role in government and industry relationships through the publications of the Business Liaison Unit (BLU), have been quick to recognise and react to these industry concerns and an industry round-table was convened by them in Canberra during March 2012 to specifically address the primary matters of concern. In terms of security shortfalls relating to recruitment, the report finds: The vetting of Australian employees as part of the application process for a MSIC generally comprises a criminal-record check, as well as internal company checks deemed appropriate. Industry sees the MSIC process as providing an additional layer of security vetting above the level they can provide themselves. However, although the MISC vetting process provides a security assessment and a photographic record of an individual employee, the process is limited. Currently, the requirement for a MSIC does not apply to foreign nationals or to Australian and other workers engaged on nonregulated vessels operating under subcontract arrangements. Clearly, as the report finds, much more needs to be done. The coalition will always support sensible moves to enhance our maritime security regime. The coalition has a history of proposing and supporting sensible measures to enhance our maritime security regime and, in this case, the security of our offshore oil and gas assets. For example, in 2005 it was a coalition amendment to the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 that required operators to write and follow security plans, including security risk assessments and preventative strategies to manage risk. The coalition notes the report and is extremely concerned about the gaping holes in Australia's offshore oil and gas resources security. The coalition has a record of securing Australia's borders and strengthening security requirements across Intelligence the maritime industry including our offshore oil and gas assets. There appears, from this report, to have been serious lapses since 2007. It is not satisfactory at all-let alone, the world's best practice. Finally, like the minister, I would like to pay tribute to the outgoing Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Michael Palmer as he completed his term on 7 June this year. He has served with distinction not only in his most recent role but in an outstanding, career of service and dedication. He served in his current position as Inspector of Transport Security during the whole time. I was transport minister, and I admired his dedication and commitment.  decorated policeman of 35 years service, winning the Australian Police Medal in 1988. He started out with the Northern Territory police in 1963 where he served for 16 years. Then, after a stint as barrister-atlaw in Queensland, he went back to the Territory in 1983, this time as a commissioned officer. He was duly promoted to the rank of Commissioner of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services in 1988. He became the Member for Asia, as the minister said, in the Interpol Executive Committee in 1997.  one of the architects of the Australian Federal Police's anti-corruption provisions. This earned him an Officer of the Order of Australia award in 1998. I could go on, but let me thank him for his exemplary service and, in particular, the last seven in his role Inspector of Transport Security. He leaves with the best wishes and respect of all who have served and worked with him, and the coalition wishes him well for the future. His extensive career background gave great authority to his reports. Finally, I also take the opportunity to welcome Mr Andy Hughes, who took up the post of Inspector of Transport Security from 8 June. Mr Hughes is also an experienced police officer. He has served in the AFP, including in the senior executive service, and was the Chief Police Officer for the ACT, as well as being in charge of national operations and international operations for the AFP. He was the commissioner of the Fiji Police Force and spent two years with the United Nations as the police adviser on  has observed, Mr Hughes comes ideally equipped for the position, and I wish him well in the new role. NA Economics Committee Report",73
69,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012, together with the dissenting report and the minutes of proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",75
70,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential administrative changes to support the tax rate changes in the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. In as particular, the bill sets withholding rates so that the correct amounts are withheld and are available for payment under the second bill at a later date. The substantive provisions of the bill are in schedule 1. It replicates exactly the provisions in schedule 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the third bill. The third bill was one of four bills that the committee examined in its last advisory report, tabled on Monday, 18 June 2012. In this inquiry the committee received submissions on this issue and took evidence from key stakeholders-in particular, the Financial Services Council, the Property Council and the Treasury. The committee concluded that all four bills should proceed. The referral of the bill is in effect requesting the committee to repeat its previous inquiry. The committee sees no constructive benefit in this, given that the circumstances are much the same as when the committee tabled its report a week ago. The committee reiterates its previous recommendation that the House pass the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 as proposed.",75
71,Mr CIOBO,COMMITTEES," by leave-I rise to make a statement in connection with the Economics Standing Committee advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012. Liberal members of the committee have lodged a dissenting report in relation to this bill. It is curious that this report, as the chair of the committee outlined, reflects on a bill that was before the committee only a matter of weeks ago and which the committee has already reported on. Mindful of that, the Liberal members of the committee have made dissenting comments that highlight our concern that perceptions about the sovereign risk in Australia are founded in reasonbecause this government does not know whether it is Arthur or Martha. That goes very directly to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012. The government originally announced they were reducing the rate from 30 per cent down to 7½ per cent. Then they announced in the budget that they were increasing the rate from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. Then they decided to withdraw and leave it at 7½ per cent, before introducing this bill, which puts it back up to 15 per cent. Is it any wonder at all that people are confused about what this government is up to? Is it any wonder that as Liberal members of the committee we stand steadfastly opposed not only to the impact of the bill itself but also to the very process of in-again, out-again, onagain, off-again, that this government has adopted with respect to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and, more broadly, with respect to withholding taxes are generally? We stand by our concerns as raised in the previous dissenting report of the committee. We also highlight that there were some robust criticisms of Treasury modelling and of the comparison rate chart that was put forward by Treasury and tabled and lodged with the committee secretariat and raised by, for example, the Property Council of Australia. NA Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. To which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House notes with approval that, in response to public pressure, the Government has introduced this limited bill, but deplores the Government's failure to: (1) establish an independent Registered Organisations Commission to: (a) enforce, and police the reporting and compliance obligations; (b) provide information to members of registered organisations about their rights and act as the body to receive complaints from their members; (c) educate registered organisations about the new obligations that apply to them; and (d) absorb the role of registered organisations enforcer and investigator, currently held by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia; (2) ensure registered organisations face the same accountability and transparency measures as required of companies and their directors under the Corporations Act; and (3) ensure registered organisations face the same penalties as companies and their directors under the Corporations Act."" Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (13:17): I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. It is interesting that it took the government only 10 days to announce this legislation, but only after the Leader of the Opposition had announced the coalition's Better Plan for Accountability and Transparency for Registered Organisations. It is flattering that Labor has sought to emulate the stance that had been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, but, as usual, Labor's plan is lacking in a number of key areas: it still sees Fair Work Australia in control of investigating registered organisations; it does not expressly provide Fair Work Australia with the ability to cooperate with police; the requirements and penalties are still not in line with the Corporations Act; and it has no reporting mechanism on why investigations are going overtime. The coalition's plan, on the other hand, seeks to make sure that members of registered organisations can be assured that their money is being used for the right things and for their interests. There are rules to ensure that companies and their boards of directors do the right thing-the same rules should apply to registered organisations and their officers. Our plan seeks to ensure that registered organisations and their officers are as accountable and transparent as companies and their directors, and that we have a level playing field where we ensure that everybody plays by the same rules. It is clear from the experience with the HSU that Fair Work Australia is not up to the job of making sure that registered organisations do the right thing-it is either a model of incompetence or is engaging-or has engaged in-a deliberate and overt go-slow to protect the government. The coalition's plan proposes to remove from Fair Work Australia both the investigative and the compliance powers over registered organisations and give those powers instead to a new, genuinely independent body, which will be called the Registered Organisations Commission. The Registered Organisations Commission will have stronger powers. It will be tasked with acting quickly and efficiently and will be required to cooperate with other law enforcement agencies where it is in the interests of the public to do so. By contrast, in this bill and under Labor's proposed changes Fair Work Australia would continue to be responsible for registered organisations. Under the government's plan, former union bosses are going to regulate union bosses. It is akin to putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. The rules and requirements which would apply as a result of the proposed changes are still significantly weaker than those currently applicable to company directors. Company directors are subject to 697 federal and state provisions that impose legal liabilities, including massive fines and jail time. While the penalties proposed in the bill are in line with other civil penalties in the Fair Work Act, they still fall considerably short of those required under the Corporations Act. It is the disjointed and inconsistent nature of this regulation that creates opportunities for people to find loopholes. This is disappointing but also expected of this government. Under the coalition's plan, the penalties would be the same across the board, whether for union bosses or company directors. It is worth noting that we can enforce penalties all we like but, at the end of the day, it is individual behavioural systems that let the everybody down. This point was highlighted in an article by Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks when he said: Those who believe that liberal democracy and the free market can be defended by the force of law and regulation alone, without an internalised sense of duty and morality, are tragically mistaken. As we discussed in earlier debates today, that rings very true. In a perfect world, citizens would be more aware of their 'moral' responsibility; however, as we all know, this is not necessarily the case. While this bill seeks to expand police cooperation powers, it does not clearly state that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that we get clarity on whether there will be cooperation in this area. There is also no express provision to allow Fair Work Australia to provide a brief of evidence to the DPP when it is important to give express powers to allow this to happen. This is a bill designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses that sees former union bosses as the 'cops on the beat'. It is a weak bill that does not go far enough and we call on the government to support the common-sense amendments that we will be proposing. These amendments will include: to give specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence; to ensure that the investigation is conducted by Fair Work Australia, not outsourced entirely, as this would allow; to ensure that the disclosure of how money is spent is provided to Fair Work Australia as well as to union members; to have reports to parliament on why investigations are taking so long, when the investigations last for more than a year, and then every six months thereafter; to make the provision relating to police cooperation very clear so that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police at the commencement, during and at the conclusion of an investigation; and to increase the penalties for misusing members' funds, in line with the Corporations Act. At the end of the day these bills and the penalties imposed should not be compromised to keep union bosses happy. They should be designed to protect everyday working Australians that fund these unions in the first place. In terms of the case with the HSU, it is disgraceful to see health workers' money being spent for personal purposes by union bosses and employees. Our health workers, who look after our ageing population, work with the disabled and support the sick, are not usually rolling in dough. They work hard to pay their bills and pay their unions to represent their best interests. If I were part of this workforce paying union dues, I would be outraged by the recent reports in the media about what has gone on and the outrageous, unauthorised expenditure of union funds. It is because of this investigation that we stand here today debating this proposed legislation. We have maintained all along that the process Fair Work Australia has undertaken on this investigation was severely lacking. The final report that was produced had 1,200 pages, with many pertaining to the former secretary of the HSU. We will not oppose this bill but will seek to apply sensible amendments to make it work better in everybody's interests, as we bill agree that something needs to be done to ensure that money being paid by members to registered organisations is used for proper purposes. As previously stated, and as usual, the coalition have a better plan and we will seek to improve the proposed legislation by making the amendments I referred to earlier.",76
72,Mr BANDT,BILLS," It is obvious, as a number of members have already made clear in their contributions to this debate, that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 is a response to some pretty concerning allegations that have been made in recent times about expenditure of union money in this country. There should be a fundamental principle that applies whatever your union, and that is that members' funds are spent for the advancement of members' interests. Unions are one of the few organisations that we have left in this country where members are able to exercise some very real control over the direction of their organisation and who runs it. You will find more democracy and control in a union than you will find in a publicly listed or a privately listed company or in many incorporated associations. It is a fundamental principle of unions, but it of course relies members being properly informed about what happens in their union, including in their union leadership. To the extent that this bill aims to provide members of unions with more information about what is happening in their own organisations, we are supportive of the intent of the bill. We note that the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, also supports this legislation. However, I do wish to raise one comment, which is that I wonder whether, in their haste to introduce this bill, said: the government have created in some ways an unlevel playing field. The requirements for disclosure of remuneration that are found in this bill would be a very good principle if they in fact applied across the board. But what we know is that, in many instances, unions and workers will find themselves negotiating with private proprietary limited companies and those companies may be very big and very powerful. There is no obligation on the five most senior staff within a privately listed company to tell the union or the workforce what they are earning and yet there will be an obligation on the people in the union to disclose their remuneration. So, potentially, as a result of this bill, we will have a situation where a union official-and it might not even be an elected official; it might be a staff member-is sitting down across the table from a very well paid human resources manager or consultant or one of the directors of the company, and one side will know what the other gets paid but the reverse will not be the case. I am concerned that that may lead to a situation of significant power imbalance between workers and their representatives on the one hand and employers who may be very big and powerful employers on the other. For all the reasons I outlined before, on that is not enough reason to stand in the way of this bill. But we do note that perhaps, in their haste, the government have tipped the playing field slightly against the people that this is supposed to assist.",79
73,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise also to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 and support the amendments moved by this side of the House. I will begin my remarks by quoting from another member in his contribution late last week. The member In my experience, the vast majority of trade unions are professionally managed by highly competent and dedicated people who act on the basis of sound professional advice. But, regrettably, there have been exceptions to that. Officers have sought to obtain personal benefit or benefit on behalf of others at the expense of members of their union. Reported instances include not only misapplying funds and resources of the union but also using the privileges of office to attract and obtain services and benefits from third parties. Aside from issues of profiteering, secret commissions and tax avoidance, these undeclared benefits can compromise officials. Rather than diligently representing the interests of their members without fear or favour they effectively ‘run dead' as a result of these side deals. This no less than graft and corruption in its most reprehensible form, and it occurs at the expense of vulnerable members whose interests they have been charged with representing. That was in the early part of the contribution from the member for Barton, who made, I thought, an extremely good contribution to this debate last Thursday. They are words that I very much agree with. Unions play a fundamental role in Australian workplaces and people have the right, and should always have the right in our free and open democracy, to join a trade union. And to ensure that the trade union is managed properly and within the law, you need to ensure that the laws that govern them give people faith that they can trust that the money they are contributing will be used to represent their best interests. The same applies to the employer who decides to join a group of like-minded employers to have their interests represented in industrial relations in this country. It is an important element of running a business, dealing with your staff. It is a complicated area of law which very rarely goes through a period of five years without having substantial change in one form or another. So these are important institutions in our country. Trade unions are a very important institution in our society. What we have seen in the last 2½ to three years-and have probably seen only very few times in the past-is a fundamental undermining of the role of unions and the faith that people have in their operation. I their think that the member for Barton is right to say in his contribution that the vast majority of trade union officials are professional and that the vast majority of unions are managed professionally by highly competent and dedicated people, and many of them in this parliament, who were formerly trade union is officials, fit into that category. They care deeply about their perspective, they care deeply about the working people who join trade unions, and they have sought in their career to represent them to the level that they have risen in being elected to the federal parliament, and I think that genuinely of many of those on the other side. But what, I think, should pain us all is that laws-laws which I have some familiarity with-have for some time been so badly abused and so badly misused. It must cause many of those on the other side a great deal of pain to see the institutions which are so valued and so important in our society undermined by those who are-in the member for Barton's words-'profiteering', seeking 'secret commissions' and practising 'tax avoidance' which is 'no less than graft and corruption in its most reprehensible form'. The allegations and the evidence which have been produced in relation to the Health Services Union are an example. No worse allegations could have been made. The fact that we are having to debate this bill in such haste, as the member for Melbourne commented, shows just how shameful this episode has been. It has dragged out for a period of four years because the agency which has been enlisted to investigate it has dragged its feet, for whatever reason. It has been shown not to have the capabilities or the capacity to investigate thoroughly enough or to bring justice to those members whose funds have been used in inappropriate ways. Putting aside the contemporary and real political debate in relation to a member of this parliament who had involvement in these issues, and putting aside whether he was at fault or not, there is no doubt that behaviour went on. There is no doubt that this behaviour was allowed to go on for a very long period of time, and there is no doubt that many within the union movement knew that it was going on. There is no doubt about that. A very recent piece from Aaron Patrick in the Australian Financial Review steps clearly through what people knew and when they knew, and the extent of the involvement of people in the party of those who sit opposite must bring great pain to many. So this bill is an attempt by the government to address issues which have become clear in the HSU matter and other matters that the member for Barton refers to further in his speech, and he makes the point that the Prime Minister has some familiarity with some of those similar issues. To those involved in industrial relations, practitioners across the country, I think people are genuinely shocked at the level, as the member for Barton said, of graft and corruption which has gone on, and are surprised that these measures have had to be enacted in the first place. We say, and rightly, that this bill does not go far enough. In fact the Leader of the Opposition announced, just 10 days before this bill was announced, stronger measures, and they are measures that we move as amendments to this bill. What we need now-and what we quite obviously needed in the past but what was not fully understood-are the strongest possible measures, measures which are consistent with responsibilities that corporations are required to meet. We need these measures because the faith of people who are paying their union dues week in and week out has been fundamentally undermined by the evidence as to and the examples through the Health Services Union. For those who do not this understand or know, the Health Services Union workers are the people who push trolleys around hospitals: the hospital orderlies. These are not well-paid people. These are people who usually come from a migrant background, a non-English-speaking background. They are usually low skilled; although, some current members of the HSU are undoubtedly skilled employees. Many are unskilled and many are exactly the sort of workers who should be members of a trade union because they do need assistance in negotiations. It has been a fundamental principle I have always supported that if someone wants to be represented they should have that opportunity. So it must pain all of us to see what has happened to these people who have committed their small amount of funds, albeit from their pay packets, every week, funds that could be used for all sorts of other purposes to make their life easier. In doing so they have knowingly made their own choice to commit to an organisation because they think that it is helping them to better their circumstances and that it is an institution that will negotiate with employers on their behalf to ensure a far better outcome in their workplace. But what they now know is that the money they contributed, for however long they have been contributing to that institution, has not always gone to these good causes, including the good cause of fighting for their rights and responsibilities. We hear much from those opposite about the rights of working people and about ensuring that working people have fair pay and conditions and fair workplaces. We currently hear in question time the minister for workplace relations trying to create each day a political issue out of state legislation because he claims working people are going to be worse off, yet we have not heard the same minister and other members who also argue strongly on these matters-like the member for Wakefield and the member for Kingston, in my own state of South Australia-express the great outrage that they should be expressing when it comes to these matters. This bill is before the House not because the Labor Party want to reform the way that registered organisations operate but because they want to cover their great shame at the way that these workers have had their money ripped off from them in unimaginable ways. They have been ripped off to an enormous extent. There are suggestions that the amount of money ripped off from these union members could be somewhere around $20 million. The sums are quite extraordinary. I have always been uncomfortable with the fact that trade union members contribute money to a political party whether they wish to or not and I think that is an area of reform that this country needs to consider. I know the new Premier of Queensland is considering such things, and I congratulate him for it. Early on in his premiership he is proving to be someone who will get things done, someone who is setting a course for the right things to be done. And this is a right thing to do. To give people choice about where their money is going is the right thing to do, particularly in the circumstances which we have seen in this HSU debacle, this shameful episode in Australian industrial relations history which is not yet fully investigated or prosecuted. So this bill is a shameful attempt by the minister for workplace relations to cover what is an ongoing sore for the union movement and the Labor Party which undermines the faith Australians have in these important institutions. The Australian Labor Party is an important institution as well but currently the leadership is trying to undermine as much as it possibly can people's faith in it. As Senator Abetz has said time and time again, in relation to this bill-and the member for Forde repeated this before-it is true that this bill is designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses and it sees former union bosses as the cops on the beat. It is completely conflicted. It is weak at its very foundations. It will not do the job it needs to do to ensure recovery of the faith that has been lost in this whole process, this whole shambolic HSU episode with its factionalism and nastiness and with its 'graft and corruption', to quote the member for Barton's terrific contribution last Thursdayreflecting the freedom of the back bench that he now has to outline some of these concerns. He did so in a quite fulsome way, as the House should be reminded. Obviously, he knows and he has seen all this as he makes the point in his contribution that in his time in legal practice these issues have been played out. That is the most concerning thing of all, that what has gone on at the HSU could be rife in the union movement. Certainly the member for Barton was indicating last week that there are concerns about other episodes and other examples and that these are matters which should be looked at, and I am sure that in the future there will be more consideration given to ensuring that the money of trade unionists, the people who decide willingly to contribute their own funds for their own betterment in the workplace, is being used in an appropriate fashion. Sadly, this bill will not ensure that that is the case. The proposed amendments that have been put up by the coalition will ensure that that is the case. Certainly, they will ensure that there will be a greater level of transparency to ensure that people are being represented and are getting what they think they should be getting from the product that they are purchasing, which is membership of an organisation which seeks to assist with their working life, not for their money to be spent on the most objectionable indulgences by its officials. This has been a shameful episode in Australian industrial relations history and this bill should be tougher so it does not happen again.",79
74,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! It being approximately 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA London Olympic Games",83
75,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I am delighted to pay tribute to three inspiring young athletes from my electorate of Higgins. Three young women-Shelley Chaplin and Cobi Crispin, both of Ashburton, and South Yarra's Katy Parrishhave been chosen to compete in the London 2012 Paralympics. Now 21 years old, Katy Parrish competed in the Beijing Games when she was just 17, an experience she has described as her greatest moment. Katy was born with cerebral palsy but she has never let it hold her back. I wish her all the best in her 100metre, 200-metre, 4x100 metre relay and long jump events. Close friends Shelley and Cobi have been nominated to represent Australia in wheelchair basketball, with the team to be officially confirmed in early July. Twenty-eight-year-old Shelley is a seasoned Paralympian who has competed in both Athens and Beijing, while 24-year-old Cobi also competed in Beijing. Both girls nominate winning the bronze medal at those games as their career highlights. We all know that to compete at an Olympic level takes a huge amount of determination that most of us simply cannot fathom, but Paralympians take it to a whole new level. Determination, commitment, strength and courage are words that come to mind when you think of the challenges these athletes have overcome to excel in their that chosen fields. On my website contact page I invite Higgins residents to send messages of support that I will pass on to Shelley, Cobi and Katy for the Paralympics between 29 August and 9 September this year. I want them to know that we are behind them, wish them all the best and know that they will do Australia proud. Sydney Dance Company",83
76,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to congratulate everyone involved in the Sydney Dance Company's excellent production of The Land of Yes and the Land of No. On 15 June I had the pleasure of attending a performance of this production at the Princess Theatre in Launceston in my electorate of Bass. To be able to experience a world-class performance from all involved, from the choreography to the sound, the lighting, the direction and the brilliant dancers, was a real treat. I particularly acknowledge Tasmanian dancer Jesse Scales. I am sure that it was an enjoyable experience for Jesse to return to her home state and showcase the skills she has acquired from years of training and performing on the mainland and in New Zealand. It was certainly a pleasure to watch her in action. Credit must go to world renowned designers Rafael Bonachela, Alan MACDonald, Ezio Bosso, Guy Hoare and Theo Clinkard. I also acknowledge Tasmanian Graeme Murphy, who led the company as Artistic Director from 1976 to 2007. Once again, I congratulate everyone involved in the Sydney Dance Company. I am thrilled that funding from the Australian government through the Australia Council is allowing them to share their talents across the nation. Aged Care",83
77,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I highlight the fantastic work being done by Co.As.It in Queensland. For 25 years Co.As.It has been providing community care services for the Italian aged care community in Queensland. Director Dina Ranieri and her wonderful staff provide in-home care and also a very dedicated service in their respite centres. Since 2005, the Queensland Co.As.lt team has been successfully providing training for staff in Italian nursing homes, community health centres and all of the local hospitals Brisbane and two on the Gold Coast. It has implemented over 600 activity groups for the elderly in local nursing homes. All this was supported by the government under the Community Partners Program within the Department of Health and Ageing-until now. It is disappointing to the dedicated people of Co.As.lt in Queensland that their application under the new grant was not approved, and they cannot even find out why. They were told that funding under the Community Partners Program would not be available, yet I am advised that other organisations in other states have been funded under the same Community Partners Program. The community has every right to know what is going on. How hypocritical of this government that on one hand they are not funding community organisations that do a great job while on the other hand they have a multicultural inquiry looking at submissions and saying that there should be more aged care places made available to aged migrants with non-English-speaking backgrounds. Fowler Electorate: Sustainable Streets Program",84
78,Mr HAYES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Earlier this month, together with the Fairfield City Mayor, Frank Carbone, I attended the opening of stage 1 of Bibby's Place Sustainable Streets project. The first stage of the project involved developing the Bibby's Place cul-de-sac into a highly environmentally sustainable street with solar lighting, recycled seats, porous paving and new landscaping. The local residents and community will be able to use the street as a meeting place and also as location for a number of entertainment and recreational activities. The project is a successful example of all levels of government-state, in federal and local-working together to identify and fund projects that will lead to benefits for the entire community. Bonnyrigg is one of the fastest-growing centres in south-west Sydney. There are 11 places of worship, including temples, mosques and churches, and seven cultural clubs lie within a kilometre's radius. The Bibby's Place cul-de-sac is unique but so typical of our diversity. It is a home to a number of religious sites, including a Chinese Presbyterian Church, a Vietnamese Phap Bao Temple, a Turkish mosque and a Vietnamese cultural centre. Many of their representatives attended the opening, including Joseph Park, from the Bonnyrigg Christian Church; Toan Nguyen from the VCA; the leader of the Bonnyrigg Mosque, Imam Nurullah Karakas; and the most venerable Thich Bao Lac from the Phap Bao Temple. Bibby's Place is a showcase of cultural harmony and environmental sustainability and will be most beneficial- (Time expired) Mental Health",84
79,Mr TUDGE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I inform the House that a headspace centre will soon be established in the Knox area in my electorate, which is a terrific outcome. It is a combination of a more than 12-month-long campaign which I have spearheaded along with many other people in the local community. We have organised a 10,000strong petition, we raised over $10,000 from local organisations to contribute to the establishment of the centre and we have done numerous speeches and media releases in this parliament along the way. I am absolutely delighted that this centre is coming to our area. It will be located in the old Centrelink building in the Knox Ozone precinct which, as members may not appreciate, is the hub of the Knox community and is where young people generally will go and hang out. The centre will involve counselling services, GP services, psychiatric care and some drug and alcohol care, as well as employment services-a full suite of services targeted at 12to 25-year-olds. Our hope is that young people who are battling depression and severe anxiety may see this as an opportunity and as a place where they can walk into and get the care and assistance they need so that they can live full and fulfilling lives like everybody else. Macarthur Electorate: Australian Defence Force",84
80,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today, I would like to share with everyone an email I received from an Australian soldier serving our country in Afghanistan: G'Day Russell, I am a deployed member serving in Afghanistan that just received one of the best parcels a soldier could from Australia. A gift packed by children I do not know, arranged by a teacher I have not met and sent with the best wishes and thoughts of a nation worth fighting for. Could you please let Ms Jenny Budd and the children of Kindy and Year 1 at Thirlmere Public School know that their care package has arrived and I have just responded, so a letter should be there in a couple of weeks. The reason I am letting you know is because Jenny sent a cut out from the local paper where you sponsored a website promoting such actions. Party politics aside... a great act by an elected representative. Thankyou to you and particularly the teachers and students at Thirlmere Public School who have demonstrated in one small box what being Australian is all about... supporting your mates. This is a lovely email from one of our soldiers who was touched by the kindness of some local children and their teacher. They did this as part of the Support the Troops Campaign, which was supported by many members of this House in the lead-up to ANZAC Day. After receiving this email I visited the children at Thirlmere Public School with the state member for Wollondilly, Jai Rowell. The children were so excited to hear from the soldier and were keen to tell me about all the things they put in the care package for him. The response I received from this soldier shows how much it means to our troops to have the support of the Australian public behind them. Being away from family and friends to serve your country overseas is not an easy thing to do. I am glad that the children from Thirlmere were able to lift the spirits of this soldier and show him that he has the support of our nation behind him. I congratulate them on their efforts. Shortland Electorate: Diabetes Week",85
81,Ms HALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to share with the House the fact that I am holding a diabetes forum in Swansea on 12 July. I will be inviting all residents from the SwanseaCaves Beach-Marks Point area to come along and learn the facts about diabetes. The 12th of July falls within Diabetes Week, a week when it is very important to raise community awareness about diabetes, to allow people to put in place strategies and to improve their lifestyle, which will in turn improve their chances of remaining healthy and not developing diabetes. To a large extent diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a lifestyle disease. At this forum people will learn strategies about healthy eating and exercise that they can put in place to minimise their chance of developing type 2 diabetes. On the day, we will have nurses from Diabetes Australia in attendance and we will also have somebody coming along to demonstrate the type of exercise that the residents of that area can undertake to not only improve their physical fitness but minimise their chance of contracting diabetes. (Time expired) Bennelong Electorate: Rotary Clubs",85
82,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week I attended Epping Rotary's 50th anniversary dinner at the Epping Club with over 300 people supporting this black-tie event to congratulate Epping Rotary on 50 years of charitable work in the Bennelong and wider communities. The beneficiary of this fundraiser was The Shack, a great local group who help young people in the region to regain control over their lives through mentoring, crisis intervention, counselling services and guidance to apply for jobs. Thank you to all of the members of the Epping Rotary Anniversary Organising Committee for hosting a wonderful occasion, deserving of the esteemed Rotary brand. Rotary is famous for implementing programs through the four-way test: is it the truth; is it fair to all concerned; will it build goodwill and better friendships; will it be beneficial to all concerned? I am sure many of us would appreciate it if our government aspired to these same standards. Blair Electorate: Lions Clubs",86
83,Mr NEUMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I had the privilege yesterday with my wife, Carolyn, to attend the Lions Club of Fernvale changeovers. The Lions Club of Fernvale did a fantastic job in the Brisbane Valley when it was ravaged by flood, handing out about 2,000 meals across the Lowood and Fernvale area. This Friday night I will be attending the Lowood Lions changeover as well. I want to congratulate Lion Peter Bennett, who is the president; the secretary, Peter Barnes; the treasurer, Joy Barnes, the vice-president, Geoff Beattie; the membership chair, June Freese; the first-year director, Jack Thorne; the second-year director, Trish Annand; the lion tamer and tail twister, Adam Pinner: and the immediate past president, Glendell Appleford. They gave out cheques to a lot of different community groups in the Brisbane Valley yesterday. These groups are worthwhile. They also assisted in the Men's Shed at Lowood. They have assisted in many things, including the Rail Trail Fun Run, the seniors social morning barbecue at Fernvale and the Father's Day cricket match. There was a $2,000 donation from Toby and the Lowood IGA for equipment purchases. They have also assisted in the Fernvale Environment and Heritage Festival. They have done a lot of great good in the whole region. They are to be honoured and thanked. They deserve our praise, they have earned our trust and they are worthy of our respect for the work they do, helping people in the Brisbane Valley. National Pain Week National Carers Week Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (13:57): I rise today to draw attention to National Pain Week, which will occur during the parliamentary winter break from 22 to 28 July, and National Carers Week, which occurred last week. These two important weeks are obviously connected, given that Australian carers often makes sacrifices to care and support those who are experiencing pain. Earlier this month, I met with a resident from the electorate of Macquarie, Andrea Downing, who suffers from chronic pain on a daily basis. As a result of this chronic pain, Ms Downing faces daily challenges. Many like Ms Downing have reduced opportunities for work, having to opt for cheaper accommodation in locations such as the Blue Mountains, where access to health services and suitable transport is limited. Following my meeting with Ms Downing I have reviewed what I consider to be startling statistics with regard to pain that will be broadly advertised during National Pain Week. One in five Australians suffer from chronic pain. Eighty per cent of those-that is, 16 per cent of the national population-do not have adequate access to treatment for their pain. Chronic pain is a very real and debilitating illness resulting in loss and a lot of misunderstanding. It is a real condition that can manifest itself under a variety of banners and requires thorough recognition as a disability. It is absolutely critical that people with a disability and their families and carers are provided with the regular care, support and therapy equipment that they need. Effectively, this government will spend more each financial year on its interest repayments than it will spend in total over the next four years on the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. You can forgive Australian people such as Ms Downing for feeling short-changed because of the government's approach to chronic pain. Canberra Legends Program",86
84,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Recently, I put out a call for local sporting legends in the Canberra electorate, extending my Canberra Legends Program, with the hope of discovering some hidden sporting talent. With the London Olympics upon us, I thought it would be nice to mention my first Canberra sports legend here today: 10-yearold Alex Halank is a young windsurfer born and raised in Canberra. Alex is currently in year 5 and, although Canberra is not the best or most likely location for developing windsurfing skills, he has persevered and practised.",87

86,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY THE SPEAKER," I appreciate that everybody in the parliament is very concerned about issues being raised in respect of services provided to children who visit Parliament House under the school visitation program. I, like everybody else in the building, am very encouraging of our schools visiting the parliament. As chair of the Parliamentary Education Office Advisory Committee I, like many others on that committee, would in no way want to see this program altered or changed. My attention has been drawn to media reports about the provision of hospitality for school groups visiting Parliament House. I have been advised that the Department of the House of Representatives briefed the House of Representatives Appropriations and Administrative Committee on the budget outlook for the department last week. I understand that the provision of hospitality for visiting school groups was listed as a savings proposal, but the department decided on Friday it would not proceed with that proposal. Let me repeat that for everybody. was decided on Friday not to proceed with that proposal. So the service will continue. NA Asylum Seekers",87
87,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS," On behalf of the House I want to acknowledge the dreadful tragedy that happened on Thursday last week, when an asylum seeker boat capsized with considerable loss of life. The precise details of this matter still remain unknown but what we do know is that there were likely to be over 200 people on board this boat, including one 13-year-old boy. The boat capsized with considerable loss of life. While survivors were rescued, at this stage we are unable to determine, tragically, how many people have lost their lives in the sea. One hundred and ten survivors have been transferred to authorities on Christmas Island and a number have been transferred to the mainland for treatment. This is a dreadful human tragedy. I know that members across the parliament would be feeling the weight of that, and we can see many in our community who are grieving from this dreadful news. We should acknowledge the efforts of those who went to the rescue in not easy circumstances. They include our Australian Navy; our Air Force, which had planes assisting; Customs and Border Protection personnel; personnel from other agencies; and merchant vessels, who responded to the need for assistance and diverted from their commercial activities in order to be available to help. We should thank them for their efforts. Without them many more people would have died. Today we respectfully and very sincerely acknowledge the lives lost last week.",88
88,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS," I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister, prompted by It this latest disaster in the seas to our north. We mourn for the dead; we grieve for the living, who have suffered much; and we offer our support to all the naval and other personnel who have done what they could in the search and rescue effort. If there is anyone to blame in a tragic situation like this, surely it is the people smugglers who prey on desperate people's desire for a better life in Australia. Obviously at a time like this all of us consult our consciences on what is the best course of action to take. I am sure all of us in this House have resolved to put policies in place that will end forever this evil trade. NA",88
89,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I would like to welcome into the gallery today a delegation from the Regional Representative Council of the Republic of Indonesia. I welcome them to the parliament today, and I hope they enjoy their visit. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Alcoa",88
90,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the government's intention to give the Alcoa aluminium smelter at Point Henry $42 million in hush money to help pay its carbon tax bill. Given that the Australian Aluminium Council has warned that the carbon tax will contribute to ensuring Australian aluminium operations have no long-term future, will the Prime Minister now announce similar bailouts for all the other 16,000 workers in the industry at sites like Gladstone, Portland, Kwinana, Kurri Kurri and Bell Bay?",88
91,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the suggestion in that question of hush money is a very serious allegation to make not just against the government but against the company Alcoa. I request that the Leader of the Opposition, possible, rephrase the question in a more sensible way.",88
92,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I was going to point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the use of the term hush money is an imputation. I rule that part of the question out of order. I call the Prime Minister.,89
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I have been concerned, as have the members for Corangamite and Corio, about the circumstances at Alcoa. We have also been advised by the company of those circumstances, which the Leader of the Opposition has come into the Parliament and misrepresented today. The circumstances of Alcoa which have been made available to the government include pressure on Alcoa because of international prices and because of the age of some of its capital stock. We have worked with Alcoa because we believe these jobs are precious. We believe the jobs of Australian workers are precious, and that is why when jobs are being threatened in our economy-for example, by the global financial crisis-we have always worked to protect jobs. We have taken that same ethos about understanding how important jobs are to working people to circumstances at Alcoa and we are working with the company because we want to see a continuation of the company and a continuation of those jobs. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is not at all concerned about those jobs; the only thing that will ever worry him is what is the best way of distorting this issue, to make it about his fear campaign. This is not about the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign; this is about a different set of circumstances. He owes it to the workers there to be honest about it. He owes it to that if region of Victoria to be honest about it. He owes it to the people of Australia to be honest about it. For us on this side of the parliament, jobs will always be something we work to protect. On that side of the parliament, any threat to jobs is just an excuse to try and politically profit as part of their destructive and aggressive negativity. We will work to help working people; they will keep being negative about working people and their lifetime prospects, as we have seen the Leader of the Opposition be already today.",89
94,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government's own modelling shows a 61 per cent drop in aluminium production as a result of the carbon tax, wouldn't the best help she could give the workers at Point Henry be to simply drop this toxic tax?",89
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Leader of the Opposition, before he comes in here and misrepresents circumstances, should acquaint himself with the facts. He should actually pay the respect to working people necessary to acquaint himself with the facts. I refer him to the statement of the Managing Director of Alcoa, Mr Alan Cransberg, who has, as Alcoa has previously stated, that 'the review of the Point Henry smelter and the current situation have not been brought about by the upcoming price on carbon but are as a result of the international price of aluminium and the high Australian dollar'. The Leader of the Opposition, once again, in here trying to sell his misrepresentations to these working people and to Australians generally-completely disgusting to try and create that fear, completely disgusting to try and profit off that fear but in keeping with the kind of negativity we always expect from the Leader of the Opposition. He has never cared about saving a job, he has never acted to save a job and today he is not telling the truth about these jobs.",89
96,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I seek leave to table the government's own modelling, which shows a 61 per cent reduction in aluminium production under the carbon tax.",90
97,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Leave is not granted. Asylum Seekers,90
98,Mr LYONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. Will the minister update the House on the search-and-rescue efforts for survivors of the boat that capsized last week?",90
99,Mr CLARE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (14:11): Can I thank the member for his question. As question time was coming to an end last Thursday a Border Protection Command Dash 8 aircraft spotted a capsized boat with approximately 40 people crowded on its hull, 110 nautical miles north of Christmas Island. This triggered a massive search-and-rescue effort involving Navy patrol boats, surveillance aircraft and merchant ships. By late that night 110 people had been plucked from the sea. The search-and-rescue effort continued into the night, into the next day and the day after that. Unfortunately, no more people were found alive. The search for survivors was suspended at 8.44 pm Saturday night Australian Eastern Standard Time. There were, reportedly, 200 people on board this vessel. We may never know for certain but it is likely that approximately 90 people may have lost their lives. The bodies of 17 people have been recovered. Initial reports were that all of the survivors were adults except a 13-year-old boy. The latest information that I have is that the survivors included nine unaccompanied male juveniles. All surviving passengers were transferred to Christmas Island. Four survivors have since been transferred to Perth for medical treatment. I have said that this tragedy needs to be fully investigated to ensure that everything that should have been done was done. An independent inquiry will be conducted by the Western Australian coroner. WA Police and the Australian Federal Police are investigating the incident and are also working to identify victims. Initial interviews with survivors have begun and they will continue over the coming days. A whole-of-government review will also be conducted. This will involve Customs and Border Protection, Defence and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, over the last few days we have again witnessed Australian men and women putting their own lives at risk, reaching out a long way from our own shore to save the lives of people they have never met and do not know. They have worked around the clock in what has been a massive search-and-rescue effort. Can I say again on behalf of everyone here, a big thank you to the men and women of the Royal Australian Navy, Border Protection Command, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the merchant ships who came to the rescue. Over the last few days they have seen some truly horrifying things and they have responded with remarkable work. I need to advise the House that a critical incident mental health support team has now been deployed to Christmas Island to assist these brave men and women. This is yet another terrible tragedy. It is incumbent now, on all of us, to learn from this; to work together and to act to ensure this never happens again. Carbon Pricing",90
100,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government's decision to give the Alcoa aluminium smelter at Port Henry $42 million to help pay its carbon tax bill. Why are the 600 workers at Port Henry entitled to a $42 million payment for the carbon tax but not the 500 workers at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley? Are the workers in that area not a priority because their electorate is not sufficiently marginal?,91
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Leader of the National Party has asked a question based on an entirely false premise. The assertion he is putting to this parliament is wrong. Let me repeat the words of the managing director of Alcoa. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wants to make these sorts of distorting claims then I hope he has the integrity to ring up the managing director of Alcoa and say that he is accusing the managing director of Alcoa of speaking untruths. The managing director of Alcoa has said, as I quoted in answer to my last question, that the current situation has not been brought about by the upcoming carbon price but as a result of the international price on aluminium and the high Australian dollar. The fact that the opposition has now degenerated into chatting among themselves and smiling shows just how little regard they have for the jobs of these workers. For them this is all just one big political joke. not care at all. It is written all over their faces, all over their smiles and their chatter to each other. They do not care about these jobs. These jobs, for them, are just a convenient political plaything as they come in here with their negativity and cheap politics. The Leader of the National Party has asked an incorrect question; it is factually wrong. In insulting these workers and the company they work for it is, in my view, morally wrong as well.",91
102,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that the government's own carbon tax modelling forecasts a 61 per cent reduction in aluminium production as a result of her tax?,91
103,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is that he is wrong, as usual. G20 Summit",91
104,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the outcomes of the G20 leaders' summit?,91
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that she is interested in what happened at the G20 because she is interested in jobs and prosperity for Australian workers, including those in her own local community. Our economy is strong and one of the things very much reinforced for me, in travelling to the G20, was just how strong our economy is in an uncertain world. We can be very proud of the economy that the Australian people have built together. We can be very proud that we worked together as a government and a nation to come through the global financial crisis and ensure that our economy still has They do the benefit of growth and jobs. When I was at the G20 there were two critical concerns at the table: first, the circumstances in Europe and particularly the eurozone and, second, and more generally, the uncertainty in the global economy. Though our economy is strong we are of course not immune to events in the global economy. A stronger and more resilient global economy is in Australia's national interest. On the question of Europe, which caused so much concern at the G20, firstly, it was agreed that there needed to be a firm and resolute commitment to growth. There has been a debate about austerity and growth as if they were polar opposites. At the G20, both in the discussion there and during the lead-up, it became clear through discussion that we need a strategy for growth and fiscal discipline in Europe. That is what we have done here in Australia and there was a firm and resolute commitment to a strategy for growth and fiscal discipline in Europe as well. Secondly, there were commitments on greater banking integration and greater integration to address the issues that Europe, and particularly the eurozone, faces now. Before the end of this month we will see another very important meeting of European leaders to address these issues of growth, fiscal discipline and further banking and fiscal integration. In addition there were discussions at the G20 about the global economy and ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to safeguard it. The single biggest outcome was significantly increased resources for the IMF-all up, $456 billion. In our nation we can be proud of the economy that we have built together; but these discussion at the G20 matter for the global economy and consequently they matter to us. I am pleased that progress was made at the recent G20 meeting. Carbon Pricing",91
106,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is for the Prime Minister. I refer her to page 107 of government's carbon price modelling which shows a 61.7 per cent decrease in aluminium production as a consequence of the carbon tax. I ask the Prime Minister: does she stand by her previous answer to my previous question?,92
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It is not as a consequence of the carbon tax. Once again the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to mislead the Australian people about carbon pricing, just as he has every day, because he thinks this negativity is in his political interests. He gives not a thought to our nation or to our clean energy future; every day the only thing he is concerned about is how negative he can be today in the hope of politically profiting, and that is what motivates him to ask questions such as this one to try to mislead the Australian people.",92
108,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I fiscal have been accused of misleading the parliament. I seek leave to table page 107 of the government's carbon tax modelling. Leave not granted.",92
109,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I seek leave to table this,92
110,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,92
111,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: given that page 107 of the carbon tax modelling shows a 61.7 per cent reduction in aluminium production, I ask the Prime Minister to",92
112,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. It is not a point of order.  point of order: you have been very forthright about people who claim that they are misleading the parliament when others are misleading the parliament. The Prime the Minister has just baldly claimed that the Leader of the Opposition has misled the parliament when in fact she is doing the misleading of the parliament, and it should not be allowed.",92
113,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are other processes and forms of the House if the Leader of the Opposition claims he has been misrepresented. They cannot be used now, at question time, but he is fully aware of how he can use them after question time if that is what he wishes.  on a point of order. With the greatest of respect, I would have thought-and I hope you will take this advice from the opposition-that, if the parliament is to work, the Prime Minister cannot make misleading statements to the parliament and accuse others of making misleading statements.",93
114,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is nothing within the standing orders that would allow me to ask the Prime Minister to withdraw. There are other forms of the House that the Leader of the Opposition is well aware of and that he can use at a later hour today. Fisheries,93
115,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what on earth were regulators thinking when they gave approval for the world's second-biggest trawler, the 142 metre Margiris, to operate around Tasmania? Will you review that decision with a view to revoking it or at least put in place safeguards to protect Australia's best fisheries by ensuring that the super trawler's massive quota is broken down into smaller limits for specific areas?",93
116,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that he is seriously concerned about this matter. I can assure the member for Denison that, contrary to a report in the Daily Telegraph on 7 June, no application has been granted for the vessel he refers to. I believe that the member for Denison's concerns were probably triggered by that report or by follow-up media occasioned by that report. There has been no application to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority by the vessel which the member for Denison refers to and which is a large, mid-water-trawl factory vesseland the member for Denison is concerned about its size. No application has been made in respect of that vessel to the relevant independent authority, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. I can also assure the member for Denison and the House in general that, if such an application were to be made, it would be subject to all of the normal considerations that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority goes through. These include catch limits-and the member for Denison's question refers, effectively, to catch limits. They can include requirements to have observers on the vessel who monitor fishing activities. They can also include issues about the kind of equipment used, including technology which, for example, can detect the presence of seals. So, should an application be made, each of these issues would be the subject of consideration. Other requirements can also be engaged in and considered by the relevant authority, including logbook reporting, satellite vesselmonitoring systems, mandatory reporting of any interactions with protected species and the like. I can assure the member for Denison that what determines the size of any taking of fish is not the size of the vessel-and he has referred to a large vessel-but the constraints that are put on it by the relevant independent authority, who would work through the issues should an application be made. Rio+20: United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development",93
117,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. How have the outcomes of the Rio+20 Summit advanced the world's commitment to economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development?",94
118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. The member for Parramatta refers to the outcomes of the recent Rio+20 conference which I attended in Brazil. This conference brought the world together to consider sustainable development and our environment 20 years on from the Rio Earth Summit, a very remarked-upon event in the history of the world's consideration of sustainability and environmental concerns. In the 20 years that have passed since the first Earth Summit we have become increasingly aware of environmental problems, including loss of biodiversity, of habitat, challenges for the world's oceans and the challenge of climate change. At the Rio+20 meeting, some progress was made. I would point particularly to two areas where Australia argued for progress, and progress was made. Firstly, there was agreement to set sustainable development goals. This is a comparable process to the setting of the Millennium Development Goals, which did have quite a slow generation but, once agreed, served to catalyse global efforts to address questions of global poverty. There has now been agreement to having sustainable development goals which will, we would hope and trust, play a comparable role in catalysing world activity to better address questions of sustainability and our environment. Secondly, there was progress made on the question of the world's oceans. The environmental challenge facing our oceans has become increasingly clear since the days of the original Earth Summit. There was consideration of work for our oceans and some modest measures were agreed. Australia, particularly being an island continent with such a long coastline, can see very clearly the effects of things like ghost nets and abandoned marine equipment that is drifting and killing fish and protected species, and that there does need to be progress on these areas. Australia would have liked to have seen more progress made at Rio+20 than was made but global collective action is not easy to harness and organise. Some progress was made, which is important not only to our nation but to the world in general. We will continue to look to build on the Rio+20 outcomes. We have a beautiful environment we want to protect and we understand the global challenges our world faces as well. Carbon Pricing Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy loss Leader of the Opposition) (14:30): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to this official 53-page outcome statement from the Rio+20 United Nations conference she attended last week. Given that the government's carbon tax is predicated on global action on climate change, on what page does the outcome statement mention any other country moving towards a carbon tax, an emissions trading scheme or putting a price on carbon?",94
119,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has mistaken the purpose of the Rio+20 conference. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is probably thinking about the climate change negotiations that last happened in Durban and will happen towards the end of this year in Doha, so she has her international processes confused. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",94
120,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked her question.,95
121,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of Australia's carbon pricing system, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition apparently does not know or has forgotten for the moment that, in putting a price on carbon, Australia will be joining 850 million people around the world who live in nations where there is a price on carbon. We know that many nations around the world are taking steps to put a price on carbon, because they too will see their economies and their nations join the 850 million people currently covered by carbon pricing. For example, in the days I was in Mexico and then in Rio, I had the opportunity to meet with President Lee of the Republic of Korea. Korea is moving to an emissions trading scheme, to give just one example in our region, and is a very important trading partner of Australia's and a very important strategic partner in our region. And so, around the world, whether it be in Europe or whether it be in our region the world, we are seeing people price carbon because of the global challenge of climate change. And we are seeing people price carbonMs Julie Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was: even in the climate change paragraphs, on what page is the carbon tax",95
122,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,95
123,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was explaining that around the world people are putting a price on carbon or have put a price on carbon because it is the most efficient and least costly way of reducing carbon pollution and tackling the challenge of climate change. There was a time when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a crystal-clear advocate for putting a price on carbon. Clearly, she has changed her mind-I am getting some advice as to whether or not the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has truly changed her mind. Putting that to one side, whatever view the Deputy Leader of the Opposition currently holds she ought not to misrepresent to this parliament or more broadly how many people around the world live in countries with carbon pricing schemes. Ms Julie Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given that this 53-page document",95
124,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will come to her point of order. Ms Julie Bishop: I am-does have a chapter on climate change, I ask that I have leave to table this document so that the Prime Minister can check that it is not meant",95

129,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Relentless interjections will not be tolerated. Economy Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:35): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House what the pipeline for investment projects says about the strength of our nation and of our economy?,95
130,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am asked by the member for Petrie about the strength of our economy. What I can say is our economy walks tall in the world. We can all take pride from our economic strength and pride in what a dynamic, diverse and ambitious country we have become. We are dynamic because we, particularly on this side of the House, have put in place the long-term reforms to ensure our future prosperity and also our quality of life. We have been willing to take the long-term reforms that will make this nation a better place and that is why we on this side of the House are described as progressives-we are determined to get ahead of the game, to put in place long-term reforms. That is why those on the other side of the House are reactionaries-they are not determined to do anything to set the country up for the future. We know that if we want a society and an economy that is prosperous and has social justice we have got to fight hard for these reforms. That is why we are putting a price on carbon pollution. It is why we are reforming mining taxation, it is why we are reforming aged care and it is why we are reforming hospital funding. We on this side of the House understand the importance of making the big reforms for the future. On that side of the House, all we have is scaremongering. Our economy continues to be among the best in the world, no matter how much those on the other side of the House try to talk it down. We now have a $½ trillion investment pipeline in resources-up 136 per cent, or around $290 billion, since we came to office-and we continue to see announcements. Just last Friday, BHP announced US$845 million to be invested in the Illawarra. Of course, we had an investment from Rio Tinto, an additional $4.2 billion in the Pilbara. So, no matter about all of the scare campaigns, all of the talking down of our economy-none of it stacks up when you actually look at the facts. Of course, their scare campaign is torpedoed every day by the facts. Just like Whyalla, it will not be wiped from the face of the map on 1 July and, of course, the coal industry will continue to grow and prosper. Businesses will continue to invest in mining and, of course, so too will coalition members on the other side. So when the sun comes up on Sunday, jobs will continue to grow, the economy will be safe, the environment will be safe, the family budget will be safe, and nothing will save the credibility of the opposition leader. Taxation",95
131,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister and it refers to the Treasurer's immediate answer. Prime Minister, can you confirm this US research report that states that, because of the carbon tax and the mining tax, the net present value of shares is going to drop, thereby affecting the returns for millions of Australian shareholders and investors, particularly superannuants?",96
132,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Clearly what he is putting to the parliament is not well believed by the opposition backbench, given how keen they are to keep investing in resources companies. The opposition backbench apparently pays as much attention to the economic advice from the shadow Treasurer as the rest of Australia-which is absolutely none. The shadow Treasurer, in line with the usual negativity of the opposition, has come in here now trying to talk down the Australian economy and share prices, apparently because of the minerals resource rent tax and carbon pricing. Let's actually go through the facts. The opposition, on some days, comes into this parliament and says, 'You know, the problem with the minerals resource rent tax is it's going to be so big it will be the end of the minerals industry.' Then on other days it comes in here",96
133,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. Is the US market assessment of mining shares that says that share values are going to drop",97
134,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. If the member for North Sydney had completed its relevance it would have been better.,97
135,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on the point of order, under the standing orders relating to disruptive conduct, each and every question by those opposite is followed by a rehearsed point of order from those opposite. It is disruptive conduct and it should be actioned upon.",97
136,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. If you look up standing order 65, as I have asked many to do on numerous occasions, you might find there are some handy hints for question time for us all.",97
137,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked about prospects for the mining industry with the minerals resource rent tax and I am addressing that. On prospects for the mining industry with the minerals resource rent tax, I was pointing out the contradiction that some days the opposition say it is too big and it will break the industry; on other days they say that it will not generate enough money. The fact that they make both of those criticisms tells you something: that they are just casting around for any reason to try and attack the minerals resource rent tax. The reason for the minerals resource rent tax is that at this time of our nation's with a huge resources boom, with more than $500 billion of projects in the pipeline, it is the right time for there to be some sharing of the wealth with other Australians. We support that and we are determined that Australians see their fair share of the mining boom rather than have it channelled into the pockets of a few, which is the position of the opposition. On carbon pricing, which the shadow Treasurer raises as well, the shadow Treasurer well knows that with carbon pricing we will continue to see economic growth, we will continue to see growth in jobs and we will see our nation address carbon pollution at the lowest possible price. I know that the shadow Treasurer has had difficulties with these issues in the past-that he has been reduced to tweeting out, begging people to tell him what he should think about important public policy concerns. Well, to the shadow Treasurer who has that inability to analyse public policy issues, let me be crystal clear with him. We are determined to see carbon pollution cut, we are determined to see our nation seize a clean energy future, we are determined to see a growing economy with more jobs, and we are determined to help households with tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases as well. The shadow Treasurer is determined to mislead and be negative. (Time expired)",97

139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat.,97
140,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney was asked to his resume his seat. Many of you are ignoring that request. It does actually hold up the parliament. Is leave granted?,97
142,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To coin the Leader of the history, Opposition's favourite phrase: no. Leave not granted. Carbon Pricing Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (14:43): My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Minister, with the carbon price due to start six days time, what are the future investment prospects for the coal industry, particularly in the Illawarra region, and how does this demonstrate that resource companies' investment decisions are being guided by facts not fear?",97
143,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:44): I thank the member for Throsby for his question, because the coal industry is extremely important to regions that he represents in the Illawarra and also to the region that I represent in the Hunter. There has been a range of forecasts about the future of the coal industry in recent months, all of them overwhelmingly positive, but there is one that has been incredibly negative, and that is from the Leader of the Opposition. We know about his economic forecasting! He has predicted from 1 July, next Sunday, the death of the coal industry. The death of the coal industry-the end of it. In the Illawarra, coal mining has gone; in the Hunter, it has gone. That is what he has predicted. But the closer we get to the introduction of a carbon price from Sunday and the more facts that come out, the more utterly ridiculous, hypocritical misleading the Leader of the Opposition's comments have been. Just take the Illawarra: last Friday, BHP Billiton approved an $833 million investment in Illawarra coal. The carbon price starts in less than a week, the Leader the Opposition has forecast the death of the industry, and here is BHP Billiton announcing an $833 million investment commitment. In fact, it is the largest capital investment that BHP Billiton has ever made in its Illawarra coal subsidiary. The new mine will support the ongoing employment of 500 workers currently employed at the West Cliff mine and generate 300 new in construction jobs. With my background I have some familiarity with the industry. The coal seams in the Illawarra are relatively methane intensive and will attract a carbon price liability. Nonetheless, notwithstanding the forecasts of doom, $833 million has been committed in Illawarra coal, just days before the introduction of the carbon price. On the one hand, we have got the death of the industry being forecast by the Leader of the Opposition, who will be held to account for this by workers in the coal industrythey will hold him to account for what he has predicted and the insecurity that he has engendered-but on the other hand, we have got BHP Billiton and $833 million on the table. Just as the Leader of the Opposition was misrepresenting the position with Alcoa earlier in question time, so he has misrepresented systematically the circumstances in the coal industry. In fact, there has been an upward revision from $96 billion to $107 billion in the investment pipeline in coal and it has a strong future. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (14:47): I have a supplementary question, Minister, you have spoken about the impact of the carbon price on the $833 million investment by BHP in my region. Will you and inform the House of what assistance families in my electorate, and other electorates around mine, will have as part of the carbon price?",98
144,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:47): I thank the member for Throsby for the question because the fact of the matter is that the carbon price will have only a modest impact on the cost of living-that is, 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI-less than one cent in the dollar. The government is assisting pensioners, it is assisting families eligible for tax benefits, it is assisting many self-funded retirees and it is assisting many veterans and others in receipt of Commonwealth payments. In the Illawarra region, more than 20,000 families have already received extra cash in their bank accounts over the past month. More than 53,000 Illawarra pensioners have received $250, if they are single, or $380 for couples combined-that is 53,000 pensioners who have received an advance payment already. And 4,300 students have received up to $190. That is very important in the Illawarra with the University of Wollongong and the many students there. But over on that side, the Leader of the Opposition has opposed all of those things. He has opposed it all and he continues to go out into the community and claim that these are not permanent increases and that they are not indexed. It is completely misleading. It is a complete untruth. It is totally wrong. Regular payments are going to be increased, they will be indexed in the future, and a lot of the assistance is being delivered by tax cuts. (Time expired)",98
145,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Further to that answer, I seek leave to table a report that identifies that the carbon and mining taxes reduce BHP's earnings by three to four per cent per annum and net present value by three per cent per annum",99
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Is leave granted to table the report?,99
147,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To again quote the Leader of the Opposition: no! Carbon Pricing Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (14:49): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that Teys Australia in my electorate, which employs 800 workers, plans to shut down its Beenleigh abattoir for several weeks to avoid going over the 25,000 tonne carbon tax threshold. How will these workers and their families be supported by the government while the factory shuts down to avoid her carbon tax?",99
148,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who raises the question: if the member wants to directly discuss the issue, then of course I am open to discussing with him issues in his electorate. I am making the assumption he is genuinely raising the issue in the parliament and wants to discuss it with the government. Can I say to the member and to the parliament more broadly: with carbon pricing, we have seen in this parliament many, many claims made which, on investigation, do not turn out to be true. Indeed, in the course of this question time, from the Leader of the Opposition and from the shadow Treasurer, we have seen a continuation of the kinds of misrepresentations which have characterised this debate. The opposition has been so negative that it has predicted a permanent depression. It has been so negative that it has predicted the death of the coal industry. It has been so negative that it has said that this will be a wrecking ball through the economy, that the increases in the priceMr Van Manen: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I have asked about the abattoir in Beenleigh, not about the coal industry. It is about the effect of the carbon tax.",99
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I ask the Prime Minister to return to the question before the chair.,99
150,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My simple point is that we have, particularly from the opposition's front-bench, time after time, misleading claims made about carbon pricing. For the member who raises this question I will make the assumption he is raising it genuinely and I am more than happy to speak to him directly about it. Carbon Pricing",99
151,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. Minister, will you update the House on how the government is helping families and pensioners with everyday expenses? Are there any challenges to delivering this support?",100
152,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:52): I thank the member for Reid very much for his question. I can inform the House that this government is continuing to act to help families and pensioners with their everyday expenses. As of today, more than 6½ million initial payments have been made before the price on pollution starts on 1 July, so 6½ million families and pensioners have already received their assistance. This is going to help with their expenses like their groceries or their electricity bills that are coming now and in coming months. I can also let the House know that from today more than 280,000 self-funded retirees who are on a Commonwealth seniors health card will be receiving $250 if they are single self-funded retirees or $380 for couples combined. The one thing that they certainly are not looking forward to is this opposition clawing that money back off them if this lot ever gets the chance. I can also inform the House that the government's household assistance package is designed to support around 98 per cent of families with incomes up to $150,000. Those families will be receiving some assistance. More than half of those families will in fact get a 20 per cent buffer to make sure that they do get the assistance they need with the introduction of the carbon price. One thing that Australians are very good My at is judging whether or not what they hear is true. What they are going to know after 1 July is that the doom and gloom that this Leader of the Opposition has been spreading is patently untrue. They will be able to judge the truth for themselves. Already we are receiving correspondence from pensioners who are saying to us how pleased they are that the money is certainly going to assist them with their winter power bills. As the Minister for Climate Change and Energy and Efficiency mentioned a minute ago, pensioners do understand that the assistance they are receiving is permanent, that it is ongoing. But, of course, it is only permanent and ongoing if the government stays in power, not if people over there get the chance because we know that this Leader of the Opposition is only plotting to figure out how he is going to claw this money back. (Time expired)",100
153,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I have a supplementary question to the minister on both the help the government is giving to pensioners and families for everyday expenses: what does this mean for my electorate of Reid and others in Western Sydney?,100
154,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:56): I thank the member for Reid for his question and particularly for all the work that he does for the pensioners in his electorate. I can let him know that 18,700 pensioners in the electorate of Reid have already received their initial payment. In the neighbouring electorate of Parramatta, more than 22,000 pensioners have received a payment. Even in Bennelong another 18,000 pensioners have received this money. I hope the member for Bennelong is telling each and every one of those 18,000 pensioners that he will be clawing that money back off them if he ever gets the chance. Starting today in Reid more than 2,000 self-funded retirees on a Commonwealth seniors health card will receive a helping hand. I reiterate to the member for Reid and to everybody on this side of the House that pensioners and self-funded retirees on a Commonwealth seniors health card can be assured that this money is ongoing. Of course, the falsehoods peddled by those opposite are exactly that. We know that the Liberals are all about helping themselves. Barry O'Farrell is there in Reid, in Parramatta, in Bennelong making sure that those pensioners that are in public housing pay increased public housing rents. His whole idea is to line his own pockets just like all of those opposite. (Time expired) Electricity Prices",100
155,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to this letter from Global Switch-which runs a data centre for leading Australian companies-to its customers, dated 14 May 2012. The letter confirms that the electricity rate will rise from 14.8c per kilowatt hour to 19.4c from 1 July 2012, a rise of 31 per cent. Will the Prime Minister now admit that many small businesses using off-peak tariffs will face electricity increases in excess of the 10 per cent she promised? Mr Laming interjecting",101

157,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. To the member's question, what the government have always said about carbon pricing is we worked with the Treasury to model the effects, particularly the effects for households. We modelled those effects and said that, on average, the additional cost for households would be $3.30 per week. As the member well knows, the jury is effectively in on that, because the regulators around the nation, including in New South Wales, have spoken and said either that the increase is exactly what the government said it would be or it would be less. Dr Jensen interjecting",101
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Tangney may be out very soon too.,101
159,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, in those circumstances, the assistance that is being provided is going to assist households in the way that the government predicted-that is, we will see an average increase in electricity for households of $3.30 a week and an average assistance of $10.10 a week.",101

164,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering the member for Flinders's question more broadly than households, which I have just described. Of course in modelling the impact for households, which will be less than a cent in a dollar, the flowthrough impacts from businesses were modelled into that cost-ofliving rise, and households will see tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. I would also say to the member for Flinders, as he well knows, putting a price on carbon is the most efficient and effective way of reducing carbon pollution.  Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister is defying your very clear ruling that she answer the question she was asked about small businesses, not about households. I ask you to draw her back to the question.",101
165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister has the call.,102
166,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was simply pointing out that whether one is talking about carbon pricing and small businesses, large businesses, households or anyone in the Australian nation, if you are going to address carbon pollution you need to work out the cheapest and most effective way of doing it. I agree with the member for Flinders when he says that perhaps the most important domestic policy decision was the decision of the Howard government that Australia would implement a national carbon trading system. He then went on to urge the government to take up that proposal for putting a price on carbon. Given his words then endorsing carbon pricing, I am a little surprised to get his question today.

So it is no wonder that the Prime Minister has now gone to take refuge, seeking asylum in the chief whip's office, pleading with him not to do to her what he and others earlier did to the member for Griffith, the former Prime Minister.  a point of order: we have just had a motion at the start of question time about asylum seekers, and to use that term in this debate is totally inappropriate.",102

180,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, standing orders should be suspended because, I tell you what, the Sussex Street squad are not just coming for the Prime Minister, they are coming for the Deputy Prime Minister too. We all know the minister for workplace relations wants to be the Treasurer in the government of the member for Griffith. That is why standing orders should be suspended. This is a Prime Minister who consistently runs away from facing up to this parliament, who consistently runs away from giving an account of her stewardship to the Australian people, and you would think that after two long years of failure the least she would try to do is come into this parliament and give an explanation of what has happened in this time. Two years ago she said that a good government had lost its way. That is what the Prime Minister said, and standing orders should be suspended so she can explain exactly what she meant by that. We know that when the Prime Minister said a good government had lost its way she did not actually believe that; because, just a few months ago, when she was again challenged by the member for Griffith, she said that it was not a good government, it was an absolutely shambolic government and it was completely paralysed by the ineptitude and the incompetence of the member for Griffith. But she did pledge that she would provide a better government and that she would give us a better way on border protection, a better way on climate change policy, a better way on the mining tax. But, as the people of Australia well know-and this is why standing orders should be suspended-the government has just got worse and worse. This is a bad government getting worse, and every day its failures become more apparent. It is a government which is incompetent and untrustworthy. It has got the Midas touch in reverse. The only thing that this government is good at is savagery against anyone who dares to stand up against it, and that is why standing orders should be suspended. We only have to look at what the current Deputy Prime Minister said about the member for Griffith, and this is why standing orders should be suspended: so that the Prime Minister can explain herself. Why did she put the Deputy Prime Minister up to say that the member for Griffith has no Labor values and never had any? Why did she put up the member for Bendigo to go out there and carpet-bomb the reputation of the former Labor Prime Minister of this country, calling him a psychopath with an ego problem? And what does it say-and this is why standing orders should be suspended-about this Prime Minister and about these ministers at the table that 31 members of caucus were prepared to back a 'psychopath' against the current incumbent Prime Minister?",103
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will,104
182,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, standing orders should be suspended because six days before the last election, this Prime Minister stood up and said, hand on heart, to the Australian people: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and she needs to give an explanation. Why did she mislead the Australian public six days before the last election? Why did she mislead the Australian public to win votes? Why, having scrambled back into the Lodge, did she do the exact opposite of what she had promised before the last election the Australian public that she would do? This is a Prime Minister who simply cannot be trusted, and standing orders should be suspended so that this Prime Minister can give an explanation of why now she will not even mention the carbon tax. It is like the anniversary that she does not want to mention. This is the tax-and this is the anniversary-that dare not speak its name. That is why standing orders must be suspended, because this is a Prime Minister and a government that are in denial. The Prime Minister is clearly in denial about the impact of the carbon tax on the aluminium industry. Her own modelling shows that there will be a 61 per cent decline in aluminium production under the carbon tax, and she tries to pretend that the workers at Point Henry could not be happier about the carbon tax, that they love the carbon tax, the last thing they are concerned about is the carbon tax. Well, she needs to explain why she wants to put in place a government policy that will all but destroy the aluminium industry in this country. We have the minister for climate change constantly telling us that the coal industry could not be happier about the carbon tax and they love the carbon tax-even though the whole point of a carbon tax is to stop the use of coal. If it does not stop the use of coal what is the point? Coal is what is producing the emissions which the carbon tax is designed to limit, and the government's own modelling shows that, absent carbon capture and storage, the coal industry will go from 70 per cent of electricity production down to 10 per cent. It spells the death of the coal industry as we know it. This is a rotten Prime Minister leading a rotten government. This is why standing orders ought to be suspended. We know that the faceless men are about to change the leader of the Labor Party but they cannot change the government; only the Australian people can do that, and, boy, are they waiting for that day! (Time expired)",104
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Is the motion seconded? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:12): I second the motion. It is important that standing orders are suspended to provide the Prime Minister with an opportunity to explain why the government has failed to find its way under her stewardship. The Leader of the Opposition is right: there was a time when Labor celebrated the anniversaries of their dear leaders. They would set out their glorious achievements in 75-page documents no less. I have one here. Remember the days of the Rudd government? On their anniversaries they would put out a one-year progress report and they would send out fullthat colour glossies on their achievements. But now here we are, two years on from Kevin's fundamental injustice day, 24 June 2010, and there has not been a peep on the glorious achievements of the Gillard government. Now why would this be? That is why standing orders must be suspended, because the Gillard government would be lucky to put out a half-pager",104
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS," Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has used her prop. Ms JULIE BISHOP: We remember the Prime Minister's infamous speech on the day after the betrayal of the member for Griffith on that dark and stormy night two years ago. The Prime Minister declared that under the member for Griffith the government had lost its way. Standing orders must be suspended to provide the Prime Minister with the opportunity to explain why she has failed to find her way-or indeed any way-on the three issues she nominated as her highest priorities: border protection, climate change and the mining tax. This Prime Minister's version of finding her way is like a dodgy taxi driver taking unwitting passengers on a mystery tour as the cost of the trip goes up and up and up, and it is the Australian taxpayers who are going to be paying the exorbitant fare. As the fare goes through the roof, it is the Australian taxpayers who will pay. Standing orders must be suspended so that we can look at the issue of border protection. This is one of the great policy failures of this generation. The Prime Minister first announced her East Timor solution, denied she had announced East Timor, and recommitted to East Timor, all within the space of just three days. As respected political commentator Laurie Oakes said at the time, her performance was: … silly and slippery and slimy and shifty in all that and it's a very, very bad start to her ministerial career. Standing orders must be suspended to provide the Prime Minister with an opportunity to explain why she has failed to find her way on border protection, because after that 'silly and slippery and slimy and shifty' start the Prime Minister has gone from bad to worse. The High Court has ruled her Malaysia solution illegal, yet she continues to hold it up as one of her finest policy initiatives. She still has not convinced her coalition partner, the Greens, to back her policy. Standing orders must be suspended so that we can debate the Prime Minister's more novel approach to finding her way on climate change, with her announcement, first, of a citizen's assembly. I remind members that in her speech announcing that policy the Prime Minister said: … I will not rush headlong into economy-wide changes that people are not familiar with … She went on: I will honour my commitment to building a consensus that is informed by the facts, tested by robust debate and concluded through common sense and open-mindedness. Therefore, we will have a citizen's assembly! Then, just days before the election came the next step on her pathway, with the infamous statement: There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead. Does anyone believe that she would be prime minister today if six days before the last election she had stood up and said, 'There will be a carbon tax under a government I lead'? The Deputy Prime Minister is sitting at the table. He said that the suggestion of Labor introducing a carbon tax was an 'hysterical allegation'. Who is looking hysterical now? It is important to remember prime that these comments were in direct response to the Leader of the Opposition, who said repeatedly that, 'as night follows day', there would be a carbon tax under this government. Standing orders must be suspended because there is a mining tax which is already under challenge in the High Court and which has increasingly rubbery foundations. It is a tax with highly doubtful revenue streams, while the government's anticipated revenues have already been spent by the Prime Minister. As the US report finds, this mining tax is already dodgy. The figures are already dodgy, and as a result of the mismatch between the tax revenue that the tax is going to come up with and the spending, the government is going to raise the tax or bring it in under other- (Time expired)",105
185,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:17): Who said this? The world view of this ugly conservatism is distinguished by complete absence of optimism, total lack of generosity of spirit and denial that politics all involves ... give as well as take. …… … The triumph of fear over hope is palpable. That was the Leader of the Opposition in an article in 1998 about the One Nation Party. In that article he opposed the politics of fear over the politics of hope, and he opposed the politics of fear over the politics of fact. Since then we have seen an opposition leader desperate because of his loss. We know that from his own words. The same person who wants to claw back the payments to families, who wants to claw back the education funding, who wants to claw back the assistance to pensioners, veterans, students and the elderly had this to say about losing power: We all need grief counselling … It's like a bereavement. Not as bad as losing a child or a spouse but up there with losing a parent. It's very hard. That is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say about going into opposition. No wonder we say that the quote from Johnson about Goldwater fits: 'In your guts you know he's nuts.' No wonder we say this. Ms Julie Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance. Mr Albanese, you can sit down.",106
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS," The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call and will be held in silence. Ms Julie Bishop: I was making the point that in his words to date the member has not yet addressed the motion. Given that this is a matter where standing orders should be suspended to debate the motion, I ask him to come back to the motion.",106
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,I ask the Leader of the House to address the motion before the chair.,106
188,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Here we see personified why we should not be suspending standing orders: this is all about their dummy spit. This is all about those opposite and their failure to acknowledge the fact that they lost the election in 2010. That is why they have come in here and moved suspensions of standing orders on 61 separate occasions. They say it is very effective but they run away from it just like they ran away from the parliament. This Leader of the Opposition is the only member of parliament to ever try to run out of parliament when a division was called. Everyone else tries to get in; he tried to get out, but he was beaten by the gazelle over here. ",106
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The member for Sturt is not being relevant.,106
190,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"We should not suspend standing orders because we should not give into the indulgence of those opposite. It is not our fault that they do not sit on this side of the chamber. It is not our fault that every day they move a suspension of standing orders for the sole purpose that, during the division, they can sit on the government benches for just a few minutes. That is the only possible explanation. What we see from those opposite is that they are not conservatives; they are wreckers; they are extremists; they are reactionaries; and they are desperate as it comes to July 1. As it comes to July 1 those opposite know that all of their fear campaigns that Whyalla will disappear off the map, and all the other fears-and we heard it again in the suspension motion. The Leader of the Opposition said today: 'We will see the death of the coal industry'-at a time when we know there is half a trillion dollars of investment in the resources sector pipeline. We should not suspend standing orders because I predict I might have got the next question. If I did, I might have been asked about the Regional Infrastructure Fund and what people have to say about that. Those on this side of the House have supported the minerals resource rent tax because we support the support for superannuation and the support for regional infrastructure. This is what the Leader of the National Party had to say a year ago: I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade and how little state governments return of the massive royalty incomes they receive to the communities. That is what he had to say. I thought that might have been an aberration-it might have just been a mistake-because the Nats do make mistakes, but just this month in the Mudgee Guardian he said that mining companies: … could not expect to take away a region's resources without leaving something for the community. That is what he had to say, and then he went on to say: … mines had a responsibility to contribute to the specific infrastructure provided to meet their needs. When they are out there in their communities, they say, 'We want regional infrastructure; we need regional infrastructure; we should do something about it.' It is just like when they go around and say they have the exactly same target that we do on climate change; the difference is this: we are using a market to get there by introducing an emissions trading system with a fixed price. Those opposite want to get there the same way, but not only are they climate sceptics; they are market sceptics as well. They want to do it through the old Soviet command style economy of this Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that they say no to everything in this parliament, except yes to Work Choices, yes to clawing back tax cuts and pension rises, yes to ripping the NBN out of the ground, yes to taking billions away from public hospitals and yes to slashing the education budget. But we know they want to avoid discussion. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has been missing a bit on the last couple of weekends-he has been doing no doorstops.",106

192,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"If we did not have a motion to suspend standing orders before us, we might ask why it is that they run away from the parliament and from debate. We know that there is a real concern from those opposite when it comes to accountability. It is probably why they have just suspended standing orders to avoid question time. They do not like questions. They will not answer any questions about what their involvement was in the James Ashby affair-not the member for Sturt; he runs from that.",107

194,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer all run away from accountability. So we would certainly welcome a debate on a whole range of issues, but not a debate on their selfindulgence-a debate that says, 'I'm so great. I'm so fantastic. How dare the Australian people not vote for me as Prime Minister!' That is essentially what we are putting up with here: the longest dummy-spit in Australian political history from this bloke opposite, who just puts his ego before everything. He goes to conferences and says things like this: 'I'll be the next Prime Minister of Australia.' He says that when he goes to state conferences. He runs down the Australian economy and runs down the performance of this government, except when he is held to account when he is overseas. There, he says: … Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable. That is exactly what the shadow Treasurer said as well.  on a point of order.

249,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of 2012, which addresses referrals made between November 2011 and March 2012. This report deals with three inquiries with a total estimated cost of $302.2 million. In each case the committee recommends the House public of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The first inquiry examined Defence Housing Australia's proposal for the development of housing for defence families public at Rasmussen in Townsville, Queensland. The key objectives of the project are to ensure that the proportion of defence families residing in private rental accommodation in the Townsville area remains under the target of 15 per cent and to maintain the housing stock in Townsville at acceptable levels. Defence Housing Australia plans to develop 1,180 residential allotments and one medium-density site in 30 stages on a site of approximately 99 hectares. Defence Housing Australia then intends to construct 401 dwellings to supply housing for defence personnel. One of the key issues for this proposal concerns the potential for large flood events to impact on the Rasmussen site. Defence Housing Australia stated that the proposed development will be above the one-in-100year flood event level. The committee pursued this issue, suggesting that a one-in100-year flood may not be the worse flood Report event that could occur, as recent flood events around the nation have shown. In particular, my deputy on the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Mallee, pursued this issue. The committee accepts that Defence Housing Australia is developing and building on the Rasmussen site within normal guidelines and according to advice provided by local and state government agencies regarding the potential for flooding. I move to speak to the second inquiry of this report. The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport seeks approval for a project that will increase bulk fuel storage capacity and integrate and co-locate fuel storage on Christmas Island. Christmas Island has a high dependency on fuel to maintain essential services and operations owing to its isolated location. Diesel is used primarily in the generation of electricity; aviation fuel is essential for commercial and government aviation operations; and unleaded petrol is used for private, commercial and government vehicles. Increased activity, including sea, land and air transport components, has particularly increased demand for diesel and aviation fuel. The ability to maintain essential services and operations on the island is limited by the current capacity of the fuel storage infrastructure. The proposal describes several measures that will increase fuel storage capacity and co-location of facilities. However, a key element in the proposal, and the key concern for the Shire of Christmas Island is the proposed location of the service station. There are four outcomes proposed for the service station, each with key advantages and disadvantages. The shire does not entirely agree with the department's proposal. The department reassured the committee that full and open consultation would be undertaken during the detailed design phase of the project. The committee is relying on the department, which has overall responsibility for Christmas Island, to make the best-informed decision concerning the location of the service station. The committee is confident that the department, in making that decision, will do all it can incorporate the community's views and ameliorate any negative impacts associated with the selected location. The third inquiry in this report examined the proposed fit-out of Commonwealth parliamentary offices at 1 Bligh Street in Sydney. The Sydney CPO, currently located at 70 Phillip Street, provides office and meeting facilities for the Prime Minister, cabinet, ministers, office holders and visiting senators and members. The Department of Finance and Deregulation stated that the 70 Phillip Street premises can be described as inadequate and no longer fit for purpose, with the key areas of concern being deficiencies in security, functionality, architecture and flexibility. Refurbishment of 70 Phillip Street has not been pursued as an option as there are several fundamental issues with the building that cannot be remedied through renovation alone. The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to lease three levels of the new building at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney. The department is confident that it will achieve a far better CPO facility through contemporary design, shared facilities and the intelligent use of a superior building. The new premises will also feature dedicated media facilities, including a live broadcast link capacity, something that has not been possible at 70 Phillip Street. One of the questions that the committee asked and was seeking reassurance about was on the telephone usage and the communications also at parking level within the planned facilities. The committee is satisfied that the Department of Finance and Deregulation has fully considered all feasible options for the establishment of new Commonwealth parliamentary offices in Sydney, and that the selected option is a practical, long-term to solution that represents value for money for the Commonwealth. I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries, and the committee secretariat. I commend the report to the House. National Broadband Network Committee",113
250,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network I present the committee's report entitled Review of the rollout of the National Broadband Network: third report, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",115
251,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I present the third report of the Joint Committee on National Broadband Network, that has been covering the period from 1 July to 31 December 2011 as well as other issues reported for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2012. Over the period covered in the report, a number of significant regulatory matters have progressed. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission considered and approved the structural separation of Telstra and accompanying draft customer migration plan, allowing for the finalisation of the Telstra agreement which involves decommissioning Telstra's copper network. The NBN rollout has experienced an eight-month delay due largely to the time taken to complete the Telstra agreement. The ACCC also approved the Optus agreement which will allow decommissioning of the Optus HFC network and transfer of customers onto the NBN. The NBN Co.'s Special Access Undertaking which sets NBN access pricing terms and conditions is being considered by the ACCC and will again be examined by the committee during its fourth review. In this report, the committee signalled its concern about comments made by the NBN Co. that NBN rollout targets contained in the Report 2011-2013 corporate plan are no longer valid due to changes in the assumptions underpinning these targets. The committee found that this statement and the absence of corporate plan targets in the shareholder ministers' performance report means targets are not able to be compared between performance reports. The NBN Co. also stated that 'if there are any future policy changes, the assumptions in the new corporate plan would have to change'. The committee considers that this statement means that any future targets are the rendered unreliable as soon as there is any change to the NBN rollout environment. The committee does not find it meaningful to be provided with data on how many premises have been passed or premises made active between periods or years without any kind of target or benchmark on which to compare this data. And more significantly, if revised NBN rollout targets will be subject to change without warning, this will mean there is no way of gauging the progress of the NBN rollout in relation to costs expended on the public infrastructure project. The committee has recommended that the Shareholder Ministers' Report does, therefore, include key performance indicator information for targets in the business plan for homes passed, homes connected and services in for operation. The committee's interest in the contracting and procurement practices of the NBN Co. gained momentum during its third review. As the NBN Co. is not subject to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines, Australians have no reassurance that the procurements associated with the network rollout are cost effective and transparent. A centralised depository as proposed in recommendation 8 would assist in countering the NBN Co.'s exemptions from a raft of transparency and accountability measures that are faced by other departments. I commend the energy and enthusiasm of regional communities such as Coffs Harbour for seizing the opportunities and confronting the challenges that high-speed broadband will create. At the same time, the committee became aware of community concerns about the difficulty of extending the fibre footprint. NBN Co. consults with communities at the final stage of the development of network design, leaving little time for communities to develop such applications. Many individuals or businesses learn of the decision upon the NBN Co.'s announcement-a point at which a decision appears to be final and not open to further negotiation. The committee also found there needs to be more effective community and small business engagement in the public's education on all matters relating to the NBN. The committee remains interested in examining the points of entry for private investment in the NBN-both in the form of equity and debt funding-to ensure a maximum return on the government's investment is secured on behalf of Australian taxpayers. This matter will therefore continue to be monitored by the committee as part of its ongoing review of the NBN rollout. I expect the fourth report will place great emphasis on that work. The final matter considered by the committee in its report concerned Telstra workforce retraining issues associated with the NBN rollout. The government has committed to providing $100 million to Telstra under a retraining funding deed to assist it in the retraining and deployment of Telstra employees affected by these reforms to the structure of the telecommunications industry. These training arrangements with Telstra were not fully implemented at the time of the committee finalising its report and the committee will continue its inquiry into this matter. The committee has recommended that the department publish a reporting document on annual progress under these training arrangements. The committee is interested in the level and value of employment creation through the building and operation of the NBN, including local and regional employment. In its report, the committee recommended that NBN Co. communicate major areas of emerging training needs and workforce demand with regard to the rollout of the NBN to assist with future Australian workforce planning in this sector. In relation to the inquiry process, the committee has again received answers to questions placed on notice at hearings too late and commented on these delays in addition to the limited information regularly received in written responses. We urge the government and NBN Co. to do better. The committee is responsible for reviewing the six-monthly rollout of the NBN and takes this responsibility seriously given the large public expenditure and time taken to enable the NBN to be completed. The committee has again recommended that internal processes for the approval of answers to questions on notice be changed so that the committee-and, by extension, the community-is given the information it has asked for by the due date. I would like to thank all committee members for their continuing focus on these important economic and social issues. I do note a dissenting report from the member for Wentworth on behalf of the Liberal-National Party. I do flag as chair that these issues are worthy of both consideration and response from government and the NBN Co. I also invite the member for Wentworth in future to consider making these considerations as part of the actual formal part of the committee's work. I thank the secretariat for their ongoing good work and for the diligence that has gone into this third report. This is a very large committee of over 60 members of parliament from all political persuasions. a hotly contested area of policy and, therefore, I think the secretariat does a fantastic job of managing that process and getting a report before the House. I commend the report to the House.",115
252,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Does the member for Lyne wish to move a motion that the House take note of the report?,117
253,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report.,117
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," accordance with standing order 39(d), the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Report and Reference to Federation Chamber",117
255,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee  behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs I present the committee's advisory report on the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 and the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.  particularly like to mention the efforts of the It is previous member for Denison and now President of the AAT, Duncan Kerr, in making this legislation become reality. The Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012 seeks to introduce greater transparency and accountability in the handling of complaints about judicial officers in the federal courts other than the High Court of Australia. The Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 introduces a framework for the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate In misbehaviour or the incapacity of a judicial officer. It is important legislation; however, I would point out that the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has had three policy inquiries, we have had 10 bills inquiries tabled, we have a foetal alcohol spectrum disorder policy inquiry underway and six more bills coming towards us. It is certainly a hard working committee, as I am the sure the member for Pearce opposite would agree. I thank the hard working secretariat for putting up with the amount of work that is going through this committee, and I note that Rebecca and Natalya are here in the chamber. Report As these bills are the subject of a concurrent inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to avoid burdening stakeholders with a request for multiple submissions on the same bills and in light of the work we are doing, the committee decided to reference the submissions accepted and published by the Senate committee. This committee held a public hearing with the Attorney-General's Department and the Law Council of Australia to clarify matters. This advisory report, which is the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee's 11th, addresses a number of issues that were raised in the submissions and at the public hearing, such as payment for legal representation, the exemption of heads of jurisdiction and High Court justices from complaints handling, and the appointment of parliamentary commission members. The committee also makes comment on some issues that caused it concern, such as the specific need for the two bills, the protection of the reputation of the judiciary and the potential for political interference. Ultimately, however, the committee concluded that the bills achieve their objectives and do not warrant any amendments. The report contains the committee's recommendation that both of the bills be passed by this House. I actually stood to do this several months ago but was not given leave. I thank the committee for their work, particularly the Hon. Philip Ruddock, who contributed supplementary member for the purposes of this inquiry, and commend the report to the House. Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (16:09): by leave-First, may I say that I concur with the comments that the member for Moreton has just made in thanking the secretariat for their work given the extraordinary workload that this committee has now been charged with. I also thank the father of the House, the member for Berowra, for his contribution and long experience in this place on this particular matter. As the member for Moreton said, he became a member of this committee for the duration of this inquiry. A key element of Australia's separation of powers is an independent judiciary which enjoys a strong security of tenure. Removal of judicial officers is deliberately difficult, primarily to ensure that the decisions are not influenced by the threat of removal from office. But, as public officers, those appointed to the judiciary are expected to maintain the highest of standards. The drafters of the Constitution settled on the amorphous phraseology in section 72 that removal is by a resolution passed by both houses of parliament, on the grounds of 'proven misbehaviour or incapacity'. Constitutional scholars have since grappled with what constitutes 'proven' and 'misbehaviour' and the process through which these should be investigated. Also, with the expansion of the federal judiciary well beyond what was first contemplated under the Constitution, there is a difficult question of how complaints against officers are to be dealt with, particularly as referring these claims, many of which are vexatious, to the federal parliament would be extremely cumbersome. The concerns were canvassed in a wide ranging Senate inquiry by the Senate as a Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Australia's Judicial System and the Role of Judges, tabled in 2009. A recommendation of that inquiry was to establish formal mechanisms dealing with complaints handling and investigation. The recommendation is the foundation of the two bills inquired into by this committee, namely, the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012 and the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012. The first bill sets out an enabling framework where the principal judicial officer, such as the chief justice of the particular court, determines in-house whether a claim has initial merit. This is in line with standard procedures across government for an internal examination before deciding on any further action. A full system cannot be legislated, as this could potentially conflict with the procedures under chapter 3 of the Constitution and, if challenged, could invalidate the whole system, but the committee was satisfied that the nonlegislative system enabled by this bill has enough safeguards to ensure legitimate complaints are not sidelined or stifled. The second bill establishes a procedure for the investigation of alleged misbehaviour. Specifically, it allows for a parliamentary commission consisting of at least one former or current federal or state judge and two other officers, appointed by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. This commission has wide ranging powers to collect evidence and hear from witnesses. The proposed system reflects similar procedures established, but later repealed, during the investigations of the former High Court judge Lionel Murphy in 1986. Concern was raised during hearings regarding the wide ranging investigative powers of the commission, the ambiguity over the role of the commission to either 'advise or 'compile' information to present to the parliament and the potential for political interference. Further, as allegations of misbehaviour against the judiciary are extremely rare, the committee queried the need for this legislation. As in the case of Justice Murphy, ad hoc provisions could be just as useful as a standing legislative process. Regardless, the committee did not see this as enough to warrant dissention against the bill and has therefore recommended both bills be passed without amendment. I commend the advisory report to the House. NA Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House notes with approval that, in response to public pressure, the Government has introduced this limited bill, but deplores the Government's failure to: (1) establish an independent Registered Organisations Commission to: (a) enforce, and police the reporting and compliance obligations; (b) provide information to members of registered organisations about their rights and act as the body to receive complaints from their members; (c) educate registered organisations about the new obligations that apply to them; and (d) absorb the role of registered organisations enforcer and investigator, currently held by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia; (2) ensure registered organisations face the same accountability and transparency measures as required of companies and their directors under the Corporations Act; and (3) ensure registered organisations face the same penalties as companies and their directors under the Corporations Act.""",117
256,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. It is telling that the announcement of this legislation came just 10 days after the Leader of the Opposition announced the coalition's better plan for accountability and transparency registered organisations. The government incorrectly accuses the coalition of not presenting policy. Well, here we have an example of the government attempting to mimic coalition policy. But this legislation does not go far enough. It does not include the measures that the coalition believes are required for true accountability and transparency for registered organisations. There are strict rules to ensure that companies and their directors act appropriately. The coalition believes that these same rules should apply to registered organisations and to their officers. Only then can members of registered organisations be assured that their money is being used prudently. While this bill increases the penalties for officers of registered organisations, it does not go far enough. I shall now spend some time outlining some of the differences between the reporting obligations of companies and registered organisations, as well as some of the differences between directors of companies and officers of registered organisations. The obligations on company directors are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies including the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and, applicable, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Australians are confident in the ability of these organisations to regulate companies and their directors. The obligations on registered organisations and their officers are enforced only by Fair Work Australia. I do not have enough time to compare all of the obligations upon company directors with all of the obligations upon officers of registered organisations; however, I will take the time to outline some of the significant variations. Section 180 of the Corporations Act for requires that a director of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with a degree of care and diligence. There is a similar provision in section 285 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The penalty for a breach by a company director is up to $200,000, while the provisions for an officer of a registered organisation currently apply a penalty of $2,200. The amendments contained within this bill, if passed, will increase the penalty for officers of registered organisations to $6,600, which is still a small fraction of the penalty applied to a company director. Section 181 of the Corporations Act compels directors to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith, in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. This is reflected in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act in section 286. Again, the penalty for a breach by a company director is up to $200,000, while the penalty for an officer of a registered organisation according to this bill will be $6,600. Section 182 of the Corporations Act has the provision that a director or officer of a company must not improperly use their position to gain an advantage for themselves where or someone else, or to cause detriment to the corporation, while section 287 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act contains a similar provision. The penalty for directors of companies is-you guessed it$200,000, while the penalty as amended by this legislation for a registered organisation is a princely $6,600. A provision that a company director or an officer of a registered organisation must not use information received in their position to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to another is in both the Corporations Act at section 183, and the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act at section 288. But again, we see the penalty for directors is $200,000, and the penalty in this bill as amended in relation to officers of a registered organisation is $6,600. I trust that members are seeing a pattern developing here that, even under the provisions that this bill introduces, the penalties for directors of companies remain vastly higher than the penalties that would be imposed on an officer of a registered organisation. This pattern continues, with section 184 of the Corporations Act providing a criminal offence for directors that are reckless or intentionally dishonest and fail to exercise their powers or discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation or for proper purpose. There is no corresponding provision in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act and this bill does not introduce any. Under this bill, there are still no provisions creating criminal offences for officials of registered organisations. We have listened intently to the soap opera that has prevailed with regard to the HSU and the member for Dobell, and I stand here in stunned amazement that there has not been greater motivation to impose tougher penalties in relation to registered organisations. In introducing this bill, the minister said: This represents a significant increase in penalties to reflect the seriousness with which this government, and registered organisations, take compliance with workplace relations law. For once, I agree with the minister. It does reflect the seriousness with which the government takes the sorts of breaches that this legislation deals with-it does not take it very seriously at all! It is all for slapping members of registered organisations on the wrist, whilst it is quite happy to hang directors out to dry, or to take them to the gallows or to the guillotine. If you are a member of a registered organisation you can do the HSU thing and you can misappropriate funds and you know the penalties will be light. This legislation does very little to improve that. It is nothing more than a slightly harder slap on the wrist. If a former union boss took compliance with workplace regulation seriously, he would welcome the coalition amendments which have criminal provisions for officers that are recklessly or intentionally dishonest, and which increase civil penalties in line with those applicable to company directors. Some might think that these disproportionate penalties are appropriate when considering the large packages that some executives are reported to earn; however, these penalties also apply to mum and dad directors who might have little left after paying their employees, not just to directors of listed companies. As recent media has reported, the officers of registered organisations can also be earning substantial incomes, often many multiples of the income of the members that pay their wages. Just as directors have a duty to act prudently for the benefit of shareholders, officers of registered organisations must act prudently in the interests of their members. This legislation sends all the wrong signals. The penalties in this legislation are a token gesture implemented by a government that is being dragged kicking and screaming to the reform process. It is nothing more than a token gesture. This legislation sends the message loud and clear that the government is not serious about dealing with the sort of unscrupulous behaviour that Fair Work Australia found was taking place at the Health Services Union. Labor is saying that it is a minor matter to defraud members and to act in a way that is contrary to the interests of members. The member for Chifley has said that union officials get paid less than company directors so the penalties should be less. This argument is absolute nonsense. These organisations control vast amounts of funds. They control in many cases the future of the members that they represent. The employees of registered organisations have the ability to inflict widespread harm on those for whose money they are effectively the custodians. Penalties should reflect the potential magnitude of the damage caused by a union officer's illegal action, not the their salary. The bottom line is that the fabled 'majority of union officers' who do the right thing by their members have absolutely nothing to fear from the significantly increased penalties proposed by the coalition because, if they do the right thing, if they act in the interests of their members, they will not be paying a penalty. There are a range of matters not addressed by this bill. The coalition is concerned that former union bosses are regulating the current union bosses. That is an interesting situation-a very cosy situation. This concern is not limited to just the coalition, as constituents have also expressed their concern about the ability of Fair Work Australia to regulate unions. This bill does not address this concern. The coalition's plan for better transparency and accountability of registered organisations would have a registered organisations commission take over the roles of ensuring registered organisations do the right thing by their members and being answerable to parliament. This would address the real concern about Fair Work Australia's ability to do this job. We have recently seen that there is a certain amount of confusion about Fair Work Australia's ability to cooperate with police and other agencies. The bill, while expanding police cooperation powers, does not make it expressly clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. I would have thought that cooperation with police forces would be an absolutely binding obligation on Fair Work Australia, not something that requires clarification at this point in time. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that it be absolutely clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. It is also important that Fair Work Australia be able to provide a brief of evidence to the DPP. Again, given size of the previous problems with this, it is important to give express powers to allow that to happen. The coalition have been asking a number of questions. How can you take Labor seriously when the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was the head of the ACTU and when the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, sat on the ACTU when the member for Dobell also sat on the ACTU? A cosy little clique, indeed. How can you take Labor seriously when this happened right under Labor's nose while the member for Dobell was a member of parliament and Michael Williamson was the President of the Labor Party? How can you take Labor seriously on ensuring union bosses follow the rules when they have turned the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner into a toothless tiger? And how can you take Labor seriously when they still rely on the tainted vote of the member for Dobell? This is a bill designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses and it will be enforced by former union bosses. It is a weak bill that does not go far enough. Union members, many of whom are in low-paying positions, pay their dues every week in the hope that their union will represent their interests. They should not have to put up with union fat cats using their money for long lunches, outrageous salaries and purposes unrelated to union business. Only the coalition has a plan to properly regulate unions. I call on the government to take some real action to improve union accountability. We have seen in relation to the HSU the most egregious waste of the funds of union members-union members who work hard and go without to contribute their union dues. These are not members being paid the sorts of salaries that union officials are getting paid. They are everyday hard working Australians who have seen their money squandered and who have real concerns about the future of the union. The Australian Labor Party and the union movement do not need a complex review or a detailed examination of why union membership is declining. They need look no further than the mirror to see why they have a problem. They have a problem because the unions of today have lost sight of the goal for which they were established, and that was to look after the interests of the members. When you look at this legislation that has come out of the Australian Labor Party, the puppet of the union membership, you can see that the union movement is not concerned about accountability and having an organisation that works in the best interests of the members. The union movement is interested in perpetuating the personal benefits it can bestow on itself, quite clearly. Otherwise, we would have good penalties and some real teeth in this legislation: it would put sufficient sanctions in place to ensure officials appointed to union positions, who have under their charge large amounts of union funds, act in the interests of the thousands of members right around the country. It would have penalties that would be a serious deterrent, not mere slaps on the wrist as in this legislation. This bill encapsulates so much of what is wrong with the modern Labor Party: a failure to really deal with the union movement to ensure that it is acting in the best interests not only of the members themselves but of the Australian people generally. We need to have much stronger sanctions. The coalition in government will right this problem if our amendments are not passed in this place now. Upon coming to government we will ensure that union members are as accountable as company directors. We will ensure that legislation will be in place to give union members the assurance that their money is being spent wisely, which the Australian Labor Party is not giving them. No wonder Australian workers are deserting the Labor Party. They are deserting the Labor Party because they know that the Labor Party are looking after themselves, not looking after their interests.",119
257,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS," I start with an explanation: the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 before the House and the amendments we will move are not anti union. It is not about shackling unions to the extent that it would affect their ability to effectively represent their members. I fully acknowledge that from the Harvester award of 1907 to the election of the first female president of the ACTU in 1995, the union movement has had, and it continues to have, a significant impact on Australia's way of life. While we may disagree with the union movement on their methods and their aims, the Liberal Party from Menzies to Howard has always recognised the role unions play and the right they have to play that role. In the words of John Howard: 'We're anti-union control. We're anti-union domination. We're anti the unions having a monopoly role in the workplace, but,' 'We are not anti-union'. But this bill and the amendments the coalition seek are about lifting the standards of transparency and accountability of registered organisations, of which unions are one. It is about ensuring we do not have a repeat of the scandals of the Health Services Union, where 70,000 of the lowest paid, hardest working employees from the HSU had more than $500,000 of their money misused-misused on expensive dinners, misused on holidays, misused on escorts, misused on political campaigns and political staffers, misused to the point that this money will never be seen again. Not to mention that HSU East made millions of dollars of expenditure without necessary controls or competition. The Temby report has detailed that over four years $2.4 million was spent on the HSU credit card without sufficient guidelines documentation, and a whopping $17 million of contracts were entered into without a proper tender process. As documented by the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, Senator Abetz, there was: $5 million to Access Focus for what is believed to be consultancies memorabilia; $4.9 million over three years United Edge believed to be for IT services; and $3.4 million to Communigraphix over four years, believed to be for the union journal. And the list goes on, with the concerning revelation that some of the companies benefitting from these contracts were linked to Michael Williamson, the former President of the Australian Labor Party, This is why we are here. This is why the coalition is taking the initiative in putting forward these amendments, to ensure that registered organisations such as unions are submitted to the same level of accountability and transparency as companies and their directors are under the Corporations Act. Under the current law, trade unions as registered organisations are subject to obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. These include: not using their position for personal gain, ensuring the appropriate use of members' money and acting at all times in the best interests of the members. But the penalties for the breach of these obligations are either minor and insufficient. Under section 287 and 288 of the Fair Work Act, civil penalties for using information to the detriment of the organisation or for personal advantage could involve fines of only up to $2,200 for an individual, and no criminal provisions apply. In contrast, under section 184 of the Corporations Act, criminal offences could lead to a fine of up to $200,000 for an individual or imprisonment and for up to five years. These are serious penalties for serious crimes and this is what the coalition is seeking to achieve by moving these amendments. What is more, the coalition believes we can no longer leave it to Fair Work Australia to police and enforce these obligations. The and HSU scandal has shone a light on the to deficiencies of Fair Work Australia. To take more than three years to investigate the allegations around Craig Thomson and then produce a document which is not even in the required format for the Director of Public Prosecutions is completely unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the coalition and unacceptable to the Australian people. The institutional go-slow and the incompetency displayed seriously undermined any possibility of an expeditious, effective and professional handling of the HSU matter. What we need now is a new body, which the coalition proposes calling the Registered Organisations Commission, which will police and enforce these new compliance obligations rather than leaving it to the general manager. This new commission will take responsibility for educating members of registered organisations about their rights and acting as a repository of complaints from its members. The coalition understands that one has to separate Fair Work Australia from its day-today role solving disputes and making agreements, from its watchdog role ensuring proper accountability transparency. In the words of Peter Anderson, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry head: We need to separate some of these roles so that the arbitral side, the decision making side that affects employers and affects industry is quite distinct from the traditional role that scrutinises unions and employers organisations. How right he is. The problem with the government's bill is that it does not go far enough. Do not take my word for it: Labor's member for Barton and the former Attorney-General in the Rudd government, Robert MCClelland, said as much in his speech to the parliament last week. And if you do not want to take his word for it, read the speech of the National Secretary of the Health Services Union, Kathy Jackson, to the HR Nicholls Society just a few weeks ago, where she made a similar point, saying: ... I believe that there is a very strong case for extending, to the full extent possible and applicable, the same governance, investigation and enforcement provisions that apply to other corporations, generally those registered under the Corporations Act, to unions. You see, the government's bill is a timid reaction to the loud public outrage and it is an inadequate response to the coalition's lead on the issue. Just look at the details. Under the government's bill the rules are still weak, the penalties are still weak and Fair Work Australia is still left to police these registered organisations, despite its failed record. Under the government's bill there is no real attempt to apply the standards of the Corporations Act to those of registered organisations. Under the government's bill there is no specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence. Under the government's bill there is no requirement for Fair Work Australia to report to the parliament and explain why an investigation and has taken longer than a year. Under the government's bill that ere is no specific provision making it clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police at the start, during and at the end of the investigation. These are all deficiencies in the government's legislation which will be rectified by the coalition's amendments. We have to understand that, despite the falling membership of unions, representing as they do only around 13 per cent of the private sector workforce and around 18 per cent of the overall workforce, unions are still big businesses. Unions are big businesses and their financials reflect as much. In an important report released by the Institute of Public Affairs, entitled Australian trade unions: an alternate regulatory approach, Olivia Graham and the irrepressible John Lloyd gave us a snapshot of some these financials. For example, in 2010 the CFMEU's construction and general branch in the Victorian division held net assets worth $42 million, including $4.5 million worth of investment properties and $25 million worth of property, plant and equipment. In 2011 the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing Federation held $21,768 million in net assets and earned just over $6 million in net revenue. These are just some of the individual state based divisions. When one accumulates the net assets of the total union movement, it is easy to understand how unions can put together tens of millions of dollars every election for their brothers in the Labor Party. Given these large numbers, it is absolutely critical that the standards of financial transparency and accountability within the union movement are lifted. In conclusion, we cannot afford to have another repeat of the HSU scandal. The Australian public will not stand for it, union members will not stand for it and the coalition will not stand for it. The coalition's amendments put before the House are a step forward They will enhance transparency, they will strengthen accountability and they will ensure that unions, which are big businesses, are subject to the same analysis, the same accountability, the same standards and the same transparency as are corporations and their directors. I recommend the amendments to the House.",123
258,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I rise also to speak on the amendments to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. Once again in the chamber we find ourselves at an interesting juncture in the politics of our nation. In the past few weeks in the parliament, we have seen lateral transfers for defence families moved by the opposition and adopted by the government; and the victims of terrorism bill, a private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition, adopted by the government. Here, 10 days ago, we saw the Leader of the Opposition announce the coalition's better plan for accountability and transparency for registered organisations and, 10 days later, we have a bill introduced by the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten, to address just that matter. It appears that the opposition is governing with its ideas and programs. Once again we see a bill in response to something. In the act-react cycle, we seem to act and the government reacts, rather than doing what it is elected to do-that is, to address the very serious problems that we have seen with the Health Services Union and unions more broadly in Australia today. Given that we apply such stringent rules to corporations in the Corporations Act, it is not unfair in the light of the stunning and explosive revenue elations made by Fair Work Australia in their report into the Health Services Union that we look at legislation to improve the transparency and quality of registered organisations including unions. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in the coalition's plan for better accountability and transparency for registered organisations. In this bill, we see the provisions lacking in a number of ways, and that is attempting to address a problem when you are not really addressing a problem. That is why we have proposed some very serious amendments. I am going to outline some of those shortly. We believe, however, that the coalition has a better plan to make sure that the money of the members of these very serious organisations-which are now responsible for large amounts of money and investments and responsible for the lives of so many poor and other people at the bottom end of the scale-is spent responsibly and properly. We require the same thing from corporations and boards of directors. In the same way, when we see a Lehman Brothers style collapse, we say: 'That is terrible. Those people mismanaged their risk and their money, and those people should be dealt with.' In the same way, as the Health Services Union has, explosively, revealed serious problems and fraud, we ought to now apply the rule of law. That is why in our amendment we are bringing penalties in line with the Corporations Act, and seeking to bring across to the registered organisations act section 184 of the Corporations Act, which would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to be reckless. I do not understand how that could be opposed by the government considering that is what governing is all about. Applying the rule of law means extending the power we apply from government to negate behaviour, and the main mechanism with which we can negate this style of behaviour is the law. The Corporations Act into the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act's section 184 would provide for that, thereby negating these acts of people in registered organisations. It is an appropriate and a fair way of addressing this matter. Further, with regard to the government's increases to the civil penalties proposed in this bill, we are seeking to further increase those penalties in line with the Corporations Act. In this modern approach to dealing with registered organisations and unions, given the seriousness of the role that they occupy in today's society, it is appropriate that the penalties mirror those in the Corporations Act that apply to boards of directors and other office bearers in corporations. That does not appear to be controversial, but the fact that it is missing from this legislation a big gap in the government's approach. Other issues that we have with this bill include the fact that Fair Work Australia is still in control. The approach that Fair Work Australia has taken in recent times in these investigations highlights the need for legislation to improve the situation in how Fair Work Australia addresses matters. We feel that putting Fair Work Australia in charge without considerable increases in its ability or the provision that we would make on it from this place is a weak approach. We want Fair Work Australia to have the ability to make sure its investigations are done properly. We saw three years of failure to cooperate with police, for example, with Fair Work Australia claiming it could not produce a brief of evidence. From our amendments, and from what is missing in the government's legislation, how we can take this bill seriously when it is not proposing to give specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence, given that this was one of the main criticisms of the approach that Fair Work Australia has taken? So in our amendments we are seeking to give Fair Work Australia the appropriate requirements to make sure it cooperates with police and that it can produce a brief of evidence. We also want to make sure this parliament has a mechanism, if Fair Work Australia is not delivering on its obligations to investigate in a timely fashion, to prevent us from seeing a repeat of the situation where Fair Work Australia could take as long as it likes and be open to the perception or the accusation, which it was, that there was political interference. Whether there was or not is not my place to say, but the accusation and the perception could be made about Fair Work Australia because the parliament has no mechanism to ensure that it is acting in a timely fashion. Having reports to parliament is at the year mark, and then every six months after that, as to how an investigation is going and what the expected progress will be would provide accountability and transparency into the future. Once again, this is not subjective or targeted at anybody, and there is nothing for the government to really object to except proper transparency and accountability. That is what we are providing for with our amendments. I do not understand, and I would love to hear the government argue, why it would not be appropriate in future investigations to ensure that Fair Work Australia's investigations are held to a high standard and perceived to be at a high standard, and that at least confidence can be held in the operation of Fair Work Australia. As I discussed, we propose increasing penalties for misusing members' funds, and the stories that we have seen out of the Health Services Union have shattered public confidence in that union, particularly for those very hard working people in the health sector who do such a great job and who decide to contribute by joining a union. It may surprise the government and others to know that I am not against people joining unions. I think, inherently, join a union and collaborate with others to collectively bargain to improve their conditions in the workforce is an appropriate use of their time and an appropriate choice for a person to make. In a free society, trade unions would operate effectively on behalf of their members. I think, though, it is an inherent mistake made by unions that they are affiliated with one political party in Australia. I put that right out there. That mix of politics and unionism in Australia has led to a situation where every member of the Labor Party in this place is a trade union official, where vast sums of members' money from lowly paid workers end up in a political party's coffers, and where the Health Services Union is mixed up at the centre of a national political scandal. In a way, that is unedifying not only for the parliament but also for unions, workers and trade unionists. There is no accident in all of that; a series mistakes have been made. This bill could go much further in what it is doing to make sure that this situation is rectified in some way. I do not believe we can take the government seriously with this bill when we consider that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was the head of the ACTU and the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, was in the ACTU at a similar time as many people who have been caught up in this problem. There are too many of these issues going around, and while there is nothing specific that we would level at anybody here, these amendments are designed to give strength, purpose and meaning to a real agenda to make registered organisations transparent and accountable. It is an appropriate and important use of this parliament's power and privilege to make sure that we do so when given the a person's right to opportunity. We have seen, given the scandal that has surrounded the Health Services Unionwhose report is 12,000 pages, 900 of which deal with the former secretary of the Health Services Union-that there is real cause for concern about penalties. The coalition's amendment, particularly in relation to the disclosure of information to police, is something that ought to be supported by everybody here to make sure that in future, where there are allegations of serious misconduct, people have to cooperate with police and disclose information, and that people and officers at Fair Work Australia can cooperate fully with police at all stages of an investigation. It is important that we clarify the position, that we ensure that we signal to Fair Work Australia that, like every other citizen, corporation or entity in Australia, we ask of them that they cooperate with law of enforcement agencies. We do not want any obstacles in the way of that cooperation, and if there are any obstacles from this parliament we want to ensure, through an amendment, that they are removed so that every officer of Fair Work Australia can then cooperate. We find with many of these amendments before us that are proposed by the coalition that they would provide a very fair platform for the operation of registered organisations to ensure a minimising of criminal activity and other incorrect conduct, to put it politely. That this bill is designed by a former union boss to regulate other union bosses is a valid criticism and many members have made that comment in this place. I do not think it is appropriate that former union bosses design the rules for the next generation of union bosses. That is the flaw in this legislation. They may think this is something that will address the situation, but, when you go through it and look at how this bill came about-literally, the Leader of the Opposition proposed the coalition's plan, Minister Shorten came to this parliament and announced this legislation and now, here we are, debating it a short time later-it highlights that, really, this is a reaction than an action. The government did not choose to act, despite how long this Fair Work Australia investigation has been going, how long the report has been in the public domain and how serious it is in nature. The government did not say, 'This is quite serious. We really want to act on this. We'd prefer to do something. We're not going to let the opposition get a jump on us. We're not going to let them propose what to do and then react to it. We're going to propose some pretty serious measures and ensure that this does not happen again.' That way, everyone would be better off. The parliament, the union movement and registered organisations in Australia would improve in quality and be more transparent. I think we have seen the government's agenda exposed a little. That is what is important to realise here. I guess the government's agenda is not so much about fixing this problem; it is about being perceived to be doing something about it. There is a very big distinction here, because the coalition's amendment underscores, line by line, issue by issue, that if you were serious you would be much tougher. If you were serious you would give force to what you are saying. If you were serious, provision by provision, you would have much more detail and there would be many more actual powers to ensure that Fair Work Australia had to cooperate with the police and had the power to provide a brief of evidence, ensure that, if reports were taking too long, there was a mechanism for the parliament to address them and ensure, of course, that penalties applied-that the main force and power we can give to legislation, the power to penalise, was the same as in the Corporations Act and was there to be used when this sort of situation came up. While we do not oppose the bill itself, we rather have proposed these amendments. They are serious, measured amendments. They are not unfair to anybody. They are to give effect to what should be a bill to improve transparency in registered organisations in Australia to ensure that this situation does not arise again without any real recourse in law to address it effectively and quickly, where Fair Work Australia took so long to do so little about something so serious. That is why we need better legislation. The coalition are proud to have flagged our plan for the government, and we are happy to see the government react. If they do not have the ideas, we are happy to see them react our ideas. But, when you have that reaction, I think you also have to look at the people who originated the transparency and accountability plan and listen to us very carefully about the serious strengthening amendments that we are proposing to ensure that this legislation can work effectively.",126
259,Mr KATTER,BILLS," I applaud some of the remarks that the previous speaker made. His endorsement might be in a fair bit of trouble as a result of some of the remarks he made, but I applaud him for them. However, he started talking about unionists having a responsibility to speak up and the fact that the amendments being moved by the Liberal Party will overcome that problem. We have the situation with the building workers union where there is a right to silence enjoyed by everyone everywhere in the world. I do not know of any jurisdictions, outside of oneparty government countries, where you have no right to silence. I will not go into all arguments about why you should have a right to silence; suffice it to say that every country in the world provides that right to silence. I have not seen the amendments-I could be critical and say that I did not get the courtesy of receiving the amendments-so, not having seen them, all I can do is comment upon what the previous two speakers said. In the building workers union, if the police ask you a question and you refuse to answer it, they can jail you and you pretty well indefinitely at their discretion. We are on very dangerous ground when fundamental freedoms are taken off people. I do not want to go into all the issues around that building workers legislation. It was only under threat from the crossbenchers that the ALP moved to remove what were abominable discretionary powers that were given to these various authorities. There had not been a single problem in almost the last seven years and there was no justification. There may be justification for some oppressive legislation in the short term to a short-term problem, but I would think that you would never introduce that type of legislation without a sunset clause upon it. I find it very hard to envisage a situation where fundamental freedoms and rights are taken away to overcome a temporary problem that has arisen, however bad that problem might be. Let me turn from generalities to the bill before the House, which is aimed at increasing the responsibilities upon trade union officials in the area of accountability. The unions have all agreed to it, but I suspect that a number of them have agreed to it because they are too scared to say they do not agree to it, because someone might start looking at them and thinking that they have something to hide. I came into this place out of a terrible the baptism, which was the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland, where we had some people at the heart of police corruption. I say with very great pride that we had the courage, with our eyes open, knowing the great dangers that we took, to try to go after that centre of corruption in the police force. Most certainly it was not Terry Lewis but, on the evidence, it would appear that he was playing a part in protecting these people. In doing that, we unleashed a monster. Monsters have been unleashed with the jail Salem witch burnings and the MCCarthy hearings in the United States. We can find a hundred examples: the Spanish Inquisition; the burning of books in Nazi Germany; Oliver Cromwell's regime in England. There are many examples of the psychological phenomenon of witch burning. We most certainly suffered that in Queensland, and it made me very conscious of the enormous injustices that are perpetrated-in a lot of cases, upon public officials such as politicians. The leading case is Brian Austin, a minister in Queensland who was fix effectively the first one to go to jail. Let everyone in this place listen to this with some fear and trembling. He was jailed because he took his government car to visit his kids who were at boarding school in Armidale. He spent three years in a cage, like an animal, because he did that. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Owens, you would be aware that almost every government official in Australia-and I do not just mean politicians-has a government motor car which will be used for private purposes today. Whether it is picking up the kids from school or picking up a loaf of bread on the way home, it falls within that definition. But when the old witch-hunt occurs watch out, because there is no such thing as justice here. I am just worried that the government may have acted somewhat excessively in this area-and I most certainly would not be cheering the opposition on in their attacks here. Turning to the issue of collective bargaining in Australia, I had the very great honour of addressing two of the trade unions' annual general meetings. I think at least one of them knew of my book on the history of Australia from 1890 to 1910. In that book was a very fine tribute to trade unionism in this country. We had a situation a hundred years ago in which one in 31 of us who went down the mines never came back up again. They died a terrible death from miner's phthisis or, worse still, in many cases they were buried alive. And this was not confined to mining. Of the 2,000 men who worked digging the sewerage ditches in Sydneythey were working down eight or nine feet deep and there was no circulation of airevery single one who worked there for more than two years died of miner's phthisis. And if you are looking for the reasons for the formation of the Labor Party in Australia, look no further than miner's phthisis. The first Labor head of government elected anywhere in the world was in QueenslandAnderson Dawson, from my own family's hometown of Charters Towers. We were in Charters Towers before there was a Charters Towers. Anderson Dawson was the member of parliament for Charters Towers and the first Labor premier elected anywhere in the world. He left parliament because he had contracted lung disease, miner's phthisis, whilst he was mining. Andrew Fisher, the second Labor Prime Minister of this country, also had to leave politics on account of miner's phthisis, and his father also died from miner's phthisis. The black people who were employed in the mines in South Africa, even though they were very poorly treated, had legislation protecting them from miner's phthisisdamping-down legislation. When they were using machine drills, which came in the 1890s, they needed damping-down legislation. It was given by the white people of South Africa to protect the black people who worked down in the mines. In Wales the miners were treated even worse. They had a steel collar welded around their neck with a number on it and they were not allowed to leave their place of work, by law. They were very much in a slave-like activity. Ken Follett wrote a very good novel based upon the situation in Wales. Even though those people were treated like dogs and slaves, they still had protection for damping down. But in this country we did not. We had to form a union. One of the leaders of that very great union, the AWU, is in here today-and very proudly, I would think. The union was formed to combat and overcome, mainly by Ted Theodore when he went down the mine for the second time in his life and saw his mates die. That was his fork in the road to Damascus. He formed a union and he took over the running of Queensland within seven years. The people were so grateful for what he did for themand I pay tribute to trade unionism in this. It was not just what that great union leader did for the workers and the employees. He took the land off the landed gentry, who to a large degree were foreign corporations, and redistributed it to Queenslanders. Probably half of the landowners in Queensland today, if they trace it back, got their original land from the redistribution policies of the Theodore government. They gave us the land so that we Australians could make a quid. And our farmers were given statutory marketing arrangements. Our dairy farmers were not told what they would be paid. They said, 'You'll pay us this amount of money via an arbitrated price'-and similarly with the workers. When the dairy farmers lost that arbitrated price their price went from 59c a litre the day before deregulation to 42c a litre the day after. Every member of this place should reflect upon the fact that they belong to a political party that participated in what the very famous dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Queensland, the most distinguished of Australia's economics faculties, Ted Colson, said in addressing a meeting. He said the three great shames of this nation were the way that we treated the men who came home from Vietnam, the way we treated the first Australians and what we did to the dairy farmers of Australia through deregulation. Without the trade union movement we would live in a deregulated marketplace. It is easy for the speaker before last to get up and say that the unions should not give money to the ALP. If they had not, we would have a deregulated labour market in this country. To the eternal shame of the Liberal Party in Queensland, the Premier of Queensland stood up two weeks before the election and said that there will be no fly-in miners from overseas. No, what he said was, 'I'm not in favour of fly-in mining from overseas.' That was two weeks before the election. Five weeks after the election he stood up and said, 'There will be fly-in mining from overseas in Queensland.' It was a very different party before the election and after the election. But to see a Labor government here in Canberra give the green light to flying in foreign workers from overseas! Madam Deputy Speaker, your predecessor, Mr Slipper, removed a picture of Charlie MCDonald, the first member for Kennedy and my predecessor. Every speech Charlie gave in this House in his early years in the parliament was against bringing in foreign workers from overseas to undermine pay rates, to undermine safety conditions, to work for nothing and to take jobs that should have come to the local worker. That is the contribution being made by the trade union movement. Some of them have had the courage to speak out against flying in foreign workers. In Queensland 299,000 people are registered for full-time employment but cannot get a job, with 200,000 of those unable to get a job at all. And there is Gina Rinehart telling us that she has to fly in workers from overseas. As for the assurances provided to us by the federal government, they are not worth the paper they are written on. They should be ashamed of themselves for insulting the trade union movement of Australia with such absolute rubbish like, 'We'll make sure that there is no Australian available for that position.' There would not be a member in this place that has not driven a truck around the provisions of section 457. I most certainly have. So, if you can drive around section 457, you will most certainly be able to drive it around this(Time expired)",129
260,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. This bill will amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 to increase the financial and accountability obligations of registered organisations and their office holders, strengthen the investigative powers of Fair Work Australia and enhance remedies under the registered organisations act. Let me start by highlighting that the need for greater oversight of registered organisations has come from Fair Work Australia itself. In its statement regarding investigations into the HSU, Fair Work Australia said of the Health Services Union: The investigation reveals an organisation that abjectly failed to have adequate governance arrangements in place to protect union members' funds against misuse. Substantial funds were, in my view, spent inappropriately including on escort services, spousal travel, and excessive travel and hospitality expenditure. These revelations are a clear indicator that there is an urgent need to ensure that money paid by members to registered organisations is used for proper purposes. The 1,200-page report, to the disgust of the people of Australia, detailed the financial misuse and inappropriate manner in which the hardearned money of Health Services Union members was spent by senior union officials. It is an absolute shame that an organisation that has purported for many years to represent hard working Australians and their rights has now been exposed as having zero regard and respect for those workers. In saying that, I do associate my comments with those of previous members who have highlighted that there are unions that do an outstanding job. In the workplace there are organisations that do represent their members and provide value. I was always of the opinion that unions could have done much more, in particular, in building the Bowen Basin and now the Galilee Basin. Unions could have done a lot more in providing far better value for their members. But that is a debate for another day. The revelations that union members' money was spent by union officials on escort agencies, travel, restaurants and huge cash withdrawals are a disgrace to say the least. It clearly demonstrates that there is an urgent need to ensure that money paid by members to registered organisations is used responsibly, appropriately and in a transparent way. Today's bill will amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which sets out the statutory obligations and privileges for so-called registered organisations. These include both federally registrable employee associations-trade unions-and federally registrable employer associations, which includes employer associations and industry associations. The task of administering obligations and responsibilities imposed on registered organisations currently belongs to the General Manager of Fair Work Australia. Such obligations include ensuring that financial statements and associated reporting requirements are met. Powers include the ability to conduct inquiries, investigate registered organisations and pursue allegations of breaches. This bill seems little more than a hasty attempt by those opposite to give the appearance that they are making an effort to resolve the many issues plaguing the oversight of registered organisations. The reality is that this bill falls well short of doing what is necessary and we in the coalition have a number of real concerns about it. The rules and requirements as a result of the changes are still significantly weaker than those expected of company directors. I bring the House's attention to company directors. When one hears that term one automatically thinks of the corporate top end of town-the Monopoly type of corporate director. That is not necessarily the case. The company directors in my electorate are the local mechanic and the local butcher. They may be someone who has a combined household income of around $100,000 per annum and the advice that they have received from the Taxation Office is to set up a company structure for taxation benefits, rather than give $50,000 to the husband and $50,000 to the wife as is often the case. I implore the House: when you hear the term company director do not think of the Reserve Bank, do not think of those directors of the board of multinational companies; send your thoughts to the local mechanic, the local butcher and the local businessman, because they are the people in my electorate who will ultimately be affected. The rules and requirements as a result of the changes are still significantly weaker than those expected of a company director. While the penalties are in line with other civil penalties in the Fair Work Act, they still fall considerably short of those required under the Corporations Act. Here we have a situation where we have one set of rules under the Corporations Act for our company directors and another set of rules for our union mates. It is a juxtaposition. Why are we in this position, having this discussion? Why is this bill before the House? It was only last week in the Federation Chamber that I put up a private member's motion which sought to implement a plan that would exact the same standards of accountability and transparency from union leaders as is expected of company directors under the Corporations Act. You should have seen the Labor members of this House with union links that got up and said, 'We don't need any more transparency; we oppose the private member's motion that you put up.' There was a member who supported my motion because he was actually there and listened to it. The other members that came in were automatically opposed. I put the private member's motion up because the unions were calling for it. The unions themselves, through the papers and their organisations, were calling for itbecause there is a stench around the union movement at the moment with reference to transparency and accountability. Take, for example, the comment of the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, David Oliver. He said: … every union member in this country has a right to know that … their money is going to be subject to good governance and good regulation. The National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, has said that he supports bringing unions' accountability and transparency in line with the Corporations Act. Here we have two predominant unions saying that they support stronger transparency in the organisations. Furthermore, in his opening address for the 2012 congress, Mr Oliver said that unions: … have a significant responsibility to our members to ensure and make double sure that members' money is only used for purposes to advance our members' interests. The recent Fair Work Australia report leaves those comments in question. The bill, while expanding police cooperation powers, does not make it expressly clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia it is important that this is made absolutely clear. I ask the minister, when making his final comments, to clarify that point. In addition to clarifying their responsibilities to police, I would also like to have some further conversation on the brief of evidence from Fair Work Australia and its transition to the next progressive path in the event of untoward activities. Furthermore, there is express provision to allow Fair Work Australia to provide a brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Again, given previous problems with this, it is important to include express powers to enable this to happen. It should be noted that these provisions are frankly unnecessary but need to be supported given the circumstances. As my colleague here in the chamber, the member for Ryan, recently asked: why has this bill come about? She asked that question in a previous speech. Why does the political wing of the union movement all of a sudden feel a stronger stance against corruption and misappropriation must be taken? Is it because it is the right and honest thing to do? Is it a proactive step to stamp out cynicism within the union movement? Is it to finally put unions on the level legislative playing field that their corporate equivalents are on and impose the same kind of punishments for infringements when the only difference is where the money is coming from? No, it is not. The government lacks the moral fortitude to do something like that. It is simply because they were shamed and embarrassed into some reaction by the scandals and disgraces of the Health Services Union that have plagued this government. It is because they have been shamed by the strong leadership demonstrated by Tony Abbott on the issue and the strong stance he is taking in bringing this situation to fore. The coalition is proposing eight amendments to improve the design of the bill and outcomes for workers. Most importantly we will create a new organisation to oversee the registered organisations. We suggest that setting up the organisation, as noted in the amendment, should be supported by the government. It is absolutely consistent with the government's position on the safe roads legislation; they appropriated $15 million to set up a tribunal to oversee so-called road fatalities and employment contracts in the transport workers' sector. So what we are asking for in our amendment has a precedent, and we would suggest that this government will and should support the amendments attached here. The coalition will seek to remove the responsibility of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia to ensure compliance and shift to a new, separate and independent body which will be called the Registered Organisations Commission. This commission will fall under the auspices of the office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. It will be able to use the Fair Work Ombudsman's network and resources where appropriate and will ultimately report and be answerable to the parliament. The coalition's amendments include provision that, should a report be delayed, the commission must report to the parliament and inform the parliament of why there is a delay. The time that Fair Work Australia took to process recent investigations was nothing less than shambolic. We must implement changes in legislation to shift away from a place where situations like that can ever be repeated in this country. The commission will also be responsible for educating registered organisations about the new obligations, and will be able to that receive complaints from members and the provide information about what they can do if there is a problem or a complaint. Just as there is a specific rule which applies to companies and board directors to ensure that they are doing the right thing, that rule should apply to registered organisations and their officers. So the coalition will move amendments to ensure that the penalties are the same as those applying to company directors and ensure that the Registered Organisations Commission has powers broadly in line with those provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. When we come into this House we often get bashed up about saying, 'No, no, no.' The reality is: 80 per cent of the legislation that goes through this place is unopposed.",132
261,Mr Tudge,BILLS,"It's 87 per cent, isn't it?",135
262,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS,"I have just been corrected by the member for Aston; 87 per cent of the legislation that goes through here is unopposed. We do support good legislation, but we will be the first to oppose bad legislation. One key amendment will seek to bring across section 184 of the Corporations Act into the registered organisations act. This would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to be reckless. The coalition's amendment will seek to further increase penalties, in line with the Corporations Act. Believe it or not, the penalties for comparable offences by the officials in registered organisations are almost non-existent. Similar obligations under sections 287 and 288 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 as to using information for personal advantage or causing detriment to an organisation are limited to civil penalties of $2,200 for an individual, and there are no criminal provisions. In conclusion, I believe that this is a poor bill that will not deal with the substantive issues born out of Fair Work Australia's investigations. It goes without saying that seemingly never-ending saga of Fair Work Australia's investigations into the Health Services Union has made it absolutely clear that major reform in this area is needed. However, I believe that the reform is needed in the management rather than the legislation. The assessment of the former Attorney-General, the Hon. MCClelland MP, in the submission by the Institute of Public Relations noting that there are areas of the bill that can be strengthened, is highly accurate. He commented: The bill is a step in the right direction. However, its reforms are modest and do not go far enough. Finally, without doubt this bill and the proposed coalition amendments are a sure method that will provide greater protection to Australians in the workplace. For too long, unions have escaped proper scrutiny and finally this has exploded with the investigation of the Health Services Union and the protracted investigation by Fair Work Australia. I commend this bill, and I commend the amendments- (Time expired)",135
263,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," There are only two reasons that we are here debating the bill in front of us, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. The first is the sheer stench surrounding the Craig Thomson affair. Such is the stench that it has embarrassed the government into taking some action against some of their mates in the trade union movement through this bill. More importantly, it is that the opposition put out a plan to actually tackle the problem with unregulated unions just 10 days before-the coalition's plan for better transparency and accountability of registered organisations. That is the real reason that we are here discussing this bill today: we put forward a proactive proposal to deal with some of the issues which were raised throughout the the Craig Thomson affair, and Labor is now rapidly trying to catch up. They are putting this bill forward so that they can pretend that they are also taking some action. But it is a good thing that we are taking some action, and it is a good thing that we are debating trade unions and how they are regulated, their transparency and the amount Robert of protection which is provided them in legislation. Frankly, at the moment, there is insufficient protection for union members, there is insufficient transparency and there are insufficient penalties applying to people who have breached the legislation. And the 1,200-page report of Fair Work Australia made this point very, very clearly-it found dozens upon dozens of examples of breaches of the law by the Health Services Union. Nearly every Australian would now be aware of some of these breaches, where thousands of dollars-indeed, hundreds of thousands of dollars-was misappropriated by union officials within the Health Services Union, for cash advances, for exorbitant travel, for fine dining for the union leaders and, of course, for escort services. In addition to this, almost $300,000 was appropriated by the Health Services Union for the election campaign of the now member for Dobell who, at the time, was the leader of the Health Services Union. It was very clear from that 1,200-page report that the regulations and transparency were not sufficient to capture some of those issues. Is this the only union where these practices are going on? We simply do not know. We do know that, for example, in the construction union, all sorts of unlawfulness was discovered by the Cole royal commission-it found over 100 breaches of the law, on building and construction sites, by the building and construction trade union. So clearly there is a case that the regulations which govern trade unions are insufficient. There is clearly a case that that is happening. We actually have bipartisan agreements that the current laws are insufficient. I am pleased to see Minister Combet here because he also agrees with this proposition that the existing laws are insufficient to properly regulate and provide protections for trade union members today. Where we do disagree, though, is on the plan put forward to tackle this issue. We believe that this the minister has put forward goes some of the way but not far enough and fails to deal with all of the issues which are uncovered and documented in the 1,200-page Fair Work Australia report. There are four key problems with this bill, which we believe need to be amended. Indeed, the coalition is putting forward amendments to deal with them. The first is that the bill before us still sees Fair Work Australia in control of investigating registered organisations. We simply believe that they are not up to the job to do that. We think that they have insufficient time and insufficient focus to do that. This was evidenced by the Fair Work Australia report into the Health Services Union. It took over three years to do the investigation. The report should have taken much less time than that. Furthermore, at the end of that 3½ years it was still not in a sufficient state for the police, the department or the Director of Public Prosecutions to be able to use it to action some of the egregious breaches which were outlined in that report. So Fair Work Australia is not the right body to properly regulate and scrutinise registered organisations. We believe there should be a separate independent expert body which does that. Consequently, we are putting forward an amendment which would suggest that a registered organisations commission be established which would oversee registered organisations and would have the teeth to be able to properly scrutinise them and properly see that trade unions are being held accountable to their membership. The second problem is that the bill does not expressly provide for Fair Work Australia the ability to cooperate with the police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that this be made absolutely clear in the bill. It must be made bill clear that Fair Work Australia must, in the appropriate circumstances, provide a brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions, if required. This should not be required, of course, in ordinary circumstances. In ordinary circumstances you would think that Fair Work Australia itself would actually go about doing the right thing and developing that brief of evidence to go to the Director of Public Prosecutions. But, again, the case of the Health Services Union proves that we in fact do need to make this part of legislation, because they spent 3½ years investigating this case and yet still did not provide the proper brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Furthermore, they did not cooperate with the police throughout that 3½ years of the investigation, despite the predecessor body to Fair Work Australia expressly recommending the day before Fair Work Australia was established that it should in fact put the Craig Thomson affair to the police. But they did not. We think that is disgraceful. We therefore think that there needs to be separate legislation to properly specify this in the relevant legislation which governs trade unions. Third, the requirements and the penalties in this bill are still not in line with the Corporations Act. We think there should be a simple principle enacted in this legislation. That simple principle is that what is good for corporations is good for trade unions. In relation to penalties, for example, if the actions which were taken by the Health Services Union officials in the Craig Thomson affair occurred inside a company then individual directors may have been criminally liable for some of those things, may have had a $200,000 personal fine and could have landed in jail for up to five That is what occurs in the Corporations Act with the sort of egregious behaviour that we saw inside the Health Services Union. But underneath the Fair Work Australia act the penalty is up to $2,200. So you can appropriate hundreds of thousands of dollars and you can spend union members' money on prostitutes, on cash withdrawals or on your re-election campaign and the penalty is $2,200. And it is a civil penalty only. We should be listening to Mr MCClelland, the former Attorney-General, as well, who suggests that actually, if people are found guilty of such an offence, not only should they suffer greater penalties in line with the Corporations Act but also they should have to repay that money-because it is often the money of the lowest paid workers in the country that we are talking about which the trade union leaders are misappropriating for their own purposes. We do not think that is good enough. Consequently, we are putting forward amendments to bring the penalties in line with the Corporations Act. This also goes to the issue of transparency and basic fiduciary obligations. Everybody knows that if you are a company director or a company executive you have to outline exactly where the money is being spent by a company. Executive remuneration is transparent and other measures are transparently laid out in relation to the company's accounts. We also know that company directors have to operate under fiduciary obligations. That is, they have legal obligations to act in the best interests of their company shareholders. Again, we think the trade union leaders should equally have to follow those basic guidelines. We will, again, move amendments to ensure this. My final criticism is that the bill before us has no reporting mechanism on why investigations are going over time. It should not, frankly, have to take almost four years years. for an investigation to occur, with no explanation as to why it is taking almost four years. An egregious abuse of members' money should not have to take four years to investigate. It should only be a relatively short process. It should be done expediently and, if there are delays in the investigation, there should be a public statement as to why there are such delays. That, again, is a measure which we are putting forward. In conclusion, this bill gives the perception, the pretence, that the government are concerned about corrupt practices inside trade unions, but it is just that-a pretence. They are not fair dinkum about how they are regulating trade unions through this bill. The measures do not stack up against how companies are regulated and how company directors are held accountable. The measures do not stack up in relation to transparency, and we believe that they should. The measures do not stack up in relation to the proper penalties which apply to company directors, and they should equally apply to trade union officials. Finally, the measures do not stack up in regard to the independence of the authority which has regulatory oversight of trade unions, as there indeed is an independent body which oversees the regulations governing corporations. We are pleased that we are debating this, but we are putting forward serious amendments which we believe the government should enact. They should adopt those amendments. They would strengthen the bill and give confidence to all Australians and to all union members that their money is being protected and is being used wisely by the union leaders.",136
264,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:39): When I introduced this bill I confirmed that this government believes in a free and independent trade union movement. We believe in the advocacy of employer organisations on behalf of their members. We believe in the accountability of these registered organisations to their members. I thank the representatives of employer organisations who, unlike those opposite, have seen fit to support our bill in its entirety. I thank the trade unions who have worked with the government as well to develop this legislation through the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council. Together we have achieved a rare feat in the workplace relations space-consensus. This consensus on the key elements of the bill was achieved without compromising the core principles underpinning the government's policy position. These principles are: respect for the role played by trade unions and employer organisations in our society and our workplace relations system; respect for the members who are entitled to expect that their interests remain the primary motivating factor for these organisations; and strong compliance with the rules of organisations as well as the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act for improved rule structures, better investigation powers and procedures with Fair Work Australia for a tripling of penalties for breaches. I would also thank those members of this place who have spoken in favour of this bill, including those on the cross benches. Unlike others in this debate who have sought to smear and malign the trade union movement with innuendo and false charge, I have been and this government have been consistent in their approach to recent events involving compliance with the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. We have consistently stated our view, but the Fair Work investigations must be allowed to conclude without political interference. Fair Work Australia is an institution independent of the executive. We do not resile from the fact that the reports by the delegate of the general manager of Fair Work Australia into the HSU Victoria No. 1 branch and the HSU national office contain serious and disturbing material, which we have said in fairness to the members should be tested in the courts. We have also made it clear that the members of trade unions and employer organisations are entitled to expect that their membership fees will be used for their benefit. Whilst we were doing this, I have to report to the House that those opposite have tied themselves in knots repeatedly contradicting themselves in an identifying spectacle of politicking. They have on one hand accused the government of political interference with Fair Work Australia, but then on the other hand have called upon us to intervene. They have accused, at different times, Fair Work Australia of being part of a political conspiracy, of administrative incompetence and debacle, and of delaying the release of the report for political ends. But then, when they read the report, they praised it as thorough, respected and methodical, and relied upon the content as unquestionable fact even though it had not been subject to cross-examination. They fell over themselves raising pseudo quasi-legal arguments to criticise the actions of the general manager. They then refused to acknowledge the basic tenet of our legal system and our democracy that allegations of actions contrary to law can and should be tested and determined within our court system. Let me quote to you examples uttered by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. On 31 January this year at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition said the following about Fair Work Australia's investigation: I just make the point that as things stand, looks like an institutional go-slow to help the government. That was a convenient message at the end of January, but later after the report had been released on 23 May the Leader of the Opposition described the same investigation as: … a very long and very thorough and very meticulous and, I think, highly professional investigation. So, there you have it. On 31 January the report is 'an institutional go-slow' and on 23 May it is amazing stuff. It is a convenient message he takes whenever it suits him in order to undermine unions and the interests of working people. We in the government, however, have remained consistent throughout; the coalition has not. It is as simple as that in this debate about reform of registered organisations laws. This is the difference between us and those opposite when it comes to workplace relations. We make things happen, we get things done and we act in the interests of those we represent. We do not do and say things for the sake of being negative to obtain power. Most importantly, we do not keep our industrial relations policies a secret. We do not encourage the Australian voters to play hide-and-seek with our industrial relations policies. Those opposite work on the basis that the public will never find out what the coalition think until the actual election is conducted and over, just like they did in 2004. We have seen this time and time again with the opposition. They will not debate workplace relations, the full panorama of all the issues which affect all the Australian people that go to work every day. Of course, the Australian people do deserve better. On 26 April this year, I took the difficult decision to intervene in proceedings before this the Federal Court to apply for the appointment of an administrator to the East Branch of the Health Services Union. That branch covers workers in the health services sector in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. In explaining that decision, I said: “I am particularly concerned that the interests of HSU members across Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT are not being properly served by the current dysfunction within the HSU East Branch.” “My intervention is to ensure the broader public interest in working Australians having effective and accountable union representation is not undermined.” I also said at the time that the decision: … was taken to provide for the HSU to function into the future …  meeting the expectations and in the interests of HSU members;  sustainably and in a proper and democratic way; and  in accordance with its statutory obligations, including those set out in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. Eight weeks later, the process of fixing this part of the Health Services Union is well underway. The Federal Court has already determined that there is sufficient dysfunction within this part of the Health Services Union and appointed an interim administrator to the HSU East Branch and HSU East, the New South Wales registered union. I thank the Hon. Michael Moore for agreeing to act in the position of administrator. On 8 May I gave a press conference in response to the release of the report by the delegate of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia into the Health Services Union national office. During that press conference I made it clear that: … the other unfortunate consequence is that this process has cast some doubts about the transparency and accountability of the broader trade union movement. I believe that the problems which are reported in parts of the Health Services Union are not representative of the actions of the broader Union Movement. I believe what we see here is the action of a few individuals, not the Trade Union Movement. The government therefore committed to: … taking wide ranging action to improve Fair Work Australia's investigative processes … to enhance the accountability and transparency of registered organisations … strengthen associated penalties … and … introduce legislation to implement any recommendations from the KPMG Review into Fair Work Australia's investigative capacities, once this review is completed. Three weeks later, we delivered on these commitments and introduced the bill into this place-a bill that will improve financial training, transparency and disclosure by officials of registered organisations and by registered organisations to their members; improve the way that investigations into breaches of registered organisations provisions are conducted by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia; and introduce a threefold increase in civil penalties of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. Registered organisations play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace system. Registered organisations play a fundamental role in the Australian democracy. These are organisations created and registered for the purposes of representing Australian employers and employees. They have particular recognition under Australian workplace relations law by virtue of their representative status, and it is because of that registration that they have particular statutory obligations in relation to their operation, conduct and disclosure. Registered organisations are not regulated by the Corporations Act, and this is appropriate. Some in this debate-those sitting opposite, by and large-have argued that Corporations Act regulation should be applied to registered organisations. Others Trade have argued that penalties should be increased 100-fold. Again we see the politics of simplicity and negativity clouding the opposition. They should know that there are many similarities between the regulation of corporations and the regulation of registered organisations. Officers of organisations, like those of corporations, are subject to serious duties and obligations. For example, they must exercise care and diligence; they must act with good faith; and they must not improperly use their position for personal advantage. Further, the financial regulation of entities is similar. They are required to undertake regular reporting of their financial accounts. Auditors are required to sign off their books in accordance with accounting standards. They are subject to regulatory oversight, and the general powers of Fair Work Australia and ASIC are in fact similar. In addition, this bill uses corporations law concepts like related-party transactions. But we must also recognise that registered organisations and corporations are different creatures, both in practice and in law. The aims of the two entities are different. Corporations are designed to generate wealth and protect the financial interests of their shareholders. Organisations are established to represent the rights of their members, whether employers or employees, at work amongst other things. There has been a false debate here that, unless all unions are regulated exactly like corporations, somehow anything else is insufficient. Yet there are many different types of entities in this country that are regulated by different regulatory regimes that are appropriately suited to what they do and how they do it: charity organisations, not-forprofit organisations, partnerships and unincorporated associations, for example. This bill will improve the financial accountability and transparency of registered organisations. It will increase penalties for breaches threefold in line with those in the Fair Work Act. It will make sure that officials of organisations receive appropriate financial training. It will require the remuneration of highly paid officers, relatedparty transactions and material personal interests to be disclosed to the members. It will fix deficiencies in the current legislation-which was in fact introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, who was the relevant minister at the time-not least by now allowing Fair Work Australia to share relevant information with state law enforcement and regulatory agencies where it is appropriate to do so. This was one of the things which those opposite were pointing to when criticising the conduct of the Fair Work investigations into the HSU, and with this bill we are actually remedying the errors in drafting made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was minister for industrial relations. This is extremely important legislation, not entered into lightly, which should be supported by all members of this place. I should also add-when we talk about people who are supporting this-that, whilst the opposition appear to be choosing the path of negativity, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are both supporting this, as are the ACTU. In fact, some employer organisations have criticised us for going too far, such as the Master Plumbers Association. This bill has the support of the Business Council of Australia. So the stakeholders-the people who operate day to day-are unanimous in more supporting us, yet those opposite still persist with their old-fashioned remedy of union baiting. We want to make sure, on behalf of all those people in Australian society who are genuinely interested in the ongoing viability of registered organisations, that the registered organisations regulation operates in a way which ensures that organisations are accountable to their members. I commend this bill to the House.",139
265,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Farrer has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to. Question negatived. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.,142
266,Ms LEY,BILLS," by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (3): (1) Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 4, insert: 4A After section 288 Insert: 288A Good faith, use of position and use of information-criminal offences Good faith-officers (1) An officer of an organisation or a branch commits an offence if he or she: (a) is reckless; or (b) is intentionally dishonest; and fails to exercise his or her powers and discharge his or her duties: (c) in good faith in the best interests of the organisation; or (d) for a proper purpose. Penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both. Use of position-officers and employees (2) An officer or employee of an organisation or a branch commits an offence if he or she uses his or her position dishonestly: (a) with the intention of directly or indirectly gaining an advantage for himself or herself, or someone else, or causing detriment to the organisation; or (b) reckless as to whether the use may result himself or herself, or someone else, directly or indirectly gaining an advantage, or in causing detriment to the organisation.

(2) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (lines 15 and 16), omit the item, substitute: 8 Paragraph 306(1)(b) Repeal the paragraph, substitute: (b) in the case of an officer of an organisation-200 penalty units; or (c) in any other case-60 penalty units. (3) Schedule 1, item 9, page 4 (line 24), omit paragraph (1A)(b), substitute: (b) in the case of an officer of an organisation-100 penalty units; or (c) in any other case-30 penalty units. I make the point that the minister at the table talks about registered organisations being fair and accountable, but we in the coalition do not believe that this legislation makes them sufficiently accountable. I flagged in my speech in the second reading that the in coalition would move at the consideration in detail stage common sense amendments to make some improvements to this bill, separate from our amendments which were moved at the second reading stage. With respect to this group of amendments, the bill as drafted allows for Fair Work Australia to outsource fully an investigation to an outside body. The coalition believes that, while outside experts may be required on individual parts of an investigation, the independent statutory body should be the one to conduct and oversee the entire investigation. We have concerns that investigations being conducted by an outside entity the general manager sees fit would not allow for the proper accountability and oversight of investigations. So the coalition will move an amendment to ensure that investigations are actually conducted by Fair Work Australia, while leaving in the power for outside help to be brought in on individual parts of an investigation. In this way a full investigation of itself cannot be outsourced. We will seek to bring across into the Registered Organisations Act section 184 of the Corporations Act, which would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to behave in a reckless manner. Further, with the government's increases to the civil penalties the coalition will seek to increase penalties line with the Corporations Act. The coalition does not believe that the amendment that the government moves about disclosure of information to police is necessary because Fair Work Australia should at all times have the ability to cooperate fully with police as per advice published earlier this year by Stuart Wood SC. However, our amendment will make it abundantly clear that the general manager and staff of Fair Work Australia can cooperate fully with police at all stages of an investigation, including proactively providing information to police. As I said, we do not really believe we should need to make this amendment but we do so for the avoidance of doubt. The government's amendment in this area just does not go far enough to ensure that this cooperation will take place. While Fair Work Australia presently can provide information to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the government will allow a further disclosure to all directors of public prosecutions in Australia. However, we witnessed in Fair Work Australia's last referral an inability of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue the matters raised as they were not prepared in a brief of evidence. Fair Work Australia said that it could not prepare a brief of evidence because the legislation did not allow for it. This amendment will give Fair Work Australia the express power to prepare a brief of evidence should it need to. The government will require the publishing of information to members, including the pay, interests and expenses of senior officers. The coalition seeks to amend this provision so that the report to members, however it is provided, is also provided to Fair Work Australia within their existing in reporting requirements. The coalition believes it is important that the information is provided to Fair Work Australia to ensure that regulatory oversight on how union members' money is spent is absolutely spoton and accountable. The coalition feels that these amendments will only improve the bill. The only way to get the best possible outcome is for the next coalition government to implement our better plan for accountability and transparency of registered organisations, because only a coalition government can restore the hope, reward and opportunity that is so horribly missing under Labor's framework. I have spoken to a group of eight amendments. For the convenience of the House I have included my comments on all of those amendments but I am actually asking that amendments (1) to (3), as circulated in my name, be considered at this point of time.",143
267,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:57): For the sake of efficiency, I might deal with all of the amendments in my comments and then deal with them separately, seeing as the member for Farrer has spoken to all of them. At least, I will try to cover as much ground as I can in the five minutes. In reference to the coalition amendments (1) through to (3), there are already requirements in the legislation for officers to act with care and diligence, to act in good faith, and not to use their position improperly or use information that they have obtained through acting as an officer of an organisation improperly. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already prohibits members' money being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns, and our proposal does triple penalties for breaches of the registered organisations act. So let us be clear: the government does not condone officers of registered organisations or officers of corporations, or anyone in a position of trust or fiduciary duty, acting inappropriately, misusing funds that they are entrusted to manage or taking benefits they are not entitled to. There is nothing in the registered organisations act that prevents criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or someone engages in fraud. The registered organisations act prioritises the conclusion of criminal proceedings before civil penalties are issued in relation to the same conductthat is in sections 311 and 312. Indeed, the registered organisations act does not prevent criminal proceedings from being commenced even after civil penalties have been applied in relation to the same conduct. The argument that has been proposed to base these amendments upon is that registered organisations are identical to corporations. They simply are not. Registered organisations are not regulated by the Corporations Act, and this is appropriate. At no time, even in the Howard years, did the coalition government or any of its ministers ever propose saying that registered organisations are identical to corporationsclearly, a change in policy now. Some in this debate have argued that the Corporations Act regulations should be applied to registered organisations. Others have argued that penalties should be increased 100-fold. We believe that this argument is too negative and too simplistic. We do believe that officers of organisations, like those in corporations, are subject to serious duties and obligations. They must exercise care and diligence. They must act in good faith. They must not improperly use their position. We recognise that the financial regulation of these entities is similar. They are required to undertake regular reporting of the financial accounts. Auditors are required to sign off their books in accordance with accounting standards. They are subject to regulatory oversight. And the general powers of Fair Work Australia are similar to those of ASIC. In addition, this bill uses Corporations Law concepts like related party transactions. We must also recognise that registered organisations and corporations are different creatures, both in practice and in law. The aims of the two entities are different. It is a false debate to say that unions or employer associations are identical to corporations. That has never been in the jurisprudence of this nation, and the case has not been made to change that policy in that way. If you accept what the opposition says, that unions and employer associations should be treated identically to corporations, then why stop there? Do you argue that St Vincent de Paul, who hold significant financial interests, should have the same laws apply to them as apply to BHP Billiton? Should Telstra be regulated in the same way as the toy makers union? Should Coles have the same rules apply as an unincorporated partnership running a bookshop? We do not believe that the case for these amendments has been made. We believe that the hazards which the opposition are concerned about are adequately catered for in the propositions that are being advanced.",144

275,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:15): by leave-I move: That the resolution relating to the time and order of business for Tuesday, 26 June 2012 agreed to earlier today, be amended by omitting 12 noon wherever it appears and substituting 9 am. It is intended for the information of members that at 9 am tomorrow we will have a vote on the motion moved by the member for Bradfield, which relates to the anniversary of the terrorist act that occurred at the Munich Olympics. It is important that vote takes place prior to the Olympic Games being held in London. The motion was a request made by the Manager of Opposition Business, which the government was happy to support. Therefore, that vote will take place first and then we will have debate on other bills, on which there are long speaking lists, in order to facilitate the timely exit we hope to achieve in accordance with the schedule that has been set down for later this week. I thank the House.  Opposition Business) (18:16): opposition is grateful that the Leader of the House has agreed to ensure that the motion on the murder of the Israeli athletes at Munich 40 years ago is voted on before the Olympics actually begin. It has bipartisan support. I understand that the member for Isaacs and the member for Melbourne Ports as well as coalition MPs will speak on this motion to support it. The Leader of the House and I and many other MPs have jointly signed advertising to support this particular motion because this kind of issue should be well above partisan politics. We have also agreed between us that we sit from 9 am to 2 pm tomorrow in unusual circumstances given it is the last week of this session and sometimes it can spill over to the last day. We are all working and we hope the Senate will also see, within their infinite wisdom, the benefits of finishing on Thursday rather than sitting on Friday. Question agreed to. NA Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",149
276,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," I rise to speak on both the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill and the Income Tax Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill. This is the second time the government has introduced this bill of into the parliament, following its stunning The backflip on this issue last week. What an extraordinary moment. Last week this exact provision the government excised from the bill, only to reintroduce exactly the same provision the following day-with no explanation. Unless the member for New England or the member for Lyne or the member for Kennedy or anyone else has an explanation, there is no explanation from the government as to why it dumped it last week and is this week. Last week the government moved an amendment to its own bill to excise the doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July this year. That move followed reports that the government was unable to gain the support of the Greens-and that only came about because the Minister for Finance, Senator Wong, in the Senate accidentally let slip that when they could not get the support of the Greens on this proposal they decided to excise it from the TLAB bill. So now the government is reintroducing the measure. This is the third budget measure the government has now shown signs of backing down on. Why else would the government excise it from the TLAB last week? The first budget backdown was the government's decision to re-embrace the dumped company tax cut from budget night, which the Prime Minister now says is a priority-but does not have the money for. Secondly, the government backed away from the ongoing CPI increases to the passenger movement charge. Thirdly, just last week, the government backed away from its doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July 2012. That said, the coalition welcomed the backdown on the increase to the withholding tax on managed investment trusts. We thought it was something more significant. The Tourism and Transport Forum said the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts 'will go some way to restoring foreign investor confidence'. Unfortunately, this backdown was not before the government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the MIT withholding tax. This again reduced our predictability in the eyes of international investors. The Tourism and Transport Forum reintroducing it went on to say: While some damage has been done to Australia's reputation as an investment destination, the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate will help to restore investor confidence and renew interest in Australian tourism projects. So the tourism taskforce is in exactly the same position as we are. You can imagine where international investors are at. We do not know what the government are planning. The government originally announced that they were reducing the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 30 per cent down to 7½ per cent, so they had a one-way trend. Then they announced on budget night that they were going to increase it from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, which came as a shock to people, because investors had worked on the basis that there was a trend towards a lower level of tax. But then the flipside came last week, when the government simply removed it from one of their own bills, suggesting that they were now dumping the proposal in the face of our opposition and the opposition of a vast array of investors, only to reintroduce it again last Thursday and to rush through debate today. It is like groundhog day; this proposal has come back. Well, the opposition is going to be entirely consistent. We will oppose this measure on the grounds that it unquestionably heightens sovereign risk perceptions of Australia and the change will have an adverse impact on infrastructure investment. The only thing consistent about this government is its inconsistency. It is the constant backflips, the twists and the turns that are creating the sovereign risk. In these pretty tough global economic conditions the government should be doing all it can to be stable and predictable. Unfortunately there numerous examples where businesses are concerned about the sovereign risk that has developed towards Australia as a result of this government. Ivan Glasenberg is the Chief Executive Officer of Glencore, which is currently in the middle of one of the biggest takeovermergers in global history, with its attempt to take over Xstrata, which has a massive amount of investment here in Australia. Ivan Glasenberg said in London a few weeks ago: At least in the Congo they need you, they want you there and if they start changing the rules on you, you may not continue investing. …… … So Australia does have its risk, yes. We saw the carbon tax, we saw the mineral resource tax. a First World country but is doing things that making people cautious of investing, so Australia is becoming another country where you have got to make sure that the rules aren't going to change on you. Ivan Glasenberg is saying that not as an outsider looking in, even though he lives overseas. He is also saying it as an Australian citizen. At the dispatch box earlier today the Prime Minister was saying that it is the negativity of the opposition that is causing consternation. No, it is the incompetence of the Prime Minister, the incompetence of this government, that is causing consternation out there. We did not write Ivan Glasenberg's speech. We did not write the words of David Knox, Chief Executive Officer of Santos, when he said: Governments must recognise what we all know … that investment in oil and gas is not a shortterm game, but one based on a long-term outlook with returns over the long-term. With such massive capital investment and therefore risk up-front, long-term investors like those in the oil and gas industry need stable, are predictable, long-term rules. My clear message to the Australian Government is: do not create uncertainty. Instead provide our investors with the confidence in Australia as a stable fiscal and regulatory region-allow us to stay competitive. 'Allow us to stay competitive'-that is what they are saying. Jack Nasser, Chairman of BHP and former global chief executive of Ford, who is on a number of global boards, including News Corporation, said: I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction. People don't know where it's going. Here Jack Nasser is talking about the It is uncertainty coming out of Australia. These are are people that have a propriety interest in the welfare of Australia, and they are saying, 'Hang on, why is Australia so unstable? Why are you making it harder for us to get global investment, to create jobs in Australia? Why are you doing this?' John Stanhope, former Chief Financial Officer at Telstra and Director of AGL Energy, said: … people looking outside at Australia think we're a sovereign risk because of the uncertainty created by policy fluctuation. The difference is in the two parties, and that is very real. It struck me to hear from people who normally give Telstra a lot of money, 'No, we are not interested anymore.' To get rid of that uncertainty is very important. In 2008, as I said earlier, this government moved to reduce the rate of withholding tax on managed investment trusts progressively from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, a move which was not opposed by the coalition. But we did ask the question about whether the government was really committed to it. At the time, we expressed concerns that the reduction in the withholding tax rate was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers due to the operation of double taxation agreements. Any reduction in taxation paid in Australia may simply have led to higher taxes being paid in other jurisdictions. We expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny, as the government did not allow the bill to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics at the time. We raised serious concerns that the government's costings for the measure may have been underestimated. Today the government may try to use the previous arguments of the coalition against us in the current debate, in the context of the current economic climate, including potential significant reductions in foreign investment and employment in the construction sector, the coalition does not view this as an appropriate time for the government to be doubling withholding tax on potential sources of investment that will help to drive economic growth and job creation. Continual change to our international taxation arrangements, coupled with the government's retrospective tax grabs on a variety of legislation, reduces international investor confidence and elevates concerns about our sovereign risk profile. This instability in the government is creating greater uncertainty for investors and it is leaving Australian consumers, as well as Australian businesses, confused. There is a myriad of examples where the government says one thing and does another. As an example, I note an issue on which I have been criticised, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government has said it is absolutely committed to the NDIS-so committed, in fact, that it is going to bring forward, and accelerate, the implementation of the NDIS. The government is going to speed it up and, instead of committing $3.9 billion over the first three years, it is in fact only committing $1 billion. When I said it was a cruel hoax for the government to be claiming to speed up implementation of the NDIS when it was in fact massively underfunding it, people said: 'How dare you!' for saying that. 'How dare you suggest the government is not committed to it! How dare you suggest there is not bipartisan support!' There is bipartisan support on the NDIS. However, buried in the last paragraph on page 3 of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer's economic note that was published on Sunday, after three of the four headings, the government seemed to be boasting about but its achievements in this regard. The Treasurer said: That's been the focus of Labor since day one, it's been the focus of Julia Gillard since she became prime minister two years ago, and it's remained our focus as we've gone about getting the big reforms in placeThey love talking about big reforms. Everything is big, huge, monstrouseverything is enormous. that will set us up for the future, like the pricing of carbon pollution, like introducing the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, like giving consumers a better deal in the banking system, and like beginning the long road towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme. 'The long road towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme.' I could have sworn it was a shortened road, because the government said that it was going to fast track the NDIS. The government was going to bring it forward. But what had become a fast track to bring forward the NDIS is now turning into 'the beginning of a long road' towards the NDIS. My goodness! Even the Prime Minister sought to list the NDIS as an achievement, and now, buried deep in the Treasurer's own economic note-which goes out on a Sunday-it is a long road to deliver that NDIS. I wonder if the government is going to be here long enough to travel that long road. Perhaps it is like the original version of The Wizard of Oz, which I have just been reading to my children. I can tell you that the version is a rather lengthy book-Dorothy seems to cross a lot of roads to get to Oz. I think the Labor Party's commitment to an NDIS is as topsy and turvy, and as wavy, and as fragile as Dorothy's trip along the yellow brick road, in its original version-which is sad, because in all of this the government is playing with people's hopes. The Labor Party is hoping that people will ignore the travails of an incompetent government, but they cannot. Whether it be on social or health policy issues-like the NDIS; like the great big health reforms that the government said it was going to deliver as former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sought to take over the hospitals and to form a joint partnership that is now mired in red tape; or like the national curriculum that the government has sought to claim as an achievement and that three years later still has not been rolled out-or on economic policy issues, like the bills before the House at this moment, this is a government that is inconsistent. It is a government that is fundamentally flawed in its ability to run an economy and to run a society. It is a government that does not know whether it is Arthur or Martha, whether it is Wayne or Wendy, or whether it is Julia or John. But what I know, and what my colleagues know and what, I am sure, the Australian people know, is that this is a government that is not fit for office and that the Labor Party has truly lost its way. It has never recovered from the events of just over two years ago and, if you want a single contemporary illustration of the incompetence of the government, you need look no further than these bills that are before the House.",149
277,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I spoke in relation to this particular legislation last week, from memory, on schedule 4. I rise to original speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. These bills implement a budget measure. We announced a particular measure in the budget that would lift the withholding tax rate applied to distributions for managed investments, to residents of a country that Australia had a tax information exchange agreement with, from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, and it is commencing from 1 July 2012. The information I have received is that there is a total impact on the budget of about $260 million in revenue over the forward estimates. It is a not inconsiderable amount of money in relation to this measure, and it is part of our framework for ensuring that the budget gets back to surplus. The 15 per cent rate is still competitive with rates applying in other countries and brings us into line with the US, Canada, Hong Kong and the UK. For the information of those people who may be listening, in the UK the withholding treatment of distributions from MITs in relation to nonresidents is about 20 per cent and that rate may be reduced under certain treaties. In Japan it is 20 per cent generally and seven per cent for individuals listed in REITs, lifted to 15 per cent in 2014 unless extended. In South Korea, our fourth biggest trading partner, it is 22 per cent; in the United States, 30 per cent; in Canada, 25 per cent; in Belgium, 15 per cent; and in the Netherlands, 15 per cent. So when you look at what is happening around the world it is not unreasonable for our rate to be at 15 per cent. The coalition have had every position possible in relation to this measure. When the coalition were in power, the rate was 30 per cent. It was an election commitment of ours back in 2007 to reduce the rate to 15 cent, and we did that as part of our proposals to ensure more investment in this country and to make Australia a financial services and investment hub. The coalition have on numerous occasions criticised us over reducing it from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. They tried to refer the measure to the Senate Economics Committee for review but it did not vote against it. In the parliamentary debate they criticised the reduction to 7½ cent, claiming it was a broken promise because it was a greater reduction than we had said we would do in the 2007 campaign. The interesting question is what they would do if they returned to the treasury bench. If they are fair dinkum about opposing the increase to 15 per cent, then us see them commit themselves to reversing that position. Let us see them make any public statements about that. Let us see them come clean about the issue. To date, they have not. If they are not going to do that, how are they going to save the $260 million across the forward estimates? What particular services in education, health and the like are they going to cut? How are they going to pay for it? Once again we see the coalition generally prepared to accept expenditure that we announce, rarely in support of the budget savings measures that we pursue and often against the revenueraising measures that we undertake to make sure the budget is back in surplus and we have a viable budgetary position as a government. From opposite we hear the nay-sayers and doomsayers. We heard the shadow treasury spokesperson talk down the economy and talk about sovereign risk. For heaven's sake! When we have government debt at about a 10th of the average in the OECD, inflation in the band expected by the Reserve Bank, per interest rates much lower than they were under the Howard coalition government and unemployment at around five per cent, to go on about sovereign risk is simply a nonsense. We are talking about budget legislation that deals with about $260 million across the forward estimates. It flies in the face of all the economic indications and includes about half a billion dollars in investments in the mining sector alone-in coal, iron ore et per cetera-in states such as Western Australia and Queensland, my home state. If this is such a terrible measure that we are undertaking, you would expect the coalition, if they have any consistency, to come into this place and say where they would save the money, and they would let eventually have to come into this place with a consistent policy. When we announced at one stage that we were going to cut the tax, the then doyen of economic responsibility for those opposite, the then Treasurer, called it a 'tax cut for foreigners'. We have had all kinds of positions on this matter from those opposite. They certainly have not been consistent in any way, shape or form. Even today there is umbrage and unction from those opposite but little evidence as to what their position is, except to say-as they traditionally do in this place-a simple no. Once again, I would like to know where they stand on this particular issue. I would like them to get rid of the histrionics, hysteria and hyperbole, and the over-the-top theatrics from the shadow Treasurer, that we see so often-designed in part to hide their embarrassment that we reduced the tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. Last week we saw grandiose statements and claims about us withdrawing this measure, and I think there is a degree of embarrassment from those opposite now that we have reintroduced it so quickly. This is a sensible savings measure. It is consistent with the Henry review recommendations on location-specific rents. The government made the sensible commitment to bring the budget back to surplus and we are determined to do that on time and as promised. We are committed to making sure that the economy is strong and that we govern in a consistent way that gives certainty and security for those people who want to invest in this country. That is always the case: if the government keeps changing the rules and the laws and is inconsistent, then those who are in business are always worried about what might happen. This is particularly important legislation. Those opposite have no consistency, and they have form on this issue: every sensible savings measure they block, or they pretend that they can find savings but they never articulate them. I think what they are doing here is simply adding to that $70 billion black hole which the shadow finance minister has admitted they have and the shadow Treasurer has also said they have. So this is another $260 million that they can add to that. If they want to be consistent, them come into this place tonight and support savings and our revenue-raising measures. Be consistent; do not just spend. We know on this side of politics that we have been prudent with respect to revenue to the government. There is a lower tax-to-GDP ratio now than there was at any time under the Howard coalition government. All they did was engage in middle-class welfare, tax and spend. That was the Howard coalition government. There were rivers of gold coming in, but it was squandered and not invested in infrastructure and the kinds of things that lift productivity in places like Western Australia and Queensland. I support this legislation. I think it is prudent. It is part of the government's overall strategy. It is consistent with the majority recommendations of the economics committee of this House. If those opposite would ditch the word 'irresponsibility' and add 'responsibility' to their economic framework and policy, they would support it as well.",153
278,Mr KATTER,BILLS," I speak in praise of the shadow Treasurer when he criticises the government for changing the goalposts. I think that it is right for our overseas investors to have faith in the Australian government. Having said that, we are never going to be able to change anything if we take that principle to its logical conclusion. We would never be able to change anything. So I take the shadow Treasurer's remarks, but I think that you cannot just apply that rule to every single potential initiative by governmentotherwise, we would never be able to take an initiative. One of the many reasons that I am aggro to the ALP-NLP corporation that runs this place is that you have a management coup every six or seven years, it would appear. then let Having said that, I take the shadow Treasurer's argument. It is a valid argument and I praise him for putting it forward. But I have also got to say that you have to make some changes. We have this extraordinary situation where Australian companies pay 30 per cent tax, but foreign corporations only pay, I think, 17 per cent tax. It is an extraordinary anomaly. You say, yes, but the agreement is that our companies in America pay only 17 per cent tax and then they have to pay the rest of it when they come back to Australia. How many companies do we own in America? How many do they own in Australia? This is a very lopsided deal, a very, very lopsided arrangement. It needs to be clawed back, and part of the clawing back is happening here today. From an overseas investor's point of view, this place is dreamland-and not dreamland in so far as being the land of dreams-it is paradise. You only have to pay 17 per cent interest. You have high interest rates and you can absolutely guarantee that the dollar is going to continue to ascend. You know that the ALP-NLP corporation that runs the country is very, very committed to the idea that overseas financiers should be given a rails run. Just look at your country. The supine attitude of the last government and the current government has resulted in many of our resources being foreign owned. Fifteen years ago all of Australia's great mining companies were Australian ownedBHP, Western Mining Corporation, Normandy and Mount Isa Mines were all Australian owned. Eighty-five per cent of our mineral resources were under those great mining companies and all were Australian owned. Now they are all foreign owned. The second biggest agricultural industry in this country is dairying and every single factory in Australia was Australian owned prior to deregulation in the year 2000. Now all the giant corporations in the dairy industry except Murray-Goulburn are foreign owned. All of our sugar mills with the exception of Mackay Sugar are foreign owned. Our airlines were all totally Australian owned and, thanks to the machinations of the head of Qantas and the board of Qantas, clearly, Qantas is going to be divided up into five companies and four those companies will be foreign owned. Is there anything that Australia still owns? Is there any significant company in this country that is still Australian owned? If there is, do not tell me about, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Symon, because, if the overseas corporations find out, it will not be Australian owned for very long-that is for certain. In this place we hear a lot about Moody's and Standard & Poor's. They do not run this country and their track record is absolutely appalling. I would urge Treasury officials, if they are sitting in the House here, to go and get out the three books on Enron. Standard & Poor's and Moody's and all the rest of them told us that Enron was a great, stable and wonderful company, just two months before Enron fell over, owing their shareholders and their creditors $64,000 million. They only made a little mistake-$64,000 million in one corporation. It is an infinitely more complicated situation with governments. I am very worried about a tendency that governments have when they skite about not spending money. I belong to the biggest borrowing government in Australia's history. We did not borrow, as the current LNP government in Queensland is doing, to build pleasure domes in George Street-the parliamentary precinct-as the current newly appointed LNP government is doing in Queensland. We did not do that. We spent the money on building a railway line out to the middle of nowhere where there is a whole stack of coal reserves because a bloke called Les Thiess reckoned he could sell the coal to Japan. We did our homework and we reckoned he could, so we borrowed a king's ransom in money and spent it building that coal line. We had no guarantee of anyone using that line. They might have signed some agreements but they were only as good as the company. If the company fell over, we would have, so we took huge risks and we built this giant port at Gladstone, one of the six biggest ports in the world in that it could take 200,000-tonne vessels. There were only six ports in the world that could take 200,000-tonne vessels. Not stopping there, we built one of the four biggest power stations in the world so we could have the cheapest electricity in the world. We gave those Utah coalminers a rail run, and we had a small clause which gave us the overburden coal. We drove this giant economies of scale power station on free coal because of the cunning deal we had done. We built a power station that we did not need. There were no users there for that power station. It was a huge risk that the great Ron Camm, who was more of a mentor than even my father, took in building that power station. He said, 'If we have the cheap electricity, the aluminium industry will come.' It was a huge risk. If they had gone bad with coal or aluminium they would have been annihilated as a government. Heaven only knows, they were ripped into continuously, all the time. They borrowed, spent all this money and put the state into hock. Yes, but the money was not spent on buying votes. Most of the expenditures in this place really amount to buying votes. You can say that the spending makes life more easy and more attractive for people. Well, we were hard people-13 of our cabinet had cut cane by hand as young men. We were not used to all the leisures and pleasures of life. We were used to making sacrifices, saving our money and investing it in the future in productivity. We now spend $23,000 million every year, and three of the people on the boards of the superannuation companies that spend that money have been into see me. They say, 'All we are doing is pumping up the balloon.' I say to Treasury, to ASIC and to all these other people who are supposed to be the prudential controllers, 'Don't you see that you are blowing up a balloon?' All of that $23,000 million is being spent on realty and on the share market and it is just blowing it up. There is nothing behind it at all, except the $23,000 million that is going to be invested next year. There is nothing actually being produced at all, and in the meantime we say, 'Oh, we have to get money from overseas to open up our coal mines and our iron mines.' There was a 60-40 rule with superannuation in the days when I sold superannuation. I made a lot of money out of it, too. God bless all the people that I worked for, my clients. Sixty per cent of that money went into government securities, so what happened in 1998 and again with the GFC and things like the collapse of Storm Financial could not have happened under us. Sixty per cent of that money was government guaranteed. Let me give you just one example. You introduce ethanol, and then you know you have a market in Australia for ethanol. So you can go and put the money up to build a big dam to put in giant new sugar mill. It is going to produce ethanol and you know you have a market for it, and you have a guaranteed price because it is backed up by petrol prices throughout the world. It is a dwindling resource and will constantly increase in price. You know you have a beautiful lay-down misere investment here. Say the investment is in the dam and the delivery canal. Maybe we do not grow ethanol; we grow something else. But the government is in the position to be able to guarantee that sort of investment within reason. I sit beneath a picture of the great Jack MCEwen. He had many great sayings, but the one I liked best was that government is about getting it right and education is no replacement for hard work in getting it right. Sir Leo Hielscher put in time and effort and energy, and all those bridges across the Brisbane River are named after him. He was a very great man. He took risks as the Secretary of Treasury in Queensland with his advice to the government. There were the risks that men like Bjelke-Petersen and Ron Camm took. We are yielding the benefit of those to this very day. For the last 30 years the economy of this nation has been carried by the coal industry and the aluminium industry and they were both put there by huge risks being taken in investment. Sir Leo Hielscher was offered the Reserve Bank three times and offered the World Bank position once. He said: 'We did not really take a risk. We always knew that the aluminium would come. We always knew that we would be able to sell coal to Japan.' He could say that afterwards, but at the time. I am sure he was sweating a little. We have this huge resource of the $23,000 million. Why are we giving a free kick to every foreign corporation? I am very pleased to see the Treasurer moving today to take some of that money back. Mistakes have been made in the past. One of the ways of rectifying that is to get some of that money back through measures like the one he is moving tonight. I will be backing it even though I think we should all listen to what the shadow Treasurer said this evening as well. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (18:59): In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 it is, as the shadow Treasurer said, a bit like groundhog day. The substance of these bills was included in separate tax law amendment bills last week. Those changes, which see a doubling of the relevant withholding tax from 7½ to 15 per cent, were announced suddenly on budget night. As the shadow Treasurer quite rightly pointed out, in so many respects this tax legislation before House-yet again, as it turns out-sums up so much about the incompetence of this government, and not just on taxation policy. It really encapsulates and symbolises the government's failure to govern, and how its incompetence, at so many levels, creates a lack of confidence in the investment community. It leverages sovereign risk, as the shadow Treasurer so rightly said, and these tax bills really sum it up, on the second anniversary of the government's sudden change of Prime Minister. It is worth recounting some of the history on this as a window into the damage the government's approach on taxation matters is doing, specifically with regard to these bills. As I pointed out last week, four years ago in June 2008 the government legislated with great fanfare that it was reducing the relevant tax rate in this legislation down to 7½ per cent. That had been announced in Labor's first budget, and following the then Assistant Treasurer, the member for Prospect, speaker after speaker on the other side lauded the reduction to 7½ per cent and pointed out that the reduction was designed to send a signal to international investors. Of course, it follows that the sudden decision to double to 15 per cent the relevant rate also sends a signal. It sends a signal that this government cannot be trusted on matters of tax. This is the government that four years ago made so much of reducing the rate to 7½ per cent and then suddenly, in the budget, doubled that rate. The signal it sends is that this a government that cannot be trusted. This is a government that will chop and change. This is a government, as we have seen, that will say before an election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government it leads,' to paraphrase, and after the election introduces one. This is a government that out of the blue produces a mining tax. The message overseas, with the Labor the government in Australia pricing our investment, is that investors must now take into account that taxes will increase suddenly. In luring investment here by sending that signal, which those opposite spoke so proudly about four years ago, it will have a retrospective effect. But on top of that it also has the effect of saying there is a sovereign risk of sudden changes. We do not need to take my word or the word of the shadow Treasurer on this matter. As I outlined in the debate last week, there are so many leaders in their fields representing international investors who made this very point just after the budget. We have had those statements quoted in this House about how very directly indeed the government's decision meant that investors would think twice in the future about the sorts of investments they made. Just last Friday respected commentator Jennifer Hewett, from the Australian Financial Review, made this very point. Jennifer Hewett summed up so many of the quotes that had been put into the debate through the course of last week when she wrote: Labor has developed an unenviable reputation for its willingness to change tax rates and structures for investments. This completely undercuts faith in the permanence of reforms that do occur … My friend and colleague the member for Wright, who will speak after me, knows that of all the quotes that members of this side, including myself, put forward, those statements by Jennifer Hewett in the Australian Financial Review last Friday sum up the words and the sentiment of the reaction. What it says is if you send a signal by reducing the rate to 7½ per cent you surely send an opposite signal by doubling it. You surely send a signal that when it comes to investment in Australia sudden tax changes are the order of the day. The shadow Treasurer rightly referred to the events of last week and I want to refer to them, too, because the way the government has gone about the doubling of this tax also leverages uncertainty. Suddenly, in the budget, as I said earlier in my contribution, the government doubled the rate to 15 per cent. Then we had the tax law amendment bill last week that included in, from memory, schedule 4 the very measure we are debating now. But without any announcement whatsoever the government tabled an amendment to simply delete that schedule. As the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out, the initial reaction from industry was: 'They must have backed down. They must have seen sense.' That was the reaction from industry and some of the people the shadow Treasurer quoted. But, of course, the real point is that there was not any word from the government. There was no announcement from the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer-not only was there no announcement; there was no explanation at all. The debate in Hansard of, I think, last Wednesday sums up the chaos that afflicts this government when it comes to taxation policy. You had an amendment before the House during the debate-let me give them a little wiggle room; maybe it was a minute or two before the debate began-but no announcement, just an amendment to delete the schedule that would give effect to what had been announced on budget night. When it came to the summing up and the consideration in detail of the bill, in concluding his five-minute speech the shadow Treasurer asked the Assistant Treasurer on three separate occasions, three times in a row, what the position was. It was greeted by silence. The Assistant Treasurer was absolutely mute. Here was a minister of the Crown in here handling legislation where an amendment to strip out a fundamental budget announcement is moved and not only is there no public announcement; there is no parliamentary justification-not a word. Those actions of the Assistant Treasurer will stand as a symbol of this government's arrogance and incompetence. I am not quite sure what the balance was, but it was only after the third occasion-I think when the shadow minister for finance spoke during consideration in detail-that, finally, the Assistant Treasurer would say that there would be a separate piece of legislation. It was barely audible in this House. And so it was on the very next day, the last sitting of last week, that this legislation we are debating today was introduced. This reeks of chaos in the decision making in the government. They cut a tax to 7½ per cent; they double it to 15 per cent in the budget, with all the signals that sends. They decide they are going to strip it out of a TLA bill and put it as a stand-alone measure and they cannot even communicate it. I was thinking perhaps the Assistant Treasurer really did not know what was happening or why, but in parliamentary debate-and I have witnessed quite a bit of it-I have never seen such a spectacle. It might surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to hear me saying this, but I do not mind saying it. There are those opposite who follow these matters at a technical level pretty closely on the back bench. To be a backbencher and watch that spectacle must have been very frustrating because it was nothing short of a disgrace for decision making on the part of the government. It is, as the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out at the beginning of this debate, a symbol of so much that is wrong with this government. When this debate is over, every member on that side who was elected or re-elected in 2007 will be able to say that they voted to decrease the tax and they voted to increase the tax. That is what they will be able to do. The actions of the Assistant Treasurer last week do sum up the government's failure on tax. It is no wonder that the incompetence and the chopping and changing that is on display directly leverage the sort of uncertainty and sovereign risk that have been spoken about in this debate.",155
279,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding day Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. This bill epitomises the performance of this government in this parliament. This bill has had more starts than Black Caviar. It is like going to the tennis. I watched the women's tennis semi-final at Rafter Stadium last year. Watching this bill come in, go out, come in, go out, come in, go out is nothing short of a tennis match. I know deep in my heart that members opposite, members of this government, are embarrassed about the way this bill has been managed through this House-they must be, because there are a lot of things to be embarrassed about. Not only are we embarrassed by the way the government has conducted the transition of this bill through the House; when we speak in this House it is not just a local audience but a national and global audience. When a bill comes before the House that speaks to managed investment trusts and the imposition of tax on companies choosing to invest in this nation, it is a matter of national importance and a matter of sovereign risk. The Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the managed investment trust final withholding tax from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent on payments made in relation to income years commencing after 1 July 2012. There is one thing we can be thankful for: there is not an element of retrospectivity associated with this bill, as there are for many other pieces of legislation that come before this house. We can at least be thankful for that. Schedule 1 to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to give effect to the increase in the consequential MIT final withholding tax rate imposed by the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Amendment Bill 2012. According to the budget, it is expected to generate approximately $260 million in revenue over the forward estimates. I suspect that the reason we are having this debate is because of the $260 million this bill is forecasted bring in. During this debate I will bring evidence from the financial sector of this nation that says this government is prepared to blow-off $1 billion in lost revenue-flighted international revenue that would have come to this nation-to pick up $260 million. How does that work? The government are starting to make financial decisions because their political survival is so thinly strung that have a forecasted $1.5 billion surplus. Their political decisions are built around that figure. This $260 million helps in generating that revenue, but in order to do it they are prepared to sacrifice $1 billion worth of revenue-and I will tell you who said that. The MIT final withholding tax rate of 15 per cent will apply to fund payments made in relation to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2012. That seems like a special memorial date for this government. As we all know, the world's largest carbon tax kicks off on that date. We have the start of the investment withdrawal in Australia and yet another tax that will have a snowballing effect on investment and increase our exposure to sovereign risk. We have a twotiered economy at the moment: we have the resources sector, which is considerably strong, and we have another sector of the community, including the electorate of Wright, which has no linkages into the resources sector. Economics 101 tells us that when you are trying to stimulate an economy there are two things that you do: decrease tax and increase government spending. We have got the increased government spending; we Tax) can go through the myriad wasteful spending activities that this government has participated in. We were supposed to see a reduction in a tax rate, and I believe that was only the reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. That is like going to to the tennis semifinals as well: it is in and out and in again and out again depending on where the polls are at the moment. We recently had the Prime Minister up in Queensland telling business leaders they should be out there talking up the economy and saying how well things are going. When you walk up and down the streets of Beaudesert, when you walk up and down the streets of Gatton, which is predominantly a we farming and rural precinct, or when you get up into the tourism sector of Mount Tamborine in my electorate, these people are doing it extremely tough. I forecast tonight that we are going to see double-digit figures of businesses exiting the market. If you want to get into a booming business at the moment, go and get yourself some shares in some receivables businesses or some administrators because they will be going gangbusters as result of some of this government's policies. In 2008, when Labor previously reduced the withholding tax progressively from 30 per cent to 7.5 per cent the coalition did not oppose the relevant bill. We did not oppose it because it was done in an orderly fashion. We sent messages to the market in an orderly fashion and said that it would be staged down. We have this wake-up-and-get-out-ofbed type haphazard approach of saying: 'Today we might just double the withholding tax rate; that is a good idea, because we have run out of ideas.' As a government, they have run out of ideas. However, at the time, we did express concern that it was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers because of the operational double taxation agreements, and any reduction in taxation paid in Australia may simply have led to higher taxes being paid to other jurisdictions. At the time, the coalition also expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny as Labor had not allowed the bill to be considered by the Senate Economics Committee, that Labor's costings of the measures would be dubious and that Labor had delivered a tax cut to foreigners in the 2008 budget but had not delivered a tax cut to Australian citizens and taxpayers. When will this Labor government realise that continual changes to our international taxation arrangements, coupled with Labor's recent retrospective tax grabs, reduce international investor confidence and elevate concerns about Australia's sovereign risk profile? I sit on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, and it was interesting to hear from industry and the private sector about their concerns with the proposed legislative changes. Treasury indicated it expected little negative influence on investment flows from the increase. This position was vigorously rejected by industry, and I will quote from the Hansard transcript of the inquiry. But before I do that, how often do we see that happen, where we have Treasury come out with a position or a forecast and industry vigorously rejecting or opposing it? We do not have to look too much further than last year's forecast of what this deficit was going to be. Back before the last budget I think we had a forecast for this budget in the vicinity of $10 billion. Six months later and we are looking at a figure of $22.7 billion! This is from the same department-virtually double within a six-month period. And when the recent MYEFO documents came out it bounced out to $37 billion. This is Treasury, contrasting, again, with industry, which goes to the credibility of all forecasting. Of course, who knows what the budget deficit is going to end up at? I think it is going to be in the vicinity of $44 billion, but with this government cooking the books and trying to bring expenditure back from next year into this, who knows? I opened my comments by saying that this bill was similar to Makybe Diva. I wouldn't be putting a punt on whichever figure",160
280,Mr Snowdon,BILLS,You've changed horses!,162
281,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS,"I have changed horses. Before I digressed, I was looking at conflicting views between Treasury and the industry. This is an exchange between Anthony MCDonald of Treasury and Peter Verwer, Chief Executive, Property Council of Australia:",162
282,Mr MCDonald,BILLS,"I am not aware; there probably would be. But in this instance, to the extent that we would have allowed for any reduction in this sector as a result of the budget measure, it would be fairly minimal. Fairly minimal? For a $260 million pick-up in tax revenue? I ask you: how do you quantify what is 'fairly minimal'? He went on to say: That I know might sound strange to those directly involved in the sector because we are looking at the net impact across the economy rather than just the impact in the sector. So, don't look at it across the sector; look at it across the whole GDP. It is similar to what the government does with reference to rationalising its debt ratio and saying, 'It's only seven per cent or only 10 per cent of GDP.' If you take this as a rational comparison against not a number that should have been used as a common denominator but the whole economy, of course it is only minimal. This is the logic that they are using to try to rationalise the irrational. He went on to say: Again, if we are looking at financial flows there would be a greater reduction in the flows that occur through managed investment trusts but what we are interested in is what happens to the aggregate base and that is a different thing.",162
283,Mr Verwer,BILLS,The question was: where would that extra money come from in order to ensure that the aggregate basis remained in alignment? We are still waiting for the answer.,163
284,Mr MCDonald,BILLS,"That is part of what being a small, open economy that is engaged in international capital markets with a freely floating exchange rate does. There were some other comments from Mr Verwer: In fact, these foreign investors have said to us quite clearly that some of them had already pulled out because we no longer meet their hurdle rateit did not take long to do the sums; others said that they have frozen the negotiations. To support those comments I draw your attention to the Hansard of the Economics Committee and questioning of Mr Martin Codina from the Financial Services Council. The member for Throsby asked him: Is there any evidence for that flight of capital occurring? That is, as a result of this legislation. This is where the $1 billion comes in. Mr Codina said: There is absolute evidence of that. Collectively we have quantified in excess of $1 billion, some of which has been made public and some of which is highly sensitive, because of the nature of the foreign investors. In some cases you have sovereign funds-in other words, it would be akin to a foreign government being critical of the Australian government as a consequence of the change. Why am I only hearing about this in Economics Committee hearings where the Financial Services Council of Australia is giving evidence? Why weren't these opinions sought in the consultation process? Why weren't these people consulted? When you talk to Treasury they always open up with, 'We've consulted with the industry; we've consulted with everyone; we've consulted this to death.' Mr Codina later went on to say: Let me put it this way. We were disappointed that we were not consulted prior to the announcement being made on budget night. Since this government came into office in 2007, we have issued something like 10 media releases which were supportive of subsequent changes that have been made, either to our tax system or regulatory-wise, that essentially had their origins in the Johnson review. We were one of the leading participants in the Johnson review, involved in much of the work that was conducted there. So I guess all I can say is it did come as a surprise, as an organisation that is actively involved in assisting the government in this area, that the announcement was made without any prior consultation. Why would a government not consult with major stakeholders on such a sensitive bill that has the capacity to generate $1 billion of flight in capital from this nation? I will tell you why. To save the budget bottom line-I can think of no other reason-of a measly $260 million. The government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the MIT withholding tax has yet again reduced our predictability in the eyes of international investors. If passed, this bill would undermine Australia's objective of becoming a regional financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region. Attracting more foreign investment is important to achieve stronger economic growth which would lead to increased government revenue without the need for many new or increased taxes. Industry was barely consulted; the Australian people are rarely consulted; and the coalition remains opposed to this bill. (Time expired)",163
285,Mr BANDT,BILLS," I rise on behalf of the Australian Greens to raise a specific concern with this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012-that is, the potential impacts of the bill on investment in low-carbon and renewable energy projects. It does not appear from the terms of the bill that it would have a particular impact on this area, but there have been some significant representations made by many in the sector that the current arrangements have been attractive to those overseas funds that are particularly interested in investing in areas where there might be higher ethical and sustainability standards than one might find in an ordinary investment. The Australian Greens have received a letter from the Green Building Council of Australia, and I would like, if I might, to relate a couple of the points it makes. The chief executive, Ms Romilly Madew, and the executive director of advocacy, Mr Robin Mellon, make the point that: The current withholding tax rate of 7.5 per cent has supported Australia's economic growth by encouraging investments in commercial property construction and critical infrastructure including low-carbon and renewable energy projects. The Property Council of Australia has identified priority of foreign investors, attracted by the lower withholding tax rate, has been high-grade buildings with strong green credentials. They give some examples and then go on to say: The Green Building Council of Australia supports any initiatives, programs or campaigns that encourage Australia's green building and sustainable community industry. The PCA research indicates that the increase in the WHT rate is likely to harm investment into Australia's green building future. The GBCA urges the government to reconsider this action and examine the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the direct and indirect impacts on stakeholders, more closely. We have been involved in some discussions over recent weeks, and these concerns remain unallayed for us. The Greens still have concerns that this bill might have a disproportionate impact on low-carbon and renewable energy projects. Senator Christine Milne, who is responsible for speaking on behalf of the Greens on Treasury matters, is taking carriage of this matter will not stand in the way of the bill passing through the House, but we are not yet in a position to give support for the passage of this bill in the Senate. Our concerns remain very real and have not yet been resolved. We understand that the government has set a self-imposed time line for getting this legislation through. On behalf of the Greens I can say that that may be the government's view but our concerns are yet to be resolved. On that basis, we will not stand in the way of its passage through the House, but that is without prejudice to the position we might take in the Senate. We feel that we have very clearly put on notice the concerns we want to see addressed.",164
286,Mr BALDWIN,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding that a Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. Since 2 May, the government has had more positions on the MIT withholding tax rate, and attracting investment, than I can count on one hand. The history is simply this: on 2 May, Minister Ferguson launched the Australian 'open for investment' campaign, designed to attract offshore investment in the 80 shovel-ready projects in Australia. Less than a week later, on 8 May, the budget was handed down, announcing the MIT would go from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent-effectively undermining the Australia 'open for investment' campaign. On the evening of 9 May, 2012, Minister Ferguson told the National Tourism Alliance at an industry gathering that he appreciated there were people in the room who were unhappy but that his job was to defend the government, so he would defend the government. On 20 May, Minister Ferguson failed to appear in the House to defend the MIT withholding tax increase that he said he would defend at the NTA. On 20 June, the government amended its own bill to take out the doubling of the MIT withholding tax rate. On 21 June, the very next day, the government reintroduced its own MIT withholding tax bill in exactly the same form to again raise the tax from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent-proving the often-made point that Labor cannot stick to a policy lunchtime to Lateline. I note on the speakers list that Minister Ferguson is not going to come into this House and defend his government's decision to lift the MIT withholding tax rate which is effectively knocking over his campaign program for those 80 shovel-ready projects. It is no wonder there is a crisis in confidence in the tourism industry. It appears that the government does not understand that international capital is very fluid and will flow wherever the best opportunity and returns are. I have to wonder what the Independents' price was when they sold out to approve this measure. I have just heard a member of the Greens say they are going to pass this bill in the House but reserve their opinion in the Senate. The place to block this bill is here and now, because it would not be back on the agenda without their support. If the Independents and the Greens support this legislation they will have gone from hero to zero in the tourism industry's opinion in a matter of days. This measure will combine with nine other measures in the budget that will undermine the government's 2020 Tourism Industry Potential strategy, which was publicly released in November 2010. That strategy-or flyer, as some in the industry call it, given its lack of detail-has outlined an ambitious set of goals to promote the long-term, sustainable growth of the Australian tourism industry. According to Tourism Australia, realising this potential would mean 'doubling overnight expenditure for Australia's tourism industry, from $70 billion to as much as $140 billion by 2020.' It would increase tourism's contribution to the GDP to up to three per cent in 2020 and increase tax revenue from tourism from $9.3 billion in 2009 to as high as $14.5 billion in 2020. The carbon tax alone makes this goal from relatively unachievable. Taxing new hotel developments makes those goals even more impossible. In conceding the tourism industry's victory against Labor's departuretax cash-grab, the government might have opted to repair some of the bridges along with other tourism infrastructure. Instead, it announced a reduction to the Asia Marketing Fund from $61 million to $48.5 millionthat was in a press release that was hidden quietly on the Treasurer's website-and that was a payback for forcing government to back down on a budget measure. Such a childish response only adds to the chorus of calls for a grown-up government to get Australia back on track. The regional tourism infrastructure fund announced: firstly, has effectively reduced the Asia Marketing Fund by $12½ million; secondly, returns the industry the $11.5 million previously cut from Labor's first budget in 2008-09; and, thirdly, offers no detailed plan to deliver on either tourism demand drivers or tourism supporting infrastructure. The tourism sector did not take lightly its huge step in launching full-blown advertising campaigns against the government in recent weeks. It did so to protect jobs and is looking forward to building what should be a normal relationship of mutual trust, full disclosure and, importantly, genuine consultation. It reflects well on tourism bodies that they did not respond to the petty slap of a reduced Asia Marketing Fund as a consequence of the government's reduced departure tax revenue. The sector might have highlighted that the government could easily have kept the Asia Marketing Fund intact since this investment was only 10 per cent of the projected revenue in the first place. Yet this should not be confused with the tourism industry taking the hotel investments tax lying down. This is a vital issue for the tourism industry and the government's own words reinforce the point. Eleven months ago, the now former minister for tourism, the Hon. Nick Sherry, told industry leaders: The sad fact is that much of Australia's accommodation is outmoded and outdated and Chinese visitors in particular … are used to very modern facilities in their own country. There great challenge in tourism to invest in the modernisation of facilities. In the same meeting he said that we need to see an increase in investment to realise the potential, and added that the country would need between 40,000 and 70,000 additional hotel rooms by 2020 to cope with projected demand. Individuals and trusts base their decisions on statements like these and like the twiceyearly releases from Australia's independent Tourism Forecasting Committee. Smart investors will always weigh potential returns with risk, and they look to the government to manage the economy according to a plan. This gives hotel investors confidence to sign on for the long-term investments in hotel developments that are typically delivered over a 10-year cycle. In last week's debate I read into the Hansard the views of Tourism Accommodation Australia, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, amongst others. It would benefit the House to reflect today on the prebudget submission by the Accommodation Association of Australia, delivered well in advance of the budget-in fact, it was delivered the day after Australia Day in 2012. They say in their submission: 32. While accommodation rooms within Australia are, by and large, of a high standard in comparison to other countries, continual refurbishment is required for businesses and the broader industry for it to remain globally competitive. 33. The stagnation in the number of overseas visitor arrivals in the second half of the last decade, together with the drop in domestic tourism has created a difficult trading environment for accommodation businesses, notably those in locations outside Australia's capital cities. 34. The returns for many investors in accommodation businesses have not been is a adequate enough for them to make major commitments to capital expenditure on upgrading existing rooms and other parts of their businesses (restaurants, function rooms, meeting/convention space, leisure facilities). That was the AAA prebudget submission dated 27 January 2012, so the government is aware of these issues. Credit should be given to Minister Ferguson in delivering a prospectus of unfunded hotel investments. It is no silver bullet for tourism investment, and it is useless unless matched by other government policies that work in the same direction. I welcomed the prospectus as a 'good first step to restoring tourism infrastructure' when it was announced on 2 May 2012. Yet it only took the government six days to undermine this potentially effective measure with plans to double hotel investment tax, and today they replicate that action. This confused and incoherent approach highlights dysfunctional government with portfolios not delivering a whole-of-government approach. Otherwise, why would you launch a policy based on a 7½ per cent tax, a week ahead of the government, in its own budget, increasing that tax to 15 per cent? It flies in the face of logic, reasoning and, in particular, investor confidence. We were all reminded of this last week when the government withdrew its hotel investment tax and reintroduced its bill the next day in exactly the same form. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott: what sort of message does this send to potential investors? The opportunity for crossbenchers to deliver stability and certainty comes tonight with these very bills. In supporting the coalition's opposition to automatic CPI indexation of the departure tax last week, the Independents helped make Australia a more attractive tourism destination, to the tune of $125 million a year, and that is according to the government's figures. Yet fixing this demand challenge is pointless unless matched by a commitment to fix the supplyside challenges. And according to all of the tourism and accommodation sector peak bodies, the managed investment trust cashgrab is a key test for minority government to act responsibly. Despite the government's own vacillation undermining investor confidence, the Property Council of Australia has indicated that the only hope Australia has for maintaining its reputation as a safe place to invest is for the parliament to firm its resolve and reject this bill. Independents cannot walk away from their responsibilities to regional tourism on the basis of an exaggerated regional assistance package, for this small amount of money will be spent in a meaningful way. It is vital to achieve the right mix of demand driver and supporting infrastructure allocations. Examples of a demand drivers might be the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service's Three Capes Track, or the redevelopment of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Supporting infrastructure is the transport and accommodation you would use when going to see a tourist attraction, like the Spirit of Tasmania, or the Old Woolstore Apartment Hotel-something I thought the member for Bandt might be interested in. However, the money is allocated, Independents should demand accountability, planning, and an outcomes focus. As I write this, I think of the Clump Point marina and the jetty at Dunk Island-still in a state of disrepair 18 months after Cyclone Yasi, despite our Prime Minister approving money to fix this infrastructure. I seek leave to table a photograph of the jetty at Dunk Island, still in a state of disrepair some two years after it was damaged by Cyclone Yasi. Leave granted.",164
287,Mr BALDWIN,BILLS,"There are quite literally thousands of Australian restaurants, motels, hotels and other businesses that have not spruced up their properties since the Australian dollar approached parity with the US in 2008. With fewer customers comes less profit to reinvest in hotel upgrades to stay competitive with other markets. The crisis in both consumer and investor confidence in Australian tourism is not all because of unfortunate realities like the sluggish economic performance of our traditional markets, the high Australian dollar or natural disasters; it is also because of perfectly avoidable policies that damage tourism. The standout example, of course, is the world's largest carbon tax, which will make foreign destinations even more attractive to tourists and diminish even further returns on hotel investments. Like potential investors, Independents must weigh the totality of government policy affecting returns on investment here compared to overseas. Doubling hotel investment tax will affect investment decisions yet so will the other nine budget measures that will damage the tourism industry. Australia should seek to grow tourism and enjoy the benefits that flow from higher employment, a diversified economy and improved ties with other nations. Overtaxing tourism will stunt this growth and is short-sighted in the extreme. For tourism there is no greater challenge facing the minority government than repairing the damage already done to investor confidence in this afternoon's debate. So if the Independents who support the coalition and, more importantly, the industry in knocking over the CPI increases in the PMC want to remain the pin-up boys of the tourism industry then I say this to them: oppose this legislation, which will directly affect investment in your seats. It will directly destroy confidence in investment in Australia. It will destroy the concept that is a good sovereign nation to invest in. And, importantly, think about your own electorate. Think about the employment figures in your own electorate. Think about how this investment could be placed in your electorate and you can take part in the journey. By supporting this government, I say to them-and if indeed they do support this bill; the member for Bandt has already indicated that he will be supporting this bill in this House-at what price have you sold out your electorate? If you stood up for the tourism industry you would not be selling out the tourism industry, and those workers and those investors- (Time expired) Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (19:48): I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trusts Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and associated bill. This bill is once again before the House. As bill after bill is introduced into this House, the Australian community continues to be let down by this Gillard Labor government, which refuses to listen and refuses to consult. Just last week, the government decided to withdraw the bill before a vote. The coalition believed that finally the Gillard Labor government had woken up to reason and that the Gillard Labor government had finally listened to concerns in industry and the community. I thought at least that they had noticed the immovable outrage pouring from the financial, property and tourism industries about the measures in these bills. Yet here we are again debating bills which, if passed, will be another direct attack on the Australian economy. I welcomed the decision not to pass the tax increase last week-a tacit admission that the government had not thought through their policy and an admission by the Gillard Labor government that they were completely wrong to introduce this measure in the first this place. Their delay is yet another concerning sign that this government continues to develop policy on the run. This scattered and confused approach does not, as they say, inspire consumer confidence. It was reported last week by Dun and Bradstreet that three-quarters of Australians are expressing concern about their financial situation and one in three Australians say they would be unable to cover basic expenses for longer than a few weeks if faced with sudden unemployment. As a result, consumers are saving. They are not spending, which poses significant risks for industries including construction and retail. Nor does this government encourage business confidence. Their incessant incompetence and their proclivity for new and increased taxes sends a signal to the international business community that Australia is not a good place in which to invest money. Today's increase to the managed investment trust withholding tax, is yet another attack on business confidence. The Gillard government, on a whim, has decided that it will increase the withholding rate from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent-double. This increase makes investment in Australia less viable and directly undermines the aim of maintaining our economic resilience and boosting Australia's international reputation as a financial services hub in our region. This increase directly contravenes the words of the current Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, when he said in 2008: If we are to be internationally competitive we must have rates of taxation that are amongst the lowest in the world. The Assistant Treasurer should heed his own advice, because this tax increase does make us less internationally competitive and it does makes foreign investment, using the MIT structure, less attractive. This policy translates to a disincentive for foreigners to invest in Australian infrastructure. Make no mistake: this move will damage Australia's reputation and will hurt our economy. Indeed, according to the Property Council of Australia, more than $1 billion of planned foreign investment has already been affected. Maintaining the 7.5 per cent tax rate is important because it is of fundamental importance to attract foreign investors to invest in key Australian infrastructure. In particular, many institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds use the MIT structure to invest because they are specifically the types of organisations which are looking much longer into the future and have the capacity to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects which may not see a return for many years. They invest in the construction of buildings like electricity generation facilities, hotels and tourism facilities, hospitals, motorways and toll roads, green buildings, and other carbon dioxide abatement programs. Sometimes these projects require decades-long commitment to keeping their investment money in Australia. It is important to note that not only are these facilities crucial to the long-term benefit of the Australian economy but those institutional and pension fund investors are exactly the type of reliable and respected investors we can trust to stay here. It has been only 48 days since the Treasurer delivered his budget-the budget of smoke and mirrors, broken promises and direct attacks on the fiscal bottom line of all Australians. After the Gillard government's then … apparent decision to drop the proposed increase in the managed investment trust withholding tax last week, we now have the fourth proposed change to a budget measure. The Treasurer announced that the government would be dumping their proposed company tax cuts, yet has more recently said they are now back on the table. Their second backflip was indexation of the passenger movement charge, which the government gagged debate on last week on the floor of the House because they did not want to hear how bad indexation would have been for the tourism industry. Fortunately, the government backflipped and dumped the CPI increases that they had previously said were part of the budget. Last week we saw the dumping of the MIT withholding tax increase, and today-lo and behold-its reintroduction. As the Australian Financial Review reported today, the property and finance industries were shocked when this proposal was first put forward. Yet it is not a surprise that the Gillard Labor government is still going through with this policy. We have a government which time and time again refuses to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis on any of their bills. Yet here they are today, coming out and blasting an independent report compiled by the Allen Consulting Group. And this report is damning. It highlights that the attempt to increase government revenue in the short term will raise $35 million but will be accompanied by a decline of $30 million in gross domestic product. This increase in federal government revenue will also be accompanied by a decrease in collections by state governments, which will further affect the financial viability of states like Queensland, still trying to overcome decades of poor and reckless financial mismanagement by state Labor governments. Australians and international investors do not just want responsible economic management-they deserve responsible economic management. They consistency in government and they want a government that will tell the truth, that will do what it says, and that will not expose this country to sovereign risk. The shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, persistently reminds the Gillard Labor government that so much of their legislation is exposing Australia to sovereign risk. And what is the usual response from government ministers? It is to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that nothing bad is happening. They pretend that somehow the policies they introduce into this House will not act as a disincentive for foreign investment, despite it being the express intention of the Treasurer to come up with short-term bandaid fixes to cover up his gross economic mismanagement. This toxic government can hide all they want from the concerns of Australians and Australian families, and pretend that they are not doing the best they can to wreck the long-term viability of the Australian economy, but the truth about the Treasurer's smoke and mirrors surplus will be revealed later this year in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Behind closed doors, the government provided a so-called protected briefing for senior public servants which reportedly forecast 'turbulence and disruption' in the Australian economy as a result of volatility in Europe and the United States. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Treasurer have the gall to come into this House with their never-ending accusations of negativity from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer-as if we are the ones who are introducing poorly designed legislation, as the Gillard government does so often. Is it mindless negativity from Mr Ivan Glasenberg, Chief Executive Officer of one of the largest commodity trading companies want in the world, who said, 'We are getting greater business certainty out of Congo than we are getting out of Australia'? Is it mindless negativity when Mr Marius Kloppers, CEO of BHP Billiton, says, 'Australia is risking foreign direct investment'? Is it mindless negativity when Steve MCCann, Group CEO and Managing Director of Lend Lease, says, 'Foreign capital is very important in funding large nation building projects; the country's largest real estate and infrastructure projects can't be funded, even by the biggest Australian superannuation funds; it will be the competitiveness of our industry that will suffer'? And was it mindless negativity when Mr David Denison of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said on 15 May this year: Australia's budget … doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country. It cannot be expressed in plainer language than that. He said that increasing the risk of investing in Australia calls into question the predictability and stability of cash flows, if the risk of investing in Australia becomes too high then their response would be very quick and rational-they would simply stop investing in Australia. The coalition, as the opposition, must hold this Labor-Greens coalition government to account, because we know that members on the other side of the House do not know what they are doing and do not fully consider the planned and unplanned consequences of their policies. Their answer to political instability and to a minority government is not to reassess their policies or to recognise and acknowledge when they do not have the details correct. They do not change policy; they simply change leader and swap around their ministerial titles. We recently observed the two-year anniversary of when Prime Minister Gillard and the faceless men of the ALP betrayed the trust and the will of the Australian people. What did the sacking of Prime Minister Rudd achieve? Nothing. We will soon have, from 1 July, the world's only economy-wide carbon tax that is hundreds of per cent higher than the average carbon trading price, a tax that will do nothing for the global environment. We will soon have the economically destructive minerals resource rent tax. We will soon witness a 17 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge, which directly threatens Australia's $73.3 billion tourism industry. These taxes, increased by the Labor government, have been enforced without any rational explanation. This year's budget was clearly just another ploy in the Gillard government's desperate attempt to try to achieve a paperthin surplus-no matter the consequences for local industry. This is a government that give on the one hand and take on the other. They introduce a tax on carbon dioxide, increasing the cost of and living for all Australians, and pretend that out of the kindness of their self-righteous hearts they are giving cash to you to ease cost-of-living pressures. They claim on the one hand that they are supporters of the industry, but on the other hand they turn around and make it as difficult as they can for industry to survive and prosper. The Leader of the Opposition noted in his budget reply on 10 May that there is nothing wrong with this country that a change of government cannot fix. Today my message to Australian industry is: only the coalition has the economic credentials to help business survive and prosper. The coalition is committed to lower taxes, to helping attract investment in critical infrastructure",167
288,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Ryan will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Chinese Australians,171
289,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," I move: That this House recognises the: (1) strong history of Chinese migration to Australia over the past 200 years; (2) significant contribution that ChineseAustralians have made over this period to our nation; (3) vibrant festivities and events hosted by the Bennelong Chinese community and enjoyed by people of many cultures; and (4) unique opportunity for the local Chinese, Korean and broader communities to come together at the Bennelong Cup Table Tennis Test Match for an international table tennis competition against Australia. This year marks 40 years since the commencement of diplomatic relations between Australia and China, and 209 years since the first record of Chinese the colonies that became our nation. Both of these events provided important milestones in the development of a strong and dynamic interaction between the two nations and the growth of a vibrant community of Chinese Australians that has contributed to all of our nation's advancement. According to the 2011 census, 16.9 per cent of Bennelong residents list Chinese ancestry; just shy of the 17.3 per cent of people who listed their ancestry as Australian. 12.9 per cent of Bennelong residents were born in China or Hong Kong, and 17.2 per cent speak either Cantonese or Mandarin at home-more than six times the national average that now places Mandarin as the most widely spoken non-English language in Australia. The Bennelong region has flourished from the diversification of cultures around our local community. This is most evident during cultural festivities such as Lunar New Year. Every January and February is a time of colour, dance and song as local streets and shopping centres become hubs of community and cultural celebration. Like many locals at these events, I have been taught to write my name in traditional Chinese characters, to wish people Kung Hei Fat Choy, and to give and receive traditional lollies with blessings of good luck for the year ahead. Of course, the history of Chinese migration to Australia is not limited to the past 40 years. Whilst historical debate may never sort out fact from fiction on these issues, Chinese books dating back more than 2,000 years are said to describe Indigenous Australians, the boomerang and the presence of kangaroos in the Imperial Palace in Peking; 15th century Ming dynasty statuettes have been discovered around the Gulf of Carpentaria; and some Aboriginal cave paintings on Flinders Island depict ancient migration to Chinese junk ships. In more recent times, immigration documents recorded a carpenter named Ahuto travelling from China to Australia in 1803, just fifteen years after the first fleet of English convicts set foot on our soil. More is facets known of Mak Sai Ying, who arrived in 1818 and 11 years later became the publican at the Lion Inn Hotel in Parramatta-the first of many thousands of Chinese Australians to establish successful enterprises and become leaders of local businesses. The gold rush of the 1850s saw a large spike in Chinese migration, with many Chinese forcibly repatriated during some of the darker days of this legislature under the strict rules of the Immigration Restriction Act. Throughout this time, Chinese Australians have made a significant contribution to our nation. The White City Tennis Centre, with which I have a long history, was originally a Chinese market garden and another still operates in La Perouse after more than a century. Much of the attention today focuses on the Chinatown precincts in each of the major cities, offering a snapshot of life an ocean away, and tendering shopping and culinary delights to all Australians in a modern form of cultural engagement. Yet with such strong historical ties, this engagement should not be limited to Peking duck and the Lunar New Year. As we share so many of our day-today experiences and celebrate the growth of our multicultural society, it is important that from early in life we are encouraged to befriend and interact with people of all cultures. President Nixon's use of ping-pong as a non-threatening tool to facilitate diplomacy between the United States and China and enhance cultural ties highlighted the way that sport can be used to great effect. This was something I learned first hand in my previous career, and in particular on the 5 November 1979, when I participated in the first professional tennis match in China, which received worldwide headlines as another example of improving relations between the Western world and a closed global superpower. I competed against a little known Swedish player by the name of Bjorn Borg and, considering the score line, I was happy to invoke the Chinese slogan: 'Friendship First, Competition Second.' I obviously lost. We also played an exhibition doubles match alongside China's two leading players in front of some 6,000 people at the Sheng People's Stadium in Canton, and it was telecast to thousands more throughout the region. Prior to the match a Chinese government official told the international media: Tennis is not that popular in China, but more people are getting interested. I think this will have a very good influence. Fast-forward to 2012 and China now boasts a French Open winner, two doubles grand slam tournament winners and an Olympics gold and bronze medal. The Shanghai Masters is now established in China as a major tennis venue, and the China Open goes from strength to strength. This is just an example of the powerful role that sport can play in facilitating interaction and creating the dynamic that breaks down cultural and political barriers and builds bridges between individuals, industries and governments. In President Nixon's case, it was only one year after the US table tennis team visited that the President himself travelled to China and met with Mao Zedong: an historic moment in global politics that set the stage for the commencement of diplomatic relations between Australia and China shortly after. It was with this in mind that I developed the Bennelong Schools Table Tennis Program. Shortly after the last election, as I visited local schools in Bennelong, I noticed a troubling pattern. Very few students from an Asian background were participating in traditional Australian sports. Sporting activity is one of the best things an individual, young or old, can do for physical, mental and social health. Different body shapes and cultural upbringing attract an interest and willingness to participate in different activities. As a result, providing access to a range of activities is essential to facilitate the same bridge-building goals achieved at diplomatic levels. With the generosity of Hyundai Australia, the Bennelong Schools Table Tennis Program is donating table tennis tables to every school in the electorate. The sporting competition is then administered by Table Tennis Australia, who will run coaching clinics and schools competitions. Many tables have already been match delivered to schools and a number of students have expressed their excitement about competing against their peers and friends. Later in the year an interschool competition will serve as opening act for the Bennelong Cup test match, featuring the Chinese women's team and Korean men's team competing against Australia. If the score line from last year's test match against Korea is any guide, the same 'Friendship First, Competition Second' slogan will likely be invoked. In order to celebrate their visit, a feature event will take place in the Great Hall, including students from schools throughout the electorate and the Bennelong Schools Choir. These programs are important reminders of the way that sport can unite people from a diversity of cultural backgrounds, whether they are the youngest school kids or the most senior diplomats. The bringing together of China and Korea to compete alongside each other can perpetuate another way that these two nations can associate and cooperate through participation in sport. Earlier today I spoke with the United States consul general in Sydney to discuss the possibility of the US joining next year a competition where east meets west, where the great powers of this sport can partner with the more recent adopters to have some fun and provide entertainment for Bennelong's multicultural audience. It is often through the more light-hearted events between distant friends that our similarities, instead of our differences, can achieve some much-needed oxygen. The interaction that follows helps to develop components of a shared history which are then built upon through trade and migration, progressively bridges are built and the building blocks of understanding, loyalty and trust are developed to ensure an enduring relationship. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Berowra for agreeing to second this motion. His active friendship with the Chinese Australian community is well documented and he has been a strong and experienced guide for me as we have attended many community events together. I would also like to recognise my colleagues the members for Ryan, Scullin, Chisholm and Canberra who will also be speaking on this issue. I commend this motion to the House.",171
290,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,174
291,Mr Ruddock,BILLS,I second the motion with a great deal of pleasure and I reserve my right to speak and to further congratulate the member for Bennelong on his excellent presentation.,174
292,Mr JENKINS,BILLS," The member for Bennelong's motion invites the House to recognise the strong history of Chinese migration to Australia over the past 200 years and the significant contribution that Chinese Australians have made over this period to our nation. That is a very easy thing to support because right from the start, in when the Chinese first came to make their way economically, to set up businesses, then through the 1840s to the 1890s to labour in farming pursuits, on plantations and in pursuit of gold, and right through to the present day, they have made a great contribution to the way Australia has developed economically and socially and very much identified with the multicultural society that is Australia. The member for Bennelong's motion goes on to invite us to recognise the vibrant and festivities and events hosted by the Bennelong Chinese community and enjoyed by the people of many cultures. I have not had the pleasure of accepting an invitation to those vibrant festivities and events in Bennelong, but I am sure, if those I attend throughout my electorate of Scullin are any guide, that is also a very easy part of the motion to support. The member for Bennelong indicated that some 16 per cent of the population of his electorate indicate they have Chinese ancestry. In Scullin it is a mere four per cent, or 5,000 people, who recognise their Chinese heritage as being important to their day-today lives. I am indebted to two books written by my friend Arthur 'Boon Wah' Yong. One, which he published in 1999, is called Moon Cake and Meat Pies: the history, art and culture of Chinese settlement in the City of Whittlesea. He followed that up with another one, in 2008, called Chinese Settlement in Whittlesea. As he reflected in his first book, Moon Cake and Meat Pies, if we look at those that identify as Chinese they had in fact come from different parts of the world. He listed Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, East Timor, Vietnam, the Peoples Republic of China, and you can add Macau and Taiwan. So you can already see from that contribution the Chinese have made throughout the globe. Therefore, why shouldn't they have made such a significant impact here in Australia? In the municipality of Whittlesea, the Chinese date back to the 1850s. In Whittlesea township there are still remnants of market gardens operated by a number of families in the township. The waves of migration that have followed have meant that many people with Chinese ancestry have made their homes in the southern suburbs of the city of Whittlesea. Whether they had come in those early days to provide labour and then went on as they got economic independence to become hawkers and set up shops or whether they have come with great qualifications that have added to academe and to the way in which Australia has developed its many professions and ways of producing things through university and territory education, we recognise and should celebrate through this motion the way in which those people have been accepted. I was interested in the second book by Arthur, Chinese Settlement in Whittlesea, and to reflect on the circumstances outlined in an article that first appeared in Evelyn Observer on Friday, 21 December 1883. It was a report of actions at the Whittlesea police court earlier that month when certain people had been charged with throwing stones and assaulting Ah Hem and Ah Soung, Chinese market gardeners, from Whittlesea. What really intrigued me was not the crime, but the fact that the two Chinese market gardeners appeared before the court accompanied by Mr James Ah Pow, Chinese interpreter, and the Chinese were sworn in through the 'orthodox fashion by blowing out a lighted lucifer'. When I reflect on the difficulties that have occurred in the acceptance of people from Chinese background later in Australia's history, I find the it really something that you can actually celebrate that. In an area that accepted these people because of their hard work, in a court procedure we could also accept something that was traditional to them as people appearing before the court. And, as I have reflected from time to time, I have to express my shame at the way Chinese immigration was prevented by my own political party, but it does show that political parties can learn lessons, can change the way they perceive the value of people that come to Australia, and I think that is important. The fourth part of the motion invites the House to recognise the unique opportunity for the local Chinese, Korean and broader communities to come together at the Bennelong Cup table tennis test match for an international table tennis competition against Australia. I am happy to support that. I am happy to support that because it represents a continuation of the member for Bennelong's support for table tennis as a relevant recreational and sporting activity for many people in his electorate. I am also willing to support it because of the reasons the member for Bennelong talked about concerning the strength of ping-pong diplomacy some 40 years ago. I think it is good to remind people of the significance that sport has not only in making sure that young Australians have a direction, that they can see the importance of having disciplines that they can cope with, and that they can interact with people of their own age and with other people, but also to remind people of the power of sport as a geopolitical tool. I think it is a great reminder that we should in a debate like this actually say that there are times when progress is sometimes made in a gentle way by the pursuit of sport, and not necessarily in the way that Nixon was able to use in his diplomatic efforts with the People's Republic of China at the time. We should really use the depth and breadth of talent that Chinese Australians represent in also including them in forms of diplomacy that will assist where required because they have a different access to a cultural viewpoint that will assist in making sure that we develop in a diplomatic sense into an even more stable world. We should use our neighbours like the People's Republic of China, and perhaps like Vietnam that has a significant Chinese population, to ensure that people understand from different viewpoints the reasons we pursue the democratic institutions we pursue and be able to live in a world full of peace. In Arthur's book, Chinese Settlement in Whittlesea, he uses a poem that was written by a Chinese immigrant, a person who came to join his daughter in 1998, a very wellqualified person whose wife was a chemical engineer. Both were chemical engineers, highly intelligent with very good qualifications. Since coming to Australia, Jie Ha Wu has used his Chinese culture to open our eyes to calligraphy and to Chinese poems, and on the cover of this book is a poem called Praise of Australia in Chinese calligraphy. In the book the poem is translated and I wish to conclude with this poem. It says: Flying over the equator and the Pacific Ocean from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere, The ancient and amazing new continent surrounded by the vast expanse of ocean, the youngest and biggest island country, Which was founded on democracy and freedom with rich resources and wide territory, The most and fertile place in the world is Australia. I think that those sentiments of Chinese Australians are worth following.",174
293,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS," I want to take this opportunity first to congratulate, if I may, the member for Bennelong. This is an outstanding motion. He gave me some credit, and let me just say I do not think that he needs any tuition. I see in this resolution the acknowledgement of the strong history of Chinese immigration to Australia over the past 200 years. I relate to that. I was formerly the member for Parramatta and when I saw that Mr Mak Sai Ying came in 1818 and settled in Parramatta, it was significant. He spoke about the significant contribution Chinese Australians have made to this nation over a period of time and I must say that I see that every day through the friends I have, through people I know in commerce, and from the contribution that people make. It is very difficult to single people out, but I look at somebody like Benjamin Chow, whom I know particularly well, who headed up the Council for a Multicultural Australia when I was minister for a time. He has been an example of those Chinese Australians who have made a very significant contribution to this nation. I know the festivities of the Bennelong Chinese community. I have enjoyed them over many years when they were part of the electorate of Dundas and I look forward to the opportunity of witnessing the Bennelong table tennis match. I do not know where my family are going to stand in relation to this. I have a daughter who learnt Mandarin at Bei Da, Peking University. She is not the one who has presented the Ruddock family tree with Chinese genes. We also have the Chinese Women's Association, who are currently organising 25 years of service to the Chinese community and the wider community in my electorate-a big dinner is being held this year. There is the Chinese Social Services community organisation which provides aged care services to my community, and there is also the Friendship Association Chinese Table Tennis Club in downtown Box Hill, which also brings together many people through that great sport.",176
294,Ms BURKE,BILLS," I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Bennelong and thank him for bringing it to the House tonight. This is a motion I am most pleased to speak to and support. Australia is a country built on migration. It has been one this country's greatest sources of strength. Our Chinese community, whether living in Bennelong or in my electorate of Chisholm or elsewhere in Australia makes an enormous contribution to our society and has done so for many years. For more than 150 years, since the days of the gold rush in the 1850s, Chinese Australians have been an integral part of the Australian way of life, both culturally and economically. Whether as part of the country's first big mining industry or as market gardeners, farm hands, operators of grocery stores, part of import-export businesses, cabinet makers, entrepreneurs or industry leaders, the Chinese community have been the working backbone of this country. I do not think there is any place in Australia where this is more relevant than in my own electorate of Chisholm, where the influence of the vibrant and active Chinese community is the backbone of our society, particularly in suburbs such as Box Hill and Glen Waverley. Their influence has been profound. As revealed in the 2011 census released last week, my own electorate of Chisholm is home to more than 27,000 Australians of Chinese heritage, just over half of whom were born in China. It is a terrific testament to the quality of life in Australia and the value that we place on the Chinese community that we have such a wonderful mix of not only secondand thirdgeneration Chinese Australians but as many newer migrants as well. You only have to spend a few minutes in my electorate-going to the shopping centre at Box Hill or Glen Waverley-to appreciate the enormous positive cultural and economic impacts of the Chinese community in 100 different restaurants and cafes, as well as a thriving fruit and vegetable market working of alongside a variety of many businesses, be they medical or dental or legal practices, thriving real estate agencies or training colleges. They are all thriving and generating much wealth. There are import-export businesses. The drive and determination of the Chinese community of my electorate is palpable. Every year this area comes alive, particularly Box Hill, with the community run and supported Chinese New Year celebrations. We are one of the only areas that has a dusk-to-dawn Chinese celebration. I have not quite made it to stay all night yet. I saw dawn in on one occasion which was pretty good going. It is an amazing event and the entire community, not just the Chinese community, embraces this event. It is the biggest cultural event and festival held in my electorate. It is a cultural tradition appreciated not only by the Chinese community; more than 70,000 people can turn up to a Box Hill Chinese New Year festival. The continued success of these celebrations and the vibrancy of the small business community in my electorate are in part due to the work of the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse who put on the festival, raise a lot of money and donate it back to charity. The Asian Business Association of Whitehorse, which has operated for more than a decade, works to provide assistance to the local traders and operates with a connection to the area of the City of Whitehorse as well as broadly across Melbourne. The organisation's annual New Year celebrations and business networking events provide advice and assistance to small businesses, but nowadays it is also a backbone to my entire community. The association also produces the publication Brilliant Melbourne which keeps the Chinese community informed on what is happening around Melbourne. Publications like Brilliant Melbourne and Chinese Weekly and other newspapers in my electorate play a role in strengthening multiculturalism, social cohesion and participation throughout my community. Within my Chinese community in Box Hill they are predominantly Cantonese speakers of Indochinese descent or from Hong Kong, Singapore or Malaysia. Within Glen Waverley they are Mandarin speakers of direct mainland descent. Nowadays these two groups, which for many years were at odds with each, other have come together in the business of uniting to work between Australia and China. I want to congratulate association president Andrew Yu and Vice President Ken Huang along with all members of the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse on the leadership they provide to our community and their involvement across the board in many things. I also congratulate City of Whitehorse Councillor Robert Chong, an outstanding community leader who has been involved in the community for more than 30 years, having come to Australia on the Colombo Plan and never gone home. He has done engineering and worked for the Australian Air Force and been a councillor at Whitehorse for many years. He is a backbone of our community and a backbone of the Chinese community. We also have the Chinese Women's Association, who are currently organising 25 years of service to the Chinese community and the wider community in my electoratea big dinner is being held this year. There is the Chinese Social Services community organisation which provides aged care services to my community, and there is also the Friendship Association Chinese Table Tennis Club in downtown Box Hill, which also brings together many people through that great sport. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (20:30): I rise to speak on the member for Bennelong's motion and I thank him for introducing this motion to reflect the significant importance of Chinese migration to the history and story of Australia. The electorate of Ryan and the city of Brisbane, much like the electorate of Bennelong and the community in Sydney, has benefited greatly from Chinese migration to Australia. Brisbane's Chinese-Australian story began 164 years ago in October 1848, when the first Chinese migrants arrived in Brisbane as indentured labourers from Amoy aboard the sailing ship, the Nimrod. At that time, British settlement in the colony was expanding and the pastoralists were in need of cheap labour, as transportation of convicts had ceased. Between 1848 and 1853 about 1,000 Chinese labourers arrived in what is now Queensland and signed a five-year employment contract. They were employed as shepherds, labourers and servants and later as shearers. The first group of 62 Chinese arrived in Moreton Bay a few weeks before the first load of free immigrants arrived from England on the Artemisia. The later discovery of gold was responsible for large numbers of Chinese coming to Queensland. The numbers were not great until gold was discovered on the Palmer River, inland from Cooktown in North Queensland. More than 18,000 Chinese migrated between 1875 and 1877 and, after the gold diminished, many moved to other areas of the colony, including Brisbane. They found work in many ways as merchants, land clearers, herbalists, cooks, furniture makers, hawkers, farmers and market gardeners. In the electorate of Ryan, the Chinese established many market gardens along the creeks and watercourses and operated these during the latter part of the 19th century the first half of the 20th century. They were the main providers of fresh fruit and vegetables to the expanding population. Similar activities occurred in nearly every settlement area in the colony. This was the beginning of a significant, productive economic contribution to Queensland and Australia, one that continues today. In the electorate of Ryan, historical societies have been researching and documenting the history of the Chinese. The Chinese-Australian Historical Association is based in Ryan, established after the completion of the Chinese Club of Queensland's headquarters in Auchenflower in 1957. Like the rest of Brisbane, they suffered heavily during the 1974 floods, and the club did a lot of good work to support wider Brisbane community at the time. They have recently erected a heritage sign in the original Chinatown of Brisbane in Albert Street. They take their story throughout the community with their travelling exhibition called 'Sojourners and Settlers-the Chinese in Queensland', which has toured the state. There are many people in Ryan who have worked hard to document the history of Chinese migration to Brisbane. Desley Drevins from the Ashgrove Historical Society has documented the Chinese market gardens on Enoggera and Ithaca Creeks. Jeff Hilder from The Gap Pioneer & History Group has recently researched the story of the Chan brothers, who operated two market gardens at The Gap, and the Friends of Toowong Cemetery have translated and documented the information on the grave markers in the Chinese section of Toowong Cemetery. I thank and pay tribute to Mr Ray Poon, who has worked tirelessly over the years to document the experience of Chinese immigrants to Queensland. Thanks also to and the National Archives in Brisbane, whose many historical records have been preserved; to date they have digitised more than 15,000 records. I also acknowledge the hard work over many decades of the Chinese Club of Queensland, the current president, Mr Michael Chan, and Brisbane's living treasure Mr Eddie Liu, who has been deservedly recognised with the Order of the British Empire and the Order of Australia. The Liu family has been involved in the local community and Eddie is known as the 'father of Chinatown'. I commend the member for Bennelong for drawing the attention of members to today's motion. The member for Bennelong is a strong community campaigner for his electorate and has developed a table tennis the program to help students engage in sport and enjoyable exercise. I wish all the students who participate in the Bennelong Cup table tennis competition later this year the best of luck.",177
295,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," I too would like to lend my support to the member for Bennelong's private members' motion and recognise the strong and significant history of Chinese migration to Australia over the past 150 years. During this time Chinese-Australians all over the country have made a significant contribution to our nation. They are the masters of vibrant, loud and colourful festivities, and not just in Bennelong. During Canberra's National Multicultural Festival in February 2012 our Chinese community celebrated Chinese New Year-the Year of the Dragon. They came together for an extravaganza of dance, singing and performances. It was colourful, lots of fun and a wonderful reminder of the joy our Chinese community brings to Canberra. I have my own connections to the Chinese-Australian community. My father's mother's family came out from China to Australia during the 1850s as part of the gold rush in Ballarat. Members of my family on my father's father's side also came from Germany in the 1850s, when there was a huge influx of Germans making the voyage to Australia's shores. My mother's family came out from Ireland and Scotland in the late 1800s. Despite all that, Chinese cuisine loomed large in my childhood, particularly in the sixties. Most Saturdays my father would tuck into a plate of congee, and would sit there with his red hair, blue eyes and very pale skin. My mother had mastered the art from my father's mother, and my poor old mum used to go into Chinatown every now and then to pick up fresh ginger-in the sixties it was a bit of a challenge to get in Melbourne, so she would always go there to get her Asian foodstuff. So despite the fact that there was German, Irish and Scottish influence, the cuisine at home was very much influenced by China. Australians, particularly working-class Australians, are a mix of every nationality. Australia is a diverse community, a multicultural community and, for the most part, an accepting community. We should be proud that so many people from all over the world view Australia as a wonderful place to live, to raise a family and to contribute to society. More and more people are willing to come to our country, adopt our values, call themselves Australian and become productive members of our society. In fact, the census data released last week shows that Canberra is becoming more culturally diverse than ever before. Between 2006 and 2011, the percentage of people in the ACT who said they had an Australian background dropped from 30.7 per cent to 26.6 per cent. And the third most reported country of birth, after Australia and England, was China, with 1.8 per cent of people living in the ACT born in China, compared to 1.1 per cent in 2006. Mandarin remained the second most popular language spoken at home, following English, increasing from 1.1 per cent to 1.9 per cent between 2006 and 2011. The number of people living in the ACT who were born overseas is also on the rise-a trend I am sure is evident in many other parts of Australia. The local Chinese community here in Canberra play a significant role in welcoming new migrants and supporting Chinese students who choose to study at our universities. They are led by Sam Wong, who this year was nominated a People of Australia Ambassador for his contribution to the community. We are also fortunate to have many schools committed to teaching languages, that including Mandarin, and encouraging young Chinese students in our community to retain their native language. For example, there is the Chinese Australian Early Childhood Centre in Mawson, which was refurbished last year, providing long day care with a focus on bilingual education in English and Mandarin. The centre is helping young children develop a proficiency in and appreciation for the Chinese language and culture from an early age, which is wonderful to see. Many of the staff at the centre are native Mandarin speakers and have been teaching at the school for over a decade. The centre itself has been running for more than 25 years, thanks to the fine work of the Association for Learning Mandarin in Australia. As you can see, Chinese-Australians are continuing to contribute to our local communities in many different ways. Whether they emigrated here in the gold rush or are visiting now as international students keen to work here when they finish their degree, Chinese-Australians have played a key role in Australia's history and have enriched our cultural diversity and our nation immensely. I wish the member for Bennelong well at the Bennelong Cup table tennis match. I am sure it will be another great example of sport bringing different cultures together. Debate adjourned. Vocational Education and Training",179
296,Ms SMYTH,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) considers that the extreme funding cuts to Victorian TAFEs announced by the Victorian Liberal Government will: (a) damage the opportunities of hundreds of thousands of Victorian students for a decent education and for skilled employment; (b) damage industry in Victoria which relies on TAFEs to provide skills and training to workforce; and (c) result in job cuts and cuts to course offerings, including cuts of up to $300 million across Victorian TAFEs and up to 2,000 Victorian jobs; and (2) calls on the Victorian Liberal Government to abandon its irresponsible cuts to TAFE funding immediately, and reinstate proper funding to the sector. I was going to begin this evening by saying that I was most surprised to see the Baillieu government's $300 million in cuts to TAFE across Victoria announced in the state government's budget recently but, given the acts of the state government in cutting 3,600 Public Service jobs on a Friday night via press release, it is becoming increasingly difficult to be shocked by anything presented by the Baillieu government. So I will continue to endeavour not to be shocked by their antics. It is appalling, however, that the state government has seen fit to cut into TAFE funding-funding for students who are seeking to improve their education; funding in many instances for students who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and face a range of educational challenges. It is most disappointing and I am sure that members of the National Party and people who represent regional areas which are serviced by TAFEs must similarly be concerned not only by the financial cuts that are being made but by the consequent effects for jobs. We have seen estimates that around 2,000 jobs across Victoria are expected to go by as early as the start of next year-and those are not my estimates; those are the estimates of the Victorian TAFE Association. To give members an idea of the magnitude of cuts for each campus, I will mention a few of them. In 2013, the statewide cuts will mean that Box Hill TAFE, for instance, will suffer funding cuts a local of around $24 million; Chisholm TAFE, which has a campus in my own electorate of La Trobe, will face a cut of around $25½ million; the cut to Holmesglen TAFE will be $25½ million; William Angliss TAFE will face a $5.8 million cut; Ballarat TAFE will be cut by $20 million; and Gippsland TAFE-I note that the member for Gippsland is due to speak in this debatewill be cut by $10 million. These are extraordinary figures that have been sprung upon individual campuses which are responsible for thousands of students who, as I mentioned, face educational disadvantage in many instances. This government has a right to be interested in this issue, as the federal government has invested $224 million in TAFEs over the last four years through projects that have upgraded facilities and equipment in campuses right across Victoria, in addition to the $360 million in funding provided on average each year. So it is entirely appropriate that this debate come before this House tonight. I know that it is of significance to a great many members on this side of the House, and it should be of interest and importance to a great many members on the other side of the House. Under the Council of Australian Governments agreement reached with the states in April, the Commonwealth has offered Victoria $435 million to support reforms to the vocational education and training system to improve quality and transparency. I should note that one of the significant consequences of the TAFE cuts is that thousands of Victorian high school students may also miss out on vocational education programs. Around 40,000 students are enrolled in vocational education and training in schools, in which TAFEs provide some of the teaching to support the program. I know that at least one school principal from my electorate, Wayne Burgess of Emerald Secondary College, has expressed his concern and remarked: For some students, these programs keep them coming to school and keep them engaged. If they stop, what happens? We want high retention rates, we want students with skills, but now we're taking the very thing that motivates them. Most importantly, I can see the damage that is likely to be caused at a personal level to students currently in the system and to prospective students as well as to each TAFE college across Victoria. I have met with Maria Peters, the director and CEO of the Chisholm Institute of TAFE in my electorate. Chisholm has campuses at Cranbourne, Berwick, Dandenong and Frankston and, on current estimates provided by the Victorian TAFE Association, is expected to lose around $25 million, a substantial amount of its revenue. I know that Ms Peters is gravely concerned about the potential increase in course fees and the reduction in course availability. I know that she is extremely concerned about the long-term legacy of those cuts, particularly for students who face disadvantage and for whom TAFE currently presents an opportunity to find meaningful employment. We are already seeing examples of these kinds of cuts and the effects that they are likely to have on students who might be the worse affected. For instance, we have seen the circumstances of Ben Carbonaro, who relied on support services such as those provided by RMIT TAFE's Disability Liaison Unit during his studies that ultimately led to a journalism degree. Support services such as these are the very services that are most at risk of being cut back because of the Baillieu government's cuts to TAFE. Likewise, students from low socio-economic backgrounds are likely to experience disproportionately severe effects from this cuts. I urge members to support this motion. (Time expired)",181
297,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded? Ms Burke: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,182
298,Ms LEY,BILLS," I rise to speak on the member for La Trobe's private member's motion regarding Victorian TAFE funding. It is important that we do not characterise the debate this evening in terms of those who support TAFE and those who apparently do not, because I believe that all members in this place do support TAFE. As a member of parliament from regional New South Wales I have had much to do with the Riverina Institute of TAFE and their many campuses across New South Wales-the good work they do, the community services they provide, the jobs that they give to small regional towns, and their connection with local communities, which is very much to be praised and admired. But I would like to remind those opposite that the former Labor government in New South Wales budgeted $900 million for vocational education and training in the 2011-12 financial year and, regrettably, as with so much they do, they blew out the budget to the tune of at least $400 million. is a basic tenet that a government, whether it be federal or state, has to live within its means. And now we see that the Victorian Liberal government faces a difficult challenge in restoring economic credibility. Despite this monumental challenge, they have actually budgeted for a record level of ongoing investment into vocational education and training. This is far above what the previous government had budgeted. The quantum of dollars invested has not been reduced; in fact, it has been increased. They have also sought to refocus where exactly the VET funding is targeted. This measure is about ensuring that taxpayers get value for money and that the areas of skills in demand are given priority-those skills that will boost productivity and help grow the Victorian economy. It is a difficult and challenging area of public policy. But if we as governments are investing public taxpayers' dollars in the development of skills in individuals to benefit the productive capacity of the economy-and it could be any of the state economies in Australia or in fact the federal economy, the total economy, because people who study at, learn at and attend, for example, TAFE in Victoria may go anywhere in the state-we have a responsibility to ensure that those public dollars are directed towards the best possible end. The government in Victoria has sought to refocus where this vocational education and training funding is targeted. This measure is about ensuring value for money is achieved and that skills in demand are given priority, because it is the government's responsibility to grow its state economy. They have done this by changing the funding rates, providing more assistance for areas such as trade It apprenticeships, and reducing funding to those courses that have lower educational outcomes and may have been oversubscribed in the past. Twenty per cent of courses will see an increase in funding levels, and the majority of these courses are in fact offered by the TAFE sector. In addition to this, the Victorian government has offered to underwrite debt for Victorian TAFEs. It is important to note that. This is especially important for regional TAFEs, which have much narrower operating budgets. Ultimately, any government has a responsibility to its constituency. They must be held to account for their expenditure. It is vital that those courses and qualifications on offer do meet genuine workplace needs. The Victorian government have correctly identified areas of real demand and have tailored their funding program accordingly. If I am to touch on the history of the contestable funding model for vocational education and training in Victoria, it is important to note that this model is directly responsible for a plethora of new registered training organisations offering cheap-todeliver courses with no discernible educational benefit. These changes will prevent an overload of qualified people in areas where there are minimal opportunities and instead incentivise TAFEs and registered training organisations to focus their efforts on the skills that are really needed. Ultimately this should ensure that those mass offerings in courses that are not really in the public interest will be replaced with courses offering legitimate qualifications that promote the economic growth of Victoria. In fact, I believe that the Victorian government should be lauded for this move, not condemned.",182
299,Ms BURKE,BILLS," I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for La Trobe. I had to laugh out loud at the statements made by the member for Farrer. I am surprised she could keep a straight face during that contribution tonight, because she has belled the cat: the money is being ripped out of TAFEs and given to private providers. This will not assist training and diversity in our state. It will not go to the courses we need. It is going to visa factories. It is going to people getting courses in areas where we do not need training. We have demonstrated time and time again that it is a shonk. But we need to bring to the attention of the House the decision by the Baillieu Liberal-National government to rip $290 million out of the Victorian TAFE system. It is a matter of grave concern not only to Victorians but to the rest of Australia. Education and skills training offer the best path to a bright and secure future for our young people and, indeed, the many older people who use the TAFE system to re-enter the workforce. And who is to determine what the best course is? You may go and do a part-time course that gets you back into training-it may be in belly dancing, but it gets you inside the training system and you go on and do more things. Who is to undermine those TAFE courses that so many people do? TAFES are a phenomenal asset to our community. People on the other side have been bagging TAFE for centuries, and they should get over it. The Baillieu Liberal government have demonstrated that they just do not get what a TAFE system does. For many young students it is only with the qualifications and training that a TAFE provides that they can have any hope for the future. One of the best things I do each year is go to the Box Hill TAFE awards night for apprentices. Every one of those kids has a job to go to. Not everyone walking out of university has a job to go to, but every one of those apprentices already has a job to go to. We need to remember that TAFE is not just about students and training; it is about business, it is about the future, it is about skilling up our workforce and it is about ensuring that we actually provide the skills we need into the future. It is our TAFE sector that has the best connectivity with industry, and we are now denuding that in Victoria. It is something the Gillard government has long recognised, and under the COAG agreement in April we offered the Victorian TAFE system $435 million to support reforms to the VET system. Again, it is another Liberal government taking federal money and cutting their own funding. It is just a cost shift. The Gillard government has also invested $224 million in Victoria's TAFEs over the last four years. I have had the absolute delight of opening some new facilities in my electorate at both Box Hill and Holmesglen TAFEs and I will be opening the new centre at Gibbs TAFE if it survives this downturn. The Gibbs TAFE campus is in Chadstone in my seat. It is Gippsland TAFE's wonderful training facility which the Gillard government provided with $16 million. Over the next five years the Gillard government will deliver more than $2.2 billion of funding to Victoria to provide the skills that Australian businesses and individuals need to compete in our modern economy. Yet, still, the Baillieu coalition government just takes money away. There is no way you can dress this up as a good thing. In my own electorate, the future of one of the largest TAFE colleges in Victoria, Holmesglen TAFE, hangs under a dark cloud. With $25.5 million cut from its budget, Holmesglen TAFE is now faced with having to make the horrible choice between doubling fees, cutting courses or sacking staff. This is a tragic state of affairs. It is tragic for the students who are denied training opportunities and tragic for the staff who face a shocking future. It is also tragic for businesses who rely upon the skills that come out of Holmesglen. I had a work experience student in my office just two weeks ago who is doing a vocational course at Holmesglen. He said that his life will be in ruins if his course goes. Let me assure you it will be in ruins. Another TAFE college in my electorate, the phenomenal Box Hill Institute, is faced with severe cuts. John Maddock, the CEO of Box Hill and I met recently. Peter Garrett hosted a forum at Box Hill TAFE and we heard first hand about this tragic situation. John said: We're looking to minimise jobs cuts but 150 to 200 people may have to go. The estimates are around 2000 jobs will be cut from the TAFE sector across the state. Mr Maddock said the TAFE was looking at which courses it could increase student fees for and which courses would be discontinued. He went on to say: The one thing we will not do is put the quality of teaching at risk, nor will we put our links to industry at risk ... Job losses are going to vary across all the industry and courses. We would rather make an informed decision in two months' time than rush a decision. Once we do the cuts, it's hard to bring people back. That is the other thing people do not realise: getting good quality staff in TAFEs is really hard because you are competing with expertise out in the sector. Once you lose these staff you can never get them back. They will be lost forever. There is no way the Baillieu government or anybody can play this up as a good thing. It is an abomination for our state and for all Australia.",184
300,Mr CHESTER,BILLS," In joining in the debate tonight I acknowledge that this is an important issue, and I would like to put on record my support for the TAFE system and, like the member for Farrer, acknowledge that members on this side of the House strongly support TAFEs and think it is wrong to characterise the particular budget decisions in Victoria in the simplistic terms that the motion before the House seeks to do. Putting TAFE onto a sustainable footing for the future has created some short-term pain-and I will not argue about that with any of the members who have already spoken. I do have a great deal of sympathy and empathy for the students and staff who have been adversely affected by these decisions. But those opposite often lecture us on this side of the House and suggest that being in government is about making tough decisions and that it is not always easy. I think that in this case the Victorian government has had to make some very tough decisions. I listened very closely to the member for La Trobe in her speech here tonight, and there was not one mention of how we got ourselves into this mess in Victoria and the financial realities of the challenges facing the Victorian coalition government. All the rhetoric and all the trumped up indignation does not change the simple fact that the Victorian coalition government inherited Labor's financial mess. We have seen the same experience with the New South Wales budget in recent times and also the Queensland budget. It has been up to Liberals and Nationals in the coalition to clean up after Labor's mess at state level. It has always been the same. The simple fact of the matter is that Labor, in government, cannot manage money. Those opposite might not like it, but we have had this experience at federal level, when Howard and Costello were left with a $96 billion debt that they had to repay. We now have Treasurer Swan, who has had more deficits than he has probably had Sunday roasts. He has had the four biggest deficits in history and-guess what?-it is going to be up to Liberals and Nationals in coalition at some stage in the future to pay it back. I am disappointed that we seem to be having this discussion in isolation. We do not actually get to the financial realities. as if the minister, Peter Hall-whom I happen to know very well; he is a close colleague and a good friend of mine-went out of his way to inflict pain on the Victorian people, which is simply not the case. He has been presented with a set of numbers in the Victorian budgetary situation, which required urgent action to put TAFE on a sustainable footing. Those opposite might not like it. They do not want the facts to get in the road of this motion and get in the road of the story they would like to tell. But the former Victorian Labor government was reckless in the extreme. Never once did Treasurer John Brumby, and then Premier Brumby, live within his means. He was propped up by record revenue throughout his whole career as Treasurer. His spending was out of control but record revenue kept him afloat, so let us not pretend that the Victorian government in the Bracks and Brumby era was anything but reckless in the extreme with its spending. The situation with the TAFE industry, if you like, in Victoria was that the uncapped positions at TAFE colleges meant that the incoming government did not have the funding allocated to meet the demand for the positions that were provided for under the former Labor government. So we have the incoming Victorian Liberals and Nationals in coalition faced with a funding shortfall in the order of between $400 million and $500 million. It was simply unsustainable. Members opposite have gone quiet now because they know that is a fact. They were left with a significant funding shortfall. The member for La Trobe liked to talk about this as an issue of significance-and it is an issue of significance-but it was not significant enough for the former Brumby government to actually provide the financial wherewithal to make sure it was sustainable It is in the longer term. Let us not pretend that this has happened in isolation or that it happened overnight. They were left with a funding black hole and they were trying to fix up the mess left behind by John Brumby and former Premier Steve Bracks. My concern is that the experience in Victoria is happening on a wider scale throughout Australia. I am concerned that those opposite lack a diverse range of experience within their cabinet of people with direct business experience to start delivering value for money for taxpayer dollars and to control the reckless spending that we have seen. There is a severe shortage within the Australian Labor Party at state and federal level of people with direct business experience, people who have actually hired other people with their own money and had the entrepreneurial wherewithal to go out there and create wealth in our community. That is an issue for the Australian Labor Party. I am not here to give a lecture on that but it simply creates a problem when it comes to the management of the budget. This motion is, I believe, a smokescreen for Victorian Labor's financial failings in the past. I have some concerns with the impact of those cuts and I have raised them directly with the minister. The members opposite will not be surprised to hear that, particularly in a regional area where there is often a lack of alternatives for further study. I have been prepared to work with Minister Hall and I am striving to work with my local TAFE organisations, in the interests of my region and the students in it, to make sure we can keep TAFE on a sustainable footing for the future, because most regional communities do not have any alternatives. It is important that this TAFE issue has been raised here tonight but it also important to keep it in the context of the budget situation. (Time expired) Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (21:00): I would like to express my support for the motion, moved by the member for La Trobe and seconded by the member for Chisholm, criticising the funding cuts to Victorian TAFEs by the Victorian Liberal government. I have spoken about this issue in the parliament previously, highlighting the importance of vocational education and training in driving productivity and lifting workforce participation. Premier Baillieu said enrolments in the uncapped vocational education and training system had 'exploded' from 350,000 to 550,000 in two years. He said that was an unsustainable growth rate and was the reason the budget cuts were necessary. In light of the skills shortages business is screaming about, this is really a nudge and a wink from the Premier, saying, 'Don't worry-we can depend on migrant workers.' The free-market zealots in the Liberal Party would like nothing more than to drain government support from skills training and open the borders to unfettered migrant workers in a race to the bottom on wages and conditions. They miss the point that government assistance for skills training, such as that through the TAFE system, will reduce unemployment. Unemployment is a particular problem in Broadmeadows, a suburb in the neighbouring electorate of Calwell, where it is 13 per cent and where the Baillieu government's cuts to TAFE will be felt significantly by the Kangan Institute. Fiftytwo courses offered by the Kangan Institute could be cut as a result of the funding cuts. This will mean less opportunity for young people in Melbourne's north to learn skills and gain qualifications that would help them to secure a long-term job and help our state skill up its workforce. Some of the 52 courses cover some of the areas where our economy needs skills the most, including building, language studies, health and hospitality. Some of the courses are: certificate II in aviation (flight operations); advanced diploma in building surveying; certificate II in transport and logistics; certificate IV in business; course note-taking for deaf and hard of hearing people; diploma in youth work and certificate II in hospitality. These funding and course cuts come at a difficult time for young Victorians who are feeling the effects of the nation's two-speed economy and high exchange rate generated by the mining boom. According to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the unemployment rate across that Melbourne's north-west region is 6.4 per cent. Victoria has recorded the highest level of youth unemployment in Australia. Jobs figures show 22 per cent of young people aged 15 to 19 are unemployed-well above the national rate of 18 per cent. Some 14,000 Victorians aged 15 to 19 were unemployed and not attending full-time education in March, while 29,000 jobless young people were studying full time. At a time when Victorian jobs are being lost, Victoria's TAFE system needs support from the state government in order to help train and skill up young Victorians. Along with the course cuts there will be significant job losses for teaching staff. Analysis shows that more than 550 Victorian jobs will be lost by July this year: around 200 TAFE teaching and support jobs across regional Victoria, and 350 in metropolitan TAFES and dual-sector providers. In January next year, more than 1,320 further positions will be on the line, including up to 400 positions across regional TAFE providers and a further 950 at metropolitan and dualsector providers. The member for Calwell and I recently met with the chief executive officer of the Kangan Institute, Ray Griffiths, to discuss the cuts, and we subsequently wrote to Premier Baillieu urging him to investigate, immediately reinstate funding to public providers like the Kangan Institute and to reform the TAFE funding system in the context of securing public TAFE institutions. It is time to review the competition policy vocational education and training which led to an expenditure blow-out from $800 million to $1.3 billion. The blow-out referred to by the member for Gippsland was almost entirely in private provision. It would be better to put in place quality-control mechanisms and proper barriers to entry for private providers rather than attack public TAFE. Rather than seek to repair the broken funding system, these cuts punish the reputable, long standing public institutes the Kangan Institute. Private providers have been taking advantage of an uncapped system and have been putting profits before quality learning for young people. Both unions and TAFEs fear that private training colleges will abandon courses that attract lower government subsidies and switch to more highly-subsidised courses. Funding to public providers like the Kangan Institute should be reinstated and the entire TAFE funding system should be reformed in the context of securing the funding future of public TAFE institutions. These funding cuts are a short-sighted decision. We should be skilling our own workers. (Time expired)",185
301,Mr HUNT,BILLS," In speaking on this motion by the member for La Trobe regarding cuts to Victorian TAFE funding I want to deal with the legacy issues faced by the current Victorian government and focus, not on some of the doom and gloom, but on a way forward-a way to achieve better education for Victorian students. In particular, I want to deal with the prospect of a National Centre for Coasts and to Climate at Point Nepean. I will do so in three stages: firstly, looking at the vision; secondly, looking at the history; and thirdly, looking at the plan. Let me begin with the vision, because this in is about tertiary education for young people on the Mornington Peninsula who have been starved of opportunities. There are some very valuable institutions but none at the degreeawarding level-none which gives young people the opportunity to carve out a career through advanced research. The vision for a National Centre for Coasts and Climate at Point Nepean was something which began a decade ago and we have not wavered. The local community has been utterly supportive. There was a long battle to ensure that this like land, which was in the hands of Defence, was not sold off to private developers. In so doing, we would have lost two great assets: one of Australia's great headlands, refuges, parks and vistas, and the old quarantine station at Point Nepean-one of the greatest historic sites in all of Australia's built environments, which we would have seen converted. The land has been preserved-of that I am confident. The solution will be in place for the next 100 years and then, I am certain, beyond that. The buildings are the real subject of the great story to come, though. In my judgment, the history to come will be of a National Centre for Coast and Climate, conducted by Victorian universities using tertiary places allocated by the previous government. That vision comprises three elements: firstly, historic quarantine station and the museum; secondly, marine education and coasts and climate education as a centrepiece, as the mainstay, the heart, of the campus; and, thirdly, the potential for bringing the public in, whether through conferencing or well-being-the notions articulated by Andrew Fairley, the current Chair of Parks Victoria, who has been a tremendous interlocutor in this project. I now want to turn to something of the history. The community, through many fronts, worked to achieve this outcome, but the Howard government in particular put in place approximately $50 million for advancing and protecting marine and coastal education at Point Nepean and advancing and protecting the built heritage. So these elements are the historic Unfortunately, when the land was turned over from the former minister for the environment, the current member for Kingsford Smith, to the then Brumby government, much of that vision was lost, and the community work was abandoned. There are many people to thank, including Environment Victoria, and Eric Noel, my friend, who did so much work on that front; the members of the community reference group, and others. However, we are now in a position to move forward. I have had tremendous support and engagement from the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, Glyn Davis; from the Victorian minister for the environment, Ryan Smith; and from the Chair of Parks Victoria, Andrew Fairley. As we move forward, the plan is close to fruition. Parks Victoria is currently completing its analysis of marine and coastal education for the Mornington Peninsula. My federal belief is that there will be, most likely, three elements to that plan-exactly what the use-the community had always envisaged: history, education, and community use and well-being. So that is a step forward. For that we are thankful. (Time expired). Debate adjourned. 2012 London Olympic Games",188
302,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes: (a) that the 2012 London Olympics will take place from 27 July to 12 August and the Paralympics will take place from 29 August to 9 September, with London becoming the first city to host the modern Olympics on three occasions; and (b) the diversity of the Australian team, comprising athletes from all parts of Australia; (2) recognises the dedication and hard work of the legacy. extraordinary athletes that make up the Australian Olympic and Paralympic teams, and their coaches, friends and family; (3) acknowledges the unique role played by the Australian Institute of Sport in preparing athletes for the Olympics and Paralympics; and (4) wishes our athletes well in London. Fraser is the sportiest electorate in Australia. In any Olympic sport, I would pit my electorate against the electorate of any other person in this place. Of course, it helps to have the Australian Institute of Sport.! But it is also true that Canberra has plenty of nonelite athletes. Over 40 per cent of the ACT public plays some form of organised sport. The nation's capital is also its sporting capital. In my time as member for Fraser, I have had the pleasure of allocating Local Sporting Champions grants. Local Champions assists young athletes aged 12 to 18 with the costs of competing at state, national or international competitions. Over the past 18 months, I have been joined by swimmer Sally Foster and Hockeyroo Anna Flanagan to award Local Sporting Champions grants to individuals and sporting clubs in my electorate. Sally, who lives in the Fraser electorate and trains at the Australian Institute of Sport, is competing in the 200 metres breaststroke at her second Olympic Games. Sally also has a special connection to the Olympics. Her great-aunt competed in the 1936 Berlin games. On the six-week boat trip over to Germany, she and the other swimmers trained by having someone hold their arms while they kicked their legs in the small pool on board the ship. Anna Flanagan is heading to London as part of the Hockeyroos squad, playing in the position of full-back. Anna debuted for Australia against Korea in 2010 and has scored six goals in 56 international matches. She plays for the Canberra Strikers in the Australian Hockey League, and she is also studying journalism. So who knows-at some point after her hockey career is over we may see her in this place as a journalist covering the nation's politics. The AIS is a terrific facility that has been producing great athletes for many years. I know there are many athletes who live and train at the institute, each with their own unique story. I want to wish each of those AIS athletes the best for the games. London hosted the modern Olympics in 1908 and 1948. In 1939 it was granted the 1944 Games, but these were cancelled due to World War II. Had they held the Olympics in 1944, it would have been the 50th anniversary of the modern Olympics. Sporting These Olympics will be held from 27 July to 12 August, followed by the Paralympics from 29 August to 9 September. It was a pleasure this morning to join the Prime Minister and the Minister for Sport, Kate Lundy, to farewell our Paralympians. My own personal connection to the London Games is courtesy of a childhood friend, Bronwen Watson. Bronwen also trained at the AIS and is representing Australia in the women's lightweight double sculls. The winner of four world championships, she is one of the fittest and most dedicated people I know. I wish her all the best and hope that she manages to come home with gold. Her dedication and that of all of our athletes are examples of what individuals, with the support of others, can achieve. It is witnessing athletes achieving gold medals or, in some cases, simply participating, that makes the Olympics such a special event. I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the dedication and sacrifice of coaches, families and friends. No athlete makes it to the games alone and they rely heavily on the support of those close to them. So, to those friends, families and support crews, I say: thank you. My favourite Olympic moment has to be Cathy Freeman's 400-metres victory at the 2000 Games: that look of steely determination and focus; that moment as she strode away to consolidate her lead as she came out of the final turn; the sight of her sitting on the track alone in a full stadium, the relief of having carried her own and a nation's expectations. For me that moment signified more than a nation celebrating the triumph of an individual athlete. For me it was also a great moment of unification between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians, one based on rejoicing our shared histories and cultures. is my favourite moment because in that symbolic sense it managed to get the combination of Indigenous celebration and pathos. Every Olympic Games produces moments of heroism, humanity and humility. Proposed in 1894 by Pierre de Coubertin, its motto Citius, Altius, Fortius-Swifter, Higher, Stronger-will again be on display by our athletes at the Olympics and Paralympics. I wish them, and in particular those from the ACT, every success and the experience of a lifetime.",189
303,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Is the motion seconded? Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (21:15): I second the motion. I thank the member for Fraser for his motion today, which recognises the upcoming Olympic and Paralympics Games in London. Every four years, we have the opportunity to watch Australia's and the world's best athletes compete against each other at the pinnacle of human physical achievementthe year when all other sporting events pale into insignificance. We are reminded of the unwavering commitment and exertion required to become the world's best and to win that coveted gold, silver or bronze medal. There are always stories that are so inspiring that you cannot help but cry in recognition of their achievement This morning I was honoured to attend the Australian Paralympics team's launch ceremony in Parliament House. At this stage, there are 161 athletes going to London this year-the biggest team that we have sent to date. I met Dylan Alcott, who will be competing in the wheelchair basketball event this year and who has been paraplegic since birth. Dylan has truly battled adversity to lead a remarkable life. By the age of 17, he It had already been part of an Australian team which won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and again, when he was 19, at the 2010 World Championship. I also wish University of Queensland student Bridie Kean golden success in the women's wheelchair basketball event. Bridie is yet another great ambassador and team captain, and spoke so eloquently at this morning's launch. I was also fortunate to attend the St Peter's Western Swim Club's corporate relay and breakfast on 15 June at St Peter's Lutheran College in Ryan. At such a critical time in the lead-up to the games, I would like to thank all the Olympic swimmers including Mitch Larkin, Stephanie Rice, Nick D'Arcy, Kendrick Monk and Leisel Jones for taking time out of their busy schedules to support the Starlight Foundation. A big thank you also to Phil Di Bella, who matched donations on the day dollar-for-dollar so they were able to raise more than $17,000 for such a worthwhile charity. Of course, we should also record a huge thank you to all of the administrators, volunteers and athletes' family members who make such an enormous contribution to a successful Australian Olympic and Paralympics team. It is mothers like Judy Larkin, who called just the other day for an Australian flag to take over to London, who invest so much effort and dedication to ensure their children can grow up with the opportunity to represent our country. Australians would not excel in sport both domestically and on the world stage if it were not for the hard work of the Australian Institute of Sport, the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Paralympics Committee. Every year, the AIS offers hundreds of scholarships to athletes to attend the sports training institute, so that participants in 36 programs across 26 sports can use the services of skilled coaches, world-class facilities and other cutting-edge sports science and medicine services. The AIS has a reputation for being one of the best high-performance sports institutions, and our sporting community owes much to their team. I extend my appreciation to Mr John Coates AC and all members of the team at the Australian Olympic Committee for their unremitting dedication to Australia's participation and success at the Olympic Games. As Chief Operating Officer, Mr Craig Philips mentioned the preparation for the 2012 London Olympics began in 2005 when the decision to host the Olympics in the UK was announced. All athletes go through a very extensive process to be officially selected for the games, and it is the work that we do not see at the AOC that goes a long way to a smooth games event for Australian athletes. I also would like to recognise Mr Jason Hellwig and all the members of the Australian Paralympics Committee. At the launch this morning, Mr Hellwig said he was confident Australia can achieve enough gold medals to remain among the top Paralympics sporting nations in the world despite half of the team being made up of debutants. Both Olympic and Paralympics teams are looking at the ultimate goal of being in the top five for both the gold and aggregate medal tallies. We will face some very tough competition this year from traditional rivals, including China, the United States and the United Kingdom. Every Australian will be cheering for all our sportsmen and women, and I wish both teams and all our athletes all the very best. I remind Australians that the first time the Australian flag ever flew was at the 1908 London Olympics where we won the first gold medal for the rugby union.",191
304,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the motion of the member for Fraser. He and I are running partners along with you, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore. Running around Canberra, I can ensure you that our efforts are in no way Olympian-although we do our very best. The Ipswich hockey complex recently displayed a banner which said 'Good luck in London Hockeyroos and Kookaburras'. Hockey is a sport in which Australia has excelled. Australia has been in love with the Olympics since Edwin Flack was the first athlete to represent Australia. He won gold in both the 800 metres and 1,500 metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Athens, like London, has hosted the Olympics on more than one occasion. We wish our Olympians and Paralympians well. Australia has excelled in sport and, for a country of about 22 million, we certainly have punched above our weight. When we hosted the Olympics we came third and fourth in Melbourne and Sydney. There are many sports in which Australia has done well. Hockey is one sport in which we have done particularly well. Our women's basketball team has also done well in recent years. Athletics is another sport which, in its early days, Australia did well in. Who could forget Betty Cuthbert and her efforts? Australia also does well in swimming. I hate to say it, but the member for Fraser is wrong; Queensland is the sporting state which has really been the place to be, because many, many times, swimmers from other states at national championships have seen that maroon cap and have wilted, just like New South Wales do in the State of Origin-and will do so shortly! I want to mention a couple of athletes, particularly from Queensland. A girl from the Gold Coast who won silver at the Beijing Olympics is Sally Pearson, who is the current world champion in the 100-metres hurdles. She has not always had an easy life, but with courage and determination she succeeded. Who could forget the delight on her face when she realised she had won the silver medal? The other person who seems to have been around forever but is my personal favourite when it comes to swimming is Liesel Jones, a girl from Brisbane. With grace, humility and determination, she has been a wonderful success story for such a long period of time. She seems to have been there forever in our swim team. Liesel has won eight medals: three gold, four silver and one bronze. She in the company of Ian Thorpe, Dawn Fraser, Petria Thomas and Susie ONEILL-and she is there again. I am hoping that she will win a gold medal to bring her up to the elite company of Ian Thorpe, who has nine medals: five gold, three silver and one bronze. If she gets one medal over there, she will be up there with Ian Thorpe. She is another great girl from Queensland. I also want to pay tribute to the women's basketball team. I urge them to and hope that they will break the drought. They have been silver medallists for the last three Olympics against their fierce rivals, the Americans. I hope that Lauren Jackson, who in my view is the best women's basketball player ever, will lead them to victory. The Americans have frustrated us on various occasions. We have got the better of them in one world championship, but I think we really are well placed this time to beat the Americans finally. I hope they break the drought and make sure they bring home the gold medal. It would be a fitting tribute for Lauren, who burst onto the scene as a centre forward in 1998 at the young age of 17. In those days she was quite gangly and a bit awkward in the way she shot and played, but she is a powerhouse in the women's NBA and a great ambassador for us across the globe. When she has played in Russia or in America she has been known, and when she played for the Canberra Capitals-and I have to say that it is a pity she was not playing for a Queensland team-she led them to victory on many occasions. My home town of Ipswich is a great sporting capital. We have produced the likes of the Langers and the Walters. At one stage we had the whole front row of the Australian rugby league team! The Olympics have never been quite our thing; we have been more into ball sports in Ipswich, but we are is really behind them. I know the people of Ipswich and the people of Somerset will be watching keenly. I find it hard every four years: with only the exception of the world cup soccer, I think I get the most distracted by the Olympics. We wish the Olympians and the Paralympians well and thank them for their wonderful contribution to our sporting life.",192
305,Mr IRONS,BILLS," I rise to support the motion by the member for Fraser and to add a Western Australian flavour to this particular debate. The member for Blair mentioned hockey. Western Australia has not only punched well above its weight in the economy for a long time but also punched well above its weight in hockey circles. I was honoured to attend the Australian Paralympic team announcement here in the Great Hall. It was fantastic to hear that Colin Harrison from my electorate of Swan was selected, but I will go into further detail on that later. With just 65 days to go until the opening ceremony for the London Paralympic Games, our talented Olympic and Paralympic sportsmen and sportswomen selected to represent Australia are working hard to prepare for the Olympics and Paralympics. In my speech I will focus mostly on the Paralympians. Our team of over 160 dedicated athletes will compete in 13 different sports over 11 days. As President of the Australian Paralympic Committee, Greg Hartung, said at today's launch, later this year we will see London host what is expected to be the largest and most competitive Paralympic Games ever. With the London Paralympic Games expected to reach an audience of three billion people, our Australian athletes will well and truly be on the world stage. The Australian Paralympic Committee's vision for the games is 'inspire and excite'. I believe this is very fitting. As Australians we have always found ourselves inspired by those who push themselves to find success and achieve. Our athletes have done just that and are an inspiration to Australians everywhere. I will be one of the many Australians excitedly watching the games and sharing in our athletes' struggles, joy and achievements over the course of the games. I hope all my colleagues in this place and all other Australians join together to support and cheer on our Australian team. I think the running of the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot on Saturday night, when the nation watched Black Caviar win, was a warm-up for these two events. Australia's continued commitment to the Paralympic Games rings true with our Australian values. Our Aussie athletes have overcome significant adversity to achieve their goals, and every one of them has shown immense dedication to their chosen sports for many years. Our Paralympic team comprises athletes competing at an elite level. With their selection, they have demonstrated commitment, dedication and a will to achieve. Our athletes should be commended. It is not only an honour to represent our great country but an enormous honour to bring back medals through individual and team efforts which are a tribute to Australia's continued achievement in the international sporting arena. It is our athletes' high performance in their chosen fields, and not their disabilities, which defines them. I would also like to acknowledge the incredible team of support staff who will be assisting our athletes. There will be 140 officials, carers and support staff attending the games with our athletes. The high cost of care for some of the athletes makes competing difficult for many athletes. In total, 36 high-care athletes will be competing as Australian Paralympians. Australia has a rich history of participation in the Paralympic Games. Australia was one of the 23 countries who in 1960 competed in the first recognised Paralympic Games in Rome, Italy. Australia also played host to the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, which were heralded by Dr Robert Steadwood, then President of the IPC, as the best games ever. A total of 3,843 athletes from 125 different countries competed in the Sydney games, with the Australian team claiming the top spot with an astounding 149 medals. I again acknowledge Colin Harrison, of Victoria Park in my electorate of Swan, who has been selected as part of Australia's Paralympic sailing team to compete at the 2012 games. It is a fabulous achievement, and I have every faith that Colin will do the Swan electorate, the state of WA and our country proud. I would also like to acknowledge the four other incredibly talented Western Australian athletes selected to represent Australia in the London 2012 Paralympics. Nigel Barley, Darren Gardiner, Madison de Rozario and Brad Scott will also be part of the Australian team. It is a great honour to represent their country and I, along with many other Australians, will be cheering for them. All Britain should take note, particularly after the loss this morning to Italy. I wish success to our Olympians and Paralympians. NA",193
306,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Macarthur Electorate: Carbon Tax",195
307,Mr MATHESON,ADJOURNMENT," There is less than a week to go until the people of Macarthur are hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. I take this opportunity tonight to stand up for the residents, families, seniors and small business owners in my community who will suffer as a result of this tax. The big question is, why must they suffer when the government's own figures show us that the carbon tax is not going to work. The carbon tax is a $9 billion a year tax which every Australian will pay through their electricity and gas bills. In the first four years, it will total $36 billion. But, despite the carbon tax, Australia's emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes by 2020. Why? Because electricity and gas are essential services and so everyone will pay the carbon tax, not just the major polluters as the government would have us believe. The major impact of a carbon tax is to raise electricity prices. The government estimates a rise of up to 10 per cent in five years, although the electricity industry is predicting a 20 per cent rise over the next 18 months. In New South Wales, prices are going up 18 per cent, with nine per cent directly attributed to the carbon tax-that is nearly the entire price rise in the first year, instead of the government's five-year projection. I have pensioners in my electorate who are already struggling with the cost of living. all I am visiting homes in the middle of winter where it is freezing cold inside because the elderly are too scared to turn on their heaters. A significant electricity price rise from 1 July is going to hurt families in Macarthur. Most of them are already using electricity responsibly. It does not matter how much it costs them, they are still going to have to turn on the lights, cook the dinner, do the washing, use a computer and of course heat their homes. And let us not forget small business owners-they will have no choice but to take on the burden of these price rises or pass the cost on to their customers and risk losing business. Earlier this month, the shadow minister for climate action and the environment, Greg Hunt, came to Macarthur for a community forum. We met with many local business owners, including Simon Bradbury, who owns Stockade Pies in Queen Street. 'Simon the Pieman' said he will have to make and sell an extra 8,000 pies per year to cover the cost of a carbon tax on his business. This is a man who represents so many like him in my electorate who are trying to support their families and my community with no help or compensation from this government. I have recently visited many manufacturers in Macarthur to see how the carbon tax will affect their business. Most of them have said that they will be worse off, and that the carbon tax could not come at a worse time. They are already struggling against the high Australian dollar, and soon they will be paying the carbon tax while their overseas competitors will not have to. In recent months, I have met with businesses such as Nepean Engineering, the TRN Group, Narellan Town Grocer & Deli, Narellan Planet Health cafe, George's on Queen cafe, Sports Spirit, Funnell's Electrical, and many other local businesses concerned about this tax and the impact it will have on their businesses. Some have even written clauses into their contracts which warn customers of the possible price rises that will be passed on once the carbon tax begins on 1 July. And do not get me started on the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation that will see the government use taxpayers' money to buy shares in green projects which the private sector will not back-that is an absolute and total joke. What puzzles me most is that under this Labor-Greens policy, instead of reducing Australia's emissions, firms will have to purchase 94 million tonnes of carbon permits overseas each year by 2020. By 2050, it will equate to 1.5 per cent of GDP. How will this help Australia reduce its own emissions and improve our environment? Not one country currently imposes an economy-wide tax on greenhouse emissions or has in place an economy-wide ETS. The US, Canada, India, China and Japan have all made it clear that they are not moving to a broad based carbon tax model like Australia's. The European Emissions Trading Scheme does not cover the whole economy and provides many industries with free emissions permits. Europe's scheme raised only about $500 million a year, while Labor's carbon tax will raise more in three months than Europe's has in five years. With a population of just over 500 million, the European scheme raised just over one dollar per person per year. With a population of less than 23 million, Labor's carbon tax will raise almost $400 per person per year. The government claims that China is acting to reduce its carbon emissions, but China's emissions are forecast to rise by 500 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020. In fact, Garnaut's own climate change papers tell us that between 2005 and 2020, Chinese emissions will increase from around 5 billion tonnes of CO2 per annum to over 12 billion tonnes of CO2 per annum. Then we have Australia with the most expensive carbon tax in the world-it starts at $23 per tonne, but it will keep on going up and up and up. Treasury estimates it will be $29 per tonne in 2016; $37 per tonne in 2020; and more than $350 per tonne in 2050. Like the people of Macarthur, the coalition believes we need to protect our environment today and for future generations. Our Direct Action Plan delivers on Australia's commitment to a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. (Time expired) Calwell Electorate: Graffiti Prevention",195
308,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," The Hume City Council in my electorate of Calwell last week received $127,830 of federal government funding aimed at fighting graffiti in our local community. The funding for this project comes from the Proceeds of Crime Fund, which is money confiscated under Commonwealth laws to be used for crime prevention. The funding was awarded to Hume City Council and its partner, The Salvation Army Crossroads, so that they can implement the Write Signal Project, which is part of the council's current graffiti prevention strategy. This strategy has been developed to deal with the increase of the rate of graffiti in our municipality. The project is intended, on the one hand, to help curb visual vandalism and also, on the other, to encourage graffiti artists to express their creativity in a socially acceptable manner. Graffiti is illegal in Victoria and it is common knowledge that local councils spend thousands of dollars every year to clean it up. I welcome the approval by the Minister for Home Affairs of this significant amount of money for my electorate. Graffiti is not a new phenomenon and, in fact, in recent times it has made a bit of a comeback; less as visual vandalism and more as credible artistic expression, now known as street art, with a special social commentary. But there is a fine line between credible artistic expression and the damage to property and imposition of costs that follow because of the need to clean up the damage caused. Most graffiti, particularly the lowest grade, tends to upset many people in the same way that way that vandalism does. It impacts on state and territory governments, local government, police, public transport and utility providers, local communities and young people in a variety of ways. Hume council's strategy, which is a combination of graffiti removal and educational programs, is paying dividends, with an notable increase in the amount of graffiti being reported by residents. In recent offences. months the Hume graffiti vans, as they are known, have been particularly active in Craigieburn and Roxburgh Park. In October 2011, 1,170 square metres of graffiti was removed in those two suburbs alone. That compares with an average of 900 square metres per month that was removed in the 2010-11 financial year. The Director of City Infrastructure, Steve Crawley, has said the response from the community to the council's 1300 hotline and other anti-graffiti measures has been very positive. Hume council's education campaign in local schools has also created a new generation of 'Graffiti Warriors' who are proud of the city they are growing up in and want to keep their communities clean. Although graffiti is an issue of concern for many of our community members insofar as it is seen as delinquent behaviour, there has been limited criminology research exploring the characteristics of graffiti offences and offenders and the impact that graffiti has on communities. But residents, retailers and visitors often feel that graffiti contributes to or causes an atmosphere of neglect and urban decay and that the presence of graffiti in an area can distort perceptions about the actual level of crime and safety in that area. Local police youth liaison officers have indicated that many young people are committing the crime of graffiti vandalism due to boredom, lack of direction and lack of support structures. They have identified that young graffiti artists are using graffiti as a form of self-expression, but that it is also perceived by the community as antisocial behaviour. In 2010, 27 people in my electorate of Calwell were charged with graffiti related offences. In Broadmeadows there were about 76 reported cases and in Craigieburn there were 57 reported cases. Crime data indicates that teenagers in the 15to 17-year age bracket are the most prolific in numbers of detected I want to congratulate Hume council for its very important Write Signal project. One of its main objectives is to facilitate an education program for young people in high schools, as I have mentioned. I would like to thank Hume City Council and its partner, Salvation Army Crossroads, who work very hard with our young people in order to improve our neighbourhoods and make life easier for the young people who wish to engage in creative artistic expression. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (21:40): We are now six days away from the launch of the carbon tax-the tax that dares not speak its name. I would like to use this opportunity to advise the people of Herbert and Townsville just what to watch out for. The government talk a good game-they do not even mention the tax in any of the as. They will tell you that they are overcompensated for the tax. But what is the truth? We will find out in the months ahead, but there are a few things about which I think you should be very aware. Those people who will be receiving compensation must realise that it stops at the front door. It will not help you with the incurred by business. It will not help you with the food you buy, the bus you catch, the repairs to your roads, the dump where you take your rubbish or the council trucks that collect your bin. All of those costs have passed on. Of course, businesses have the option to absorb the costs themselves, but we all know what has to happen: the costs will be passed on to the consumer. I have talked to my butcher, Paul Bonner, from Sunvale Meats. He employs 12 staff and provides excellent service and sells excellent product. There are a few very good butchers in Townsville so he knows that presentation, service and product all go hand in hand. His power supplier has advised him that his electricity bill will go up by as as 22 per cent from 1 July. He does not want to hurt his customers but he cannot absorb the costs either. He will never sacrifice service, product or presentation, and his staff are central to that premise. He may simply have to pass on the costs. In Friday's Townsville Bulletin the owners of Lamberts Produce told how they are buying up big before 1 July to try and get the last of the quality cheap product. Tom Kennedy, a partner in Lamberts, said: I hope the government bean counters have got it right. This carbon tax is going to bite-I expect more than what the Government wants us to believe. If it wasn't, why are they handing out all this money in payments to households? Why indeed? I received a letter from a constituent, Scott, who stated the case on the cost of refrigerant gases. He told me about the sale of HC refrigerant gases from 1 July. The carbon tax will be huge on these gases. Today, a normal re-gas for a commercial fridge will cost you around $80. From 1 July, due to the carbon tax, it will cost over $250. costs There are two issues here. Firstly, the refrigeration mechanics who do this work will now be exposed to a greater number of defaults, which will eat into their cash flow, thus eroding their business plans. Secondly, to be HC gases R600 and R290 are butane and propane based and are currently unregulated. If we do not watch out, we will have people going into hardware stores and doing it themselves at home. This, my friends, could be very dangerous to a lot of people. You will see every business which uses electricity cop it from this tax. Bakers, by the very nature of their business, are heavy power users as compared to the dress shop next door in the shopping centre. Their costs will rise, as will the cost of the bread you much buy. So, please, when you turn up and it costs you more for your bread, don't blame the kid behind the counter. Blame this government. When the shadow minister for the environment, Greg Hunt, asked the Prime Minister a question today about the rising cost of power for small business, she ducked and dived. She did not answer or even address the question because she knows full well, as does her government, what is going to happen here. But, then again, this government does not care about small business and it certainly does not care about the people who will pay this poorly constructed, poorly consulted carbon tax. And to what end? By how much will our carbon output drop? Nothing. It will rise, and we will have to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion buying carbon credits from countries overseas to 'meet our targets'. All this money churn and it does nothing. Fair dinkum, you would have to be as thick as railway china to come up with this idea. Make no mistake, a coalition government will rescind this bad, bad tax and will replace it with something that works, that will drive down the use of carbon in our atmosphere but do it in a way that actually does something in Australia not overseas. This side of the House under Tony Abbott will provide the people of Herbert, Townsville, and North Queensland with hope for a better world, the reward for effort, and opportunity for everyone in my city, my region and my state to provide for themselves, their families and their future generations. Chifley Electorate: Western Sydney Wanderers",196
309,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT," In April this year the federal government made two significant announcements which will bring lasting benefits to young people who play football in Western Sydney. First, we announced a special $5 million program to help lift grassroots participation in the game. As patron of the Mt Druitt Town Rangers Football Club and in an electorate where it is estimated there are nearly 10,000 people who play football, I was delighted that the government had committed so generously, boosting participation in what is already one of the most popular of all codes in Sydney. In 2010 there were approximately 90,000 registered footballers in Western Sydney playing in junior and senior competitions, accounting for over 20 per cent of participants nationally. There are more registered football participants in Western Sydney than in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT combined, with approximately 374 state, league or grassroots clubs operating in the region. Over 50 per cent of the 400-plus Socceroos have hailed from Western Sydney, including Tim Cahill, Mark Schwarzer, Bossa Bosnich, Mark Bosnich, Harry Kewell, Brett Emerton, Paul Haakon and more. The other major announcement made by Football Federation of Australia CEO, Ben Buckley, in April was the inclusion of a Western Sydney team in the Hyundai ALeague. News of a Western Sydney franchise was welcomed by the entire community but most notably by the football fraternity. While many will lay claim to the origins of football in Australia, Western Sydney has a compelling place in the game's history. The first recorded match played in New South Wales under association football rules took place when the Wanderers played the King's School rugby team at the Parramatta Common on 14 August 1880. In the A-league's predecessor competition, the National Soccer League, there were four and sometimes five Western Sydney teams represented. These were: four-time premiers Marconi Stallions, the Melita Eagles, twotime premiers Sydney Olympic, and threetime runners-up Sydney United, formerly Sydney Croatia. In the 1980s a Blacktown City team also played in the comp. Given the region's strong links to the game of football, it was fitting today that the new Western Sydney franchise was unveiled as the Western Sydney Wanderers, the same name as that first team. And when they make their debut in October against the Central Coast Mariners, they will be wearing a striking home strip designed by their apparel sponsor, Nike, which will consist of a redand-black hooped jersey with white shorts and black socks. The colours and the name reflect the wishes of Western Sydney fans who flock to the FFA's fan nights held all over Western Sydney. The club has a great deal of building to do in the months ahead, but they have a CEO in Lyle Gorman and they have signed a coach and three players all with links to Head coach, Tony Popovic, has returned where it all began for him. Tony grew up in Fairfield in Western Sydney. He began his career with Sydney United before moving to the J-league in Japan and eventually signing with Crystal Palace in the UK. His career, an impressive career, included 58 appearances for the Socceroos over 11 years, scoring eight goals. Like many others who grew up in Western Sydney, I am delighted the game's heartland is being represented in its premier competition for the first time since 2004. This is terrific news and I cannot wait to see them play. While few of the game's founders will still be around, I am sure that many of their children and grandchildren are still active and involved in the game in Western Sydney and they will rejoice when a local team proudly takes to the field in the Aleague. Our funding the game where it is played most will pay dividends in the years to come both in terms of the social fabric but also our sporting prowess. Finally, on the day when we welcome our own A-league side, I want to recognise that today is Matilda's star and Quakers Hill resident Kyah Simon's 21st birthday. I hope she has had a great day. Best wishes to a terrific ambassador of the game and a magnificent ambassador for our region. Carbon Pricing",199
310,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT," Thank you for the opportunity, Madam Deputy Speaker. On 2 June this year, I celebrated 50 years of wonderful marriage to a beautiful woman. That beautiful woman presented me with a new wedding band and in that wedding band there is a piece of carbon. I was just wondering whether those geniuses on the other side would tell me how much emission this little diamond is going to emit the region. to create a problem for us. The other point that I want to raise tonight is the issue of the $36 billion tax on the Australian people in the way of a carbon tax. It is quite obviously not going to decrease carbon emissions and in fact emissions will increase from 2012 to 2020, by 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes. It is obviously a flawed policy reliant on shutting down power stations and buying carbon credits overseas where companies can come into this country and participate in the wonderful treasure trove that is there in the way of cash carbon credits from this incompetent government. And what about wind turbines? Wind turbines are going up in ever-increasing numbers, dividing our communities and creating massive social problems. What do they produce, or what are they producing at the moment-and I do not think that it is likely to increase-about two per cent of our energy requirement. How the hell are we going to replace coal fired power stations and gas fired turbines and even hydro driven turbines which create and generate electricity with those sorts of inefficient energy replacements? Electricity companies will pay the most, and they are passing that cost directly to customers. I have pensioners coming to me concerned about the fact that they are paying at the moment about 60 per cent more for their power than they paid for it last year, and many of them are turning their heaters off, going to bed and putting extra blankets on the bed to keep warm at night in this very cold time of the year. I have had a contractor come to me who employed five people two years ago in his solar and electricity business. He was drawing about $1.6 million into his company. Two years ago it was $2 million. At the end of this financial year, he anticipates that he will only pull in about $300,000. He has dismissed all of his employees because he can no longer afford to pay them. He tells me that he has to supplement his income because he will not make enough money out of what he is producing to live his normal life with his family in the community. I asked him what the problem was and he said, 'Simply, Alby, people have stopped spending.' That is a very significant part of what is happening in the retail business in this great country is a national disgrace that any government of any political persuasion would bring this sort of penalty down on people who are working hard trying to make a living and being so rewarded for the Australian dream of many years. I have spent a significant amount of my working life in abattoirs. I visited a number of abattoirs in the last two or three months to find out what is going to happen to them in terms of the 10 per cent hike in the carbon tax as well as what is going to occur with state parliament increases because of rundown infrastructure. The average electricity increase in those abattoirs is going to be about $120,000 a year. A company man from Sarajane Furniture in Cowra which employs about 130 people tells me he will be able to survive for about two years. He uses an enormous amount of machinery which requires a significant amount of electricity to process his furniture. He reckons that he can absorb the cost for about two years, but eventually the escalating price of the electricity is going to put him out of business. Media",200
311,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT," Over recent months we have heard much about the need to review the laws which regulate our media. The debate has been prompted by a range of developments, including the scandal involving the Murdoch press in the UK, an apparent decline in the standards of journalistic ethics here in Australia and the rapidly changing media landscape, driven mainly by technological change. In more recent weeks, public discourse has risen to new heights thanks to the restructuring decisions of both News Limited and Fairfax and the refusal of Fairfax suitor Gina Rinehart to commit to the Fairfax charter of of ours. It editorial independence. My views on these matters are well documented and I will continue to argue for new laws to ensure diversity of ownership, high standards in journalistic ethics and the retention of acceptable levels of local content. We have had enough inquiries; it is time to act. Both the Finkelstein inquiry and the Convergence Review urge us to do so. We need more independence in the oversight of media behaviour and we need a public interest test to protect diversity. The recent intense focus on the changing media landscape and questions about what is an appropriate government response-and the slowness of those responses-have pushed to the background another important debate. That is the need for a more active government approach to the question of privacy. It is now four years since the Australian Law Reform Commission delivered its seminal report on privacy. The product of two years of research, the inquiry deserves the attention of each and every person who serves in this place. A key recommendation of the inquiry was the establishment of a statutory cause of action in privacy, commonly known as a tort of privacy. The reality is that, in the 21st century, when a mobile phone camera can send an image or video viral in an instant, we need new and strengthened privacy laws. These issues are more important in a world in which the print media in particular are feeling the weight of technological change. We have seen some of the consequences over the course of the past week. Their response has been misrepresent, sex up and do everything possible to create a better story. In some cases, whether the facts are accurate or inaccurate has not been a matter of concern for the publishers. It has been all about circulation and advertising sales in an environment where the print media is under enormous economic pressure. Arguments that sufficient protection already exists in the area of privacy under the common law or the tort of trespass or for breaches of confidence are simply wrong. To argue that there are protections in the the Australian Press Council is absolutely laughable. We have seen the results of that over many years. We have seen the results of self-regulation. We have seen the capacity of the media organisations to withdraw from the Australian Press Council at their will when it suits them. This is no longer sustainable. It is no longer acceptable. The media will continue to argue that the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations are a threat to freedom of speech and democracy as we know it. This, of course, is just rubbish and there is no shortage of academics around the country prepared to support my case. A statutory right to privacy would clarify the law for us all, both individuals and media organisations. It is in the interests of all of us; it is in the national interest. None of us should be fearful of it. It is a good thing for the country, and the government should now embrace those recommendations in the same way that it should embrace the recommendations of the Finkelstein inquiry and the recommendations of the Convergence Review. Some people say that I speak with a jaundiced view on these things because I have experienced these things myself. That qualifies me. I have seen the way the media can misrepresent the facts. to embellish, (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",201
312,Ms ODWYER,ADJOURNMENT," For the first time in living memory an Australian government is introducing what it claims is an 'economic reform' that will have the effect of reducing our nation's productivity and competitiveness. By introducing a price on the most essential component of an economy-energy-the government's $9 billion a year carbon tax, by its very design, will increase input costs and will have the effect of either reducing outputs or reducing form of consumption, or both. Given that the Treasurer has said in the past that productivity is essential to the nation's prosperity, it is mind-boggling that he would be implementing an economic change that, in his words, is the 'next frontier' in economic reform by lowering, not increasing, productivity. And all this at a time that the Treasurer acknowledges as the most turbulent since the Great Depression. It is disingenuous and dishonest for the Prime Minister and Treasurer to claim to be undertaking a productivity agenda while they introduce the world's largest carbon tax, well ahead of the rest of the world. They should heed the warnings of the Productivity Commission in their report, where they stated: … no country currently imposes an economywide tax on greenhouse gas emissions or has in place an economy-wide ETS. It was evident only last week at the latest in a long list of failed UN and other conferences that the Rio summit brought the world no closer to a global agreement on carbon pricing. If anything, it was made clear that many of our trading partners are headed in the other direction, of abandoning plans to introduce economy-wide carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes-if indeed they ever had plans in the first instance. The United States, Canada, Japan and Russia have all moved away from a carbon price. Similarly, the emissions trading scheme that exists in Europe is a $500 million a year tax and is not economy wide. The European carbon price has dropped to around $10 a tonne and is progressively going down. The government has dismissed the effects of introducing a productivity-crippling carbon tax on trade-exposed industries, and this reeks of arrogance and ignorance. The government claims that only the 'top 500 polluters' will pay. This is plain wrong. If a business finds itself in a position where input costs have increased with no productivity offset, they have two options: pass it on through higher prices and inflation, or absorb the costs. In the latter, in order to protect most crucial factor-profit margins-the company must reduce expenditure, and the first casualty is always jobs. I hear so many examples from business and the not-for-profit sector about the impact of the carbon tax. Most recently at one of my mobile office meetings one of my constituents, who runs a business in carton packaging, has calculated that his business faces an increased electricity bill of around $500,000 this year alone. This does not include indirect costs such as increased prices of freight, stock, materials and auxiliary services such as lawyers and accountants. This company is already trying to manage a high Australian dollar while fighting off competition from cheaper alternatives out of South-East Asia and China. This company can either shed jobs to recoup losses, increase prices and risk losing more business to its international competitors, or take its manufacturing offshore. There is no compensation for this business. This example exposes the great green delusion of the government's carbon tax policy. The dangerous carbon pollution that they say the carbon tax will reduce will simply be produced offshore, in countries that do not have the stringent environmental policies that Australia does. Far from reducing emissions, emissions will increase because the demand for these products will not disappear. Products will simply be sourced from other countries. For a policy that has been promoted as both economic and environmental, the real effects are, in fact, significantly damaging to both. What is rarely and not clearly explained is the compounding nature of the carbon tax. Unlike the GST, the carbon tax does not replace any other taxes; it is simply an additional one. It cannot be credited against any carbon tax collected, like the GST. If the one is to apply Michael Porter's value chain model to the carbon tax, the incredibly detrimental effects the tax will have on inflation become abundantly clear. But do not just take my word for it. Listen to the words of business leaders in Australia like Graham Kraehe AO, chairman of Brambles and BlueScope Steel, who said that 'the inflationary impact is almost certainly understated'. We know that the carbon tax will have a detrimental impact on our economy and on the Australian people. The government still refuses to listen. The coalition will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians by abolishing the carbon tax. (Time expired) Climate Change",202
313,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Bearing in mind the speeches by the opposition tonight, I hope they listen to what I have to say. Despite the relentless denials of global warming by vested interests that support the opposition, evidence supporting government's decision to take measures to combat climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions grows ever stronger. The unprecedented floods in eastern Australia and the record heatwaves and high temperatures in the south-west of Western Australia last summer, together with significantly reduced rainfall levels, all correspond to the well-tested predictions of climate change models. In Australia, rain-bearing weather systems driven by higher than average Indian Ocean temperatures have dumped record-breaking rainfall in the eastern states, while around world exceptional conditions have led to extremes of heat and cold. On 2 March this year in some locations in Victoria-Madam Deputy Speaker, I know you would be aware-rainfall broke monthly records in just a single day, and Wodonga recorded 88 millimetres of rainfall in a few hours, which broke the previous March monthly record of 84 millimetres set in 1926. An estimated 70 per cent of New South Wales was flooded or under threat of flooding on 5 March during a time that is normally one of the driest months of the year. The United States has experienced its fourth warmest winter since records began in 1895 and, while still in what was technically winter, the country experienced a weather pattern normally seen in early summer. Many areas experienced temperatures 10 to 22 degrees above average. At the same time 650 people died in Europe and Asia in February. They were frozen to death in the intense cold that has been linked to changes in atmospheric circulation caused by global warming. Whilst ignoring the record-breaking temperatures in North America, climate change deniers deceitfully point to the frigid European and Asian temperatures as the evidence that global warming is not occurring. Of course, selective use of the evidence by climate change deniers is not new, but the exceptional conditions experienced in the northern hemisphere do deserve a brief explanation. The recent freezing conditions in Europe have been associated with changes in the weather system, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, together with reductions in sea ice in the Barents-Kara Sea located to the north of Norway and European Russia. Professor Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact the Research explained that the current weather pattern: … fits earlier predictions of computer models for how the atmosphere responds to the loss of sea ice due to global warming. He further said: The ice-free areas of the ocean act like a heater as the waters are warmer than the Arctic air above it. This favours the formation of a high-pressure system near the Barents Sea, which steers cold air into Europe. Of course, none of this evidence for the growing impact of global warming driven by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is of any consequence to the opposition. Ignorance is not evidence, nor should it be the basis of policy, despite the claims of the opposition to the contrary. The CSIRO's report, State of the climate 2012, paints an alarming picture of the ongoing deleterious effects of the cumulative effects of carbon dioxide emissions on the world's climate. The report notes that the long-term warming trend is continuing, each decade having been warmer than the previous decade since the 1950s. The warming trends observed around Australia are consistent with global-scale warming that has been measured during recent decades, despite 2010 and 2011 being the coolest years recorded in Australia since 2001. Importantly, however, 2010 and 2011 constituted the wettest two-year period ever recorded in Australia. I am sure that, given the evident hostility of the opposition to the CSIRO and the important work of its scientists, were the opposition to take over the government of our country the CSIRO would be forced to change its name from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to the Climate Science Information Rejection Organisation. Carbon Pricing",204
314,Mr WYATT,ADJOURNMENT," Those were very interesting comments from the previous speaker, but I rise today to speak about the damage that this government is set to inflict on the constituents in the electorate of Hasluck, which I represent. The carbon tax is a $9 billion a year tax which every Australian will pay through their electricity and gas bills. In the first four years it will total $36 billion. Despite this poor policy decision, Australia's emissions will actually increase from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes by 2020. Instead of reducing Australia's emissions, firms will have to purchase 94 million tonnes of carbon permits overseas each year by 2020. The government estimates a rise in electricity prices of up to 10 per cent in five years, although the electricity producers are predicting 20 per cent increases over the next 18 months. Families still have to turn on the lights, cook the dinner, do the washing, run a computer and have heating and cooling. Small businesses face the same price measures but will have no option but to pass on the cost to their customers, forcing prices up in general. The carbon tax comes at the worse possible time for manufacturers, who are struggling against a high Australian dollar, while their overseas competitors do not have this specific increased cost pressure. I have received hundreds of emails and telephone messages from the community of Hasluck. Let me read out just two quotes from emails that have been sent to me in the last week: I am a Service widow, surviving on a very low service DFRDB pension … The carbon tax will see the end of any small amount of spare money I can find. Why should I be paying this when there is no reason for Australia to have this tax? Also I will not be one of the ones compensated for the tax. I don't speak up normally, but my very existence is now in question. That was from a pensioner in the north of Hasluck. These are pretty damning words which show how, with the heartlessness of the Gillard government, no heart and no compassion prevails. The next quote comes from someone in the far south of my electorate: As your constituent, I am writing to you to demand a repeal of the unnecessary, destructive tax on carbon dioxide. This tax will hurt me and my family, as electricity prices go up, the price of goods will go up, and jobs in our local community will be lost. This tax will do nothing to help the environment and is based on a lie. I call upon you to publicly call for its repeal. As I have said before, there are literally hundreds of similar emails or letters that I could read out today. Small businesses are also very concerned, for many reasons. Firstly, where is their compensation for this tax? Where is their money coming from every week to offset the increases in utility prices? It will not be coming. That is why the costs will be passed on to their customers-and this is an environment that is hardly conducive to extra burdens being placed on our small businesses. Another cause of concern is the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will see the government use taxpayers' money to buy shares in green projects which the private sector will not back. How many government members have invested their super funds in clean energy projects? Green small businesses setting up will get the government handouts to launch their businesses in my electorate, despite the possibility of not being a financially viable project or having already been knocked back by a bank for finance. What a great way of getting a risk-free loan when credible financial institutions will not fund these initiatives. This creates an unlevel playing field and further hurts small businesses that are already under siege. The European ETS has raised only $500 million a year, while Labor's carbon tax will raise more in three months that Europe's did in five years, according to the Weekend Australian of 9 July 2011. With a population of just over 500 million, the EU scheme raised just $1 per person. With a population of less than 23 million, Julia Gillard's carbon tax will raise more than $400 per person per year. Meanwhile, the US, Canada, India, China and Japan have all made it clear that they are not moving to a broad-based carbon tax model like Australia's. Whatever spin and deceit comes from the government, the people of Hasluck and around the nation know that the next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax. If elected, the coalition will repeal the carbon tax as soon as possible. In contrast to this pie-in-the-sky policy of the Labor Party, the coalition's direct action plan will deliver on Australia's commitment to a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. It is a simpler way and delivers better environmental outcomes without a carbon tax that drives up prices for families and businesses in Hasluck. Carbon Pricing",205
315,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT," I agree with the constituent quoted by the member for Hasluck that her very existence is in danger, but not for the reasons statedrather, because of dangerous climate change. Next week we come to a juncture where we will for the first time put a price on carbon and, in so doing, move Australia along the path of innovation and sustainability and away from the old road of fossil fuel dependence and degeneration. The driving imperative for the carbon price has been clear for some time: it is the need to reduce Australia's carbon emissions as part of a shared international commitment to global emission reductions. It is aimed at limiting the increase in average global temperatures by the end of this century to two degrees above pre-industrial levels. Beyond that level of global temperature increase we know that the consequences will be grave and extremely difficult to mitigate. This is not an unlikely hypothetical scenario; current commitments, including Australia's, are putting us on track to global warming of at least four degrees. Consider the impacts of the 0.8 degree temperature rise that we are already seeing in Australia. Extreme weather events are at the forefront of our national consciousness. Residents of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are still picking up the pieces after large scale flooding and cyclones. In WA, extended periods of hot, dry weather and low rainfall have led to out-of-control bushfires. We are also seeing coral bleaching on our reefs, species migrations and so on. If this is the effect of a 0.8 degree temperature rise, you do not have to be NASA's head climate scientist to see that the effect of a fivefold increase in temperatures by the end of the century will be catastrophic. In March, the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology released the State of the climate 2012 report, confirming the global warming trend based on ground, ocean and satellite based observations. In late 2011, leading international climate scientists attended the Four Degrees or More? conference at Monash University. The final report from that conference documents projected and expected devastating impacts of an average temperature increase of four degrees by 2100 on the economy, on terrestrial species and ecosystems, on marine and coastal environments, on agriculture and food security, on human health, on cities and towns and on regional security, where it is expected that drought and food shortages, sea level rise and storms will dislocate hundreds of millions of people already referred to by some as 'climate change refugees'. Across Asia and the Pacific, in such a situation there will be no stopping the boats. Earth and palaeoclimate scientist Dr Andrew Glikson of ANU has noted that what is significant is the pace at which the climate is changing. It is changing so fast species will not be able to adapt. He has written that the rate of greenhouse gas rise of about plustwo parts per million CO2 per year is the fastest rate identified in the geological records of the last 65 million years. This is underlined too by the 2011 UN Environment Program report, which states: There is alarming evidence that important tipping points, leading to irreversible major ecosystems and the planetary climate system, may already have been reached or passed. The irresistible rationale for introducing a price on carbon is that carbon has a cost. The urgency is founded on the fact that climate change is occurring and will deliver environmental, social, health and economic impacts that must be avoided. The exhaustive social and economic analysis in this country and elsewhere shows that it will be both more effective and cheaper if we act to interdict as much of the consequences of global warming as early as we possibly can. That view is shared by 89 developed and developing countries, which together make up more than 80 per cent of global emissions, and that also make up approximately 90 per cent of the global economy. The Australian government accepts our part of the challenge. With approximately 1.5 per cent of global emissions, there are only 10 countries contributing more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than Australia and, of course, we contribute the most on a per capita basis. It is absolutely right that a country like Australia, with a strong and well-developed high-carbon economy, and with a tradition of making key contributions to efforts that require international cooperation, now play its part in the urgent global effort to address climate change. But it is also urgent that we put Australia in a position to participate in the burgeoning renewable energy and energy efficiency economy. Total global investment in renewable power and fuels reached $211 billion in 2010, a 32 per cent increase on 2009 and approximately 5½ times the investment made in 2004. While the steep climb in global renewable investment is very welcome, it is also a clear reminder that the world is moving very fast in this area, and we would be kidding ourselves if we thought Australia was leading the charge or even changes in going out on a limb here. I think it is vitally important to emphasise that both the economics and the science are guiding the government's actions on the carbon price. Recently American scientist Daniel Nocera noted that every year our burning fossil fuels will release a million years of photosynthesis. By putting a price on carbon we are making that step across the line that divides a wasteful, irresponsible dangerous past from a forward-looking, inventive and sustainable future, and 1 July is an important milestone in that regard. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (22:20): I was very interested to hear the comments of the member for Reid tonight. My advice to him would be not to sell his coat. Last month here in Canberra was the coldest May in 50 years. Across the Tasman, in Christchurch, only two weeks ago they had their coldest day ever recorded-going back to 1860. However, that is not what I rose to speak about tonight. The question I wanted to pose to the House is: if you deliberately wanted to undermine our nation's prosperity and if you deliberately wanted to inflict harm upon the Australian nation, what would you do? The very first thing you would do is attack our national competitive advantage-our lowcost electricity-and that is what this government plans to do with its carbon tax. By imposing the world's largest carbon tax upon the Australian nation, this government is undermining the very foundations of our prosperity. We have the absolute absurdity that, under Labor's carbon tax, Australian coal can be shipped to any one of the massive new coal-fired power plants that China is building to drive prosperity in China. But, if we use that same piece of coal here in an Australian power station, it would be subject to Labor's carbon tax. This policy will simply place Australian businesses at a competitive disadvantage and drive jobs offshore for absolutely zero environmental gain. The second thing you would do, if you wanted to undermine our national prosperity and if you wanted to deliberately inflict harm upon the Australian nation, is peddle the Hollywood fantasy that we can drive our and economy with wind turbines and solar panels. These sources of power will only ever be tokenistic and their use cannot change the temperature of the globe. The third thing you would do, if you wanted to undermine our national prosperity, is make an all-out assault upon small business-and that is exactly what this tax does. It is a vicious and destructive tax that will be imposed upon hundreds of thousands of the small businesses which provide most of the jobs for people in Australia. The fourth thing you would do, if you wanted to damage our nation and undermine our national prosperity, is seek to destroy the dream of home ownership for the average Australian citizen-and that is exactly what this government plans to do. The level of home ownership in Australia rose sharply after 1947, when only 53 per cent of Australian families owned their own home. The ownership rate for families continued to rise steadily during the Howard years. But, as the recent census has revealed, there has been a shocking reversal of the trend in home ownership. There has been a decline in home ownership under this Labor government which is believed to be the sharpest on record outside a recession. Labor are set to make this situation worse, with the Housing Industry Association estimating that the carbon tax will add $5,000 to $6,000 to the cost of the average home. Simply put, this carbon tax will make it harder for the average Australian to own their own home. The fifth thing you would do, if you sought to damage our nation and undermine our national prosperity, is peddle fear and doom to our children and make them pessimistic about the future-and that, as we have heard in tonight's speeches, is exactly what this government is doing. They have used propaganda to indoctrinate our children about an impending climate apocalypse in which all the polar bears will die and millions of people will drown as a result of rising seas levels-and in which those left alive are going to experience endless drought and violent storms. This is exactly what this government is doing through scaremongering of its climate change commissioner. Finally, if you wanted to damage Australia, you would undermine trust in our political system. Again, that is exactly what this Labor government has done through the breaking of the promise made by the Prime Minister, in the dying days before the last election, that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. In short, if you wanted to damage the Australian nation and undermine our national prosperity, you would be supporting the policies of this Labor government and you would be here in this chamber supporting this carbon tax. So it is no surprise that, the anniversary of the coup d'etat inspired Labor's faceless men which deposed the member for Griffith, we see most members of the government, rather than having celebrations and merriment, walking around the House as though they were on their way to a wake. (Time expired) Coalmining Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (22:25): I commend all members of the House who were able to keep a straight face during the contribution of the member for Hughes just now-particularly during the part of his dissertation where he condemned those on this side of the House for 'peddling fear and doom', when what we have seen from those opposite, and particularly from the member for Hughes, is a 12-month campaign of nothing but fear and doom. I will have a few things to say about that during this adjournment address, because on this side of the House jobs and employment are our priority. In the Illawarra and Southern Highlands region, there are still many locals who are locked out of the benefits of the resources boom. Since speaking recently in parliament the about these issues, I have been contacted by many constituents who are desperate to find employment in one of these resource projects. Against this backdrop it was very welcome news for the people of the Illawarra when last Friday BHP Billiton approved an $833 million investment in coal mining ventures in the Illawarra. This represents the largest capital investment by BHP Billiton ever in its Illawarra coal subsidiary. The new mine will support the ongoing employment of over 500 workers, currently employed at its West Cliff mine, and will generate 300 new jobs in the construction phase. It is welcome news that $833 million has been committed to Illawarra coal-and just on days before the introduction of the carbon by price. I hope this welcome news will put a stop to a planned visit by the Leader of the Opposition-or at least the fear campaign he has been attempting to spread around my electorate and many others, predicting gloom, doom and the death of the coal industry. The Leader of the Opposition should be held to account for talking down Australian jobs and the coal industry in regions like mine. I hope he will be held to account for the baseless fear and insecurity that he has generated-not, I should say, amongst those who actually work in the coal industry. They look at the Leader of the Opposition and they laugh, because they can see expansion in their own pits and expansion in the industry, and they see through his baseless fear campaign. Last year, the Leader of the Opposition visited Peabody Energy in the Illawarra and predicted its demise as well. Unfortunately for him, a day or so later Peabody Energy announced a $5 billion takeover bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal. So much for a lack of faith in the industry. Coal has a strong future in our country and in my region. There has been an upward revision from $96 billion to $107 billion in the investment pipeline for coal in this country. However, there are some real threats to the future of coal and coal jobs in my electorate. I would like to take this opportunity to point out some of the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party when it comes to the coal industry. Just a week ago in the Southern Highlands, Liberal councillors on the Wingecarribee Shire Council voted with their Greens colleagues to attempt to bring a stop the expansion of the Medway Colliery from 220,000 tonnes per annum to 460,000 tonnes per annum. If the Liberal Party are successful in this bid, will have a devastating effect not only on Boral's mine but also on the cement works. The cement works and colliery have operated in tandem for over 90 years and they are dependent upon each other. They are an important source of employment and wealth generation for the region and they employ more than 180 workers and contribute more to the community through the procurement and the multiplier effects of wages earned and spent locally. The town most affected by the application is now known as New Berrima. It was built as a dormitory suburb for the mine in the first place, and for families at the nearby cement works. So while cement is a critical product in our national and regional development, it operates in a very competitive international environment. Threats to the Boral cement works through the recent decision, supported by Liberal Party councillors on the Wingecarribee Shire Council, should be resisted. If those opposite wanted to do something for the future of the coal industry and coal mining jobs in my region, the member for Hughes would pick up the phone to his Liberal colleagues in the adjoining electorate and tell them to do something about the position that has been adopted by their councillors in relation to this mine, because good hard working families in my electorate depend on this cement works and the adjacent mine for their livelihoods, and the decision by the Wingecarribee Shire Council puts those jobs at risk.",206

They Backed by the retailers associations, they will be able to start in the workforce as a result of handed down by the Federal Court took too were not able to work after school. The currently young Australians who want to work round, cannot do so. How we got to the stage on putting laws in place which will prevent school-before this Federal Court decision to show the ineptitude of our current Prime for workplace relations that these laws 2010. I received a phone call from Jane Spencer, manager of the Terang Cooperative, Charlie school. She was incredibly confused by this confused by the decision and that the manager to take the action that he had to; he was forced and the laws which had been created by the Gillard. Once I examined what had happened, I were of this law. There were actually six school in Terang at 3.30, going to their local working through until 5.30 when the cooperative close at 5.30 or six. They are not open until But what had the then workplace relations minimum engagement in the retail sector of three longer leave their school at 3.30, go to the hour and a half.

The then workplace relations This was the start of what the Australian people and then did another, a Prime Minister who because she seems to have problems delivering said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the did not give up. They continued their fight. took it to the Federal Court. Unfortunately, the processes of decisions and appeals took over eventually we had the Federal Court coming 'These students can go back to work and they and the employee agree that this is how long students, a parent or a guardian gives their approach the decision. Yet why did it take so the Federal Court took this decision these Leticia Harrison, had left school. They could time the decision took meant that they were experiences they had at the Terang Co-op working.

It gives which comes with having a job. We should should act to allow students to work not There were other students who were also laid were four kids who used to do the paper round work for three hours doing their paper round, sent to young Australians. The government is your bikes early in the morning doing your paper town of Avoca said to me: 'I always look for paper round when I am thinking of employing there that they will carry on with them in their I look for.' Yet what have we done? We have shut down the the retail sector. This is the next thing we reregulated our workplace. I implore the House to support this motion. hoping that both sides will see reason, that Federal I am hoping those opposite will stand as one 'Yes, the Federal Court, having got it right, school.' I will be listening with interest to hear what might be jumping the gun but from feedback telling me is: it is decisions like this that Gillard made as the minister for workplace government. It is one of the reasons why I think breath for the ballot box to come either this clear message that they do not want to be young people to work before and after school. encourages people to work and especially the House. It is a good, sensible motion. It a year and a half, which was far too long. But down with a common sense decision. It said, can work for an hour and a half if the employer they want to work for and if, on behalf of the approval.' That was a fairly common sense way to long for this to occur? It meant that by the time two young Australians, Matthew Spencer and no longer do their work because the period of out in the workplace themselves. But given the they are both gainfully employed and out there from this. If young Australians are given the school, it is fantastic experience for them and sure that they go on after school to enter the them that sense of confidence and self-worth not forget this. This is why this government only after school but also before school. off as a result of this decision. In Avoca there there before school, but because they could not they had to stop doing it. What a message to be saying to them, 'We no longer want you out on rounds.' One of the largest employers in the the kids who have got up early and done the people, because I know there is a work ethic careers after school. It is one of the key criteria ability for students to work before school in should look to change with regard to the laws that I am hoping that both sides will do so. I am Court has righted a wrong in this instance. and say, 'Yes, the Federal Court got it right' and should now look to do so before as well as after the government has to say about this motion.

We had these provisions Australia and they operated perfectly well. days there used to be trading hours acts across closing-and sometimes 5:30 closing. Often schoolchildren could work. It is less of a and Woolies and most of the retailers trade well for very short engagements. I take the members point that country towns want to stop young people from the country sentiments that the member said about young money, be able to save a bit of money for cars But of course what he misses out is that, awards set. In the process of setting these employer associations about things like minimum engagement. The Labor government and I are happy engagements for casuals. What the retailers' children as a graphic example of a way engagements. What they are seeking to do relatively small number of people who are doing delivering newspapers-and use it to undermine engagements. We all know what the retailers somebody in for work, have them work for retailers want. That is their wish list. That seen it happen. I have seen a great many retailers requesting it in awards and implementing it associations come around and enforce the know that is what their representatives in member represents is a stalking horse to undermine things like minimum engagements, opposition wants-and that is who you are, election before you",226
335,Mr Tehan,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,We're waiting!,226
336,Mr CHAMPION,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"This is the thing. You have judgment before you jump the aisle, as it were. I ask the House on both sides to support government supports the wording and the supporting some of the presumptive arrogance in the use, I think, of particular situations as a for casuals. I have some experience in this union for about 11 years or so. We had these in the retail industry award in South They were in the retail award, because in the old the country in states, which had six o'clock these clauses were necessary so that problem now in the city, because of course Coles into the evening, and so there is not the need might be the exception to this. We would not being able to work these hours. All these people being able to work, get a bit of pocket and that sort of thing are all perfectly sensible. as part of the Fair Work laws, there have to be awards, there are contests between unions and to support and protect three-hour minimum association were doing in this case is using these in which they could undermine minimum with this early morning engagement is find a a particular brand of this work-in this case the overall concept of three-hour minimum want. They want a situation where they can pull an hour and send them home. That is what is what the retailers association wants, and I have and fast food organisations try it on, both in their shops until unions and other independent rules. We know that is what they want and we this parliament want. What this motion from the reintroduce elements of Work Choices that overtime and penalty rates. That is what the not the government. You have to wait for the to wait for the Australian people to make a But we know what we would get from them in government. We will have all these cases: 'Five harm would it do?' Of course, it is all designed it is all about. We used to get the same thing about penalty penalty rate wasn't there, we could afford o'clock at night.' I used to hear those arguments arguments about overtime. 'If only overtime hours, couldn't they?' 'If only I wasn't limited more hours.' That is the argument that the opposition, groups use to undermine things like minimums. If you look at what the Federal Court actually be able to work a minimum of 1.5 hours after their parents or guardians had to agree circumstances. Parents or guardians should court also said this applies where employment the shop is closing. That is a fair set of where you have fast food outlets employing simply to get out of the three-hour engagement. The reason why the three-hour engagement They have to buy uniforms. There are costs you only get an hour's work, if your minimum might find yourself in a situation where it getting paid. That is why the minimum engagement is why it has been upheld in the Federal Court's decision. We have this particular circumstance which and by the courts, not through political direction way of looking at these things. This is not three-hour minimum established because that workplace relations system on emotion or on going to run the Fair Work system on what is we are going to have people arguing their case. politics. But we know what the opposition would worked out that Work Choices is like a loaded mouth and they are all running from it as best it, you can see the nerves and you can see the Sometimes there is laughing and scoffing: they are going to do. They are going to cut the with various circumstances and situations and safety net. That is the member's intention here-slowly three-hour minimum. The three-hour minimum is a very important know that some 20 per cent to 30 per cent of who are on insecure incomes and a lot of people people want to work for just an hour. What to erode the minimum standards. That is what rates when I was a union official. 'If only the to have a few more workers on a Sunday or at 12 a lot as well. We used to hear the same payments weren't there, they could work extra to 38 hours a week, I could work more, get retail associations and other employer did, it said that schoolkids should continue to school, between 3 pm and 6.30 pm, and that to it, which I think is a pretty good set of agree to these things for people under 18. The for a longer period was not possible-that is, circumstances, but we would not want a situation young people, 16or 17-year-olds, for 1.5 hours is there is that people have to drive to work. associated with work. So for casual workers, if engagement is just an hour or 1.5 hours, you is costing you as much to get to work as you are is important. It is a fairness thing, which was taken into account by Fair Work Australia or through petitions but through a rational done through sentiment but evidence. We have a is what is fair. We are not going to run our one person's individual circumstances. We are fair overall. We are going to have hearings and We are not going to run it on sentiment or do, as they do in so many things. They have dog; it is a dog with a bit of dynamite in its they can. That is why, every time we mention smiles. Then they say, 'It is dead and buried.' 'As if we would do that!' But we know now what onion slice by slice. They are going to come up they are going to try to push for erosions to the but surely to cut out things like the fairness mechanism for casual workers. We workers are now casual. That is a lot of people who are dependent on the hours they get. In the retail industry, my union has worked very some notice and do have some security. Often regular hours at a place for years and years. a level of permanence, and find they have of heart, and their hours have been reduced. reduced from 37 to three in the space of a We know that people have issues with insecure situations made even more insecure.

But the majority of within that middle section of the bell curve, day. Sometimes they just make the 50 per cent of it. But I think that we need to accept within the middle section of the bell curve. The issue we are discussing today is, I believe, adversarial industrial relations. What we are Australia and how we can properly engage them work-and I have heard the member for Wannon quite critical to them for a number of reasons, opinion, industrial awards should not contain the workplace or prevent employees from working. This is particularly relevant for our school as it is, to engage in the workforce. They undertake around the work they have to do homework and their additional study.

We support that in the member's electorate-I think their work ethic. But we do not want to see a and others seek to deliberately, as a strategy, cut away-cutting the onion, slice by slice-at second the motion proposed by my colleague for schoolkids under the Fair Work and employees, I am very confident that shape of a typical bell curve. You have good You have good employees and you have employers and the majority of employees fit which means that they do their best on any given mark; sometimes they are a little bit either side that both employers and employees generally fit far too important for us to be engaging in talking about today are the needs of the youth of in the workforce. The issue of after-school raise the issue of before-school work-is which I will start to cover shortly. In my provisions which serve to reduce productivity at students, who have such limited opportunities, already have to fit in any employment they at school, the hours they need to attend, their is not a new concept for our secondary school work. That has been commonplace in Australia that engaging in extracurricular activities students; that activity can be participating in argument can be extended quite easily and students are normally engaged in activities with It identifies and potentially starts a working It can demonstrate a positive work ethic to potential worker has been engaged in part-time work at school.

The minimum engagement of three hours, students, and I am very pleased to see the September 2011. I think it recognised very clearly opportunity to work after school and, potentially, develop the skills that are necessary. It was the union that really should be supporting workers not have been appealed at all; it should have expected that the union would be significantly Australia and would have wanted to do something and to be part of the workforce both now and union took the action that it did I do, however, support the motion by the the work that he has done so far and will continue to do.

I know there are many students in the Macarthur shifts to fit in with their schooling and with decision by Fair Work Australia in June 2011. for moving this motion, and the shadow minister Eric Abetz, for his support of this important this motion.

For this changes to the retail award and ensuring these Court's recent decision. I commend the Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (12:07): I the member for Wannon brings before the House two important issues which have been the subject first of those issues is how we manage to certainty on the one hand-that is, the need take-home pay-with the capacity of young people part-time work, while completing their schooling. The stories that speaker after speaker from House with this morning would be compelling you stand here and you talk about the needs system that enables a 14to 16-year-old student the afternoon, jump on their bike or the local hardware store in the main street of a country money and some work experience, it would be very think there would be a right-thinking person against the importance of constructing a system having access to additional money and the schooling. However, we know that these circumstances other side of the House often try to approach develop good time-management skills and strive all dream of. Today's world is moving at a rapid at such a young age gives our youth a fantastic being labelled as lazy, hard to please and getting into the workforce. I have met so many Macarthur who would be a great asset to any the push by the coalition and the subsequent to work a minimum 1.5-hour shift after common sense, especially when the majority of in small towns and regional areas close at across Macarthur a valuable opportunity to chance to develop an impressive resume for future working hard and saving money, especially in inspiring that two teenagers kicked off these When Matthew Spencer and Leticia Harrison decided to fight this ridiculous rule that stopped applaud them for persistence and determination, as for supporting these young people every step young people in Macarthur gaining valuable I thank all those who are involved in making these changes remain in place throughout the Federal member for Wannon on his motion today. am pleased to be speaking on the matter that today, a matter which goes to the heart of of much debate over the last 4½ years. The balance through our workplace laws the need for for certainty in relation to working hours and to find and engage in work, particularly the coalition side got up and entertained the if they were the only side of the story. When of ensuring that you have a workplace relations to knock-off from school at three o'clock in bus and get down to Coles or Woolies or a small town and get a few hours work, a bit of pocket hard to argue against that. In fact, I do not on this side of the House who would argue which facilitates young people in this country value of work experience while completing their do not operate in a vacuum. Those on the these debates on the basis that the workplace relations system can be dealt with by simple vacuum. If all we were talking about were conjecture, but that is not all we are talking about the many hundreds of single mums living the retail and related sectors, who need some they are going to work. If you have to travel to your place of employment and then for pretty sure that you are not going to be spending counter. You are not being paid for your time work. That is why on this side of the House we relations system that is able to bring into this side of the House do not believe that in this must be necessary that one person's benefit worker. We look for solutions that ensure that not cut the throat of another. That is why Work Choices. We scrapped the system of AWAs old could sit down and negotiate with the arrangement and they had some bargaining those opposite are advocating. The member for Canning admitted in a debate they had a secret industrial relations policy they were really going to come clean, they Whilst I am on it, if they are interested in work skills, they will get behind our trade training and real workplace experiences are being garnered.

And then we have polyfidelity, these arrangements exist in our society today But none of those aforementioned relationships the sake of those couples who do live as man in an environment which is most popular and to be shown disrespect or denigrated by giving domestic arrangements.

For and wife, a male and a female, to raise children stable in our community today, they ought not the same legal definition to all of those other the status quo and that any debate in regard of time in this place because there are so many and Innovation and Minister for Climate support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 that and supported by others. Like many members, my constituents and have consulted in say, as everyone would be familiar with, that there the spectrum on this issue. But ultimately for me this is a matter of discrimination against should remedy. Same-sex couples should not if they should choose to do so. address this issue by amending the definition of Importantly, it does not place an obligation to marry same-sex couples if they should not wish to do so. The bill simply seeks to remove society. It is important, as the member for Throsby that marriage has changed over the years. We vow of obedience or the prohibition of certain change and it is important that the legislature not take away someone's rights; it establishes Labor, I would submit, has a very proud discrimination. That is one of the reasons Labor movement, although I have enormous respect amongst the members of the Labor Party. When established the Racial Discrimination Act of Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and in 85 separate pieces of legislation to remove discrimination is not acting alone on this matter either.

I am opposed to same-sex marriage held views to the alternative and I acknowledge become quite divisive in the wider community. In relation to the tone of the debate, I take contribution was very respectful in tone and should be held. It is my intention to participate both sides. As I said, I think there is a real community. I think some, particularly some language, portraying people who do not bigoted and homophobic. I think that is terribly debate to develop. On the weekend, there was a great example Nationals had their state conference in Bowral. defeated, but it was a very mature and constructive of the younger members of the party were marriage is an issue which neatly divides discrimination and to advance equality in our indicated in introducing the bill, to note no longer have betrothals and dowries, a wife's interracial or interreligious marriages.

For the people for whom I but particularly as a member of my family way that I construct the current arrangements to marry. For those reasons, in brief, I do and am happy to have my support on the record. spoken in the past on the issue of same-sex in both the tone and content of my contribution but I recognise that there are very strongly that this issue does have the potential to my lead from the previous speaker. I think his I think that is the manner in which the debate in this debate along those lines and to listen to risk of this debate becoming very divisive in the on the Left, have deliberately used inflammatory support same-sex marriage as being somehow unfair and not the way we should allow this of how this debate should be pursued when the A motion on this very issue was narrowly debate. It is fair to say, perhaps, that a lot advocating change, but I do not think same-sex on the basis of age or any other basis. I have had the chance to ask a lot of people often been surprised by their comments and Many people are quite ambivalent about this issues for this parliament to be considering others, on either side of the debate, who have not trying to belittle the issue. But it is fair contact me on this issue want us, in this parliament, brings me to my conclusion-that I am not sure this debate. The issues have, I believe, been the broader community and surely it is time to see where we stand on this issue. Get a clear stand on this issue and then move on to the regard as being of greater importance In relation to the substance of the issue, same-sex relationships but I do not support that is the only politically consistent position because it is the position I took to the people Importantly, that position is also entirely took a position of being opposed to same-sex are consistent in the application of that policy There have been no surprises in relation to view. If we wanted to adopt a different position, that back to the people who elected us in the first place. I think that stands in stark contrast to this carbon tax. This Prime Minister explicitly ruled election, yet only weeks or months later she back to the people of Australia. That is where of trust have caused so many problems for the opposite of the approach I have taken-I took going to be consistent with it. That is the openness as a member of parliament. If we are going of our democratic system and restore faith this is a very important principle to remember humanly possible to do so. As I said, I had a position of opposition and I will continue to maintain that position certainly do not intend to change my mind on had given my constituents the chance to vote should bring on the vote on this issue. We need of importance to the Australian people. I members of parliament clearly cannot please Australian community. Some people in my electorate and others will be very pleased. I fear that we point. I would like to reassure those who may in my electorate for their views and I have the level of passion they have about this issue. issue and think that there are far more important at this time in our history. However, there are very passionate views. I understand that. I am to say that a significant number of people who to focus on other things. That is what how much longer we should continue to have well and truly canvassed both in this place and in bring on the vote. Bring on the vote and let us indication of where we, the 43rd parliament, other issues which people in the community to their lives at this time. I do support the recognition of legal rights within the proposed changes to the Marriage Act. I think and the only position of integrity I can take, of Gippsland at the last general election. consistent with the broader view of my party. We marriage to the voters at the last election and we position in a very open and transparent manner. the view of the Nationals and my own personal I think it would be incumbent upon us to take Prime Minister and her breach of trust on the out introducing a carbon tax prior to the last had a change of mind. But she did not take it this Prime Minister and her fundamental breach current government. I think this issue is the a position to the people of Gippsland and I am and transparency I think you need to show to restore community confidence in the integrity in the parliament and the people who serve here, and one I intend to adhere to whenever it is to same-sex marriage at the last election campaign for the remainder of the 43rd parliament. I this issue and, even if I did, it would be after I at a general election. So I say again: I think we to have the vote and move on to other issues acknowledge that this is an issue about which everyone in the electorate or in the broader will be very disappointed with my view may have to agree to disagree on this particular be disappointed by the position I have taken here today that I will continue to work in support and lesbian people in the Gippsland community, marriage act.  2012.
