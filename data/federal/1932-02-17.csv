1,Mr CAMERON,Unknown,"Barker) [1L7] - I move- ' That the honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) do take the Chair of the House as Speaker. If the honourable member for Lilley is appointed to the chief position in the gift of honourable members of this House, he will, I am sure, perform the duties pertaining to the Speakership in a manner which will do credit, not only to himself, but also to the chamber over which he will preside. The honourable gentleman has already given long service to his constituents, having been first elected to this House in 1917. He has, moreover, occupied the position of TemCook, porary Chairman of Committees in several parliaments, and in that office has had an opportunity to show that he possesses those qualifications which justify his promotion to the higher honour of the Speakership. The occupant of the Speaker's chair should be a man of calm temperament and impartial judgment, and the honourable member for Lilley possesses both qualifications. He enjoys the distinction of possessing the longest unbroken period of loyal service of any member of the United Australia party.",13
2,Mr WARD,Unknown,"That is not a recommendation. Mr CAMERON"" - I do not agree with the honourable member for East Sydney. If the honourable member for Lilley is appointed to the position of Speaker, he will, I am convinced, conduct the proceedings of the House in such a manner that when at length he comes to leave the Chair, he will have earned the confidence and esteem of the whole body of members.",14
3,Mr NAIRN,Unknown,"Perth) [11.10] - I have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) for the position of Speaker of this House. My acquaintance with the honourable member covers only the period of the last Parliament, but it has been sufficient to cause me to hold his personal qualities in great esteem. If elected to the Speakership, he will, I am sure, carry out his duties with honour and credit to himself and to this House.",14
4,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Lilley) [11.11] - I thank those honourable members who have proposed and seconded my nomination as Speaker of this House, and I respectfully submit myself to the decision of honourable members.",14
5,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.12]. - It was ten years ago, in this very month, that I first took advantage of the opportunity which presents itself only onee in the life of a parliament, when any honourable member can speak untrammelled by rules of debate-som e of them absurd - whic h unfortunately up to the present have not been properly altered and amended. I do not object to the honourable member for Lilley, who has been nominated for the Speakership, because he and I have been the best of friends ever since he entered this Parliament. I have a great respect for him, and if he is appointed I hope he will emulate the splendid work of his predecessors. Hut I object principle to the present method of appointing the Speaker, because once an honourable member is elected to that position, his electors are disfranchised; they have no further representation in this House. Realizing that the officers of this Parliament know far more of parliamentary procedure than does the average honourable member who is appointed to the Chair, and that the conduct of Parliament really rests upon the parliamentary officers, I would prefer that some officer, and not a member of Parliament, should be elected eaoh session to the speakership. This would enable all honourable members to represent fully their electors. Those remarks apply also to the position of Chairman of Committees. It is strange how frequently some of my dearest friends fill the positions of Speaker and Chairman of Committees, and thus become subject to my criticism. I raise one other matter. This is one occasion on which I can hold up to scorn and contumely some of the judges of the High Court and other courts. These judges, even in the hour of their country's need, have refused to allow any reduction to be made in their salaries, but they 'are so terribly blinded that they have drastically reduced the wages of the workers. Five years ago I expressed the contempt and loathing in which I held Judge Lukin. To-day I hold him in still greater contempt. He receives in addition to his salary a pension of £1,000 a year from the Queensland Government. He sits in court with all the dignity of his horse-hair wig, and refuses to suffer any reduction in his salary. Men of his type took part in the French Revolution. At that time one fool said that the people should eat grass, and according to Carlyle, he was eventually strung up to a lamp poBt, and hanged with grass stuck in his mouth. ""When the people properly control Parliament no longer will Australian men and women receive a dole of 5s. a week plus Is. 6d. for each child, while in the Motherland an unemployed man receives 15s. a week, and an unemployed woman 13s. a week. Our Defence Department has issued a regulation to the effect that 7s. 6d. a week shall be provided for each child. Is on there any difference between the children who have to be maintained on Defence Department money and those who have to be maintained by other government expenditure? This is a very serious matter, although I am not blaming this Government for it._ The previous Government deserved a lot of the blame, and they received their reward at the election. But the people have not yet obtained control of Parliament. We talk about our democracy in Australia, but there can be no democracy here so long as this Parliament can control the people who create it. The people have the right to control the Parliament, and we shall never have a democracy until they can exercise that right. Private members have at different times tried to improve matters in this respect, but the previous Government, like those which preceded it, limited the rights of private members to the greatest possible extent. Those who were members of the last Parliament know that this statement is true. I had a motion on the business-paper to provide for the bringing into effect of the principle of the referendum, initiative and recall. Honourable members who are sitting on the front Opposition bench may laugh, but they, like myself, have signed a platform which contains this plank. If they were sitting in a Labour conference they would not be complimented upon their laughter. Let me tell them, and honourable members generally, that I have held the respect of my constituents longer than any of them - i h fact for nearly 43 year3. For very many years I have tried to get this House to carry a motion approving of the principle of the referendum, initiative and recall. On one occasion, when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, such a motion was agreed to unanimously, but no Labour Government has ever taken steps to give effect to this principle. I am loyal to the Labour party. The planks of the platform of that party are as sacred to me as the Prayer else, Book and the Bible, and I wish to see debts. them put into effect. I do not want to see members of this party holding on place and pay. I say definitely that there were more ""gold-diggers"" last caucus than in any in which I have Dear Sir, sat during my long parliamentary life. Honourable members opposite seem amused, but by and by I shall have something to say about them, the and I shall not hesitate to say York. Dr Maloney. it. I hope to continue to hold the respect of my colleagues as I have held it during all the years. I have never said anything in this House that I did not believe, and I have never tried to attain an object unconnected with the welfare of humanity. I know that the right honourable member for North Sydney, in his heart of hearts, believes in the referendum and initiative. I have taken care not to speak of the recall. I believe that I am the only member of this House who has trusted his constituents, and who, for 42 years, has given them the right to render the seat of their representative vacant at a day's notice. By presenting a petition signed by one more than half the number of voters who voted for me in my constituency the electors could bring about my immediate recall. Honourable members are again laughing, but they laugh in ignorance. Poor children, there is a lot yet for them to learn. There was a time when 556 signatures could have brought about my removal from Parliament. I have mentioned Judge Lukin. I wish also to mention Judge Drake-Brockman, Mr Justice Rich, and Mr Justice Evatt. I am sorry to have to do this. If my suggestions had been accepted our poor country could be helped out of its troubles. Let us do here as they did in England during the war period. At that time food was rationed, and the highest aristocrats in the land had to submit to rationing just like the poorest people. We should remember too, that poor old England can produce only enough food for every fourth man, woman and child living there. Australia, on the other hand, is producing more than three times as much food as she requires to feed her people. Let us ration our food supply and everything and use all the surplus to meet our In regard to the monetary position, I to wish to place on record the following letter which I received from the Treasury in the on the 16th January, 1932 :Witb reference to your telephone inquiry of today relative to the cost of remitting money to New York, I would point out that taking exchange rate as 3.40 dollars to the £1 it costs £143 in London to place £100 in New This £143 must be remitted to London from Australia, and at a rate of approximately 25 per cent, would cost, say, £36. It will be seen, therefore, that the remitting £100 from Australia to New York is approximately £179-£7 9 being in respect for exchange. It is in such circumstances that Germany has said that she cannot and will not pay her dehts. All the European nations are thinking about refusing to pay their war debts. I ask whether it is right, when Australia, is willing to pay her way, that she must send abroad £79 as exchange for every £100 of principal and interest in respect of her indebtedness? If the people of this country were asked to reply with tv plain "" ye3"" or "" no"" to the question, whether they are willing to do this, I am sure thai; they would say no. I trust that this Government will find some way of placing all debts upon a different footing from the indebtedness incurred in respect of ordinary trade and commerce. I hope that some agreement will be made which will l i ft the burden of this terrible interest charge from the shoulders of the people. I shall watch the Government very carefully. Although I cannot hope to point my finger at any member so gracefully as the Clerk of the House has done it today, I shall nevertheless watch the Government, and hope that it will find some means of removing this terrible burden. I hope that I shall live to see Australia, the land that I love, and which I believe honourable members opposite love as well as I do, become a real democracy. I trust that this Parliament will come under the control of the people. At present the people have control on only one day in three years. I say with all reverence, as though in the presence of my Maker, that if God be God, He would never create anything His equal and never allow any created thing to make itself His equal. Why, then, I ask, as a representative of the people, should those who create this Parliament control it on only one day in three years? They should control it every day. Why should Ave be able to make ourselves more powerful than they? That is why, for 42 j'ears, I have given constituents the right of recall. I that some day the system will be made general. Then no longer will so many vile and wicked happenings, with their assocost of ciated fraud, misery and trickery, be countenanced - Jobbery occurred even in connection with the building of this Capital. It fell to the lot of a member of the Labour party, the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. .Eiley), to make the exposure that certain contractors had fraudulently withheld 600 tons of cement from the foundations of a Government building in Canberra, the cost of which was estimated to be about £1,000,000. Yet no one was sacked or even censured. I know that had the Scullin Government been in charge of affairs the delinquents would have been dealt with. That great genius, Walter Burley Griffin, prepared the design for a beautiful permanent Parliament House, which was to cost £250,000, and provided a room for every member of Parliament, whether of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Through the machinations of certain departmental heads that great man was set aside and his design superseded. In place of that beautiful permanent building we have this temporary Parliament House, which was estimated to cost £230,000, but which has cost £760,000 of the people's money. If any honourable member doubts the accuracy of my statement. I refer him to the report of the inquiry that was made into the matter by the then Leader of the New South Wales Bar, Mr Wilfred Blacket, KC., which shows clearly how vilely Walter Burley Griffin was treated. And no one was censured. The roof of this building would not keep out the rain, and, when I drew attention to that fact 80 tons of gravel was placed upon it in a vain endeavour to rectify the fault. If a committee could be appointed with power to obtain full information before the available informants disappear or die, very severe punishment would be meted out to those responsible. I had intended speaking of this matter when the Speaker of the last Parliament was eleoted, but my chief dissuaded me. That I have regretted ever since. I urge all young members of Parliamy ment, who may feel that they are tramhope melled by our rules of debate to take advantage of the happy opportunity that is afforded to them on an occasion such as the present and give utterance to what their conscience prompts them to speak. Members of the House then unanimously calling Mr Mackay to the Ohair, he was taken out of his place by Mr. M . Cameron and Mr Nairn and conducted to the Chair. "" Then Mr SPEAKER ELECT, standing on the upper step, said- I desire to express my keen appreciation of the great honour which honourable members have eonferred upon me. I realise the responsibility that is mine in assuming the duties of the office, following as I do so many who have occupied the Chair with distinction, and I feel that I can be successful only if I have the full support honourable members, whose goodwill I shall endeavour to deserve by the exercise of tact, courtesy and strict impartiality. Honourable members who may think that the Standing Orders are too rigid have the remedy in their own hands. In return for the efforts that I shall make to carry out my duties satisfactorily, I shall expect from all honourable members strict obedience to my rulings and decisions. It is my intention to endeavour to uphold the best traditions of parliamentary procedure, and to apply common sense to the interpretation of the Standing Orders.",14

I am confident that you will bring to that task the qualities of impartiality of and justness, because I remember that, many years ago, before you entered this Parliament, you were responsible for an extraordinarily fair piece of dealing in of the connection with myself which demonstrated to me the innate justness and fairness of your character. I am satisfied that those qualities will characterize your I hope that during the term of this Parliament you will carry out to the practice of previous Speakers, and and recognize, in their turn, the members of the several parties in the House as they rise to take part in a That method has been used in your previous parliaments. It was adopted when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime on Minister, and also when other governments were in office, and the practice is observed at the present time in the British House of Commons, where the various parties are recognized in their turn in the matter of calls from the Ohair. I trust that this practice will be followed in this chamber. At the same time, I point out that members of the Country party are occupying their present seats in this chamber to suit their own convenience. They desire, so far as possible, to sit together. The object of the Country party in coining to this Parliament is to put into effect, at the earliest possible moment, the policy that iras jointly agreed upon by the United Australia party and the Country party prior to the election. So long as the Government carries ovit the policy on which the people voted, it can rest assured of the support of this party.",17

18,Mr LYONS,DEATH OF SENATOR THE,"Wilmot-JPrime Minister and Treasurer) [3.31] - Almos t invariably on the meeting of the House after an interval, it is the sad Minis- duty of the Prime Minister to announce the death of present or past members of this Parliament. Unfortunately, this occasion is no exception. Senator the Hon. James Ernest Ogden died on the 5th February at his home in Tasmania. The late senator was not a robust man, and his health had been failing for some time. The news of his death, however, came as a shock to his colleagues in this Parliament, most of whom had not heen in close touch with him since the adjournment in November. The sudden removal from our midst of one who had been so recently sharing in the work of the Parliament, and whose personal friendship was valued so very highly, is felt particularly keenly hy those of us who were associated with him. Senator Ogden had a long record of parliamentary service, having been a member of the Tasmanian and Commonwealth Parliaments. I was associated with'him in the Tasmanian Parliament, and in the Government led by the late Honourable John Earle. I valued his friendship and respected him for his sincerity. Before his election to the Commonwealth Parliament in 1922 he had been a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for sixteen years, during which time, in addition to a brief period as Treasurer, he was Chief Secretary and Minister for Mines and Labour for two years. For a brief period he was Leader of the Opposition in that Parliament. Senator Ogden was a member of the Commonwealth Government as honorary minister from the 29th November, 1928, for approximately twelve months. His parliamentary life covered a period of 26 years, during which time he did not spare himself to give of his best to Tasmania and the Commonwealth. Before his entry into Parliament, his efforts on behalf of hi3 fellow workers were such as to merit special remembrance. We tender our deep sympathy to his widow and family in their loss. I move-by leaveThat the members of the House of Representatives record their sincere regret at the death of Senator the Honourable James Ernest honourable Ogden, who was a representative of Tasmania in the Senate since 1922, and performed valuplaces. able service as a member of State and Commonwealth Governments, and tender their deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",19
19,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OF SENATOR THE,"Yarra) [3.33] - I second the motion moved by the Prime Minister, and join with him in expressing our regret at the death of the late Senator Ogden. As honourable members know, he suffered for some considerable time, and the manful way in which he stuck to his duties, despite his long and serious illness, won our admiration. I join with the Prime Minister and all other honourable members of this House in expressing deep regret at his death, and desire to convey to his widow and family our sympathy with them in their great loss.",20
20,Dr EASLE PAGE,DEATH OF SENATOR THE,"Cowper) [3.34] On behalf of the Country party, I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin), which extends the sympathy of the members of this House to the relatives of the late Senator Ogden. As years go, he was a comparatively young man, especially for a native of Tasmania, where longevity is the rule. He died worn out by the years of service which he devoted to the public. For a brief time. I worked with him as a colleague in a Government, and no one could have been more conscientious or painstaking than he in the discharge of his duties. Despite constant ill health he spent many years in the service of his country, and I am convinced that the public have lost a valuable servant by his death.",20
21,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OF SENATOR THE,"West Sydney) [3.35]. - I join with the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), and with the leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) in expressing my sympathy with the widow and family of the late Senator Ogden. I was acquainted with him only, during recent years, but I can agree with the Leader of the Opposition that Senator Ogden displayed great fortitude in carrying out his duties despite the serious i l lness from which it was obvious he was suffering. Question resolved in the affirmative, members standing in their NA R. W. FOSTER.",20
22,Mr LYONS,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.36] - I announce with regret that the Honourable Richard Witty Foster, a former member for Wakefield and a former Minister of the Crown, died on the 5th January in Adelaide. I was not a member of this House when Mr Foster was representing Wakefield, but I know of his work and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members. Mr Foster first entered Parliament when elected to the House of Assembly of South Australia, in 1893, and was a member of that House for thirteen years, during which time he held Ministerial office for periods totalling five years. His election to the House of Representatives took place in 1909, and he retained the seat until the general elections of 1928. He attained Ministerial office in the Hughes Government as Minister for Works and Railways, holding that portfolio from December, 1921, to February, 1923. His colleagues in this chamber remember him as one imbued with a high sense of public duty, who was at all times prepared strenuously but fairly to uphold his political beliefs. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a very valuable record of public service. I move-by leaveThat the sympathy of this House be extended to the widow aud family of the late Honourable Richard Witty Foster, who was a member of the House of Representatives for Wakefield, South Australia, from 1909 to and rendered conspicuous service to Australia as a member of State and Federal legislatures, und as a Minister of the Crown.",20
23,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Yarra) [3.38] - I second this motion, and regret the occasion which has led to its being moved. The Prime Minister gave a brief summary of Mr Foster's career. The deceased gentleman had a long record of public life, a record which was in every way honourable. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) did not know him in this House, but many of us here knew him well. He was one of those figures in public life that one never forgets. He was a strenuous fighter, and a vigorous debater-non e more vigorous. He fought for what he believed in, and fought strenuously, but he was personally one of the kindest men it was possible to meet. I am sure that all of us who knew him regretted the vicissitudes of public life which led to his disappearance from this House during one of those periodical upheavals which trouble the political history of the country. He was missed more in this Parliament than many others would have been, because of his driving force and personality, and because there was never any doubt of his sincerity. All members of this Parliament, no matter what their political opinions, felt a sense of personal loss when he went out of the House. Every one who knew him will join in regretting his death, and in extending their sympathy to his widow and family in their loss of a husband and a father.",21
24,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Cowper) [3.39] I desire to associate myself with the expressions of regret at the death of the late Honourable Richard Foster. For' many years I was associated with Mr. Foster in the work of this House, and applauded the vigor and impetuosity of his eloquence. I admired also the keenness with which he defended State rights in this Parliament. In that cause, as well as in all his parliamentary work, he drew upon a vast store of material which was of service to all his fellow members. I desire to associate the Country party with the expression of sympathy contained in the motion.",21
25,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"West Sydney) [3.40]. - I wish also to associate the members of 1928, my party with the motion. It was not my privilege to know the late Mr Foster, because he left this .parliament when I made an entry to it, but from the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, I judge that he was a keen fighter for his principles. I join with other honourable members in extending our deepest sympathy to the sorrowing relatives and friends of the deceased.",21
26,Mr GREGORY,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Swan) [3.41] - As one of the oldest and closest friends of the late Mr Foster, I wish to extend my sympathy to his widow and family. I was closely associated with Mr Foster for many years. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, the late honourable gentleman was an earnest and energetic fighter for his principles, and I venture to say that no man who has ceased to be a member of this chamber has been more greatly missed than he, or held in greater honour.",21
27,Mr MAXWELL,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Fawkner) [3.42] I enjoyed and valued greatly the friendship of the late Mr Foster, and wish, therefore, to utter a word of affectionate respect as a tribute to his memory. I endorse every word that has been said about the late Mr Foster by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). Mr Foster was no plaster saint, but he was as straight as a gun barrel. He had strong convictions and the rare courage of his convictions. The vicissitudes of life, both public and private, he met breast forward, and I question that he ever entertained a momentary doubt that right would ultimately triumph. When : we meet on an occasion like this to consecrate ourselves to the service of our King and country, and remember with honour those who have gone before, I sometimes wonder whether we are not compassed about with a great cloud of unseen witnesses-thos e who have finished their course and gone before. It may be so. One thing of which I feel certain is that men such as those whose memory we are honouring today, being dead yet speak to those who have ears to hear. They are saying to us, "" Work while it is yet day, for the night cometh when no man can work."" The most effective way in which we. can express our respect for the memory of such men is by giving earnest heed to their silent admonitions. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA JOHN EARLE.",21
28,Mr LYONS,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"Wilmot-Prime MinisI ter and Treasurer) [3.45] - by leavemoveThat this House records with regret the death of the Honourable John Earle, a former member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, expresses appreciation of the public service rendered by him as a member of the Legislature and as a State and Federal ister, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow in her bereavement. On the 6th of February, the death occurred in Tasmania of the Honourable John Earle, who had a lengthy career of public service as a member of the Tasmanian and of this Parliament, and as a Minister of the Crown in both his own State and the Commonwealth. It is about nine years since the late gentleman was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, but up to that time he had been a prominent figure in the public life of Tasmania and of the Commonwealth. He commenced his parliamentary career in the State of Tasmania, being elected to the House of Assembly for .Waratah in 1906. He subsequently represented Franklin in that House. He was Premier of Tasmania on two occasions-o n the second occasion for a period of two years. I was personally associated with him, being a member of his Ministry which was in office from April, 1914, to April, 1916. The late Senator Ogden was also a member of that Ministry. Mr Earle's appointment as Senator dated from the 1st March, 1917, and he was re-elected at the general election of 1917, holding his seat until 1922. He held office as Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council in the Hughes Government from December, 1921, to February, 1923. The sympathy of the House of Representatives is extended to his widow in her bereavement.",22
29,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"Yarra) [3.47] - I second the motion. It was not my privilege to know the late Mr John Earle personally, although I met him on one occasion in the Federal Parliament when I was not a member of it. He carried out his duties capably and ably. He applied himself to work in an energetic and thoughtful manner. He passed out of public life some years ago, and now he has passed out of life altogether. join with the Prime Minister, and with I other honourable members in conveying to the widow of the late Mr Earle our deepest sympathy in her bereavement.",22
30,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"Cowper) [3.48] The long list of motions moved by the Prime Minister, indicates the toll that public service is taking of the politicians Minof this country, and the death of Mr. Earle is another instance of life devoted largely to public service. His was a long and distinguished career in public life in both Federal and State spheres, and the members of the Country party desire to associate themselves with the expressions of regret contained in the motion.",22
31,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"West Sydney) [3.49]. - I wish to associate the members of my party with the motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by other honourable members. It was not my privilege to know the late ex-Senator Earle, but I recognize from the references made to him by the Prime Minister that he at one time played a big part in the public life of this country. I join with other honourable members in extending our sympathy to his widow. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF MR. JOHN JOSEPH GLASBY.",22
32,Mr LYONS,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"""Wilmot-Prime Minister aud Treasurer) [3.50] - by leave- I move That this House places on record its deep regret at the death of the late Mr John Clasby, who was elected as member for the division of East Sydney, at the general elections held on the 19th of December, 1931, but did not take his seat in this chamber; and tenders its profound sympathy to his mother and members of his family in their bereavement. We have just paid tribute to the memory of three former members of the Federal Parliament. I now refer to one who, having been elected to Parliament, did not live to take his seat in this chamber. Mr John Joseph Clasby was elected to the House of Representatives as member for East Sydney at the general elections in December last, and died in Sydney on the 15th of January. The stress and strain associated with an election campaign had taken their toll, and he was suddenly stricken with an illness which ended in his untimely death at the age of 38 years. His was already a very useful life, which had included active service in Egypt and France during the war, and association with movements having for their object the stimulation of interest in public affairs. It seemed that he was on the threshold of a promising - career of parliamentary and public service, but he was not destined to take his seat in Parliament. His funeral was attended by myself and several other members of the Government. The tributes paid to Mr. Clasby on that occasion afforded a striking testimony of the esteem in which he was held by all sections of the community. The members of this House share the universal sympathy with his mother and members of his family in their sad bereavement.",23
33,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"Yarra) [3.52] - We have been expressing our deep sympathy with the relatives of former members of this Parliament who have died after long careers of usefulness in the service of the public and close association with us in , strenuous public life. Although Mr. John Joseph Clasby was in a different category, his death made a special appeal to our sympathy. Mr Clasby was a young man who had just taken the first step in a promising parliamentary career when he was stricken down. His end was, no doubt, accelerated by the strenuous election campaign in which he had participated. Wc all feel the deepest sympathy with his mother and the other members of his family, who, no doubt, Joseph were looking forward with pride to the time when their son and brother would win an important position in the national life of Australia. But Mr Clasby was not privileged to sit for even one day in the Parliament to which he had been elected. That circumstance has aroused the sympathy of the whole nation. I did not know Mr Clasby, although I believe that I met him for a few' moments on one occasion when I was travelling to Queensland and he was returning from that State; but I have heard those who knew - him well in Sydney express the highest opinions of his ability, manly qualities and fine disposition. My party joins with honourable members generally in expressing the deepest sympathy with his mother and family in their great sorrow and bitter loss. Br. EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [3.53] Personal knowledge of the late Mr J. J. Clasby, which dated back many years, led me to predict a very great future for him in the public life of Australia, and I deeply regret that on the very threshold of a career which promised to be brilliant he should have met with such an untimely end. His death was largely the result of war service, and of the strenuous efforts he made in the time at his disposal after his ordinary work was done to benefit the public life of Australia. He was of the right age to enter political life, for although he was a man of experience, he still had the energy of youth. His death is a definite loss to Australia, and we associate ourselves with the motion of sympathy moved by the Prime Minister.",23
34,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"West Sydney) [3.54]. - The circumstances of the passing of Mr J. J. Clasby touch me very closely, for I have participated in the three campaigns which have heen fought in the East Sydney electorate during the last eleven months. I appreciated the fighting qualities of the late Mr Clasby, and shall long remember the battle which was Waged in that electorate in December last. I took an active part in that struggle, and fought Mr Clasby strenuously in a political contest. He was a fair fighter, who took his part manfully, and he won from us a seat which we had held for many years. He was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of the victory he won, and we regret his death. As we look round this chamber today we feel that his mother and the other members of his family would have felt honoured to witness the ceremony of the opening of this Parliament, and to see their son and brother in the place to which he was elected, but it was not to be. ""We regret deeply the circumstances which have made this impossible, and express our sincere sympathy to his sorrowing relatives and friends.",23
35,Mr WARD,DEATH OE THE HONORABLE,"East Sydney) [3.56] I also desire to express my sympathy with the relatives of the late Mr Clasby. I did not know him except as a political opponent, but I can appreciate the tremendous strain to which his physical and mental forces were subjected in the campaign through which he passed last December, for I have participated in the three East Sydney campaigns of the last eleven months. I sincerely regret that Mr Clasby did not live long enough enjoy the fruits of his victory. He a good fighter in the interests of his party. The vote which he received on the 19th December, was to me an indication the personal esteem in which he was by the electors of East Sydney rather than an endorsement of the principles of the political party in the interests of which he stood. I extend my sympathy to those who have been bereaved. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Motion (by Mr LYONS) agreed toThat the Speaker be requested to transmit to the relatives of the deceased the going resolutions together with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. NA M2.",24
36,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.57].'-by leave- I move That this House expresses its deep regret at the sinking of British submarine M2 and. tenders its heartfelt sympathy to the relatives of those who so tragically lost their lives, and to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in the loss the country has sustained. Since the Commonwealth Parliament was last in session, the British submarine M2 whilst manoeuvring off the coast of England, has been lost and all her personnel have perished. It was a tragedy with, fortunately, but few equals in the naval history of Great Britain. While exercising in the Channel off Portland, Dorset, on the 26th January, the submarine dived, and did not again come to the surface. At first there was a slight hope that the lives of those on board would be saved, but that hope soon gave way to the sad realization that the 56 officers and men comprising the crew had gone to their deaths. We can hardly imagine the plight of those unfortunate men, but we can be certain that when the time came for them to abandon all hope they faced their deaths bravely, and in keeping with the best traditions of the Royal Navy. We extend our deepest sympathy to the relatives of those who perished in the disaster, and to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in the loss the country has sustained.",24
37,Mr SCULLIN,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Yarra) [3.58] - I to associate myself with the motion of was the Prime Minister. The news of the sinking of the submarine M2 struck the whole civilized world with ""horror, of not only because of the loss of so held many lives, but of the circumstances under which the men went to their death. Although we can only imagine the feelings of those who went down in the submarine, we can appreciate something of the tragedy of the whole occurrence. We extend our very deep sympathy to the relatives of the men who died. The sinking of this submarine reminds us of the great risks taken by those who man such vessels, not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. Of course, the forerisks are very much greater during war time. This occurrence affords additional evidence of the urgent need for the nations to do everything that they can do, not only to prevent the possibility of war, but also to render unnecessary any preparations for war. It is one of the hopes of this Parliament that the Disarmament Conference will take the first real step towards total disarmament, and thus remove the possibility of similar asters to this occurring in the future. Question resolved in the affirmativej honourable members standing in their places. SUSPENSION OF SITTING.",24
38,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.59] - As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased persons, I suggest that the sitting of the House be suspended for one hour.",25
39,Unknown,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 5 p.m. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .,25
40,Dr MALONEY,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"I regret to find that in my speech of this morning I attributed blame to a man who should rather have received praise- I refer to Mr Justice Rich. Throughout my life it has been my custom, when I have made a mistake or wrongly accused anybody, to acknowledge my error promptly and wholeheartedly. I do so now, I regret that I included the name of Mr Justice Rich in my strictures. I am sure that that' gentleman, out of the greatness of his qualities, will accept my apology. I intend at an early date, when the time is opportune, to ask the Government t'o provide ful l information so that the people of Australia may know the names of those who should receive commendation, together with the names of those who should receive condemnation. OVERSEAS INDEBTEDNESS.",25
41,Mr SCULLIN,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"I ask the honourable the Prime Minister whether the report is correct that arrangements have been made to transfer from London to Australia the sum of £2,950,000 that is due to the trading banks. If so, will the honourable gentleman state the terms on which the transfer will be arranged?",25
42,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,No arrangements have been made for the transfer of that amount to Australia. EXPORT OF APPLES.,25
43,Mr CAMERON,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Has the attention *f the Minister for Markets been drawn to the report that there is a shortage of refrigerated space available for the transport of South Australian apples to Great Britain? If so, will the honourable gentleman inform the House what dis- action has been taken? If not, will he take the necessary action t'o try to obtain additional refrigerated space for the purpose?",25
44,Mr HAWKER,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"When , some time ago, my attention was drawn to the possibility of there being a shortage of refrigerated space for the export of Australian apples to Great Britain, I commuhipa'ted with the Oversea Shipping Representatives Association, which undertook to provide the necessary space for all Australian apples available for export this year. It is easier and more satisfactory to arrange for the prior booking of refrigerated space for apples than for the majority of our other primary products, the output of which varies during a season. The actual details of the allocation of the available space for different consignments is now being worked out' by the council in Sydney.  Markets, when making arrangements for refrigerated space for the export of apples, take into consideration, not only the quantity of apples to be exported during the present season, but also the dates upon which apples become exportable in the various States? This is important, because the season is a month earlier in some States than in others.",25
45,Mr HAWKER,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Some time ago the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) made representations to me with regard to this matter, and I am pleased to be able to inform him that the position in Western Australia has now become considerably easier. Space in another ship has been allocated to Western Australia, and arrangements are now being made t'o lift further shipments. TARIFF PROPOSALS.",25
46,Dr EARLE PAGE,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Is it the intention of the Government to table the proposals for tariff revision that are mentioned in the Governor General's Speech before the debate on the Address-inReply takes place, so that honourable members may know precisely what is contemplated?",25
47,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"It will not be possible to table those proposals before the debate on the Address-in-Reply takes place. Where variations in the existing schedule are proposed, a full opportunity will be given to honourable members to discuss them. ADELAIDE WATERFRONT.",26
48,Mr MAKIN,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Will the Attorney General have separate lists prepared giving the amount of wages paid to men of foreign origin employed for the last two quarters upon the waterfront of the City of Adelaide, and the number of men so employed?",26
49,Mr LATHAM,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Alread y my department possesses a fairly comprehensive report on the matter to which the honourable member refers. It is possible that I shall be able to obtain from that report' substantially the information that he desires. If so, I shall supply it. If not, I shall consider whether a report of the nature referred to can be readily and inexpensively obtained. SALES TAX .",26
50,Mr WHITE,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"Will the Government, to assist the revival of trade, consider taking early steps to reduce, and simplify, the application of the sales tax?",26
51,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"The whole of the financial operations of the Government will receive full and careful consideration prior to the assembling of the next premiers' conference. Because of financial position of the country, I not hold out any hope that there will an appreciable lightening of the burden of the sales tax. PENSIONS.",26
52,Mr GANDER,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"As , during the recent election campaign, practically the whole of the United Australia Party candidates the matter. in New South Wales promised, if returned, to effect immediately a restoration of the old rates of invalid, old-age, and soldiers' pensions, will the Treasurer intimate the proposed date of that restorafor tion?",26
53,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,No promise was made on behalf of the United Australia party or of this Government that there would be any review or restoration of pension rates. If individual candidates made such promises the Government cannot hold itself responsible.,26
54,Mr THORBY,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,Is the Treasurer aware that the flat rate deduction of 2s. 6d. from old-age and invalid pensions is equivalent in certain cases to a reduction of 50 per cent.?,26
55,Mr LYONS,LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMARINE,"The reduction of pensions was in accordance with the financial rehabilitation plan evolved by Commonwealth and State Ministers in conference. Legislation for the application of the plan was submitted to this Parliament by the Scullin Government, and agreed to by all parties. NA TUBERCULOSIS.",26

59,Mr LYONS,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,The Government is quite prepared to give consideration to WHEAT BOUNTY. DELAY IN PAYMENT.,26
60,Mr THOMPSON,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"Is the Minister Markets aware that delays are occurring in the payment of the bounty on last season's wheat? By way of explanation, I may say that I have been advised by wheat-growers in my electorate that statements of claim were put in as long ago as last November, and not only has no payment been made, but no acknowledgment of their claims has been received from the department.",26
61,Mr HAWKER,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"The work of paying the bounty entails a great deal of checking, and the expedition with which that work can be done depends largely upon how accurately and completely the necessary forms are filled in by the farmers themselves. In New South Wales not nearly so much bounty ha? been paid out as in the States of Victoria and South Australia. In New South Wales there 3eems to be a much wider misunderstanding than in the other States mentioned of what is required on the forms. This not only causes delay to the individual, whose application forms have to be referred hack, but it results in delay throughout the department. It has been necessaiy to employ in New South Wales nearly double the staff to carry out the checking that has been neejsssary, for instance, in South Australia. I hope that henceforward the payment of the bounty will be proceeded with much more expeditiously than in the past, since everybody concerned is now becoming more familiar with the procedure. SUGAR AGREEMENT. _ Mr MARTENS - What are the intentions of the Government in regard to the sugar agreement?",27
62,Mr LYONS,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"I have already made a public statement to the effect that the Government feels that in times like these, when practically every section of the community and every industry is suffering, no particular industry should be left in such a position that it enjoys, generally speaking, all the advantages that it had in the past. A definite agreement was entered into by the previous Government with those associated with the sugar industry. The present Government recognizes the existence of that agreement, and it does not propose that by any direct action, that agreement should be broken; but it feels that the timo has come when the parties to the agreement should he invited to reconsider the matter, in view of the sacrifices made by every other section of the community throughout Australia, and that a voluntary agreement might be arrived at until the financial and economic conditions in Australia improve. I may say definitely that only on a voluntary basis would an amendment of the agreement be suggested.",27
63,Mr FORDE,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"Regardin g the proposed voluntary reduction in the price of sugar, which the Prime Minister has stated should be made, has the Commonwealth Government communicated with the Queensland Government, and with the Queensland sugar interests, indicating what reduction, if any, should be made ?",27

65,Dr EARLE PAGE,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"In view of the rapid spread of cattle tick infestation through the northern districts of New South Wales, involving the shifting southward of the quarantine line some 200 miles in the last month, is the Health Department taking steps to assist the cattlemen to minimize the danger of further - infection southwards?",27
66,Mr MARR,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"This is a problem mainly for the Government of New South Wales, but the Commonwealth Government, in co-Operating with the State Government, has been spending large sums of money for some years in an endeavour to eradicate the pest. The Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State Ministry, is now considering whether the activities of the Federal Department, in assisting in the eradication of tick, should be increased or diminished.",27
67,Mr R GREEN,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"Will the Minister for Health (Mr Marr) make immediate inquiries regarding the matter just referred to, the spread southward of that terrible menace to the cattle industry known as the tick pest? Deaths have already occurred in my electorate from red water fever, aud it is well known that cattle ticks spread this disease. If it gets into the valuable herds in the coastal districts of New South Wales untold damage will result. Will the Minister tneat this matter as urgent, and make a statement regarding it?",27
68,Mr MARR,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"This is a matter of peculiar and particular interest to New South Wales. It is the duty of that State to safeguard the interests of its cattle growers, to provide for the dipping of eattle and the eradication of the tick. Tho Commonwealth has already done more than its share in providing funds to assist New South Wales. It has cost the Commonwealth to date £55,000 for this purpose, and it is now the duty of the New South Wales Government to take drastic action for the control and eradication of tick.",28
69,Mr THORBY,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"Did the Department of Health agree to the relaxation of restrictions on the transfer of cattle within and without the New South Wales quarantine area, or did the New South Wales Government act on its own initiative in this matter?",28
70,Mr MARR,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"A commission consisting of representatives of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales was set up to deal with matters relating to the control of the cattle tick pest. That commission meets periodically, and, as far as I can ascertain, it has never authorized the relaxation of any restrictions, nor did any such relaxation take place. effort has been made to eradicate the tick from New South Wales, and to prevent its furthe r progress southward. NEW SOUTH WALES LOANS. OVERDUE INTEREST.

71,Mr LYONS,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"My Government has beeu endeavouring to obtain from the Premier of New South Wales (Mr Lang) information that would enable it to make the payments due. We have asked for a definite statement as to the amount due, and the amount that the State is able to make available, so that the Commonwealth Government may make arrangements for the payment balance, but we have been unable to obtain a satisfactory reply from the Premier of New South Wales. We recognize that this position cannot be allowed to continue, and that the default of New South Wales must not be per[2] mitted to become the default of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I have only this morning notified the Premier of New South Wales that my Government proposes to go aheadi n the matter. I think that it will he well for me to inform honourable members of the text of the telegram that has been sent to the Premier of New South Wales. It is as follows On 10th February I advised you that in the interests, of Australian credit, Commonwealth Government had decided to make arrangements for payment as soon as possible on behalf of New South Wales of overseas interest due beginning this month in respect of which Government of New South Wales had defaulted. I advised what amounts Commonwealth understood were due and asked you to confirm same. I also asked what contribution your Government was prepared to make towards paying overdue interest. On 13th February, I gave undertaking sought by you that Commonwealth would not without consent of State use or suffer to be used any reply to my telegram of 10th February in evidence against State in any pending or future litigation. To date I have not received reply from you. In view of my announcement on 10th February that Commonwealth Government would make arrangements for these payments on behalf of New South Wales as soon as possible, Commonwealth Government cannot longer wait foT reply from you and has now decided to carry out immediEvery ately its undertaking to pay on behalf of New South Wales the overdue interest. This payment will be made on basis of information now in possession of Commonwealth. My Government however is still desirous of ascertaining precise details of payments overdue by New South Wales and what contribution your Government can make towards those payments and desires that your Govermuent should make this information available immediately subject to the undertaking given in my telegram of 13th February in that regard.",28
72,Mr BLAKELEY,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"During the general election campaign, the Prime Minister was reported to have said on several occasions that if his party was elected to office it would honour all obligations promptly and full y.

Are the people of Australia to of the assume that such default on the part of the Commonwealth will become the regular practice?",28

The newspaper accounts are difficult to follow, and it is almost impossible to understand the position.",29
77,Mr LYONS,SPAHLINGER TREATMENT OF,"I shall look into this matter, and see to what extent the papers can be made available.

93,Mr LYONS,PREMIERS CONFERENCE AN D,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.36] - by leaveThe Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs (Mr Latham) will leave for Great Britain shortly, in order to represent the Commonwealth of Australia at the Disarmament Conference at Geneva. Owing to the great importance of the problems of disarmament, and their possible interrelation with problems of war debts and separations, it has been decided that the Commonwealth should be directly represented at Geneva. The importance of tihe problems to be dealt with makes it imperative that the ablest available repreappointed sentative should attend on behalf of Australia as leader of the delegation. In the meantime the High Commissioner in London, Sir Granville Ryrie, will represent Australia at the conference. NA CONFERENCE AT OTTAWAREPRESENTATION IN LONDON - Statutor y Rules 1932, No. 8.",30
94,Mr LYONS,IMPERIAL ECONOMIC,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.37] - by leave- I take this opportunity of informing the House that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce) and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) will represent the Commonwealth at the forthcoming Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. After the Ottawa Conference has concluded, Mr Bruce will proceed t'o London as Minister representing the Commonwealth. He will discharge the functions of the High Commissioner, thus avoiding the necessity of a further appointment to that office after Major-General Sir Granville Ryrie's term expires in May next. The financial position in London requires the most skilled and careful attention. There are the questions of the large, shortterm debt, and of meeting the loan of £13,000,000 which falls due in November. It is believed that the services of Mr. Bruce in connection with these matters will be of the greatest value to the Commonwealth, and the Government is satisfied that the arrangement proposed is the one most calculated to promote the interests of Australia during the present critical period.
