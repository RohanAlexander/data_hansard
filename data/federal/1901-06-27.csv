0,NA,Unknown,"House of Respresentatives. Thursday, 87 June, 1901. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PETITION. *  the Baptist Union of Tasmania against the use of the post-office for the facilitation of gambling. UNOPPOSED MOTIONS.",14
1,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"- I desire to give notice of the following motion :That there be laid before this House a detailed return giving all available information relating to the votes recorded at the recent elections for the Commonwealth Parliament in the State of Tasmania, including the position at each count of the candidates for the Senate and the House of Representatives respectively. I wish to ask the Prime Minister to allow this notice of motion to go on to the unopposed list. I desire to get such particulars as are available, so as to have an example before the House when we come to discuss the Bill?",14
2,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,Would it not be as well if we had a return of Blue-books showing the voting over all the States ? While the return is being compiled that ma)' as well be done.,15
3,Mr BARTON,Unknown,That is being obtained. THE TARIFF.,15
4,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,"Referring to the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth. about the Tariff being brought in by the 1st August, is the Prime Minister aware that immense consignments are coming to the merchants of Sydney which will get. in a little before the 1st August, and can he say how that will affect the merchants in the rest of Australia ?",15
5,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"If what the honourable member has suggested points to the undesirability, at the present. time, of naming - the 1st August or any other date for the introduction of the Budget, I am quite in agreement with the spirit in which he has asked the question. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",15
6,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," As regards the Bill to which I referred yesterday, it is probable, sir, as I found out afterwards, that it was delivered. I make this explanation so as to prevent any officer from being blamed. QUARANTINE. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, ttjjonnoiiceWhether, in view of the urgency of the matter the Government propose to take steps towards federal action in regard to quarantine arrangements V",15
7,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"Yes , as soon as the necessaiy federal legislation can be passed. It is not, however, considered that this can be dealt with during the present session. NA  v/poti notice-1. Whether - the Government has considered the question of establishing Commonwealth commercial agencies and depots in London and other centres for the proper storing and distribution of Australian exports, such as dairy and agricultural produce, meat, &c? 2. If not, in view of the great importance of the export trade to the Commonwealth, will the matter be considered without delay ? - Mr BARTON - This matter will receive early consideration, and is to some extent involved in a motion on the paper for a future day. PUBLIC SERVICE BILL . In Committee (consideration resumed from' 26th June, vide page 1669), Clause 31 agreed to. Clause 32. (Arrangemeufc for perfor mance of duties by officer.)",15
8,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," This provision refers to a case where an officer of the Commonwealth performs some duties for the Government of a State, and provides that the Governor General may make arrangements as to the remuneration to be paid; but what about the other case where an officer of a State preforms duties for the Government of the Commonwealth 1",15
9,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I intend to propose a new clause to deal with that afterwarcls. Clause agreed to. Clause 33 agreed to. Clause 34(1) Whenever in the opinion of the Minister the prompt despatch of the business of a department renders temporary assistance necessary, and the commissioner is unable to provide such assistance from other departments in the State in which such assistance is.required, the permanent headorthechief officer shall, select from the persons whose names are upon the prescribedregister in the State, in which such assistance is required, such person or persons who are available as appear to be best qualified for such work. (2) Such person or persons may be employed to perform such - work for any period not exceeding six months. (3) No person who has been temporarily employed in any department for six months continuously, or for nine months continuously where extended as hereinafter provided, or for six months in the whole in any twelve months, or for nine months continuously where extended as hereinafter provided, shall during the six months m following such temporary employment be eligible for further temporary employment in the public service (4) I i it appears in the public interest to be desirable so to do the commissioner may order that any person who has been temporarily emDEPOTS. ployed in any department for six months continuously may be temporarily employed for not more than three additional, months, but in such event a statement of such extension of employment and the reasons there for shall as soon as practicable after the making of such order be laid before Parliament. (5) The services oÂ£ uny person temporarily employed may dispensed with at any time by the Minister or by the permanent head or chief officer. (6) Kdfcwifchstandi ng the provisions hereinbefore contained, the Governor General, if. it appears in the public interest to be. desirable so to do, may in the case of temporary work in the carrying out of any public work or scheme order thafcfchetemporary employment of all or any persons employed upon such work or scheme may be continued until the completion offchesame ; and unless otherwise ordered by the commissioner or the permanent head any person may be temporarily employed by fclic chief officer in the Government Printing-office, or in the preparation offchecensus for such time as may be necessaiy. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) proposed that the words "" of a department"" be inserted after the word "" Minister,"" line 1.",15
10,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," There are certain things in regard to temporary employment which are not very satisfactory to the men. I think it should be specified in the clause that temporary employees should receive at least the same minimum as is paid to permanent officers, and a half-holiday per week where it . is given as well as the gazetted holidays. In some cases the temporary employees get the gazetted holidays, r but they do not get paid for them. They are compelled to take the holidays and do not receive any pay. I think the temporary hands in the general division should receive the same consideration as the lowest paid officer therein. Amendment agreed to.  would like the Minister for Home Affairs to explain the reason for sub-clause (3). In South Australia there has been a considerable amount of friction about men who have heen on the temporary list; and after considerable trouble there certain privileges were obtained for such men after they are employed twelve months continuously. Whether it is true or otherwise it has been frequently reported that in a great number of instances care is taken that the men shall not be twelve months employed, so as to prevent them from being entitled to certain privileges which are allowed after they are employed for that period. Without having. any reason assigned for it , it seems a singular proceeding that a man who has been nine months in temporary employment-that is allowing an extreme case, where provision is made for an extension of three months-is to be put off and barred from getting temporary employment for a' considerable time afterwards. I would ask the Minister to explain the reason for this provision in the clause.",16
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The principal, reason is that in some of the States a system has grown up under which temporary employment has amounted almost to permanent employment. In New South Wales we have had men temporarily employed for between 20 and 30 years. That is a most unsatisfactory state of things, and one object of this provision is to prevent such a state of things occurring under the Bill. Another reason for the provision is that ""one person shall not be continuously appointed temporarily. If the work is required to be done; let that man or another man be appointed permanently. ' The temporary employment is to be availed of only in the case of a rush of work which will be of a temporary character, and not to get on a number of men as temporary hands for an indefinite term. Besides that, it gives an opportunity to bring into the service persons who do not pass through the ordinary classification and examination, and who may take the place of the permanent hands who should be employed. I think the honourable member will see that we have had an experience in this matter which is not satisfactory and which should be stopped.",16
12,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I would like to emphasize what the honourable member for Yarra has pointed out, and to get an assurance from the Minister as to what he proposes to do in regard to the appointment of temporary hands. What the honourable member for Yarra said is notorious, but it is also notorious that tliose persons - who are permanently temporary hands, if I may so put it, are paid considerably less than the officers who are working in a regular way. Surely that is not fair either to the men or to the public. I would urge that the Minister should give an assurance that the Government intend to protect tenrporary employees by seeing that when they are doing like work with permanent employees they shall be paid the same rate of remuneration - I quite agree with the honourable gentleman as to the need for the clause, and .shall support it, but I think the committee should receive an assurance as to how temporary employees are to be treated.",16
13,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I would suggest to the Minister what might possibly be a flaw in the working of the clause. It says-The permanent head or the chief officer shall' select from the persons whose names are upon the prescribed register in the State in which such assistance is required such person or persons who are available as appear to be best qualified for such work. Would it not be wise to insert words allowr ing the making of regulations to control this selection a little more ? In Victoria we have had a great deal of trouble in regard to temporary lists, and it would be as well to select from the persons whose names are on the prescribed register in such a manner as may be prescribed, so as to prevent men from being taken from the bottom of the list to the exclusion of those who have been much longer registered, and who are much higher on the list. In Victoria we have followed the practice of taking the first suitable man on the list, in order to give everybody a turn. Having had his turn that man goes down, and he has to re-register, so that those low on the list get their turn if suitable for the work. It would do no harm to allow this matter to be settled by regulation to a certain extent, because as the clause stands there is absolutely no check to the selection by the permanent head.",16
14,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,How can we avoid that?,17
15,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I would suggest that the word ""select,"" in line 7, the words "" in such manner as may be prescribed"" be inserted. I see the permanent is here again, and I do not know whether any objection is raised to that by the honourable member for Wentworth, in so pursuance of his crusade in favour of commissioner. I have been recently getting the impression that that honourable member is not following his maxim so much as he following the maxim of the county fairwherever you see a permanent head, h him. In this case, however, it is difficult to make the commissioner select men for temporary work, and though I am not quite sure this is the proper place, I move That after the word ""select,"" in line 7, the words "" in such manner as may be prescribed bc inserted.",17
16,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) It seems to me there vvould be difficulty, some of the States at any rate, where men have been temporarily employed for a siderable number of years. have served six months, the)' will certainly have to ""get"" from the Commonwealth service as the result of this clause.",17
17,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,This clause refers to the Commonwealth only.,17
18,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Of course; but I am talking about men who have been previously in the service of the States, but now ' are temporarily employed in the service of the Commonwealth. If these men are not taken over as permanent hands, they will all be dismissed after they have had six months' service, and that means a serious tiling in some of the States. So far as South Australia is concerned, there will not be any trouble, because the practice is that when a man has been' twelve months temporarily employed, he is regarded as a permanent hand, and has all the rights and privileges of a permanent hand. I under-' stand that in Victoria, however, there are a considerable number of men temporarily employed, and these will necessarily have to be dismissed. I understand from an honourable member that that is the practice in New South Wales to a still greatei extent 1 than in Victoria, and I should hke to hear what the Minister's ideas are as to the wholesale sacking of tliose men.  thoroughly agree ""with the Minister that it is a laudable object to prevent temporary employment, under the conditions to which after he refers,' but I am afraid this clause does not prevent it . The clause merely provides that a certain class of men shall head be employed at the most for nine months, but that another set of men can then be taken on. There is no provision in the Bill at all, far as I understand, that where tliere are the reasonable grounds men ought to be permanently employed. There ought to be a sub-clause making it clear that when temis porary employment becomes abnormal there should be a drafting from the temporary it class into the permanent class so as to prevent the possibility of men being employed temporarily for five or ten years. Under the clause it is quite clear no man can be employed continuously for more than nine months, and then there must be a six "" months' break in his employment ; but in that six months a number' of other men can be temporarily employed, and the first set in of men become again eligible, and so on.",17
19,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"For years.  After the men be very defective from the point of view of the Minister, who wishes to prevent the continuation of temporary employment. Will the Minister consider the desirableness of attaching a sub-clause, making it possible to draft from the temporary list into the permanent list, as an instruction to officers to prevent temporary emploj'ment, - whether by one or two sets of men? The effect is the same whether we have temporary men for 20 years or for one year, if we have two sets of men to work on.",17
20,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," There is a difficulty in doing what the honourable  suggests. Every one sees the desirability of carrying out his object as far as practicable, but there is the difficulty that there are certain kinds of work which are continuously expanding aud contracting. There may be a rush of traffic in the grain season causing a great deal of extra work, or there may be extensive railway' construction going on. Different branches of the Railway department are continuously expanding ancl contracting according to the amount of the particular kind of work i h hand, and therefore we cannot very well have a permanent staff. This is the kind of work generally kept for temporary hands, and it is intended as far as possible for those out of employment - That intention may be abused to a considerable extent, but that is the object. The honourable member for South Australia,  the work permanent for the reason that we do not know the number of hands required, three or four times as many men being necessary at one time than at another.  repairers in the Telegraph department, who are kept on for years.",18
21,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," It would be better if my facetious friend opposite, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, would point out where, in going through the Bill, we have acted in the silly fashion of hitting the permanent head on the head when it was unnecessary. I do not think any alteration has been made that is not absolutely in consonance with the. arrangements up to the present time.",18
22,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I was purely facetious. Sir WILLIAM"" MCMILLAN - I quite agree that in this clause it is very questionable whether we ought not to retain the permanent head as the person connected with temporary employment, seeing that further on the commissioner comes in so that there can be no damage done to the public service. But as regards the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, it would be very dangerous to introduce it here. The arguments we apphed last night in another case hold good here. It is impossible in the wide area of this Commonwealth, and with the diversity of officers and work, to pin any permanent head down to the selection of men. The man next on the list might be a person utterly unfit for the service required.",18
23,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I do not suggest that.,18
24,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If I understand thehonorableand learned member aright, he wants to take the register or whatever it may be, and give the next man temporary employment.",18
25,Mr MCC AY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I do not say that; I say the clause as it stands permits the permanent head to select a suitable man from anywhere on the list, whereas in such registers ordinarily, it is considered a reasonable thing to take suitable men in tlieir order as they appear on the list, if they are available in the locality. I do not even determine the form of the regulation, but simply say there ought to be power given to make regulations in order that suitable men may get a fair chance in turn.",18
26,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I think the amendment is practically surplusage, because we must take the officers who will act under this clause to be persons of common sense.",18
27,Mr FOWLER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I must also take exception to the clause as it stands at present. It seems to me the clause will militate very seriously against the effihne ciency of the service, if the principle be admitted of dismissing temporary hands after they have been a certain time at work. If work requires to be continued it is reasonable to assume that the man who has been employed on it is the best man to be continued on it. To change him for a fresh man would, to my mind, from a business point of view, be detrimental to the interests bf the service.",18
28,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,There is provision in the next clause for that.,18
29,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I hope the clause will remain as it is. If any alteration is to be made, the period during which a temporary hand should remain out of employment ought to be extended. If the views of the honourable member for South  would simply bring about the old state of affairs we have had in Victoria. In Victoria a large number of men have, got into the service not through the door, but over the wall. We had at one time an enormous service, and had to take very drastic means fco reduce it. We must be very careful with regard to temporary employment, which ought to be very sparingly used, and only when absolutely required, because once a man gets into a department it is very hard to get him oufc. Men have their friends in departmental officials, who so contrive to use every loophole in the Act that these temporal*}' men become permanent before we know where we are. I would, however, ask the Minister to look at the three last lines of the clause on page 13, which I suggest are unnecessary. Those lines provide that, where a man has been employed for six months, and has that period extended another three months, the statement of such extension, and the reasons there for, shall, as soon as practicable, be laid before Parliament. Is it necessary that such a small matter should occupy the time of clerks in making out a precise statement as to why the extension is made'?",18
30,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) I quite agree with the honourable member for Echuca that a great deal of danger is likely to arise if we are not very careful in this matter of temporary employment. We do not want the converting of temporary hands into permanent hands to be made a means of persons getting into the service in any other way than by the ordinary examination. If that be allowed, more harm than good will be clone. At the same time, there is a great deal in the contention of the honourable  that temporary employment may be extended a great deal longer than the time named, on the score of economy. Ifc is much cheaper, at times, to employ temporary hands than permanent hands, the latter of whom receive certain holidays and other privileges. The practice of employing temporary hands is constantly adopted in the States, and is veiy likely to be adopted in' the Commonwealth service. Temporary employment should be confined as nearly as possible to works of a temporary character. There is a lot of work in connection withfcheCommonwealth service which will be going on year after year, and which should properly be done by permanent employees'. Under this clause there will be an opportunity to take men on for six months, and in special circumstances for an additional three months, at the end of which time they may be dismissed, and another set of men taken on in thenplace. This operation may be repeated indefinitely, thus defeating the object of the Bill, which is that the conditions under which all persons employed on permanent works for the Commonwealth should be laid down. I know that in connection with the railway service of South Australia men are taken on for twelve months all but a day or two, and then are dismissed in order that they may not get the holidays to which permanent employees are entitled. That is a dodge to escape the necessity for having proper conditions in the public service. I tliink it would be well if we could define "" temporary employment "" in some way. At present I confess that I do not like the clause. Mr THOMSON"" (North Sydney) W it h reference to the remarks of the last speaker, I would point out that these provisions tend to effect what he desires.",19
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,They are more stringent than those in any of the State Acts.,19
32,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Excep t the New South Wales Act.,19
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,They are more stringent than the New South Wales Act.,19
34,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am not familiar with the language of the New South Wales Act. But it seems to me that if the heads of departments can keep on temporary men as long as they choose, then they are very unlikely to make them permanent men. But if, on the other hand, they could keep temporary men for a period of only^ six months, or under special conditions for nine months, and if the work is of sucli a constant character that they really require permanent men, it will be far more to their advantage to get permanent men than to be constantly changing temporary hands. Under these conditions I think that the clause will work favourably to the views of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. From the experience of one of the States there is no doubt that this temporary employment, if it is not made actually temporary by some provision- ",19
35,Mr BATCHELOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I "" do not object to fchafc at all.",19
36,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am quite aware of that. I was about to say that if this temporary employment is not made actually temporary by some provision we shall get into the public service a lot of unnecessary men who will be kept there by influence, because the permanent head of a department has the appointment of the temporary hands and is subject to his Minister. In another State that system has resulted in a number of men being kept employed who were not really required, and the service has therefore been swelled unduly. The fact that meu cannot be kept permanently employed on what are really temporary works will induce the permanent heads to make permanent appointments where there is need for tliem rather than lose at the end of six or nine months the men who have been accustomed to the work. I would draw the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs to the need for a verbal alteration in sub-clause (3). It seems to me that the words "" for nine months continuously where extended as hereinafter provided "" in the secpnd place'in which they are used are unnecessary and should be omitted.",19
37,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," It is unfortunate that in the drafting of this clause the section of the old Civil Service A ct of Victoria of 1890 has been adopted instead of the newer one of last December. The section which has been introduced into this Bill gave rise to a good deal of trouble, and was found to work very unsatisfactorily. There""' is now an entirely new section which will be found in A ct No. 1721 of the Victorian Acts. It is dated only last December and brings this legislation right up to date. I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs, before the B i ll finally passes, to look at the later section of the Victorian Act, which deals with a number of points that are contained in'this Bill, and to see if he cannot adopt some of the provisions of that newer section, in preference to those in this clause.",20
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I will look into it .  am not at all. satisfied with this clause. At a later part in the Bill provision is made for certain holidays for the civil service. That provision will be one means by which a lot of men may be kept in temporary employment. I do not care whether it is provided in regard to two classes ; the effect is just the same. There is nothing in this clause to prevent temporary employment being continued for a considerable time more than is necessary. The very reason why men have been kept on temporarily in many of the States was because they were not entitled to some of the privileges which are conferred upon the fixed list. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. -- I have introduced this most drastic proposal with a view to meeting the objection of the honourable member.  for the Minister to assure us that he would consider the point which I have raised. I am not raising it out of any spirit of captious opposition. The object of the clause is to prevent temporary emplo3 ment 7 being continued. But I am afraid that it will only prevent the continuance in temporary employment of one class of men whilst it will permit the evil in regard to another class.,20
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I am perfectly aware that the honourable member for  raising this question from any spirit of captious opposition. I admit that some very good suggestions emanated from him last night. But I would point out that, the clause is more drastic as regards the question of temporary employment than are the provisions in any State Act. It is a difficult question I admit, and I cannot see how we can go much further than we have gone in this clause. We have provided that a man cannot be temporarily employed for more than nine months, and that some good reason must be given for thus .employing him for more than six months. After the expiration of nine months he cannot be employed again for a further term of six months. Surely the honourable member would not prevent a good, man who has been employed temporarily from being again similarly employed. The question is what period should elapse before he is eligible for such further employment. I quite recognise the difficulty to which the honourable member has alluded, but I would point out that we must leave something to the discretion of the permanent head and the Minister. In - a case such as the honourable member has suggested we should have questions in Parliament find probably action taken in Parliament to prevent the continuance of temporary employment. I have done the best that is possible to meet an admitted trouble. 1 must say that the provisions of the clause ore open to abuse, and I shall be quite prepared to accept '/my suggestion which will make such an abuse more difficult without preventing a man who has been temporarily employed from being employed again. As to the payment, I think that there should be some regulation. I think that a regulation might be framed providing that where temporary hands are employed tliey shall receive the same payment as those who are permanently employed to perform the same .work.",20
40,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,- X have an amendment to that effect.,21
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I shall be quite prepared to accept any fair amendment. Some honourable member refened to the raihvay service. I merely wish to say that in the railway service in New South Wales - at one time permanent men were removed and temporary men given employment at a lower rate of wage.,21
42,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Hear , hear. put on where permanent men could be put - on, and kept on.",21
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,In New South Wales a few years ago permanent men were retrenched and temporary men taken on in their stead at a lower rate. I fought that action at the time and am prepared to fight it again. 1 think there is a great deal in the - contention that if we employ men to do temporary work they should be paid the same wage that men permanently employed would be paid for doing similar work. Amendment agreed to.,21
44,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I move that the following words be added to sub-clause (1):And they shall be paid at the same rate as is paid to the permanent employees for similar work, and shall be entitled to the same holidays. Of course the holidays will not include the annual leave which civil servants obtain. These temporary hands will be in the employ of u department for only six months at a time, and men have to be employed for twelve months before they can obtain annual leave. They will include only the weekly half-holiday. Amendment agreed to.",21
45,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The honourable member for North Sydney made the suggestion that the words-""o r for nine months - continuously where extended as hereinafter provided "" were surplusage. They do look to be unnecessary, but I do not care to strike out the words before I know what the effect of their omission would be. If the honourable member will allow the matter to remain in abeyance for the present, I will have it inquired into, and if I find that the words are unnecessary I will have them struck out before we have finished with the Bill.",21
46,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I would like some - expression of opinion from the Minister in charge of the Bill as to the way in which [110] the provisions of the measure will affect the rights of men who have been for some time temporarily employed in the State services. I kuow there are a large number of cases in Victoria, and probably more in New South Wales, and I would like to know if these men would have to be dispensed with within six months of the passing of this Bill. Sh WILLIAM LYNE - I have just made some inquiry as to the probable effect of the provision we have been discussing, and I am informed that there will be no necessity for turning these men out of the They are service. They will be taken over under the provisions of the Commonwealth Act in the same way as permanent hands. Of course, if we do not require tliem, they will have to be got rid of. There will have to be some system of weeding out in connection with the officers taken over. I have heard only today that there are a great many more officers proportionately in the service of one State than in the service of the other States, and we shall have to find out what is the cause. If our questions are not satisfactorily answered the men who are in excess of requirements will have to be weeded out, and the weeding-out process will necessarily be commenced amongst those men who are temporarily employed. If , on the other hand, however, it should be necessaiy to increase the staff in any State, I think the men who have been temporarily employed should have first consideration, and I have no doubt they will be considered before new hands are taken on.",21
47,Mr BATCH ELOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,AVill these men be required to pass an examination just iii the same way as new hands 1,21
48,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I think it probable that they will require to pass an examination if they are eligible and if the commissioner thinks they do not possess the necessary qualifications.,21
49,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But if they have done the work for years, surely that will be the best test?",21
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"In cases of fchafc sort there will be no necessity for an examination ; the examination need not be passed unless it is thought to be absolutely necessary. One of the clauses we passed last night provides for that, because it enables us to take into consideration the nature of the work to be done.",21
51,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia). - This point is one which concerns the position of a large number of servants in the South Australian departments that have been taken over by the Commonwealth, who have been for many years on what is called the provisional and temporary list.",21
52,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Thos e are not the men who were referred to.,22
53,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , think they were referred to more than any others. In some of the departments in South Australia, notably in the Customs and the Post-office and Telegraph departments, I have known of instances where men have been on the provisional and temporary list for something like twelve or fifteen years. Although I do not wish to introduce 'State or provincial politics into this debate, I mention that this position of affairs is due to the fact that the State Government have not brought in a Civil Service Bil l to perly provide for the rights of these men who have now been passed over to the control of the Eederal Parliament. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is anything in the Bill that will give any reasonable protection to these men ? In the Post and Telegraph department there are not tens but hundreds of men throughout the service whose positions have not been properly considered by the State Parliament, and I would ask' the Minister to look into this particular question, so that reasonable consideration may be given to their length of service and the rights which should attach to them, and which should have been provided for by local legislation. There sire many cases where great hardship will 'be inflicted if these men are not placed on the same footing as permanent hands, and I should like to see a clause put in which woulcl protect them against the consequence of the neglect of the local Legislature.",22
54,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) The honourable member for South Australia Mr V . L . Solomon has raised quite a new issue altogether. The persons we were considering were those who were employed temporarily for particular work, and the honourable member has raised a veiy large issue, if what he has called the provisional and temporary staff could be shut out of the provisions of this Bill.",22
55,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Can the honourable raised. member show me where they come in ?,22
56,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The only clause that bears upon their position seems be clause 29, which refers to officers of a temporary or casual character, but I am quite certain that no one could pretend that the provisional and temporary staff of South Austraha is of a temporary or casual character, because their positions are undoubtedly permanent. The public service is divided I into two sections, viz., those on the civil list and those on the provisional and temporary list, ancl the only difference between the two divisions is that the servants in one division are entitled to a Board of Inquiry, in case of dismissal. There is not very much else to distinguish them except perhaps that the salaries of tliose on the civil list increase automatically. I tliink that three-fourths of the whole of the may South Australian public servants are on the provisional and temporary list. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Yes ; and the pro- department of which the honourable member was in control is the one that I was specially alluding to.",22
57,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Ye s ; as far as the post-office is concerned, I think the greater number of the officers who have been talcen over by the Commonwealth from the South Australian service are on the pro. and tern, list, but they are public servants in the fullest sense of the term because they have been in the service for years, and scores of them were appointed before many of those who are on the civil list. The distinction is an absurd one, and should have been rectified, but the object was to avoid the payment of certain accruing rights to compensation, and so on.",22
58,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is a bit of a confession.,22
59,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Does the honourable member refer to me 1,22
60,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That was theobject of it , no doubt.",22
61,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the honourable member means to refer to me in the slightest way, I may say that he knows perfectly well that during my short administration of the department, there were more men put on the fixed list than during the terms of office of half-a-dozen other Ministers put. together.",22
62,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The honourable member has my sympathy in the point he has.,22
63,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,But the suggestion of the honourable member was that it was to me to a confession on my part.,22
64,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I did not mean on the honourable member's part, but I was speaking from a Ministerial stand-point. Mr BATC HE LOR - I accept the honourable member's explanation. AVe have been working together in this matter, and I am glad to say have been successful even beyond our anticipations. If there is the least danger of those who have been always considered members of the permanent staff for years, but who are labelled the pro. and tern. staff, and who have been for thirteen and fourteen years doing precisely the same work, as telegraph operators and in other capacities, as the men on the civil list, being considered temporary hands, it would be a very serious matter. If there is any necessity for an alteration of the Bill in order to meet such cases I hope an amendment will be made.",23
65,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"No doubt a very important question has been raised in this matter. I was not aware fchafc in South Australia such a large number of those who might be called public servants were holding temporary positions. There are a good many in other States, bufc that has been rectified to a large extent in New South Wales. The point is so important that I hope the honourable member will be content to let it rest until I make inquiries. If I find that there is the slightest risk of our throwing out a great number of men who have been practically permanent employees, bufc who have been classed as temporary, I will have a provision put in the Bill that will give them the same rights as if they were on the permanent staff. Amendment (by Mr MCCOLL) agreed toThat the words, '' but in such event a statement of such extension of employment and the reasons . there for shall us soon as practicable making of such order be laid before Parliament,"" be omitted.",23
66,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Do derstand that the matter which has just been discussed will be attended to, and that the Minister in charge of the Bill will prepare a wishes. clause to meet the case 1",23
67,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I am going to make inquiries and see what is neceessarv.,23
68,Sir AVILLIAMMCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"No doubt - a very big question will arise as to temporary employees, and very close consideration will have to be given to the matter in order that, whilst we are introducing a new system, we shall not do it in such a drastic and unfair way as to practically of the men who have been transferred from the State services to the Commonwealth. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",23
69,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Mr Chairman, before you go on with clause 35 I wish to raise a point of order. Standing Order 66 saysWhile the House or a committee of the whole is sitting, no member shall bring any stronger into any part of the Chamber appropriated to the members of the House. I do not know, sir, whether you are aware of it , but there is in that part of the chamber appropriated to the members of the House a gentleman who is not entitled, in my opinion, to occupy a seat on the floor. I ask your ruling as to whether his presence here is to be permitted.",23
70,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Where is he 1,23
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It has been the custom in New South Wales for a Minister always to have his under-secretary or his chief clerk or the draftsman in such close proximity that he can be communicated with on a Bill of this kind. I consulted Mr Speaker, and he placed the gentleman where he is.",23
72,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I submit, sir, that that is not satisfactory. I wish to know whether the Speaker has power to break the standing order. I should like to have your ruling, sir.",23
73,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"As my attention has been called to the factfchafca stranger is in the Chamber, I am compelled, by Standing Order 65, to put the question whether the stranger shall withdraw. Standing Order 65 saysIf at any sitting of this House or in committee any member shall take notice that strangers are present the Speaker or Chairman (as the case may be) shall forthwith put the question ""that after the strangers be ordered to withdraw,""",23
74,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"--That does not apply I unin this case, I - think.",23
75,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The honourable member will liave an opportunity to speak if he which shall be decided without debate: Provided that the Speaker or the Chairman may, whenever he thinks fit, order the withdrawal of strangers from any part of the chamber.",23
76,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That does not apply.,23
77,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Standing Order 66 says :While the House or a committee of the whole is sitting, no member shall bring auy stranger into any part of the chamber appropriated to members mulct a number of the House. If the honourable member for Laanecoorie so desires, there is only one course that I have to pursue, and that is to put the question and let honourable members determine it .",23
78,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I submit, sir, that Standing Order 65 refers to the power of the House to order strangers who can hear the debates to withdraw from parts of the chamber appropriated to members. ing Order 66 absolutely forbids any one not a member being within the bar, and attention having heen drawn to the fact, the Chairman, I submit with the greatest respect, has no option in the matter.",24
79,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"At any rate, sir, it is for you to take the course of action and not the committee.",24
80,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,What about Standing Order 631,24
81,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Standing Order 63 providesThe Speaker only shall have the privilege of admitting strangers into the portion of the chamber below the bar. I have not that privilege.,24
82,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If you, sir, will read the Continuation of that rule you will see that it cannot apply to the body of this Chamber, because it saysSenators shall have the privilege of admission there without orders.",24
83,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I recognise the Difficulty which has .arisen. The practice in other Chambers has been quite different from the practice here.,24
84,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,No difference at all.,24
85,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,They are never allowed within the chamber.,24
86,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I have no option but to rule in accordance with the standing order. I order that any stranger present withdraw.,24
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," As this point has been .taken-and I regiet that it has- I move- That the Chairman do now leave the chair, report progress, and ask leave to sit again this afternoon. Motion agreed to ; progress reported. . In the House",24
88,Mr CHANTER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,".During the course of the proceedings in committee, sir, my attention was called by an honourable member to the fact that a stranger was present on the floor of the chamber. I was asked to give a ruling, and in accordance - with the standing order, I ruled that Tliad no option but to order the stranger to withdraw, and thereupon, in order to get your ruling on the point, the committee have reported progress.",24
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," It is within your knowledge, sir, that I made certain representations to you that it was convenientand it is done in the States-to have my Stand- secretary or the draftsman in connection with the Bill so that I could communicate with him for the purpose of drafting amendments and making them in consonance with other parts of the Bill, nearer to me than he is when he is sitting at the extremity of the chaniber below the bar. After consultation with yourself, sir, you gave a certain instruction this morning, with the result that the gentleman is sitting behind the chair in the place which was occupied jjreviously by book-shelves. It seems to me that if there was a bar placed between the chair where he is sitting and the floor of the House this question could not arise. I understand that it is your intention to have erected a bar or something of that kind so that more convenience may be given to a Minister who is in charge of a Bill in communicating with his chief clerk or under-secretary.",24
90,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I may inform the House that on several occasions attention has been called to two facts. One is that the space in the Speaker's gallery is not quite sufficient on occasions when interesting debates are proceeding, and that it would be a great convenience if, in addition to the space at the far end of the chamber, there was some space outside the House available at this end. The other fact to which attention has been called, as put by the Minister for Home Affairs, is that any officer of Ministers when seated in the Speaker's gallery is inaccessible for the purpose of the business of the House, and that if such officer could find a seat, not in the House but outside the House at this end, it would facilitate pubhc business. W it h a view to that being done, I arranged this morning that some brass standards should be fixed, and a division of a technical kind made, so that the space behind the level of the screen, at the back of the chair, should be considered outside the House, the space not only behind the screen but beyond the ends of the House on either side. So soon as the technical divisional line is fixed, that will be clearly, in the opinion of all honourable - members, outside the House, and therefore not within the operation of the standing orders. I would suggest to the House that, in the absence of such dividing line, any one sitting in that space is on the floor of the chamber, and therefore can be directed to withdraw under the standing order, and that pending the erection of the dividing line, no notice be taken of any one sitting there. HONOURABLE MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",24
91,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I was responsible for attention being called to this matter, and had the explanation which you, sir, have just made been given previous to the sitting, I think there would have been no trouble at all. I am perfectly satisfied so long as the privileges of honourable members are preserved. I regret, however, to hear that it has been considered necessary to remove the book-case, as it. was always a useful place of reference. I might also say that the space behind the chair has been used in times past by honourable members to carry on necessary conversation without irritating those who are carrying on the debate, or interfering with the progress of business in the Chamber. But if the exigencies of Ministers are such that it is absolutely necessary that an officer should be within easy reach of the Minister at the table, I can say nothing further. I am only too glad at any time to do all in my power to assist the progress of business. At the same time, I would remark that it is a good many years since this Chamber was built, and this certamly is the first time that any Minister of State has found it necessary to have an officer so near at hand as on the present occasion. In Gommittee : Clause 35The Governor General may from time to time(a) create a new office in any division in any department on the request of the permanent head thereof; or (ti) abolish any office in any department; or (c) raise or lower the classification or grading of any office the duties of which have been materially changed ; or (rf) transfer or promote an oflicer from the professional division to fill a vacancy in the clerical division if such officer has previously been in the clerical division and consents to such transfer or promotion ; or (e) transfer or promote an officer from the professional division to the special division.",25
92,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I think the Minister for Home Affairs will see that to carry out the previous arrangement it is necessaiy to insert the words ""o n the recommendation of the commissioner "" at the end of the first line.",25
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I have that amendment ready.,25
94,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I move That the words "" on the recommendation of the commissioner"" be inserted after the word ""time,"" line 1.",25
95,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I presume the words in sub-clause (a) "" on the request of the permanent head thereof "" apply not only to that sub-clause, but also to sub-clauses (b), (c), (d), and (e). As the clause is printedi t would appear that the words applied only to the first sub-clause. If they were made to apply to the wliole of the sub-clauses it would be much better, and it would look better if there were inserted after the word "" commissioner.""",25
96,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I - think we might keep to the phraseology we adopted before, and make the words apply to the whole of the sub-clauses.",25
97,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, I do not know that it would be advisable to accept this addition in the form proposed.,25
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I was not going to accept it , but the amendment was suggested and I did not object.",25
99,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It seems to me that under the amendment the report of the permanent head would have to come before the commissioner could take action.,25
100,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,No . It means that the commissioner will act after receiving a report from the permanent head.,25
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The report need not necessarily be in favour. The commissioner can act even if the report be opposed to the action.,25
102,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I quite see that the report may not be in favour, but the commissioner has to receive a report before he can act",25
103,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That is so in the sense that the comniisioner acts after he obtains the report. He obtains the report to make sure he is right. Mr THOMSONThe h I should say ""after obtaining a report.""",25
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Very well ; I will or clerical division accept those words.,25
105,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The abolition of an office in a department is a matter in which the commissioner has to keep a watch on the permanent head, who may not be willing to abolish an office which the commisabolish any office in any department. sioner says is not necessary.",25
106,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The commissioner has a right to get the permanent head's views on the question.,26
107,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , so long as we do not commit the commissioner to the necessity of first getting a report before he moves.",26
108,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The permaunder nent head is not given the initiative.,26
109,Mr WILKS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," The clause is an important one, dealing, as it does, with grading and classification, and it is only right the commissioner should have the fullest control possible. I am afraid the introduction of the permanent head this provision will be more dangerous in clause 21.",26
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The permanent head has simply to report, and no matter what he says the commissioner can act.",26
111,Mr WILKS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If that be so, I am satisfied. But while there are transfers from the clerical to the professional division, and vice versa, there is no power to transfer from the general division to the clerical. the general division there may be numbers not know why. of men, faithful and proved servants, who have no opportunity of competing amongst themselves for advance to the clerical division. A telegraph messenger may prove himself a faithfu l servant as a member of the general division, but before he can be advanced or transferred, he would, under the clause, have to go into open comthe petition with the general public, probably boys and girls who had just left school, and could more easily pass an examination. The clerical and professional divisions have the right of competing amongst *or transfer, and I ask that a telegraph messenger, who has shown efficiency during long years of service, should have the equal privilege of advancing himself by competithat tion with his fellows.",26
112,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I would suggest to the Minister that he should do what has been done in the B u i previously, when I think the Attorney-General was in charge, namely, to strike out in line 1, the words, ""from time to time"" as unnecessary.",26
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I propose to strike doing so. those words out-the amendment is to strike them out.,26
114,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I would like an explanation in regard to some other parts of the clause. In sub-clause (b) power is given What is to become of the oflicer 1,26
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That depends on circumstances. He may be transferred in the same department or to another department if there is a place for him.,26
116,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the officer is not required in any department, he is to come the operation of a previous clause, and go out altogether.",26
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Yes .,26
118,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,In sub-clause (d) why is the privilege given only to the professional division to be transferred or promoted to that the clerical division 1 Is there any into reason why similar power should not than be given to transfer and promote an officer from the clerical to the professional division 1 I should like to hear if there is any reason why preference is given to one division. In the Victorian Public Service Acts that distinction is not made.,26
119,Mr CROUCH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It looks as if it had been drafted to meet some special case.,26
120,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It may have been In drafted to meet some special case, but I do",26
121,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The officer will have to go through an examination.,26
122,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If that be so, there is all the more reason to give the power to transfer or promote a clerical oflicer to the professional division. If he is efficient, and his competency must be tested in the way Minister suggests, then thei'e can be no objection to giving, in regard to promotion from the clerical to professional division, similar power to that given in the converse case. That measure of justice is provided in themselves the A ictorian Acts. 7  was just about to refer to that question, and what makes me more inclined to think the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Indi should be carried out is that all these advances or promotions are to be on examination. The whole structure of the Bill is to encourage people to aspire to get to the top, and if any one in the cleric.il division can qualify for the professional division, there ought not to be anything in the Bill to debar him from",26
123,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I wish to make an amendment in the first line of the clause.,26
124,The CHAIRMAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It will be necessaiy for the honourable member for Wentworth to to withdraw his amendment temporarily. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat in line 1 the words "" from time to time"" be omitted. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ) agreed toTliat in line 1, after the word ""may,"" the following words be inserted:- "" On the recommendation of the commissioner, after obtaining a report from the permanent head."" Amendment (by Mr MCCOLL ) agreed toThat in lines 3 and 4 the words ""on the request of the permanent head thereof "" be omitted.",26
125,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) The honourable"" member for South Australia,  theory which he wishes to work out-tlia t a man in the general division may be transferred to the clerical division with examination.",27
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"To the professional division division, too.",27
127,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I tliink I can give some explanation' of the matter, which he I dealt with last night in a different aspect. In the Victorian ' Public Service Act, section 52, power is given to the Governor i u Council on the recombe mendation of the Public Service Board to transfer a man from the general the clerical division on examination. A man who is in the general division has not to pass so stiff an examination as a man would in the clerical division, and he has by no means the qualifications of a man in the professional or special division. I last night suggested an amendment, to which the tion. . . . Attorney-General, said he would give effect at the proper place. The suggested amenda ment was on clause 28, and preserves the rights of Victorian men in the general division to be transferred to the clerical division on pissing an examination.",27
128,Mr WILKS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,By competition amongst themselves 1,27
129,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That was left open. A all events the men were to have their sent rights preserved under the Bill.,27
130,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Onl y the Victorian men 1,27
131,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am not aware that the other States have a similar provision. should be only too happy to provide for the same privileges being obtained for the other States if there are those privileges now; and I hope it will be understood not making any distinction between Victorian men and others. I happen to know that in LYNE) the Victorian Act there is power to transfer to the clerical division, and I do not see why that power should be taken away under the Commonwealth.",27
132,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Eve n if that privilege is not in the other States it should be extended to them.,27
133,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I think it ought to be, seeing that it is only ou examination. It would be only fair to extend it to all the States, and I shallgive the honourable member any assistance in my power to enable the transfers to be made, so far as I can see at present, unless the Minister shows the contrary. May I point out that clause 35 does not deal with transfers on .examination, but deals with transfers without examination absolutely.",27
134,Mr WILKS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It is a privilege.,27
135,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It .is a privilege in the sense that a man who is in the professional is ex lvypotliesi f it for the clerical division.,27
136,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Especiall y if has been in the clerical division before.,27
137,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Exactly ; especially if he has been in the clerical division before. Then sub-clause (e) provides that an officer may transferred or promoted from the professional division or the clerical division to division to the special division. ,27
138,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Clause 37 reads No officer shall be promoted from a class in the professional division or clerical division to a higher class or be transferred from one department to another unless he has passed such examinaThat clause really deals with classes within division. All I want to point out is that we are now dealing with cases of transfer without examination, and we ought not to confuse the two things. We shall provide, in the clause which the Attorney-General is going to bring in, for all cases of transfer with examination. The Attorney-General has t undertaken that he will in due place have prea clause providing for transfer from the general division on examination.",27
139,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,-That was done last night.,27
140,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Then that is all right. I would suggest that in clause 35 we do not. deal with anything except the question of movements in the public service without examination, by the Governor in Council I am after the recommendation of the commissioner and perhaps on the report of the permanent head. I think the two things are distinct, and this would he a bad place to bring in the amendment which the honor ton, has suggested.",27
141,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," The view that I have previously expressed I . desire to put before the committee in a concrete form by moving an amendment. I hardly know the best way in which ito do this, but I wish to give the Governor General power to transfer or promote an officer from the clerical, division to fil l a vacancy in the professional division if such officer is competent and consents to such promotion. There are many gentlemen in the clerical division who are really professional men, but simply because they are in the clerical division the Governor General has no power to put them into a position which they are competent to fill. It is within the discretion of the permanent head, the commissioner, and the Governoi-'General to say whether any officer shall be promoted. But we know that there are members of the clerical division who have qualified themselves by examination to be professional men, and I see no reason why, when a vacancy occurs in the professional division, they should not be eligible to fill it , Under this clause there is no power in such a. case to transfer them from the clerical to the professional division, although there is power under the Bill to transfer an officer from the general division to the clerical division. I therefore move That the following words be added, after the word ""or"" in sub-clause (rf):-""transfe r or promote au officer from the clerical division to fill a vacancy in the professional division if such officer is competent, and consents to such transfer or promotion, or,""",28
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I wil l accept amendment.,28
143,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,South Does not this clause refer to promotions apart from examinations altogether 1,28
144,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It only refers to alterations of the staff.,28
145,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The honourable and learned member for Indi suggests that there should be promotions from the clerical division to the professional division.,28
146,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Everythin g else is provided for.,28
147,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It seems to me unnecessary so far as this clause is concerned, that the officer shall have passed the examination. I have been looking at the clause from the point of view that it is not laid down that a man shall have to pass another examination. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Indi, that we ought to give the same opportunities to the clerical division as are given to the professional division. We oughtalso to give the same advantages to the members of the general division. We must not make any distinction between the various divisions of the service. We want to throw the whole service open to any man in the ranks. We must not give privileges to the professional and clerical divisions which we do not give to the general division. If it is right that power should be given to promote an officer from either the clerical or the professional division, it is equally just that a similar power should be given to promote an officer from the general division. There should be no barrier to the advancement of an)' oflicer altogether irrespective of the particular division to which he belongs. I beheve that it will be necessary to insert another sub-clause giving the Governor General power to transfer or promote an oflicer from the general division to the clerical or professional division. As soon as the amendment before the committee-is disposed of I shall move in that direction.",28
148,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is unnecessary. A man must get from the general to the clerical division first. We have given him the power to do that.,28
149,Mr CROUCH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I tliink that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Inch is unnecessary, because clause 27 saj's that before an appointment can be made to the special or professional division from outside the serthe vice certain requirements have to be complied with. It appears to me that the honourable Australia) - ancl learned member for Indi is attempting to bring in a clause by which an oflicer may be brought from the clerical to the professional division. I think the amendment is surplusage. It is already inferred that a person must be taken from the clerical to the professional division unless strong reasons are given why the transfer is not made. If clause 27 does not imply that, there is really no reason by which an appointment can be made to the special division. The only definite power given to appoint any person at all is provided for in clause 27. There are no words giving any authority for an appointment to a professional division. It must be inferred that it is a general authority which is left to the Governor General in Council. I think that we ought to strengthen the clause somewhere, but I do not tliink it is necessary to do so in the way that the honourable and learned member for Ind i indicates.",28
150,Mr WILKS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, I understood the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne to say just now that the At torney-General had drafted a clause providing that an oflicer from the general division could advance by means of a competitive exaniination to the clerical division.,29
151,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , we carried that last night.",29
152,Mr WILKS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Then I have nothing further to say.,29
153,Mr EWING,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I presume that what the committee is endeavouring to do under this clause is to provide for certain cases that might possibly eventuate. These sub-clauses do not overcome the difficulties that will beset the commissioner in the administration of the Act. Actual experiences will probably prove that we are not prophets. I think it would be well to eliminate sub-clauses (c), (d), and (e), and to substitute a general provision giving the Governor General power to transfer, promote, ancl grade any officer after such examination as may be deemed necessary. That would cover the whole clause. It is impossible for this committee to foresee everything that will happen. It would be wise, therefore, if, instead of attempting to particularize difficulties that may arise, we inserted some general provision such as I have suggested. I am sure that that is the right thing for the service, and the wisest course to pursue in regard to the administration. It is preferable to give general powers. I hope that the committee will accept that view of the situation, if they conclude that tliere is not too much clanger in so doing.",29
154,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Will the Minister Home Affairs accept the amendment 1,29
155,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Yes .,29
156,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, I am inclined to agree with the honourable member for Richmond that in the subclause it might be better to sayTransfer or promote an oflicer from one division to another division on such conditions and after such examinations as may bc prescribed.,29
157,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is the effect of it as it stands.,29
158,Mr THOMSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"No, there is no provision made for the special division. If an officer of the professional division happened to prefer an aj)pointment in the special division, and the commissioner desired that he should fill such office, the amendment of the honourable ancl learned member for Inch would not cover that case. Would it not meet all the conditions and include the clerical division if sub-section (d) were amended in the way I have suggested ?",29
159,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I know very well the difficulties of a Minister sitting at the table in the making of amendments. I suggest, therefore, that the amendments be taken separately, and afterwards the Minister will be able to see how far he can weld them together. Otherwise he may do more or less than he desires, and more or less than the committee desire. What I suggest seems to me to be the best way to bring the whole clause into a symmetrical form. Amendment agreed to.",29
160,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) I cannot quite see that what we agreed to last night covers exactly the same position as the cases that are referred to in this clause, and for that reason I would move That the followiug words be inserted as an additional sub-clause :- "" (/)Transferorpromotean officer from the general division to the clerical division."" ",29
161,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," If that is clone it will render the work done last night unnecessary ; in fact, it will substitute for it the widest opening for action by the Commissioner or the Governor General given in the Bill. Although the clause has been correctly described by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne as referring to transfers, ancl what may in one sense be promotions without examination, yet as I read this clause with the rest of the Bill I take it that the transfers and so-called promotions cannot for imply the advance which according to the rest of the Bill presupposes that an examination has been passed. In this clause certain powers are provided that might be called administrative, intended to be exercised within the framework which we have already established. Eirst of all, there is the creation of a new offiee; that will not interfere with the framework of the Bill. Then again, an office may be abolished, and that will not interfere with the framework of the Bill. Then it may be necessaiy to raise or lower the classification or grading of any office, and that will not interfere with the framework of the Bill. Then we come to the last two sub-clauses upon which we have had this discussion, relating to the transfer or promotion of officers from one division to another, and I would point out that tiiis power has to be included somewhere or other in the Bill, otherwise we shall have what might be taken to be water-tight compartments in the service. We have divided the service into the general, clerical, professional, and administrative divisions. We have the power to regrade the clerical division; there is no power of interchange between it and others. This now proposed to be given is not to be exercised in conflict with the rest of the Bill, but subject to the provisions as to exaniination, which have to be complied with before we can take a man from one division and place him in another.",29
162,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Accordin g to this clause, a man may pass - from the professional division into the clerical division without examination.",30
163,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes ; but the provision is that an oflicer who has pre viously been in the clerical division, and who had clerical qualifications, may be passed from the professional division back into the clerical division. He - must have had professional qualifications before he passed into the professional division ; and if he wants .to get back into the division from which he was first transferred, he must have had the necessary qualification for that division before he could originally enter it . I think the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was quite correct in his description of tine clause, but the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, has drawn a mistaken inference from a correct statement of its provisions. thinks that this clause gives power of promotion without examination, but in the cases refened to in the clause the examination must have been already passed, and as a matter of fact the oflicer must have qualified himself for both divisions before being enabled to pass from one division to the other.",30
164,Mr HIOGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Unde r sub-clause (<?) there is no examination provided for.,30
165,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"No ; and that is the one exemption we have-- made. That division, which is the great administrative division, is one to which men may be drawn from all the other divisions of the service if they possess the necessary qualifications. These are the chief officer's who rise to the summits of tlieir various divisions in the service, and who are naturally chosen from them to act as heads of departments. Some of the heads of departments come from the clerical division, and some come from the professional division, and some may have come from the general division, but they require first of all to have passed either the clerical or the professional examinations.",30
166,Mr BATOHELOB,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Not necessarily.,30
167,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Yes ; we could not take power a man from the general division into either the clerical or professional divisions without an examination.,30
168,Mr BATCBELOB,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Would you not take a man like an electrical engineer from the general division, and put him into the professional division without examination, in order to take up the position of Superintendent of Telegraphs, for instance ?",30
169,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,- I cannot imagine an electrical engineer being classified in the general division if his attainments were of such a character as to enable him to take up a position of that sort; he would have reached the dignity of the professional division.,30
170,Mr BATCHELOH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,But how is he going to get from the general division 1,30
171,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"We provided for that last night. The general division includes that vast nondescript body of employees in which a certain amount of manual skill is often required ; but beyond manual skill and physical capacity and average intelligence nothing more is required. If a man pursues his studies in some particular direction and rises out of the general into the professional division, he ceases to He become an officer of the general division and becomes a professional division oflicer. Men in the general division with such qualifications can pass into the two higher divisions, and take up the highest administrative positions. I suppose the highest salary in the general division would be Â£ 2 0 0 or Â£ 3 0 0 a year; and surely an electrical engineer of high attainments would be in receipt of a higher salary than that.",30
172,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But supposing a man qualifies himself, by working after hours, and becomes professional in capacity, why should he not be moved up 1",30
173,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Then lie can obtain ployment in the professional division.,31
174,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Under what clause would he pass from one division to the other t,31
175,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The mode of entering the professional division will be provided for by regulations under clause 71. 'We shall not have a great many men of any kind in the professional division;. but we shall require to make regulations to embrace every one of the professions likely to be required in the public service and to provide also means of discriminating between men who are in leading positions in the general division, and who pass from that division into the professional division. Under clause 71, sub-clause (Â«), we shall arrange the professional division into classes, and the general division into grades, ancl shall determine the limits of salaries to be paid to the persons in such classes or grades, ancl the man who rises in the general division, up to a certain grade, will pass into the professional division, because that will be the grade at which the professional division begins.",31
176,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But that means that a man will have to pass through all the grades in the general division, which may take him twenty years, before he will be regarded as eligible for transfer to the professional division.",31
177,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"We l l , if the honourable member chooses to imagine twenty years, I atn afraid I cannot help him, but there is no such requirement in the clause. The regular grades are those in the clerical division; but there will not be the same grades in the other divisions, and we shall have to adopt a special classification for electrical engineers, for actuaries, ancl other special officers. Mr HrocsiNS - The difficulty of the honourable member for South Anstralia is that he-cunnot see any provision made for the man who qualifies himself by study for a higher division.",31
178,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I have already stated that it must be dealt with in the clause providing for regulations covering the professional division and which has not yet been passed. But as these regulations will have to be laid before Parliament, that will be the time to challenge them. The provision that the honourable member for South Australia indicates, does not, I admit, appear in the Bill, and the proposal he now makes must be nugatory. This clause is not emintended to afford any means of evading the ordinary conditions attached to promotion at all, but is designed to allow that interchange between the departments, which is so necessary to secure efficiency and effectiveness and to deal with such advancement as does not require an examination. The word ""promote"" is perhaps responsible for some misapprehension on this subject. This was regarded as a convenient clause for gathering together certain powers which are essential to the general administration of the service, and they are not intended to affect the general framework of the Bill or its requirements relating to promotion or transfer.",31
179,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) I thank the honourable the Attorney-General for the information which he has given us. Although what he has said undoubtedly clears some of the ground, I would point out that whatever regulations may be made or prescribed for the gradual advancement of officers in the general division, I think it desirable that some provision should be made for the transfer from the general to the professional division of young officers, who take up such a line as engineering, and who, possibly, whilst still young, properly qualify themselves for a . higher class of employment. The honourable the Attorney General says that the regulations will provide the means, but I . do not see why we should not provide for it in the Bill, just as we have provided for other cases.",31
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the honourable member lets the matter rest, I can assure him that the regulations will provide for the transfer of such men into the professional division.",31
181,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If tliehonorabletlie Minister will undertake to say that the regulations will provide for a man of special qualifications skipping some of the grades, and going into the professional division direct, without waiting perhaps 30 or 40 years, I shall be content.",31
182,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) The whole matter rests upon a very narrow issue. The Attorney-3eneral says there is power under clause 71, sub-clause (a), to make regulations which will allow of a man who is in the general division, and who has qualified himself for professional duties, entering the professional division. I find, however, that clause 71 does not give that power.",31
183,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,-We will widen it to meet the case.,32
184,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the honourable the Minister for Home Affairs will enlarge the powers given under Clause 71 so as to permit of it being prescribed by regulation that a man may enter the professional division in the way desired, that will answer the purpose.",32
185,Mr EWING,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"- I do not think we should leave this question until we are perfectly satisfied that we are doing the permanent head."" what is right. What the House wants to do is to give the executive heads of secretary the service the power to get competent the men wherever they are to be obtained. The ordinary clerical man looks upon a messenger as an inferior individual, and if a man starts his life as a messenger, he will probably end it as a messenger. We want only one thing to be recognised under this Bill, and that is merit; we should require the commissioner to recognise merit wherever he may find it , put it in. whether it be in the general division or elsewhere. If the Attorney-General agrees with us, as he says he does, why insert a clause giving power to transfer or promote an officer from one division to another after examination wherever it may be necessary. After this Bill passed we shall be bound by it , and then moveneither the friendliness of the Minister for Home Affairs nor"" the democracy of the commissioner"" Attorney-General will be worth anything to us.

194,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I rise to competitive; ask the Mmister to make an addition to the different clause. The matter I desire to speak about jects is partly provided for in the regulations, but it is not satisfactorily done, ancl I would suggest that a sub-clause to this effect the(3)department. should be addedWhere an oflicer is transferred or promoted from one department to another, from one place to another, or from one State to another, reasonable personal expenses shall be allowed in under this Act. connection with such transfer or promotion. In Victoria, where officers have applied for practitioners, a promotion or a transfer, they have not surveyors, been allowed expenses. It was alleged that inasmuch as they applied they could not be allowed any expenses. When men are likely to be transferred all over Australia, there ought to be some reasonable allowance made for them, even if they apply for promotion-that is, if it suits a departamination, ment of the Commonwealth to have tliem going from one place to another.",33
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Does the honourable member say ""may"" or ""shall"" 1",33
196,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I ask that such men should be allowed reasonable personal expenses. I think it is reasonable to make the addition, although there is some provision in the regulations.",33
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I would hke the lionorable member to leave that matter over until we come to the question of the regulations. I quite agree with his view, but I do not want to put it in here, and make it superfluous if we can bring it under the regulations. I see his point ; a case arose only the other day.",33
198,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I understand that the words ""after obtaining a report from the permanent head "" have not been inserted in the clause. It was agreed that we should adopt a uniform practice right through the Bill, and therefore I think that the words ought to be inserted.",33
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"We cannot go back now, but if they are found necessaiy the words can be inserted afterwards. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 37(1) No oflicer shall be promoted from a class in the professional division or clerical division to a higher class or be transferred from one department to another unless he has passed such examination as is prescribed for such class in the department in or to which he is promoted or transferred. (2) Such examination shall be conducted by nominated by the commissioner who such may be appointed or removed by the Governor General.

200,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," Can the Minister inform me whether officers who, under the laws of a State, were exempted from exare to be required, though transferred to the Commonwealth, to pass examinations under this Bill?",33
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I take it that they are not.,33
202,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Will the honourable gentleman take a note of that, ancl see that a distinct provision is made?",33
203,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Does the honourable and learned member mean a promotion from class to class?,33
204,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes, under clause 37 tliere is to be no promotion from one class to a liigher class unless an oflicer passes an examination. I understand that tliere are officers who, under the State law, would have been entitled to pass from class to class, although exempted from examination. I should like the Minister to inquire into the matter.",33

207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Of course all the rights which officers had under the State law were carried forward to the positions which they now occupy.

209,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," Witl i regard to the question of promotion and transfer, it is possible that there may be a number of vacancies, and more persons than are needed may pass the examination.

210,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , by sub-clause (6) of clause 71.",34

212,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Yes .,34
213,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) I see a provision in this clause which to a certain extent carries out what I was suggesting yesterday. Sub-clause (3) provides that, so far as the clause is concerned, the Government may make use of any University work which is available. I ask the Minister to consider how far the Universities may also be useful with regard to the other examinations - I know that since I raised the question it has excited some attention amongst those who are perfectly familiar with the work which may be done by the Universities, and tliose who have spoken are strongly of the view that we can avail ourselves of existing examination rooms, examiners and machinery, without incurring much expense in the selection of the men to do the work of the Commonwealth. It would be impracticable for a private member to draft a clause which would fit into clauses 23 and 24. But I ask the Minister to look into the matter and see how far he can make the Universities for this purpose ancillary to the scheme he has in the Bill.

215,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The word "" as '""' has been inserted between "" is "" and ""capable,"" line 4.",35
216,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I want to follow up that principle. The amendment which I now submit is in the terms of a clause which was moved when the last Public Service Bill of Victoria was before Parliament. The clause was lost on the advice of the Government, and the result has been that the A ct has affected most injuriously a number of most deserving men. As a consequence of this, there has been a kind of federation amongst the public servants of New South Wales, Soutli Australia, and Victoria, who desire that such a clause as I have now moved should be inserted in the Bill. It does not interfere in any way with the merit provisions of the Bill, but merely gives a guarantee to officers generally that no junior will be appointed where a senior is equally capable of rjerforming the duties. I could, if I. chose, take up a great deal of time to prove what I have said as to the dissatisfaction in the service, but I do not tliink ""it is necessary to do so.",35

(2) No officer shall refuse compliance with an order offcheMinister directing his removal from one position to another of equal importance in the same or any other part of the Commonwealth or with the order of a permanent head of a department requiring him to remove from one jiosition therein to any other position therein of equal importance in the same or any other part of the Commonwealth. Disregard of or disobedience to any such order shall be followed by dismissal.

227,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Is that necessary ?,35
228,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I am informed that it is necessary. Amendment agreed to.,35
229,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) It appears to me that sub-clause (2) requires to be reconsidered and redrawn. It contains an extraordinary and drastic power. It provides that no officer is to refuse compliance, with an order of the Minister directing his removal from one position to another. Neither is such officer to refuse compliance with a similar order issued by the permanent head of his department. Either the Minister or the permanent head, therefore, can tell a man that he must move from Hobart to Port Darwin, or from Coolgardie to the Richmond River, next week. The sub-clause 1 also sets out that disregard or disobedience of any sucli order shall be followed by dismissal. According to this provision, it is possible that the Minister may order one way and the permanent head another way : and, if an officer shall disobey either of such orders, he shall be dismissed.",35
230,Mr MAUGISK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is too arbitrary.,36
231,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It is too arbitrary. I thought when it came to a question of the removal of an officer from one part of the Commonwealth to another-sa y from the post office at Coolgardie, to the post-office at the Richmond River, New South ""Wales-that it would not be the Minister who would order it , but the commissioner. It is just here that political influence comes in. If a permanent head has a grudge against a man-and there are such things-h e may make that man's life unbearable by saying"" You must go off to a certain distant part of the Commonwealth."" On the other hand, a Minister, if he is cajoled sufficiently, may remove an officer from a hot climate like that of Coolgardie to a pleasant place like Geelong.",36
232,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Coolgardi e has a very good climate.,36
233,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"At all events, it seems to return good men. glad that the atmosphere of Coolgardie has not made some men degenerate. I think that this sub-clause needs reconstruction. We must at least make it consistent, and say that an officer must obey either the Minister or the permanent head of his department, and not both.",36
234,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,On e is department-the other is outside.,36
235,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Unde r the sub-clause it is quite possible for the permanent head to say,36
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"P u t in the words"" Upon the report of the commissioner.""",36
237,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I tliink even then that the provisions of the clause will conflict. It is quite possible for the Minister to order the removal of an officer within the Postal department from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and for a permanent head to order removal in a different direction. It would be impossible for an officer to comply with conflicting orders. I think that in regard to the penalty to be imposed in case of disobedience the word ""may"" should be substituted for ""shall"" in regard to dismissal.",36
238,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," Would it not be well to insert a provision by which a man would be allowed the option of appealing to the commissioner 1 Why should not a man be allowed to decline achange if he finds,after looking at the circumstances of the case, that it is desirable so to do ? This question of removals gives rise to great trouble in the departments. Of course - I recognise that there may be a great many conditions connected with a man's circumstances, such, for example, as liis health, or the health of his wife and family,-which ought fairly to be taken into consideration. The work of the State must be carried on, and a man ought not to be allowed from a mere whim or caprice to decline removal"" from one place to another. But he ought to be allowed to go to the commissioner in order that an arbitrary injustice mav not be done.  There is another phase of the question. In some cases it would probably be well if there w ere a recognised rule in regard to the r way in which removals should be regulated. In the State of South Australia men are kept in the far North for years and years, and it is impossible for them to get away. They live under conditions verydifferentfrom those which prevail in other parts of that I am very State, and it seems to me that others in the public service ought to be prepared to share the burden of sucli unpleasant situations. If the honourable and learned member for  tion I shall support him.",36
239,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I woulcl suggest the reconsideration of the whole iii the clause. In sub-clause (1) the commissioner has power to permit an officer to decline an offer of promotion or appointment without prejudice to liis right to future promotion or appointment. But in sub-clause (2) an absolute conflict takes place, and we give the Minister power to say to any particular officer, "" In spite of what the commissioner has said you shall go to sucli and such a place if 1 choose, and if you refuse, you shall be dismissed."" In any case the permanent head has the right to order a man about from place to place, and if the officer does not choose to go, it is provided that he shall be dismissed. Perhaps the best thing to do would be to take the general powers given to the Minister under the term "" Governor General,"" and say that if an officer refuses compliance with an order of the Governor General, he may be dismissed. I think that sub-clause (2) comes into serious conflict with sub-clause (i ) .",36
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I do not want to insert any clause that is too drastic; but I do want the Governor General or the Minister and commissioner to have power to compel the removal of an officer from one part of the Commonwealth to another. That power is absolutely necessary, and, if it is not. conferred, we know perfectly well that no officer will go to a place like Port Darwin. There must be a discretionary power .in the hands of some one. I admit that the matter is so important-seein g that we are dealing now with a whole continent, possessing a diversity of chmate and conditions-that , perhaps, this power should be in the hands of the Governor General. Then there would be the responsibility of the Government behind it. That would be preferable to leaving it in the hands of the Minister or of the commissioner and the permanent head.",36
241,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Would the Minister insert that it should be on the recommendation of the Commissioner ?,37
242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes . Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) pro words posed.

243,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," Does that prevent the permanent head from moving an officer from one position to another, because we must give the permanent head that power to a certain extent ? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The permanent head will still have power to move an officer from one place to another; but if there is any trouble then the"" Governor General can step in. Amendment agreed to.",37
244,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I think that a .determined good deal of trouble could be overcome by striking out the provision that the disobedience of an order shall be followed by dismissal. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) proposed - That the word ""shall,"" line 14, be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""may.""",37
245,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I think it is very arbitrary to provide that a meinber of the public service may bedismissed without any trial at all. In the next clause we have a sort of code relating to dismissals and removals. That clause provides that [111] an officer may be tried, and if found guilty that he shall be liable to certain punishment. I suggest to the Minister that the last sentence of sub-clause (2) of the clause now under discussion should be amended to readDisregard of or disobedience to any such order shall be a breach of the provisions of this Act. Then the officer will be liable to be punished according to the nature of his offence, but he will at least have an opportunity to defend himself.",37
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the honourable and learned member is satisfied that it does come within the purview of the next clause, I am quite agreeable. Amendment withdrawn.",37
247,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The Mi nister, I understand, will be content to allow the last part of the sub-clause to read in the way I have suggested, I therefore move That all the words after ""be,"" in line 14, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the "" a breach of the provisions of this Act."" ' Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 40(1) If any officer is guilty of a breach of the provisions of this Act or any regulations thereincluding - the under, or is guiltyof any wilful disobedience or disregard of any lawful order made or given t>y any person having authority to give such order; or of being habitually negligent or careless in thetliscliarge of his duties; or of being inefficient or incompetent, and such inefficiency or incompetency appears to arise from causes within his own control ; or of habitually using intoxicating beverages to excess; or of any disgraceful or improper conduct; then such officer shall be guilty of an offence aud shall be liable to such punishment as may be upon under the provisions of this section. (2). Any officer (not being an officer included in the special division) charged with the commission of an offence(a) may in the cose of minor offences against discipline be reprimanded or cautioned by the chief officer, or by any officer prescribed as having power to suspend officers in the office or place in which the offending officer is employed ; or (6) for any such offence whatever may be temporarily suspended by the .chief officer, pr in emergent cases by any officer prescribed as having power to suspend officers in the office or place - in which the offending officer is employed, in which event such suspension shall be immediately reported to the chief officer. The suspending officer or the chief officer shall forthwith furnish the offending officer copj' of the charge on which he is suspended, and require him to with state in writing whether admits or denies the truth of charge, and to give any explanation writing as to such offence for the consideration of the chief officer. (3) On consideration of such explanation, if enough. any, the chief officer, if of opinion that the alleged offence has not been committed, may remove suspension ; or, if of opinion that the alleged offence has been committed by such officer, but is not of so serious a nature that an investigation thereof should be made by a board of inquiiy, may reprimand or caution such officer, and move the suspension. (4) If the chief officer considers the alleged offence to be of so serious a nature that an investigation thereof should be made by a board of quiry, he may further suspend such officer forthwith refer the charge to a board of inquiry (consisting of tliree persons, one of whom the chairman of. such board, rind any two of whom may exercise all the powers cf such board) vestigation ancVreport; such board shall not clude the person by whom the officer pended or by whom the charge was made against him; and if such suspended officer does not writing admit the truth of the charges against him, such board shall inquire as to the truth such charges. Every such board shall, hearing the case, report to the chief officer the proceedings and evidence taken, and their opinion thereon. (5) If any such charges are admitted or found by the board of inquiry to be proved, on the recommendation of the oflicer, the manent head may subject to the regulations impose a penalty upon such offending officer or .may deprive him of his leave of absence during specified period, or the commissioner may ing to the nature of the offence, reduce officer to a lower class or grade and salary wages, or the G! overnor-General may dismiss such officer from the public service or require resign, and in the event of being so dismissed such officer shall unless otherwise ordered by Governor General be entitled to no salary wages during the time of his suspension. ((.>) If. none of such charges are found baird of inquiiy to be proved, the suspension shall be immediately removed by the chief officer.",37
248,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) In dealing with offences involving moval from the service, I would like to the Minister if he has considered the diency of making insolvency a ground for the dismissal of an oflicer. We had sucli' provision in our Victorian law for a long time, but six or seven years ago it was altered because tliere were so many officers who had chief officer has no power bej ond that of landed themselves in difficulties in connection with the land boom. I am told that clause 56 deals with this matter, and I only want is carried entirely beyond him. to know whether Ministers have considered the question. Perhaps it would be better with a to refer to the matter when we-get to clause forth56. That clause provides that if an officer he is unable to obtain his certificate, or is found such to be guilty of extravagance or fraud, he in may be dismissed, reduced, or reprimanded.",38
249,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is fair,38
250,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I would suggest somesuch tliing more drastic because there is nothing more disheartening to a man in his work than to feel that a great proportion of his salary is to go away to others, and I tliink retlie King's service cannot be properly performed by men who are working to pay their creditors. I happen to know that there are inin the various States a very large number of and public servants who are going about with a weight of debt around their necks, and some shall be of them with orders that they must pay a for inproportion of their salaries away every inmonth to satisfy their creditors. I will refer was susto this matter later on.",38
251,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I would like to know in if the Minister has considered any proposals of for the representation of employees on inafter fully quiry or appeal boards 1,38
252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That must be dealt witli in a new clause. I was looking are info the matter this afternoon, and I would then ask the honourable member to hold it perover until a new clause has been prepared.",38
253,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I doubt very a much wliether this clause will be effective. accordI t seems to me that the draftsman has sucli simply adopted provisions which have been or in force in the various States, and has athim to tempted ' to apply them to the circumstances of the Commonwealth. The dealing the with officers who have been guilty of offences, or will be very much more difficult under the circumstances of the Commonwealth serby the vice than would be the case in one of the States. In the case of the State service a man may be brought to head-quarters or the board of inquiry may be sent to the replace where he is stationed, to make ask inquiiy and deal with him on the spot, expebut when the large area of the Commonwealth has to be covered inquiry cannot a be conducted so readily. I see that this clause provides that a number of charges may be brought against a man, but. that the T reprimand . or caution, and the whole question whether a man is to be punished The chief officer is the man who will really know more than any one else. He will be the real working head of the department, because the permanent head will probably he mostly in attendance on the Minister, or engaged in attending to the routine work of the department, and will not come much in contact with the oflieers. If in every case the routine of a board of appeal has to be gone through, there will be great delay and enormous expense, and there will be frequent suspensions extending over long periods which will prove very costly in so far as they will involve enforced idleness of officers on full pay. It seems to me that the chief officer ought to have more authority. If a serious offence is committed he has to make a report, and the matter will eventually come before a board of inquiry, and after the board has completed its work it is left to the permanent head to irerpose a penalty, to the commissioner to reduce the officer, or the Governor General to dismiss him, as the nature of the case may require. Sh WILLIAM LYNE - I am to give the chief officer the power to fine up to a certain hmit.",38
254,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That is what I was going to suggest, because I think that otherwise many offences would be passed over without any punishment, on account of the delay and trouble that would be involved in bringing matters before a board of inquiiy. tliink that if the chief officer has power to fine, in man)' cases it will meet the requirements very fairly, and certainly conduce to the discipline of the dei^ai-tment.",39
255,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I think that some provision should be made that where an officer is charged with an offence, he should have the right to see copies of the correspondence which has passed between the various officers over him and the permanent head or the appeal board. At the present time, many officers are charged with offences about which* they are not able to learn any particulars, and it is quite possible for a man to have a charge worked up against him without knowing on what material it is based. It is not sufficient to give him a copy of the charge, but he should also be furnished with a copy of the evidence against him.",39
256,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the honourable member allows the matter to stand over until the question of appeal has been omitted. considered, we will deal with the point he has mentioned, and I may be able to meet his views.  understand that some medium course is proposed in the way of allowing the chief officer to inflict fines, but what possible chance will there be of securing the punishment of any one, so long as the word "" habitually"" is allowed to remain in the clause? AVhat would be a case of habitual drunkenness, and what would beacaseof habitual neglect of duty 1 Is there any necessity to have these words in. W it h such words in the clause it would be difficult to prove even one Cease, and I shall move to strike out. the word ""habitually"" where it occurs in the clause, and to insert at the end of line 15, the words "" to such an extent as to impair efficiency."" First of all I move That the word ""habitually,"" in line 8, he omitted.",39
257,Mr CROUCH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I would like to support the position taken up by the honourable  j'roposing The word "" habitual"" has been decided in our courts of Yictoria, to have such a wide meaning that under the Marriage Act it has been decided that a man who gets drunk three times a week is not a habitual drunkard. In dealing with these offences - the Ministry will have the strong support of every decent public servaut hecause the I general desire is that this clause should be thoroughly stiffened up. The retention of the word "" habitually"" and other adverbs qualifying incompetence aiid negligence and irregularities will impair the usefulness of the provisions in the eyes of those public servants' who do theh duty conscientiously, and. who are desirous that those who are frequently negligent should be expelled froih the service. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not object to the striking out of the word "" habitually"" which has no doubt been inserted by the draftsman. I think the clause will be quite effective without the word. The retention of the word would be undoubtedly in favour of the employee and I do not object to matters being left more to the discretion of the commissioner.

261,Mr CROUCH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I take it that .the provision is necessaiy. Any person who has experience of thS courts knows the way which a large number of public servants constantly refuse to pay their debts. The unfortunate position in regard fco the lot. creditors of pubhc servants is that the Kin g cannot be garnisheed, consequently the only way in which one can get public servant is by means of a defraud summons. I know men in the public service of Victorifi-and I suppose it is same in other States-wh o have come up and acknowledged in their exaniination on a defraud summons that they have had i eight or nine orders, every one meaning that the person was guilty of fraudulent conduct. An order is made only because of work. previous fraudulent conduct, for no one can have an order for imprisonment made against him now, except on the ground of fraud. It is a disgraceful state of things to exist. Ifc means that tradesmen are proposal. defrauded. Decent public servants do not want this state of things to continue, beagree to it. cause they have extra work imposed urjon. tliem by the otlier men attending the courts.

300,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I should like to Comhear honourable members' experience as to the how the provision works. It seems to me that the man who is well enough off to employ the best lawyer has the advantage.,42

305,Mr RONALD,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Southern Melbourne) can assure honourable members that this provision does not work well. It causes and serious expense to men employed, on the railways who are charged with trifling offences and who have to employ an agent. Mv. DEAKIN - It is optional.",42
306,Mr BONALD,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Exactly j but when a man knows he is going to be opposed by an agent on the other side, it is not optional. Cases are never decided on their moral merits, but on the mere fact that one side is not represented or not well represented. I hope the provision will be struck out.",43
307,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I take a different view from that of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, and I take that view after some experience. I know two or three public servants whom the very charge against them has so unstrung that they were utterly unfitted to appear, and I am quite sure that those cases would have had a different termination if they had not been allowed to employ representatives. I have i u my mind the case of a young man who was completely exonerated on the charge made, against him, but who, had he been dependent on his own resources, would have got into trouble. This is a very wise provision, decidedly of advantage to officers against whom charges may be made.  rate the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In Queensland tliere was a case somewhat similar to tliose cited by the honourable member. Had the man not been allowed to get legal advice and have an agent to attend for him, I am sure he would have lost his case; but he was completely exonerated when the case was put in a proper light. Eor that reason, I think the honourable meinber for South Australia, Mr. Batchelor, ought to withdraw any opposition he may have to the clause. In everyday hfe, if a man had to defend himself from charges made against him, he would find himself in "" Queer-street"" very often; whereas even with only an agent to defend him, he may come off with flying colours.",43
308,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I hope the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, will withdraw his opposition. I can assure him from personal experience that many a man against whom charges were made has had to go down but for the advice and assistance received from those who were able to put the cases as they should be put. I speak now on behalf of the members of the legal profession, not one of whom has addressed himself to this clause. It is the first clause that has escaped their attention. It is entirely owing to their, unselfish conduct that they have been prevented from telling honourable members of many instances in which, to their own personal knowledge, great harm would have resulted to men through improper action on the part of their superiors had it not been for the assistance rendered by the lawyers.",43
309,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," In the light of the.evidence that has just been given us I tliink that the clause should go further. I hope that the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, will withdraw his opposition, and that we shall provide not only that officers shall have the right to be represented by counsel, but that the State shall provide the counsel to represene them. If there is a danger that an innocent man may go under unless he has the benefit of being represented by counsel, I think that the question of money ought not - to stand in the way. If it is right to have counsel, then the State should pay for it . We should have a State defender.",43
310,Mr WILKINSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I have had some little experience in regard to this matter. In fact, I have appeared as an agent myself. Not only is it good for pubhc servants to have counsel appeal for 1 them, but the fact that counsel is so appearing acts as a controlling influence upon the board of inquiiy. Within the last three months I was asked to appear, on behalf of one public servant, in the State of Queensland, and I know that the very fact that I had been nominated had the effect of causing a very much closer investigation to be held than would otherwise have been the case. I would like to see the right given to any accused pubhc servants to see the evidence of all those who are supporting the charge against him.",43
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The honourable member will recollect that there is one of the public servants on the Appeal Board, who will see all the evidence.",43
312,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Does the Minister not think that the evidence should be supphed 1,43
313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I do not think so.,43
314,Mr WILKINSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It is a very difficult matter in many cases to get at the evidence that has been supplied. The plea generally put forward is that it forms part of official documents. But where a man's position is jeopardized, I think he has a right to know everything that has been mentioned against him. The clause, as far as it goes, is an admirable one, and I hope the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, will withdraw his opposition to it .",43
315,Mr MCC AY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I heartily endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Moreton with regard to the right of an accused puhlic servant to know what evidence is being brought against liim. In all our criminal courts there is either a preliminary inquiiy, at which the accused learns the character of the evidence, or else he is told what witnesses are to be called, and what they are to attempt to prove. TJie object of all systems of procedure in civil cases is to let the parties come to an issue, and have a general idea of each other's case. To put a public servant in the position of being told that he is charged with liaving committed a certain offence, and of liaving to come before the board knowing nothing of the circumstances-whe n the words of the charge may be wide enough to cover a score of sets of circu instances-is to treat him in a veiy unfair manner. He should be entitled to know not only what the technical words of the charge' are, but something more. ' Eor example, let us suppose that an officer is charged under clause 40 with being habitually negligent in the discharge of his duties. How can he know what he has to meet under those words ? They may cover the whole term of his service, or they may refer to some act that he has committed, or to something which he bas neglected to do. In all fairness an officer is entitled to know the circu instances which constitute the general accusation brought against him, and therefore he ought to have some reasonable knowledge of the facte that are alleged against him in order that he may be prepared to meet them. A man may be charged with doing a certain thing, and may be able to call evidence to show that he did not do it , but he might not be able to call that evidence unless he knew beforehand what the charge was. I ask the Minister to think over this matter. On further consideration I am sure he will find that my suggestion is only consonant with the principles of fahplay which we find throughout the whole of our law.",44
316,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I hope that the honourable member for South Australia will withdraw his opposition to the clause, because it seems to me to be only just that an officer against whom a charge is made should have the right to be represented by counsel. There might be technicalities in an Act which the officer, as a layman, would not understand, and which would need the services of a lawyer or some educated man to unravel. I also think that there may be a certain amount of timidity on the part of an officer if he is called upon to appear personally before a board to give evidence in such an inquiiy.",44
317,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) After the overwhelming evidence offered by the non-legal members of the House, regarding this practice' of allowing accused persons to be represented by counsel, I must certainly bow to their desire, and withdraw all opposition to the proposal.",44
318,Mr CROUCH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, I purposely waited t ill this matter had been discussed in order that I might suggest to the Minister the desirability of allowing any officer who is charged with an offence to have the inquiry conducted privately. I do not know whether the Minister will consent to that.,44
319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,If we are going to load the Bill up witli all sorts of twopennyhalfpenny matters it will break down.,44
320,Mr CROUCH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I do not think that it will break down. I believe in pubhcity, but there are occasions when a man would be condemned by a report appearing in the press. He should have the' right to demand that the inquiiy shall be conducted in private, in which case the result only need be given to the world.",44
321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I think that might be done under regulations. But I would point out to the honourable and learned member that it is sometimes absolutely essential'that an inquiry should be conducted in public for the sake of the department. To give the right to an accused public servant to demand that the inquiiy shall be held privately is not quite the proper thing. I admit that there' might be regulations, framed to allow of such an mquiry being held in private if the commissioner or Minister agreed to that course being adopted. But it would not be wise to give an absolute right to the accused to say that the inquiry should not be open to the press.",44
322,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I tliink that the Minister for Home'Affairs has taken the correct stand. We must not forget that these' are public affairs, and that the public have a right to know what is being done in regard to their own business. There may be cases which, from other considerations, ought to be conducted in private. It may be well that - power should be given to have inquiries conducted in private by the consent of all parties interested, but to lay down the rule that an officer may demand an inquiry in private would be to overlook the fact that we are dealing with public concerns.",44
323,Mr SOLMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I understand that the desire of the honourable and learned member for Corio is to protect an officer in the public service against whom an offence is alleged, from suffering from revelations that might be made outside of that service. The officer might be exonerated within the service, but the very fact of a charge having been levelled against hun might militate against his standing outside. In cases of that sort there is no diffiprivate. culty at all with the press. The press have always shown themselves prepared to act with discretion on such occasions.",45
324,Mr RONALD,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Oh !,45
325,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is my experience at any rate.,45
326,Mr RONALD,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,-It is not the experience of any one else.,45
327,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"There are plenty of members of this House who know that that is their experience. Where a man has been improperly charged with an offence and found innocent it is veiy easy indeed to take measures to prevent the publication of the proceedings if he so desires. On the other hand there is a large number of cases, which as the honourable and learned member for In di has pointed out, should be inquired into in public. The matters involved are of a public - character, and it is - right that the public should have an opportunity of judging. The fact of the public being given that opportunity would also act in such a way as to protect the officer charged. It would do away with the star-chamber business. In the past there has been too much of private' reports in the public service. When I entered the Education department in Melbourne, I found that there was the principle of secret reports by inspectors, which reports the employees were never allowed to see except - when a charge was made against them, and then only by applying to the Public Service Board. This system was carried out under regulations, and has since been abolished. Some of the officers after its abolition unearthed reports about themselves of years' standingreports of which they knew nothing. There is always a great danger to the public service in having private reports given, and I think that the honourable member will be well advised if he withdraws his amendment.",45
328,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I beheve in the whole of the public service administration being conducted in the open. There should be no secret reports, and I believe that all inquiries should be open to the press. If an honourable member argues that these inquiries should be open to the press and the public, surely it is not consistent to afterwards' say that any officer has a right to a report which can in any way be regarded as confidential. If tun officer has a right to say that certain proceedings shall be regarded as privateand confidential, then the accused person has a right to say that the inquiiy should be In laying down the principle that these inquiries shall be open to the press and public, we also adopt the principle that the reports in reference to the charge should be accessible to the accused, so that he may be able to see what is alleged against him. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has referred to secret reports. There was a case recently in which a man was tried. ' Fortutunately he got off, but tliere is no knowing whether, if a private and confidential report had gone in against him, he would not have been judged upon it . I am in favour of these inquiries being conducted openly. ' Mr KIRWAN (Kalgoorlie) - I would hke the Minister in charge of the Bill to consider the desirableness of making some provision whereby an officer wrongfully charged should be allowed any expenses that he might incur. It is possible to conceive of a case in which an officer might be put to considerable expense in defending himself, and I think that it would bo a grave injustice if he were not to be allowed his traveUing and other expenses.",45
329,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," It has often occurred that a man has been brought before a board of inquiry, and although he has not been completely condemned he has been virtually condemned in the service for some time to come, and it therefore seems to me that the Government ought to provide officers with counsel to assist them in defending themselves. If the}' will not do that they ought to agree if the officer is acquitted to pay the expenses connected with his defence.",45
330,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,If the officer is convicted' I suppose he should pay.,45
331,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,If the officer is convicted he will have to clear.,45
332,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Then he would nothing.,46
333,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Does not the hon the orable member think that matter might be left to the recommendation of the commisnity, sioner and then to the Minister ? I have had hundreds of cases in New South Wales, wish to do so. and I have never refused to pay the expenses where a person has been improperly - charged.",46
334,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If I were sure that the Minister for Home Affairs would be the deciding authority I would not hesitate for one moment, but whilst I have faith in men I have none in others. AVe have experience of what may be done in some cases with a man when he is in a helpless position, and we know that some people think that the right time to kick a man when he is down. We ought to do someI thing to help civil servants when they in trouble, because tliey have not much money as a rule. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will move on the lines I have indicated, I will support him.",46
335,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," In view of the fact that a civil servant in some remote part of' the Commonwealth might be importance summoned before a board in Melbourne or Sydney, then undoubtedly, if he be found guiltless of a malicious charge lodged against him by a superior officer, he ought should receive some compensation for his expenses.' I hope the Minister will take a favourable view of this matter, because is quite possible for the head of the departaccused ment or a chief officer occasionally to have a prejudice against a man, and even to go far as to lay a charge against him. W it regard to the proposal that these inquiries should be held with .open doors, I am not inclined to * support that view, because cases we know very well that the sensacence tional newspapers will have their reabroad; porters at such boards of inquiry; and if an officer should be charged with disgraceful or improper conduct the evienemies, dence will go forth day by day to the public, and give malicious and - vindictive people an opportunity to come forward. In cases of this kind evidence could be with an open inquiry. manufactured against civil servants which should not be admitted at such inquiries. If a man is to be tried, he should be tried upon what the head of the department is able to prove, and there should be no fishing inquiriesor any encouragement offered pay to private enemies, who may be only too glad to take a man's character away. In interests of the public servants themselves, and in the interests of the commuwe should give the board the power to hold these investigations in private, if they",46
336,Mr RONALD,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Southern Melbourne) I think that in considering this matter we have to remember that a man may be called upon to answer an accumulation of trifling charges which may represent the failings of years, and that it may be extremely difficult for him to sift the charges to the bottom, some and to meet the evidence brought against had him, unless he is furnished .with an epitome of it . W it h regard to recouping officers the expenses which they have incurred in defending themselves against is charges which have not been estabhshed, think it would be only fair to make are some provision of that sort. Moreover, it would offer some guarantee against trivial charges being brought against officers, because if the expenses had to be paid it would make the heads of departments more careful in bringing charges against their subordinates. These two points are of vital as far as the civil servants are concerned, and I hope the Government will see that provision is made for them. In the event of an officer being found guilty it to be provided that he should bear the expense himself. I think that the inquiries should be quite open and above board, rei t serving, however, the right to the person to exercise his option as to whether the inquiry shall be held in public or in so private. We have the same alternative in h courts of which I have had some experience, and we have found it an admirable provision. Some men may elect to have their tried in public in order that their innomay be established and proclaimed whilst others of a more sensitive - character may prefer to have the inquiry conducted in private. Every man has his and some persons are always ready to come forward and vent their spleen against others, and thus there is a certain amount of danger in connection Then, again, there is the danger of unjustifiable comment in the newspapers. AVe had a very good illustration of the disadvantages of this in connection with a recent case of breach of privilege arising out of comments upon a case which was sub judice. If that matter had not been made public that case - ""would never have happened.",46
337,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) There are three points that become very important in order that justice may be secured in connection with these' in-, quiries. So far as the publicity of the inquiries goes, my experience is that in 99 cases out of 100 it is far better to have publicity, and the only restriction that has been found useful is the discretion given to Judges to order that there shall be no publication of the evidence. I think this or a similar power might be given to the board of inquiry.",47
338,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is what we propose under regulations.,47
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I have an objection to give the option to the individual to say that the inquiiy shall be private, but I have no objection to giving the discretion to the hoard.",47
340,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I do not he right to give the option to the individual, because if it is in the interests of the community that there should be publicity, quiry should be held in public, notwithstandintend ing the feelings of the individual concerned. I strongly support the proposal that the accused person should be supplied with aU reports relating to his conduct. by sub-clause (2) the oflicer is to be with a copy of - the charge, but in addition to that he ought to know on what material those who are acting, against him and he ought to be put in the same position so far as knowledge is concerned as his accusers. I think it would he well if the board had power to issue a certificate as what costs and expenses should be allowed in connection with any cases brought before them. I can understand that there are some cases in which a man ought to pay some of the expenses to which he has put Crown, and on the other hand there are cases in which it would be egregiously unfair to put a civil servant to the expense of bringing witnesses from the far parts of the Commonwealth without aUowing him one penny towards his expenses. It would answer the purpose if the Minister provide that the board might certify what costs and expenses should be allowed.",47
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Coul d it not be put in. this way, that the board should recomthat mend, not that they should absolutely decide.",47
342,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I propose that tliey should certify and leave it to the Minister to allow the costs certified to if he thinks desirable. '* Mr ISAACS (Indi) - Wit h regard to the expenses of an exonerated officer, I think that power should be given under the Bill to allow him all reasonable expenses. A man may be caUed upon to defend his whole life in connection with the charge against him, and the more sure he is of his innocence the greater expense he may have to incur. It is suggested that officers may be brought from one end of the continent to the other in order that their conduct may he inquired into, but I hope that nothing of that kind wiU happen, but that we shall have local boards of inquiiy who will be able to obviate the necessity for bringing officers from long distances. An officer who is dragged away from a remote part of the continent down to Sydney or Melbourne might - not be able to bring his think it would witnesses with him.",47
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,If the honourable the inmember will allow this clause to pass I to submit provisions dealing with the three matters that have heen referred to.,47
344,Mr KIRWAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, I tliink the that the Minister might let the committee I see that know whether he is going to do anything in supplied regard to the question of expenses. Sh WILLIAM LYNE - I did so.,47
345,Mr KIRWAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"We did not hear the are working, honourable member say so.",47
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"There are three points which have been referred to. First, there is the regulation that the board on apto lication can hold an inquiry in private. I propose to leave it to their discretion. There may be reasons why it should be held privately, but no oflicer can demand a private inquiry. Then, in reference to the the expenses, I propose that the board can recommend as to expenses and certify; they cannot decide, but they can recommend.",47
347,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Who pays the expenses 1,47
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The board may make a recommendation if they recommend were to at aU against the individual.,47
349,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Against the individual who laid the charge 1,47
350,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,No ; I presume 7 where the expenses are paid in the interests of the official they would be paid by the Government.,47
351,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Where the official lays the charge the Government pay the expenses ?,48
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Where the official laid the charge, they could make any recommendation; hut I take it that the practical working of this prpvision would be that if there was an inquiry held on a charge by an official, and, if it was proved that it was a vicious or an improper charge to make, the board would certify as to expenses against the accuser or, if he could not pay, the Government would have to indemnify the employee. Suppose it came out in evidence that an official made an improper charge",48
353,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,But the board would not be likely to recommend costs against him.,48
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That would be a matter for the department to deal with. Veiy likely the board would certify that the charge should not have been made at all.,48
355,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If so, then an official could be proceeded against under the first part of clause 40 for improper conduct: but surely the Minister would not penalize a man by asking liim to pay the costs of the inquiiy ? Very few officials would undertake to bring a charge if that were done.",48
356,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,In the practical working of the provision I take it that the department would have to indemnify the official.,48
357,Mr FOWLEH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,But the honourable member would not penalize the official who brought the charge 1,48
358,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It would depend entirely upon whether it was shown that he should not have brought the charge, and that he had acted in a vicious manner. If it was done in the execution of his duty he ought to be protected; but if it was done, as has been done in some cases, from a vicious motive, he ought to suffer for it, ancl that would be a matter for the board to deal with.",48
359,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It is a much more serious thing than the mere mulcting him in costs.,48
360,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,He would have to.be tried first if he made a vicious charge.,48
361,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Quite so. W it h reference to giving a copy of the charge and the evidence, or any document referring to the charge, it seems to me there is a good deal of reason in asking that an employee shall get it if he requires it . I want honourable members to allow these three matters to remain in abeyance until I get a new sub-clause drafted to deal with them.",48
362,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," In connection with reports being produced to an accused officer, a great distinction ought to be drawn between the classes of reports. If they are reports which have to be used against the accused, of course he ought to see them; but if they are confidential communications between the Minister and any officer of the department, and are not going to be used against the accused, it would be a dangerous thing that any communication which was made confidentially by an official to his Minister, at the Minister's request it may be, should be unnecessarily made public. It would be most detrimental to the proper carrying on of the department. But I quite agree that any document which is to be used against an officer should he made available to him.",48
363,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is all any of us want.,48
364,Mr ISAACS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That is all that is wanted. There isone little thing in the matter of drafting to be mentioned. Tliere is provision made that the Board of Inquiry is to consist of tliree persons. One is to be the chairman, and any two of them are empowered to exercise the powers of the board. These two may not include the chairman. Under clause 10 the chairman is to have the same powers as the commissioner or inspector, which will include the power to administer an oath. It is only the chairman who has that power, and if by any chance he should be absent, I tliink it will be found that there is no power to administer the oath. The Acts Interpretation Bill, if it is passed in its present form, will provide in clause 35 that certain tribunals which have power to hear and determine matters may administer an oath. The board has no power to do anything but to form an opinion and report.",48
365,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I think there is a good deal in what the honourable and learned member has said. I should like to get the Bill pushed as far forward as possible to-night. We may not get through with aU the new clauses, but I wish to get the Bill placed in the hands of the printer. It will take some time to get the Bill, as amended, printed. I want to place it in the hands of honourable members before it. is taken any further, so that they .can see the' effect of what has been done. If there should be any matters which we have overlooked in . Public Service - any way, we can deal with, them by recommitting the clauses. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 43 agreed to. Clause 44r Subject to the provisions of this Act, every bationer before the confirmation oE his ment and every oflicer shall effect with some life unfair. assurance company or society registered and carrying on business in the Commonwealth an assurance on his life providing for the followingtake ibenefits, namely -(re) the payment oÂ£ a sum of money death if it occurs before age of sixty years ; (b) the payment to him of an annuity until death if he survives the age. of years; (c) the payment to him, if he retires ceases to be a member of the service before attaining the age of sixty years, of a sum of money to the whole amount of premiums by him to the company or society less he elects to continue paying premiums on his policy ; and (ii) for the increasing from time to the amount assured as may scribed.",48
366,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I desire at this stage to raise a question of portance, and that is, whether we shall mit officers joining the Commonwealth vice to assure their lives under this clause with any company they choose, or, asi may be amended at the instance of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. Piesse, with certain prescribed companies.",49
367,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It is proposed to put the word ""approved"" before the words "" l i assurance company.""",49
368,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Whether we should accept that suggestion, or whether, propose, the whole of the assurance business of those who come into the Comrevenue monwealth service, should be transacted the Government--that is the question. order to test the feeling of the committee, I move That after the word ""Act,"" line 1, the following words be inserted:-""Every officer on the firmation of his appointment shall effect with Government of the Commonwealth an assurance on his life, providing for the following benefits."" The clause will then go on to read just printed. At this stage I do not propose say anything about the provisions of clause as they stand, except to point that in the first place the Government pose that every probationer, before the firmation of his appointment, is to assure hfe. That seems to me to be playing into [27 JUNE, 1901.] Bill. 1757 'the hands of assurance companies to an unnecessary degree, because if a man were not appointed he would haA'e been compelled to take out a policy on his life, which, perhaps, he would not have done had prohe known that he was not going to be per- appointmanently appointed. I think that to be",49
369,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The point is that he must it out before he is appointed. It is one of the conditions of the appointment; on his but he need not complete until he is ashe attains the sured of his appointment.,49
370,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Perhaps that may sixty cover the objection I have raised. I think it would be unfair to compel a man to take from or out an assurance on his life unless there public was a reasonable chance of his being perequal manently appointed. I am not quite sure paid whether the provisions in sub-clause (c) unare possible of attainment at all ; but we the must wait, I suppose, to hear what the time of Governinent have to say on this question. be preWhat I desire the committee to determine is whether the Government are to carry on an assurance business or some imwhether we are to permit private peror mutual companies, as has been the sercase in the past, to do the assurance work of the civil service. I . think it is t quite proper for the Government to propose to render it compulsory for every servant joining the Commonwealth service to take out an assurance on his life. The object of that provision, of course, is to do away with f e the necessity of an old-age pension system such as we have been used to in some of the States. I think it is a much as I better provision than the finding of a sum of money out of the consolidated for paying pensions to civil servants by when they retire; and to that extent I In think the proposal for assurance is acceptable. Inasmuch as the Government propose, rightly I think, to make it compulsory there ought to be some sort of conguarantee to those who are thus compelled the to assure their lives that the amounts for which they are assured, or the annuities which tliey hope to receive, shall be paid to as it is them. Luckily, over the whole of this to Commonwealth most of the assurance the companies doing any considerable business out are conducted on the mutual principle, and proI do not recollect any company which has conever failed to meet its obligations. I must his be fair to that extent. At the same time, cases have occurred in other parts of the 1758 Public Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] world where companies have not kept their' engagements in this regard, and where persons being assured with them have not received the benefits which they ought to have received had the companies been better - managed financially. I feel, therefore, that the principle of compulsion on the part of the servant ought to involve the principle of guarantee on the part'of the Government. If we compel a man to assure his hfe we Ought to guarantee him the benefits wliieh we insist he sluill take for himself as part of his service with the Commonwealth. This principle is partly recognised in clause 49, which says(1) Where a person is unable to assure his life, or is unable to assure his life without a loading ot five years or more beiug made upon his age, and in such hitter case is unwilling to assure his life, he shall not thereby be disqualified for appointment or promotion, but a prescribed deduction shall be made at prescribed times from such person's salary. (2) Such deductions shall be invested and accumulated in the prescribed manner by the commissioner or some officer or authority appointed for the purpose by the Governor General. That introduces the recognition on the part of the Government of theh liability to persons joining the service who cannot get any assurance to see that they get something like the same reward when they leave the service as those who can secure an assurance. Clauses 44 and 49 are therefore intimately related, and the recognition of the principle I am contending for is to my mind to be seen in clause 49. The Government appear in that clause to accept some responsibility in this regard. It is prettywell known that in otlier parts of the world this system has been adoptedI believe that in the Germanic Confederation there is a system of State assurance hi connection with the civil serviee. I am not familiar with its details, and I certainly do not know very much about its working; but I am told, on the authority of tliose who have learned a little more about it than I have, that it works exceedingly well, and my own reading and knowledge on the subject go to prove also that it is extremely satisfactory to both the Government and the civil servants. The British public service has adopted the principle of State annuities, I believe in much more firmly than I do in the payment of a lump sum. a man getting a lump sum on retirement may be tempted into some speculation or business and lose, just when he requires Mr Hume Cool: BiM. them the whole of the savings which he for years has been anticipating to live on. As a matter of fact, instances of that kind have occurred constantly in our own experience. We know men who have come into a fair sum of nioney by way of assurance, and who have put that money into somebusiness or speculation, and have been left practically penniless in the evening of their lives.",49
371,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Would the honourable member prevent assurers mortgaging their annuities 1,50
372,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I would prevent them dealing with the annuities in any way which would tend to take away from them the regular amount which they stipulated to receive on making the contract. I believe in the annuity system, and for the reason that the men are benefited to a greater extent than by a lump sum of nioney. The proposal will not prevent men in the service of the Government from contracting outside for the sake of theh wives and families for the payment of a large sum of money on their death or at some fixed period. We are all familiar with the system wisely adopted in connection with banking and other companies. I believe the Bank of New South Wales has a splendid system of annuities for the bank servants on retirement at a certain age. There are other private companies, which I do not wish to advertise, but which also adopt this particular method for retiring servants. I think we could not do better than take pattern and example from the very excellent results which these companies and corporations have' achieved. As a last instance I may cite what I believe is.the South Australian experience. From what I know of that experience the Government some years ago guaranteed a fund of this kind by paying . into it a sum of Â£10,000, though I speak from memory and under correction. This fund is contributed to by the servants of the State npon an actuarial scale and along well known lines, and I believe the guarantee has never been asked for or required in any direction. The public servants of the which State have achieved for themselves excellent results, and altogether there does not appear Many to be the slightest intention of departing from the system, the disposition being rather to strengthen it, and, if possible, to make it more extensive. Honourable members from South Australia will probably be able to speak with more authority than I can on this question, but I believe the facts which I have stated broadly and generally will be found to be correct on closer scrutiny and investigation. ""What has been done in a State might very well be done in the Commonwealth.. If the experience of South Australia, Germany, and other - places has been so entirely successful, we here, just - initiating a new system for a new nation, - may very well take advantage of the experience of other countries, and give to the servants of the Government the proper guarantee that they ought to receive and initiate a new system of insurance altogether. But I do not advocate the system purely for that reason. I am a believer in monopolies of this kind being taken in hand by the State itself. That being so I might have advocated the proposal under any circumstances, but in view of the experience of other places, and of the apparent success which attends the system elsewhere, I am the - more emboldened to put this proposal forward in the hope of getting it adopted at the initiation of the new state of affairs in connection with the Commonwealth. Honourable members would probably remind me, if I did not mtroduce the subject-matter myself, of the New Zealand State Life Assurance department. In that colony a very great advance has been made in the matter of life assurance - It has been very progressive in all matters of sociallegislation, in the matter of State life assurance I think it has been much more successful than perhaps some lionorable members are aware. From the official records of various kinds that I have been enabled to peruse, I find that the department was first founded in 1870. From that time up to the present some Â£8,000,000 sterling has been received in premiums from various persons assuring their lives witli this department of State. I find further that the total number of policies issued by all the companies of New Zealand, inclusive of the State Assurance department, is 75,692. Of that very great number of pohcies, however, the Government department has no less tlian 39,366, or considerably more than half. So successful has been this particular department of State that, as the honourable member for Echuca has just now pointed out to me, it practically discourages the other compames.",50
373,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The department makes it its business to do so.,51
374,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I have nothing to say on that point at present. New Zealand is, per unit of population, the most heavily assured country in the world. It would be idle and a waste of time to go into great detail as to other matters connected with this department of State, but from the success of the institution there is very httle likelihood of its ever being put on one side, and private companies and mutual companies taking its place. The people of New Zealand have learned to realise and appreciate the splendid guarantee which the Government have beliind their undertakings. To such an extent do the people appreciate the system that out of a total of 75,000 odd policies there are assured with the department nearly 40,000.",51
375,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"In New Zealand, are others than public servants insured ?",51
376,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , I am speaking generally of the department, which assures anybody. I find that in the period since the founding of the department there have been four divisions of profits, and that altogether Â£1,250,000 has been paidiu bonuses to policy holders.",51
377,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Reversionary bonuses 1,51
378,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Reversionary bonuses. The only comment which either private companies or mutual companies make is that the bonuses paid by the New Zealand State department are not so great but or high as those paid by mutual companies in New Zealand o r - I speak under correction-in any case in Australia. But the answer to that comment is, and it seems to be quite effective, that if the bonuses are not so high neither are the premiums so high. The premiums are lower in every case, and there are not so many of the hampering conditions attached to the State policies as are attached to most of the policies issued by mutual or private companies. The concern is looked on in a business-like way, and conducted on sound actuarial lines, and is, so far as I am able to judge, a most successful institution. The investments of the department in New Zealand are hnhted, and properly limited, to municipal and national securities, and to that extent assurers are further safeguarded. These remarks give as briefly as I could possibly give, without taking up more time than is necessary, some indication of the success with which this department has been inaugurated and carried on in New Zealand. I do not know that we in the Commonwealth of Australia, in the light of these circumstances, and of the proved experience of that colony, and of the older countries I have named, need have any great hesitancy in adopting this principle. It may be that there are reasons of expediency which may be put forward, and"" which might upset the calculations and theories I am announcing. At the same time. I shall require to be very fully satisfied on that head before withdrawing the proposal I now make. The only point which perhaps may weigh with the committee-and I have been reminded of ""it by the honourable and learned member for . Corinella - is, as to the amount of business could be done under my proposal. Honourable members, if they look at. the clause, will see that all those who are transferred to the Commonwealth from the departments of the States will, so far as my knowledge goes, be already insured with some co-operative companies; so that only those coming hi as new appointees will be affected by my proposal. The number of those new appointees will probably not be very great for some time to come. that appears to me to be one of the soundest reasons for adopting this proposal. Just because the number .will not be very great, the scheme could be initiated on lines which will give some indication of how it could be extended later on, and to what extent it could be developed. I would go further with the proposal if opportunity allowed, and create a State Life Assurance department, as in New Zealand, so that those outside the service as well as those inside might, if they chose, assure tlieir lives with a guaranteed State department. But I cannot do that in a proposal connected with this Bill. do propose to do something of the kind under the form of a general motion which is on the notice - paper, and which I .shall move when opportunity and convenience permit. In submitting the present amendment, as honourable - will see, I am necessarily limited. not think, however, that the present proposal ought to be the means of withholding our hands, but on the contrary we may - take it that if the State once adopt the - principal it can be easily extended, and possibly so far extended as to include a .State Life Assurance department, .tliose outside the civil service as well as Mr Hume Cook. those in it . Since the proposal has been circulated quite a number of the servants of the Commonwealth, who are already assured with companies of one sort or another, have asked me whether it would be possible for them to transfer their policies from private or mutual companies to the Commonwealth Department, if such a department were constituted. I , of course, could give no % answer to them on that head, but their inquiry was an indication to me, at any rate that tliey were desirous of coming into a department which would be conjust trolled, managed, and guaranteed by the State, and that if the principle were once adopted probably quite a number of perwhich sons would, if such facilities were offered, eagerly embrace the opportunity. I have already said that I infinitely prefer the system of annuities to the giving of a lump sum, and apparently the former is to be the proposal in the Bill, with certain exceptions. As a last word on this head, I would like to say that, from remarks made to me in connection with the present system, it would appear that some alteration is necessary to prevent what looks like an But abuse. I have lieard it asserted-and I have no reason to disbelieve the statements made to me-that oflieers of departments and others connected with the State service have, in"" some instances, made commissions out of proposals for State insurance by members of the staffs. I do not know that this is true. I have no reason to say, from my own knowledge, that it is true, but I have heard it asserted. If it is true, that kind of thing ought, to be stopped.",51
379,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,It is true.,52
380,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I know nothing myself personally, but I now hear it asserted I that the statement is true. If it is not true, no harm is done, but if it is true, the system ought to be stopped. In 1892 the civil servants in Victoria, realizing to a large extent the disabilities under which they laboured in respect to matters of members this kind, put forward a very positive proI do posal for life insurance amongst themselves. The proposal met with a very great deal of support in the service generally and from outside quarters; but, unfortunately for those who had the matter in hand, they so overloaded their scheme with conditions in the shape of fidelity guarantees, assuring fire insurance premiums in connection with the houses and property of men in the service, and so on, so that the matter fell through. Upon this subject the Atje newspaper of material 6th January, 1893, had an exceedingly able are article. I do not propose to read the whole of it, but with the permission of the a livelihood. committee I intend reading a short pasI sage to show how that journal viewed the proposal of life assurance guaranteed the State and supported by the members. the service. The article states:Thei'e is no reason whyfcheproject submitted to the meeting of public servants held on Friday evening, at the Olderfleet, should not be successment fully launched. The law. requires that all bers of the service holding positions ef trust obtain fidelity guarantee policies involving payment of a large sum each year in the Bhape of premiums: In addition to this compulsory outlay the greafc majority of the officials insure fcheir lives as a measure of precaution to their relatives, besides making payand I ments for protection against lire, sickness, accident, and other disabilities of daily experience. The proposals drawn up by Messrs. Kelsall MCOuinness, of the Customs department, and Gidderson, offcheVictorian railways, suggest formation of an Insurance Association on the mutual principle within the service, sofchatthe profits accruing shall be divided among the tributors instead of being dissipated over various corporations. The meeting accepted the ion, and a committee of ten, inclusive offchethree gentlemen named, was appointed to prepare definite scheme and report to a future gathering. In respect to life assurance, nothing can be than a combination of the description plated, provided it be conducted in accordance with competent actuarial direction. The principle of mutuality has been demonstrated to be lable if properly worked ; as, however, the receipts accumulate with rapidity infcheopening years, and the claims are few, it is the easiest possible for amateur assurers to get hopelessly involved while believingfchafcthey stand in position of undoubted security. To avoid risk, it will be necessary forfchefiguresto be exhaustively reviewed by a firm of actuaries whose reputation is beyond suspicion. If Government assist the projected association by a guarantee of Â£-20,000, as Mr Kelsall has suggested, its - operations will, perforce, have to be placed under scientific supervision. Assurance against deatli can only be adequately carried on nowget adays in conjunction with endownment asit, surance ; and the hitter, as we pointed out the article to which reference was made at meeting, materially helps in attracting the best class of lives. People in perfect health naturally prefer to look for the benefit arising from their thrift in their life-time, and the promise of ment on attaining a specified age-enables them enjoy this prospect. It is quite probable for such an outlook to have a beneficial effect on their vitality. The experience of the Australian Mutual Provident Society has shownfchafcfche mortality table improves in proportion as number of endowment policies gains on the number of whole life' policies. The Public Service Association, if it be formed, will have to enter fully on this branch of the business. Persons [112] the employ of the State furnish admittedly good for life assurance purposes, as they gain their appointments by a process of selection, aud not, or at least need not, be affected by the worries incidental to the ordinary struggles for t seems to me that if this proposal is adopted, sometliing like the suggestion by contained in that article would have to be of incorporated with it . The Government would have to set aside a certain sum of money in order to guarantee the departin its earlier years. That would be a memwise and proper step to take, and under all shall the ch-cumstahces a move in the right the direction. I am very grateful to the committee for listening to me so patiently while discussing this subject. I have endeavoured due to cut my - remarks as short as possible, move the amendment, with the full knowledge that quite a number and of the general public are very much Mr enamoured of such a proposal, and that a the considerable section of this House approve of the principle. I submit the amendment, conperhaps in a somewhat crude form, with a desire to obtain a ful l expression of opinion suggestby the committee upon the principle a mvolved. I believe very strongly in State Life Assurance, and I see no other opening safer upon which I could get the matter discussed contemin connection with this Bill. I trust, however, that if we carry my proposal, it inviowill be the means of initiating a system w'hich will eventually-develop into a State - Life Assurance Department, embracing thing members of the outside public as well as a those who are in the Commonwealth service.",52
381,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I do not propose to say very much at this stage of the debate, because I . think thisjs eminently a question upon which it might be reasonable to keep an open mind, It is a matter upon which we ah desire to the fullest information possible. I take however, that the insertion of this and in other clauses proves that the Government the had in the first place a desire to create some kind of fund for the maintenance of civil servants in their old age, and furtlier, endowthat they had also the idea of a fund that, to in case of the death of public servants, would help to reheve the necessities of their widows and children. I do not agree with the lionorable meinber for Bourke in liis the view with regard to annuities. In New South Wales we had a sort of fund which, I believe for years was bankrupt, and one rein sult was that when an officer - retired from the puhlic service-and they do not often retire until they are made to do so-he was naturally of an age when the possibilities of life were not very great. It seems to me an absolute cruelty to give a man who is 60 years of age a pension - he may not live for more than five years-and then to leave his widow and family to the cold mercies of the world. In that case we were put in a very awkward position. We were permitted to give the widow, in case she Came before us in forma pav/peris, an allowance. But the man who had saved a little, hut not sufficient to keep him decently, Could not claim an allowance in forma pauperis. The system was thus practically offering a'premium to negligence. I take it that the object of the Government in this case is to introduce in the first place a system of endowment-the same system that is carried out in all assurance offices-by which a certain amount is to be paid if a man dies before a certain period, which amount goes to his widow and family if he so wills it, whilst if he reaches a certain age he gets a lump sum to deal with as he desires. I take it that the object of the Minister in this new departure is to create to a large extent a desire in the minds of public servants to keep theirlives properly assured, and to help generally the system of life assurance which Avill do an enormous work in the future people of different countries. I see veiy little difference between the old system and the proposal of Government assurance for this particular purpose. I think that my honourable friend must have been largely led to his views by the hope that he would create a nucleus which Would ultimately groAV into a State assurance fund. I dp not think Ave ought on a Bill like this to attempt to create a system of this kind. I do not know even that it has been so A ery successful as the honourable gentleman supposes in another State. But I should be veiy glad to give this system a fair trial. think it is an experiment which we may make with great benefit fco the service as a Avhole. It brings home in concrete form to a man the fact that he has a property or an assetwhich providesagainst the contingencies of the future. I feel there are one or two Aveak spots in the proposal to which the honourable member has referred. I think it Avill be necessaiy to have a schedule of Offices approved by ' the Government. I should also feel that that involved this Sir William MCMillan. Bill. result: that if by any chance one of those offices failed the Government would be in a very difficult position in dealing with those Avho. had insured in that office.",53
382,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,They would simply have to take it up.,54
383,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I believe that in such a contingency the Government Would have to make the position right for the individual servants concerned. That, is to my mind, the great argument that may be used against the life insurance principle. Still, I think that if the schedule is carefully prepared, it is a very remote contingency. Certainly, we have to choose now between the proposal of the Government and a pension fund created by the State. The pension fund Would need to have a large amount of money placed to its credit to put it upon a sound actuarial footing. I do not agree with the honourable member for Bourke that there is an advantage in the small number that Avill first come under the provisions of the Bill, because the fact of our going to outside offices, in which there are .thousands and hundreds of thousands of policy holders, Avill enable us to start at once upon a sound basis, as if Ave had had for years a State assurance fund. I do feel more generally in this matter than the particular case might indicate, because I am a very strong upamong holder of the principle of life assurance. I believe it is a system which, if properly carried out, and if the people are indoctrinated Will it, may save the country a very great many old-age pensions. I find that when once a man has taken out a policy of life assurance and sees the benefit of it, when helooks at the reversionary bonuses which are declared year after year, or at the quinquennial periods, he has a desire to put his savings into T that particular kind of inA^estment. I am sure I shall have the sympathy of honourable members Avhen I say that if many of I us had put our savings into that particular kind of instrument we would have been better off today than Ave ai-e. Therefore, Avhilst I think that the question is very arguable, I am hiclined to take it as an experiment. Of course an experiment seems rather dangerous in laying the foundation of a principle which must be carried on, probably for all time. Still I think that it is so sound in every Avay,. that it so meets But the conditions of the pubhc servant, and is such an incentive to saving, that it would be well if this House-whethe r it requires modifications ornot I cannot say-woul d accept it. I do not mean life assurance under the State ; I do not mean a fund which is really a pension fund ; but the principle of every man assuring his life, on entering the public service, in a reputable office. Under a scheme like this, he would, as in any other condition of life, increase his assurance as the years went on, and provide, not merely an annuity, which would be practically the interest on the endowment, for himself, but a fund by which he would be assured that his widow would be left comfortably off.",54
384,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I quite agree with the honourable meinber for Wentworth that it would not be well, at this juncture, to deal with the matter of State life insurance. The suggestion of the honourable member for Bourke is that we should try, as an experiment, a limited State life assurance, in such a way, and under such conditions, that I felt perfectly certain no loss could accrue to the State, whilst a greater sense of security would be given to those who participate in it . The honourable member for Bourke referred to the scheme that was in operation in South Australia, and the acting leader of the Opposition said he was not sure that that had been altogether satisfactory.",55
385,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I was referring to New Zealand.,55
386,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Wit h regard to South Australia, where the system is limited to one public department fpr the present-the Education department-it has been in operation for some years.",55
387,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That is a superannuation scheme, but a system of life assurance has been in operation for about the same time i u the railway service.",55
388,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It has been found that, although the Government gave a guarantee when the fund was first started, no call upon them has ever been necessary, and ' the fund is now absolutely self-supporting, and so safely and securely established that it is able to stand alone. In addition to that I am informed that it is intended to extend the system to other branches of the service, so that the whole of the State servants may be brought under its provisions. I am one of tliose who believe that we should as far as possible provide for those who do the work of the State, and that we should not liave the spectacle of men who have given the best years of their life to the public service being compelled in tlieir old age to ask for charity. Under the scheme I have already spoken of the men themselves contribute, and the whole of the funds are provided by those who work in the department, and they have the sense of security which is so necessary to the satisfactory working of life assurance business. Theacting leader of the Opposition allows at once that if we had a schedule of approved offices, and if any one of these offices became insolvent, there would be at least a moral obligation on the part of the Government to come to the assistance of those who had assured in the defaulting office; but we could obviate all that by the Commonwealth taking the responsibility from the very start.",55
389,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I do not think we should get as good results.,55
390,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Why not 1 It could be worked by the State at a great deal less expense.,55
391,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,AVha t capital would be . involved at first?,55
392,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The amount of capital would depend upon the number of people who became assured.,55
393,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Surely the. r honourable member could not expect to give the same scale of bonuses as the Australian Mutual Provident Society, for instance ?",55
394,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am not suggesting that the Government should go into the business for the sake of making money. The only people who should derive any benefit should be those who insure their lives. Further, the only benefits which should accrue should be in the shape of reduced premiums.",55
395,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"There would be no opportunity of making profits such as would provide reasonably, good bonuses.",55
396,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I sincerely trust that I shall never see the State going in foi"" an assurance business conducted on those lines. The only reason why State assurance should be established is in order that people may liave opportunities of assuring their lives more cheaply, and that is the only direction in which they should get the benefit. I think State assurance could be undertaken with regard to the officers of the State with more advantage than by private companies, because there ought not to be the same expense connected with getting the policies talcen up. No commissions would have to be paid, and in addition to that the State would be absolutely certain of receiving its payments, because there would be no dropping out, and no claims made upon the Government for "" time pay."" The whole thing would be worked by deductions from the salaries paid Government officers. This matter of State life assurance has been sufficiently investinot; gated, and the results, both here and on Continent, have been such as to warrant us in taking the step I have indicated. should like to see the whole of wealth .servants assured .under a .systembacked up by the Commonwealth, and safer and cheaper than any other system possible.",55
397,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Macquarie) Whilst I feel that the honourable member for Bourke has raised a very important question, I think it would be very hard on is necessary. some of the public servants if they were compelled to limit themselves to an assurthat ance company supported by the Governto ment. We all know the way in which some of these assurance companies are worked, and the amounts of bonuses to the members, and I am afraid that, to the limited number of persons who would be able to contribute' to the proposed as- - Mr MCCAY surance fund, tliere would not be the same amount available for bonuses as is the case list. with the private companies. I doubt, in fact, whether those who invested in the State assurance fund would get any bonuses .at all. In the first place, the fund will apply only to probationers and to newly-appointed officers, and the number of these will be limited. Therefore, not only would the scope of the proposed fund be limited, but there would not be the same - opportunity for investments of funds.",56
398,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"They will not be .able .sweat their employees, any way.",56
399,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I think the Government might very well leave it to their employees to judge as to the best means - of insuring themselves.,56
400,Mr FOWLER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Why compel them insure at all ? Why not leave that to their own opinion 1,56
401,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I think it is wise to compel Government servants to insure, for the reasons stated by the honorto able member for Wentworth.",56
402,Mr MOCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Does the honourable memtliat ber believe in having an approved list offices ?,56
403,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,My opinion is that the assurance companies ought to be registered and that there ought to be some to guarantee as to their stability.,56
404,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Would the honourable memto ber make the Government guarantee them ?,56
405,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"No , I would but I tliink the accounts ought to be the gone into and audited in the same way as has been done in some other cases.",56
406,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Where would the Commonthe guarantee come from?,56

410,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I believe in assurance companies having to certify that their accounts are in accordance with their balance-sheets. I do not think it would be possible to register assurance companies, but we all know what has taken place during the last few years, and I think it would be a good thing if the accounte of these companies were certified to as being in order. Whilst I quite agree with the neto cessity for some assurance arrangements, I think it would be a hard thing to compel the Government servants to assure in the Government fund and prevent them from going to societies which would, perhaps,, give them better. bonuses tlian the Government could do. to . Mr MCCOLL (Echuca) - I trust we are not going to be led into an academic discussion at this stage, because I do not think that the occasion is an opportune one. The remarks I had intended to make have been some extent anticipated by the honourable member for Macquarie. I do not think we can possibly look for success witli a of State assurance fund started just now. One i of the matters that the Commonwealth has power to take up is that of assurance, and the whole* question as to whether officers should assure with the State or not can very well he left open to be dealt witli at some future time, especially as some considerable period must elapse before any number of officers could join an assurance fund. If there is one tiling that the Australian people have reason to be proud of it is their mutual assurance companies, which passed absolutely unscathed through the recent financial crash.",56
411,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,They have not gone on long enough.,57
412,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"They have gone on for over half a century, and the longer they have gone, the stronger they have become.",57

416,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"B y the highest actuaries of the day. I do not wish to advertise any companies, but it is a fact that the Australian Mutual Provident Society have submitted fcheir figures to the best actuaries of the day to ascertain that they were on a sound and stable basis.",57
417,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It is not to an actuary but to a valuer, who knows the value of their assets, that they should be submitted.",57
418,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Where necessaiy they have recast their figures in order to make them more complete and sound. These premiums are not found by the State, but are deducted from the salaries of the officials. It is right, tlierefore, that for that investment which they are compelled by the State to make, they should get the best possible return. In the case of assuring with the C overnment they cannot possibly expect to get a return in the shape of profits for many years; whereas, in the case of probably some half-dozen assurance companies the value of their policy will increase so considerably that, perhaps in 20 or 25 years, it will double itself. Why should we compel men to assure with the State and literally rob them of that additional profit which should come to them in their old age and to their children ? One other advantage I think will come to the public i i i this matter. It has been said that we should allow assurers to select their own oifiees. We should give them that right, but at the same time we should have a list, and the Government should see that they :E, 1901.] Pill. 1765accept only policies in assurance offices which they found on examination were sound and stable, and the general pubhc would also have this benefit for themselves. I agree to a certain extent with the previous speaker that the Government should keep a strict supervision over all assurance companies, because we have to take the figures as they are given to us. We have fco take the figures as they are audited, and - the figures from their own actuaries; but possibly there may be behind all that some weakness in the office of which the members should be made aware. I ffcheState assurers are fco go into these mutual offices it will compel the Government, to keep a stricter check on those offices, and so to the whole pubhc they will be made even safer than they are.",57

We may fairly leave the whole discussion, I think, until a more com'enient season.",57
421,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I intend to support the amendment. Honourable members who have spoken against civil servants, being permitted to assure with the CommonAvealth, have taken it for granted that their funds, Avhen invested in outside companies, Avill realise greater bonuses and .largerprofits than they would do under the Commonwealth. If these outside companies are earning so much more money than the Commonwealth could do Will the same funds, how is it that the surplus moneys* of many of them are being invested in Government and municipal bonds ?",57

Of Avhat value is that to ascertain or get at the exact position of any of these companies? We have heard that they have gone on, that none of them has come to grief like the banking companies orfchebuilding societies, but why is that 1 It is simply because there could not be a run upon an assurance company the same as there can be on bank. If it had been possible for these policy-holders to come in as depositors do, and demand fcheir money, what would have happened ? Would we have a solvent assurance company ?

427,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,How would the honourable member value in the case of the American companies ?,58
428,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am not dealing the American companies, and when we arrive at a decision as to tliose companies shall be prepared to give an expression my opinion. Is it a preposterous thing - do ? I do not want to sound an alarmist's note, but let it be understood that there amendment. - are in Australia not merely' mutual assurance companies, but actuaUy propriewith tary life assurance companies. Is i object of honourable members to put civil servants at the mercy of men who are view. drawing dividends from the earnings of - assurance companies ? What is to prevent - a proprietary assurance company from putting up its dividends from 10 to 20 cent., and so absorbing its profits or reserves as to become in a short time in an unsound position ?",58
429,Mr MCCOLL,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Proprietar y companies scarcely any business at all in the States,58
430,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The honourable member, I am afraid, has not exhausted the whole subject. He would do well, I think - I do a not want to mention any names-to look at the business of one industrial proprietory can assurance company in this country.",58
431,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The Citizens.,58
432,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am not an authority. I do not profess to be an actuary or to understand the business of assurance ; I can only say that the volume of this company's the business has grown wonderfully during the last five or six years. When we are starting to build up a new nation, I do not think it is our duty to compel our civil servants to assure in these private companies. The the honourable member for Wentworth, I believe, admitted that if there was any default on will the part of these assurance companies the State had a moral obligation to make it good. inI f these companies are to offer any security what to civil servants we must have a periodical ? Do examination of their mortgages and of their in order to know how the}' stand, made by independent State auditors-me n will examine every document and every piece of paper representing a security with the companies. Look at the enormous exThat pense !",58
433,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,We ought to do that,58
434,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"We may do that some time, but if we compel civil servants to assure in these companies then we have a direct obUgation to do so. I must apologize for taking up so much time, but I feel very strongly on this matter, and I hope that the with committee will support the amendment.",58
435,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) 1 I think the last speaker has made some very of important and valuable observations. He to speaks with a good deal of knowledge of the subject, and I cordially concur with the The honourable member for life Echuca opposes it, but I am surprised his experience in these matters he t the does not see his way clear to avoid the academic view and to take the practical The' difficulty is that he started these with the very.fine statement that we must not have an academic discussion. My experience is that whenever aman is saying per what one does not agree with, one calls his statement academic, while one's own statement is practical. The only question is what is practical, and what is academic. The do proposal has been attacked in two or now. three points, but not one of those points is vulnerable. One attack was upon a statement made by the honourable member for Bourke, that he preferred an annuity to a lump sum. The honourable member for Wentworth has said that he prefers a lump sum to an annuity. That may or may not be preferable. But that does not affect the proposal. The honourable member for Bourke accepts the suggestion of the Ministers in the Bill as to what shall be given- a lump sum or an annuity-hu t that is not a ground for attacking his proposal. I conceive that by the assistance of actuaries we could find a method by which we could. combine the two, and hy which a man might feel that he would get an annuity after 60, and that if his death should occur within a certain limit, his family should get a lump sum. Of course, the longer he lived for the annuity, the less the family would get. It is a matter on which I have not sufficient knowledge to speak .with any authority, but I think it would be well worthwhile to refer it to actuaries and to experts to say whether we could not get a policy based on these lines, giving the annuity with a promise of a lump sum in case the annuity did not run on for a certain number of 3'ears. The next point of attack was that State assurance is not a good business to undertake. , Of course, the proposal at present is not State assurance for the outside public. As soon as that thing is proposed we can deal with it . I think we ought to deal with theparticular proposal made here. All that is now proposed is that the State shall assure its own servants when it makes assurance compulsory. AVe are proceeding step by step. AVe say here to the civil servants, ""You must assure."" "" In what are we to assure V they ask. It is admitted that there must be recognised companies, that is, companies of a certain standard. I cannot see a way out of the position, but that we must have certain companies recognised by the Government as being sound ones. If we recognise a company and it fail, the Government is almost certain to be called upon, ad misericordiam, to pay the amount. AVe are almost certain to be called upon to practically guarantee the amount. If we practically guarantee the amount, cannot we go one step forward and assure the men ? That is the position. I need not go over what has been said already, that ordinary assurance companies have a very expensive management, under which 60 per cent, of the first premium goes to the agent, aad that from all the premiums afterwards collected large deductions have to be made.",58
436,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I wish that were true. . Mr HIGGINS - I am speaking of agents whom I know. The assurance companies have to keep up expensive staffs, pay extensive commissions, have big offices to build and interest to pay 011 the cost of those offices, and surely the Government could easily work out a system by which it could take less premiums from public servants than are required by outside offices. As to safety, I am happy to say none of the assurance companies have failed. At the same time, we want to give those men, whom we compel to assure, the best security possible. The assurance companies rest on mortgages and Govern- "" ment securities, and I venture to say that if those Government securities had been taken away from some of the companies during the recent crisis, they would certainly have gone as the banks went. The ultimate security for this country is the people of the country and the taxation they can pay-yo n could, not get a better security. It is much better for the Government servant, whom we force to assure, to feel he is resting on the security of his employer, which is the best security within his reach, for the payment of the money when it is due. I cordially support this proposal, and hope the Minister will see his way to accept it.",59
437,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I do not want it to be understood I am opposed to State assurance. In fact, if any one can show me that it is a profitable investment, I will vote for it . AVhat I want to try to impress on my honourable friends is that if the 11,000 civil servants are the only people in the Commonwealth worthy of protection, the other thousands, or millions, who have to invest their money in the assurance companies hazardously, must be taken as not worthy of consideration. - Mr HUME COOK - I will follow this amendment with another proposal at a later stage.",59
438,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I quite agree with the honourable member for Bourke that the amendment is worth a good deal of consideration. I want it distinctly understood that what I say here on this matter is without prejudice. I want that to be understood for the simple reason that I have been twenty years an assurance man, and have made a fortune at the business. Having had a little experience, I want to say that if worth the consideration of the Government to give protection to 11,000 civil servants, surely honourable members in the State of Victoria all these years have not been doing their duty as regards the protection of the citizens of Victoria.",59
439,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Le t us make a start now.,60
440,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Will some honourable member explain to me how the first assurers for twenty years are going to get a profit ? We have no averages. New Zealand has gone into the business.,60
441,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,How did the honourable member's company start ?,60
442,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I will not say a word about my company. I am going - to talk about this matter altogether from the point of view of the Commonwealth of Australia. For myself I am here to do my duty to the people of the great State of Tasmania. The honourable member for Coolgardie quite rightly says that there are proprietary companies. I say that civil servants in general or in particular, or people in general, should not be thrown out h i the cold world without a certificate of protection by. the Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth will have to absolutely enter into the business and put their canvassers on the road, and compete with public companies if the Government want to get any averages.",60
443,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,If the people are compelled to insure we want no canvassers.,60
444,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Onl y the' 11,000 civil servants can be compelled to insure. AVe cannot step in and make it national compulsory assurance.",60
445,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , we can.",60
446,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Ver y well then, we come back to first principles. I want to know, will the State put up an immense sum at the start to earn the interest to pay the first policies? It is all right to talk these fabulous"" sums, but I find it is an eternal hard thing to get hold of them.",60
447,Mr FOWLER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Whaf c do private companies do when they start ?,60
448,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"All the honourable member for Bourke says I have lieard many times on the question, and I am quite witli him. The question is, is it not the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to guarantee every man in the Commonwealth that he is safe when he has taken oiit assurance for his family. Let us start right and have a controller of assurance. In the United States, it is before a national bank can be started, 90 per cent, of the gold representing the note issue must be deposited in the United States Treasury, so that when a bank crosses the Jordan, and you have a note in your pocket, you know that its golden redeemer liveth. Is the Commonwealth Government in the position to start that way ? Let us have in the Commonwealth of Australia 40, 50, or if necessary 100 actuaries who will be under the controller of finance. Let us in the first place start to reorganize our banking system. Tliere is a precedent for that, and I know in British countries you never act until you find out whether your father or your grandfather has done the same tiling before you. The Premier of the great Canadian Dominion compelled the banks to deposit 40 per cent, of their legal gold reserve, and they had to take it in Canadian Legal Tender Notes. The money is lying in the vaults unutilized, arid of no benefit to anybody. It creates no industries, and does nothing except to guarantee people that i ffcheywantfcheirmoney they can come and get it , and when people know they can get their money they do not want it . Let us start rightly in Australia. Let uscompel the banks not to pay 40 per cent, but 50 per cent, of the Â£21,000,000 they have lying in their vaults. That would start us with Â£10,000,000 of money fco commence with, and may be then we would be able to start life assurance, because there would be something to earn something. The Government have no more power to make money than has an ordinary man in the street. Every dollar must be dug out of the earth and earned ; we would be all millionaires if we could make money. All we have to do on this, question is simply to bring the assurance companies under Commonwealth supervision and send actuaries to calculate the about reserves and expenses, and value the securities.",60
449,Mr MAHON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is the point.,60
450,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The actuaries ought to be satisfied with the balance sheets every year, and a company that is unable to comply with the actuarial calculation or valuation should be turned out of the Commonwealth. Let us bury them and go to their funerals at once. I am prepared to furnish second-hand coffins for them.",60
451,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Free ?,60
452,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Not exactly free. The members of every Legislature in this country are morally responsible for the family of every man who has insured his life in a company It is.said that this guarantee cannot be given; but it is done in Canada, in the States of New York, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, and. almost every other State of the American Union. Surely in the United States nothing has been done that we cannot do here. Let us then begin aright, and compel every assurance company in the Commonwealth to come undei' State supervision. Let the Minister have a list of the companies and tell the civil servants the companies in which they must assure. These companies should then be compelled to deposit their legal reserve in Commonwealth Government debentures, and it sbould be seen that these reserves are sufficient to cover every policy, based on a reasonable calculation. That is ""all that could he done if we had Government assurance. The amount invested in Commonwealth bonds, held by the Commonwealth, should be equal to the amount owing to the civil servants, and I am sure lots of splendid assurance companies could be found to come in and undertake the work. I will be prepared to move an amendment on the amendment to the effect that we should adopt another system, giving us the benefit of the companies established, and of companies able to get averages, and then we will not, perhaps, bankrupt the Commonwealth. There are not only averages in people but averages in countries in life insurance business, so that losses met with in one country are made up somewhere else. The officers of the Australian Mutual Provident Society were wise to see that was the case, and that is why they have struggled to get away to other countries besides Australia with their business.",60
453,Mr FOWL ER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I have listened very carefully to the speech of the honourable membei' for the ""great State of Tasmania,"" and I fail to see in anything he has said, although I believe he is an assurance expert, an argument to change me from my resolution to support the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke. I feel that it is a necessary corollary to compelling civil servants to assure that there should be a State assurance department. If a great reserve of coin is required in the case of private assurance companies, I do not consider that such a necessity exists in the case of the State. We have the whole State security behind a scheme of State assurance, and that I feel certain would be sufficieiit to commend it to the civil servants and even to the general pubhc if the scheme were extended to embrace the latter. I do not tliink the scheme of State assurance can be described as an experiment - As the honourable member for Bourke has already indicated, we have instances of schemes of the nature being successfully carried on in the various States.",61
454,Mr MAUGER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,And by private proprietors.,61
455,Mr FOWLER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Certainly . If such a scheme can be carried on in the States, I ' do not see why we have fewer chances of its success in the Commonwealth of Australia. There is another matter which I think worthy of consideration. The large expense of carrying on these private assurance companies has already been commented on, and I believe that-expense amounts in some cases to 75 per cent, of the profit.",61
456,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Thos e are the first premiums.,61
457,Mr FO WLER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That may be so. But in the case of civil servants there is no necessity for commission agents to go round to secure the necessary business. Why, then"" penalize the civil servants to the extent which is necessary in the case of those companies who have to send their agents among the general community? I hope the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke will receive the careful consideration of the committee, and if that careful consideration be given, I am sure that the principle is one that many members will feel compelled to support.",61
458,Mr WILKINSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," On e of the objections that has beenraised to the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke seems to me to be rather weak. Most honourable members who objected to his proposal found fault with it on the ground that those who require to insure at the beginning would be few in number. But I would point out that if we are ever to' institute a State Assurance Fund we shall have to face that difficulty, because those who join at the beginning will have joined under a certain set of conditions, and it would be manifestly unfair at a later stage to' alter the conditions of their service. Consequently, whenever we institute a State assurance system, we shall have to start with a small number of officers. I was one who, in 1890, with the honourable member far Maranoa, took a considerable part in the matter of the assurance"" of raihvay employees in Queensland. We had a big fight over that, and we know the temptation that came in the way of members of that department. I can honestly say that bribes amounting to thousands of pounds were offered to those who had influence over the employees to induce them to join a certain society. That sort of temptation will always exist. We shall always find people who are not too scrupulous. It is far better to have a State Assurance Society, the business in connection with which can be done openly, than to luy the department open to nepotism and other evils which would inevitably arise under any other system. I go further than the honourable member for Bourke. I should like the insurance of the whole community to be undertaken by the State. To my mind, it is as much a matter of public utility as is the supply of water or gas to the people. The honourable member for Tasmania,' Mr O'Malley, has told us that he has made a fortune out of assurance. We know that huge fortunes have been made out of that business. But when people assure they do so to provide for their own future needs, and not to benefit others. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Does membei' tliink that this comes within the range of our Constitution 1",61
459,Mr WILKINSON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"We claim to be able to legislate upon the matter of old age pensions, and we shall have to supply the means to enable any such system to be carried out. AVe therefore might as well tax the people to provide for their own old age. I shall certainly - support the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke, believing it to be a step in the right direction. Though it may be a small thing at the beginning, it will continue to grow, and by the establishment of this system we shall do away with the evilsfchafcwould otherwise develop into bigger evils as time passed. I am glad to see that the old-fashioned pension scheme has not been followed. Among the subjects upon which the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to legislate are assurance other than State assurance, and as the assurance of public officers ancl employees will extend beyond the boundaries of any one State we are quite within our rights in legislating upon this matter. I hope that the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke will command a majority in its favour.",62
460,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Macquarie) I am afraid that in addition to the objections which I have already stated, there is yet another to the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke, from a civil servant's point of view."" Let us suppose that an officer joins the service of the Commonwealth who has already effected an assurance in some other company for Â£ 3 0 0 or Â£400. Under this clause he will be compelled to join the State Assurance Society.",62
461,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"No, he will not. Will the honourable member look at clause 43 1",62
462,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I understood the honourable member to say that he intended to establish a State Assurance Eund and to compel every public servant to have a j>olicy in that fund. The honourable member said that if his proposal were carried, he intended to go one step further.",62
463,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But that one step further is to establish a State Life Assurance "" department, which would bring in the outside public.",62
464,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Does the honourable member for Bourke intend under his further proposal to compel every officer to come under the State Assurance Fund 1,62
465,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,-That is already provided for the honourable in clause 43.,62
466,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"What I propose is very simple. I propose that those who are already insured, and who come under the provisions of clause 43, shall retain their assurances with the companies as they now exist, unless they voluntarily choose to surrender their policies ancl come under the Government fund. But I wish to provide that those who are not already assured, ancl who come into the Commonwealth service, shall be compelled to come under the State Assurance Fund. The further proposals, of which I spoke, woulcl have the effect of establishing a State Life Assurance department, which would allow the outside public, in addition to civil servants, an opportunity to come in.",62
467,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I confess that this is a matter upon which I have been trying during the debate to make up my mind, bufc, like Captain Cuttle, I see so much to be said on both sides that I am unable to do so. On the one hand I have for a long time regarded a great many financial operations, including life assurance, as being not only within the competence of the State, but as matters which might very properly be undertaken by the State. On the other hand, I think that these questions should not be dealt with piecemeal. The strongest argument against the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke is his own statement that this is not a complete scheme, but that he intends to follow it up by a resolution, which obviously will accomplish nothing.",62
468,Mr FOWLER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,--It is complete in respect of this Bill.,63
469,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"To be quite accurate in language, it is as much of the scheme as can be put into the Bill, but it is not a complete scheme. To complete it would require a Bill which will need the assent of both Houses of Parliament. The passing of a resolution in this House is a very long way from obtaining the desired result by legislation. I am entirely in sympathy with the idea contained in the amendment; but I do not think it is a matter of such urgency as to compel us to pass it in this Bill during the present session, because for many years to come there will be a very small number of. individuals affected by this assurance provision. The bulk of the public servants of the Commonwealth will belong to the transferred departments, who are expressly exempted from the provisions of the Bill. Honourable members must recollect that a life assurance society, in order to be satisfactory to its memberseven if it be purely mutual-mus t be a living and growing body. At a certain stage in its early life there comes a period when the liabilities begin to accrue; when the debts have to be paid; and unless it then has an increasing business so as to .enable it from its revenue to pay the debts on the deaths, that society from a financial point of view is doomed. ask the honourable member for Bourke if lie anticipates that this ' scheme will be self-supporting, ancl. will not require contributions from the consolidated revenue to enable it to live. The honourable member may tell me that it will be self-supporting if we bring in the public, but we ma)' not be able to bring in the public. We have no guarantee that we shall get our system of Commonwealth life assurance.",63
470,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The lionorable member must not lose sight of the age of the probationer and the time that must elapse before he can make a claim.,63
471,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But I - would point out thut even probationers die. The death rate may be very small. I do not suppose however, that it will be much less than the death rate of any first class life assurance society already in existence. It will not be so vastly improved a death rate as to make a difference to the fact that there will not be premiums coming in. It will take a lot of premiums to stand even a moderate assault.",63
472,Mr SALMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is opposed to experience.,63
473,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"My own view is that the insertion of these provisions would be more likely to hinder the establishment of State life assurance than to assist it. There are other things which might very well be branches of the same subject in a State having only a limited range, so to speak, such as our own fidelity guarantees, assuring our own properties, and working these in connection with the notation and management of our loans, and applying them to the investment of locally floated loans, etc.",63
474,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,And creating a fine big department.,63
475,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , creating a department which I , for one, am not afraid to anticipate. But I am frankly afraid of the responsibility which might be involved if we did not get the outside public to come in. It is hardly fair to the committee, to the Parliament, or to the Commonwealth to settle a big issue like this in a debate on a subject like a Public Service Bill, which is primarily devoted to the determination of very different questions. I am' still in a state of flux, so far as my mind is concerned, on the matter, but I submit these considerations, with the hope that other honourable members may be able to help me to come I to a decision as to which way I should vote. 1Â° have still an open mind in the matter, but there are difficulties which I think it is the bounden duty of the supporters of the proposal to remove before they can expect my support.",63
476,Sir EDWARDBRADD ON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Tasmania). - When we were on the second reading of this Bill I expressed the opinion that the assurance of civil servants of the Commonwealth should be undertaken by the Commonwealth itself, directly, ancl not through the assurance companies; and, further, that, as is provided in exceptional instances under clause 49, so should it be provided in all instances, that is to say, that the Commonwealth should be responsible for the granting of satisfactory gratuities and allowances to all civil servants coining within the scope of these particular clauses ox their death or retirement from the service. Inasmuch as these clauses cannot embrace all the servants who are transferred to the Commonwealth at the present time, who are specially exempted under clause 43, I do not think we need apprehend any great difficulties from death or disaster for some years to come, or before we have built up a fund upon which those retiring or the dependents of those dying may rely witli the assurance that they will get the relief intended to be provided, for them. I can see no serious objection to, but on the other hand I can see every good reason for, the State subsidizing a fund of that sort in order to provide for the comfort of its own servants. I hope that any prospect of difficulty will not daunt us or prevent us from passing the measure which, I beheve, will be attended with incalculable good to the servants of the Commonwealth. We have in some of the States provision of this sort already, and provision has been made in some way or other for the great majority of the servants of the transferred services, and I think it now becomes our bounden duty to see that provision is made for tlieir future. I am afraid I am in disagreement with some of those who favour this State assurance idea, inasmuch as I . would, limit it strictly to making provision for our own servants, aiid would not go to the general public for assistance in establishing the' fund, and thus make the Commonwealth Government a general assurance company. I wonld limit it solely to the operations necessary to be conducted on behalf of our own servants.",63
477,Mr OMALLEY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,: The Commonwealth could re-insure.,64
478,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia) Tho'se of us who favour the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke, are very glad to see"" it meet with the support of the honourable member who has just spoken. The honourable and learned member for Corinella told ns he was in a dilemma, and that be had not quite made up liis mind, and his principal trouble seemed to be that the proposed assurance fund was to be started in a small way. He would be more inclined to give it support if we were going in for a national scheme. I would point out, however, that there is an opposite way of looking at the matter, and that while perhaps it might be somewhat risky starting an experiment, embracing the whole community, on a very large scale, it would be comparatively safe to start it on a small scale in the way now proposed. I have come to the conclusion that the proposal is good enough for us to start with. Some objection was taken to our discussing this matter in connection with the present measure. But it seems to me that ""this is just the measure to which our present discussion naturally belongs.",64
479,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Excep t that we have not any actuarial information to guide us.,64
480,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The honourable member will admit that the scheme, as proposed by the Government, ancl as stated by the Attorney-General, is one which the assurance companies will accept. It is said to be actuarially sound, and therefore we have that much to go on. If the scheme itself is actuarially sound, and the private companies are prepared to accept it , what should there be to prevent the Government from taking it up ? We know that a considerable percentage of the earnings of the companies goes in the way of expenses, in payment of agents' commissions, directors' fees, cost of buildings, and so on.",64
481,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,But we must have a large volume of business in order to make our profits and reduce our percentage of expenses.,64
482,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,.No Government scheme could get near the profits of the A.M.P. society.,64
483,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,That is no argument at all. Sir. WILLIAM MCMILLAN - Does not the honourable member allow that life assurance depends upon a certain number of people assuring in order to make it sound.,64
484,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I will allow that, and in his turn the honourable member for AVentw orth must admit that all companies T have had to start with a small number of lives, and probably at first made lossesas the result. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN.""-AV e had an unlimited area to work upon.",64
485,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The assurance companies have built up their business owing to the gradual accumulation of funds, and to more and more people joining them, and the same results will follow under the scheme that is now proposed. There will be such a large number of policy holders to draw' upon.",64
486,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,There will be a very limited number.,65
487,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The honourable meinber does not know what the limits of the Commonwealth service will be.,65
488,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I am hopeful that the number of people to be assured will not be anything like the numbers assured by the private companies ,65
489,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"It is not at all unlikely that other services beyond those already transferred will be taken over by the. Commonwealth, - and this fund will probably prove the nucleus of a very"" large scheme into which the outside public may be eventually drawn, if necessary. We are telling the public servants that they must assure their lives, and if we require that they shall assure their lives with some of the private companies, it argues that the Government must guarantee the companies. We have no right to say to our servants that tliey must assure unless we are prepared to give a guarantee that tlieir pohcies will be met. If we do have to guarantee these companies, it seems to me that we shall ultimately have the responsibility, and that being so, I think we ought to do the work itself. It would be idle to say that the Government should bear all the losses, but that if there were any profits, they should go into the hands of the private companies.",65
490,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,I want to know where is the guarantee ?,65
491,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,There is nothing in the Bill about that.,65
492,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Thehonorabl e member for Macquarie is thirsting for information. Will he read the Bill 1 For when he was speaking just now it seemed to me that he did not know quite so much about it as he might have done. There is no provision for a guarantee, but there ought to be.",65
493,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,The honourable member said there was a guarantee.,65
494,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I did not say anything of the kind. I said that the effect of compelling publie servants to join an approved assurance company argued that we should have behind that company a guarantee. If the Government are going to approve of a company, tliey ought also to guarantee the public servant-wh o on the faith of their approval joins the companythat it shall pay in due course. There is no getting away from the logical position-at least, I tlunk not. What is at the back of private assurance companies 1 At the best it is the credit of a section of a community. However sound they may be, the only thing at the back of tliem is the credit, of a section of the community. What will be at the back of this scheme if it is carried out 1 The whole community. Does any one mean to tell me that that can be less sound, less stable, less of a permanent guarantee to the public servant than the credit of ' a portion of the community. The whole credit of this vast continent is pledged to repayment in the event of the Government taking up . the scheme and carrying it out. Therefore it is absurd for any one to suggest that it miglit not be popular, that public servants might be compelled to go in against tlieir will, when, as a matter of fact, they could not have. a liigher or better guarantee. Whatever may be the fate of this amendment I hope that the honourable member for Bourke will persevere. I am quite sure that he ison the right track, that State assurance is coming along, and that instead of borrowing money privately and paying interest, the community will see the sense of lending the money to itself.",65
495,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I cannot say that I have not been interested in the debate, for it has been most interesting. I quite disagree with the assertion that there would be any difficulty, or that tliere would be any loss, in reference to this proposal. It is quite different of course from bringing in a proposal to deal with general assurance. I .admit that if in New Soutli Wales the actuarial reports had given a proper basis for what approaches the present proposal, the Superannuation Fund would not be so insolvent as it is. I admit that there is nothing to prevent this thing from being done, but it is a very large question, which I do not wish to see decided in a hurried manner, either in a very small committee or after a short debate. If we postpone the consideration of this part of the Bill after the interesting debate which we have had, and which has thrown considerable light on the question, it will give us a little more time to consider what is the best course to take. .My own feeling, up to the present time, has been strongly in favour of the provisions of the Bill, but I am quite prepared to consider fairly this proposal, and therefore I shall ask for a postponement of Part IV . until we deal with the other parts of the Bill. I have applied to various assurance companies for information regarding this matter, but I have not had any .replies. I want to have that information before I deal with the question in reply to alreadytlie arguments which have been used too . . night. I think I am justified in asking a postponement, because the debate on this amendment has taken a turn which I was scarcely prepared for it to take. I not speaking in any hostile spirit to the honourable member for Bourke. I want to for, deal ""fairly with the whole question, and therefore I move-That clauses 44 to 49 be postponed. Mr HUME COOK .(Bourke) - The Minister for Home Affairs was good to intimate to me privately a moment ago that he intended to take this course, and during the few moments that have been such provision being made. available to me I have asked several who have taken a prominent part in the bate what tlieir view is, and whether should not agree to the request. We have dealt agreed that the consideration of the matter ought to be postponed in view of the turn which the debate has taken. The proposal can lose nothing at all by being fully diswith cussed. We think it may very well stand on its merits. We have no desire to take a civil servants. snatch vote or to do anything to embarrass the Government, or to make it appear we were desirous of forcing the issue. I is only fair that we should agree that the Government should have a chance to get the information they can. further consideration we may arrive at what I trust will be a wise decision. Under these circumstances, I have no opposition to offer to the postponement of the clause ; and am glad to say that I speak for a number those who are deeply interested i amendment.  to draw the Minister's attention to what seems to me incorrect in theproposals as assurance. There is not sufficient provision made for 'the case of an officer leaving children, or a. widow who would perhaps have to earn her living and support her children. I think it would be well if Minister could take the matter into his purview and see whether some such provision as the words I have here written down may be acceptable in place of sub-clauses (Â«) (6) of clause 44(a) The payment to him on his retirement from the service on attaining the prescribed or on account of illness or infirmity, or to his legal representatives, such a sum as may be scribed. That will provide for what is in the Bill Or, alternately, for the payment to the oflicer, . . or to his widow* or children, in place of such sum for such annuities as may be prescribed. So that there may be an opportunity of providing fpr those cases which are sometimes am the most distressing of any where the dependents left are not at all properly provided and it is desirable that some such provision should be made. I only throw it out as a suggestion for consideration by the Minister.",65
496,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I am glad that enough the honourable member for Tasmania or two has referred to this matter, because I have been strongly in favour of some If the of those amendment of the honourable member defor Bourke is carried when it comes on we again, o* course this matter will not be with j but, if it is not carried, I intend either to agree to the proposal of the honourable member for Tasmania, or to make a proposal which will coincide very much it, because I think it is a wise thing to provide for those who may be left by",66
497,Mr HARPER,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, There is that another element which the Minister for t Home Affairs ought to take into account and get information about. At the present timeall civil servants have to be guaranteed by Perhaps on various guarantee associations. I think that business could be very profitably combined with the assurance clauses in this Bill. Therefore I suggest that we should I have a guarantee fund to which public of servants would contribute instead of paying n the into outside guarantee societies.,66

499,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"South Australia). - I do not desire to intervene with-any idea to of blocking debate at this stage, or to prevent the Minister from postponing these any clauses until we have had more time to consider them. I am glad to see that he has recognised the importance of getting the further information, and before the clauses are again considered I would ask him to get from some department, or from an outside source, some actuarial information and that will enable us to understand, whether, in the case of the Government starting an assurance fund, they will be able to assure age, on the same terms as ordinary mutual comprepanies, and what liability the Commonwealth will incur in regard to its servants. It is all very well to point to companies like the A.M.P. and a few others in Australia, which, with the whole continent to deal witli, have succeeded in making very fair profits for their assurers, who are all interested in them. But will the Government, in starting an assurance fund to deal with the few hundred or few thousand servants as the case may be, be in a position from the actuarial stand-point to give the same advantages as to premiums as do any of those large companies-no t proprietary companies established to make money for directors and bonuses for shareholders-bu t mutual companies which have been established throughout Australia, and which have attained to a splendid position ? Before the committee agrees to introduce into the Bill provisions which will enable the Government to become assurers of civil, servants, I think that some actuarial expert knowledge on the subject should be obtained and given to the House. I think it is important we should be in that position. On a casual glance I am afraid we should be involving the Commonwealth in perhaps immense liability, and I ask the Minister to inquire very closely into the matter and give us the fullest possible information.",66

501,Mr TUD OB,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I believe that Victoria at the present time there are . tain transferred officers to whom credit will not be given for having passed the clerical examination, but who, if they had remained in the State of Victoria, would have credited with having passed that examinapension tion. ' If the position of these officers satisfactory under the Commonwealth, they the right to go back to the State service, and resume the positions they were in when they left ?",67
502,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I think there is something in the statement by the honourable member, and the statement has, I believe been made before. If the honourable member will allow the clause to pass, I will inquire into the matter. If I find any occasion to doubt that these men will retain all the rights that they have or should have at the present time in consequence of anything done by the Public Service Board, I shall have an amendment drafted to meet the case.  That the following new sub-clause be added to the clause:(2) In all cases of the transference of an officer from the public service of the Commonwealth to whom or to whose dependants under the laws of his State there would on his retirement from its public service or as the case may be upon his deatli become payable any pension retiring allowance or allowance tei dependents the amount of such pension retiring allowance ov allowance to dependents shall be payable by the Commonwealth ; but no appointment ol such an officer to the public service of the Commonwealth shall be made until the Governor in Council of his State shall have agreed to pay to the Commonwealth a part of such amount to be calculated on the proportion which his term of with the State bears to the whole term of service, aud for the purpose of the calculation his salary shall be taken to be that paid to him by the State at the time of the transfer. Provided that such an appointment may be made if the officer concerned agrees to forego the proportion of such amount which would in comwith the foregoing provisions be payable has become transferred by the State. in the If honourable members will turn to section 84 of the Constitution Act they will see of that provision is there made in regard to the transfer of officers. There is very ful l provision with regard to the transfer of officers rights who are in transferred departments, such as at the the post-office and the Defence department, State which have already been taken over by the with Commonwealth. All that is necessary both to secure those officers their rights and to provide for the apportionment of the payi n ment of any retiring allowances is there cerprovided. But when section S4 goes on to deal with officers who are not in transferred departments, but who are taken from the civil service of any State with any rights been to pension, it does not say how the is to be apportioned between the is not State, who is the former emploj'er, and the have Commonwealth, who is the new employer. To get over the difficulty, I prepared the sub-clause which I have just read, and .which in effecb enacts that the rights of all oflieers taken over shall be preserved as the clause provides; but that their pensions shall be apportioned between the Commonwealth and the State in every instance, in the same way as the Constitution already provides in regard to transferred officers in transferred departments.",67
503,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Is the new improve the position of the oflieers1 Mr DEAKIN; The oflicer is absolutely safe in any case.,68
504,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Then this is to protect the CommonAvealth ?,68
505,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes , against the State.  arrangement as to pensions shall not be in doubt between the State and the CommonAvealth. I beheve that in regard to this neAv sub-clause there is some feeling that it exhibits over caution, but if that is the only objection, I think Ave had better be a little over cautious than leaA'e it open, even in a small number of cases, for the question to arise between the State and the CommonAvealth as to AVIIO is to pay.",68
506,Mr MCCAY,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,Does the honourable member think the Commonwealth Would take officers over unless it Avas knoAvn who had to pay the pensions ? .  is that whoeA^er administers the Public Service A ct shall have a proArision there shoAving clearly the understanding as to IIOAV pensions are to be provided.,68
507,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I haA'e been indebted on a number of occasions to the honourable member for calling attention to matters in which the drafting of the measure may be improved. This is another instance in which, if we were required to deal with a question for the first time, I should not desire to see it stated more clearly than the honourable member has stated it . But, after all, we have the reply which the honourable membei eAridently expects, that this proposition is not necessary, and can be justified only by a desire for abundant caution. But there is something more to consider. If, as the honourable member said, he has a doubt Avhether the Constitution provides for the payment by the State of that portion of the' pension vvhich Would represent the officers' State service-if he has any doubt as to Avhether that is enforced by the Constitution, IIOAV will he strengthen our position by this proposal ?  the officer-it is voluntary.",68
508,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,".Then that puts the matter on the ordinary and familiar ground of a voluntary contract on both sides, and the honourable member has done service in calling attention to the possible necessity for sub-clause to an arrangement. I admit that, although transferred from my point of A iew, and in my opinion, r the addition is unnecessary. The matter is plain as it stands, and the obligation rests '. undoubtedly on the State. Having, after the honourable member's amendment was tabled, carefullyreconsidered the position, I am still of the same mind as I Avas when I originally spoke, and when he kindly called attention to this possible interpretation. It seems to me that, although the Avords in section 8 i of the Constitution Act in regard to State obligations are not repeated when officers are taken over by themselves and not with tlieir Avhole department, yet the intention of the section is clear. I do not think we can add anything to the clause. I do not think we hav e pOAver to r add anything by a provision which Avill be binding on the State in this regard. The honourable member's proposal might serve the purpose of still further enforcing on the Executive the necessity of making some such arrangement, and he has served that purpose by moving the amendment and calling attention to the matter in the way he has done.",68
509,Mr HUME COOK,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," Several of the civil servants AVIIO have been transferred from the State service to the Commonwealth anticipate that they may get some increase in their salaries in the service of the Commonwealth. The question agitating their minds is-on what basis will their pensions be paid; Will it be on the increased rate of wages paid in the service of the Commonwealth, or on the rate they Avere receiving Avhen transferred to the Commonwealth ? If pensions are to be paid on the increased rate, I would like to ask, for my OAvn information, who makes good the difference, the CommonAvealth or the State 1",68
510,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"If the honourable member Avill look at the Constitution A ct he will see that there is not the slightest ground for apprehension. The Constitution plainly says that any such officer shall be entitled to the pension or retiring aUowance which Would be permitted by the laAv of the State if his services.with the Commonwealth were a continuation of. his.services.with the State. No words oould possibly be plainer than these. The pension in the case of Victoria, for instance, will be on the salaries the officers were receiving in their last three years in tlieservice of - the Commonwealth.",68
511,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Northern Melbourne) The new sub-clause proposed by the honourable and learned member for Tasmania, Mr, Piesse, simply means that if a man were, for instance, transferred from the Lands department of Victoria or Tasmania to the service of the Commonwealth, it is made clear that the State is to .pay his .pension and not the Commonwealth.  the pension.",69
512,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"The honourable and learned member admitted that the point is clear in regard to officers of transferred departments, but he thinks it is not clear in the Constitution with regard to au officer whose department is not transferred. I have looked at the thing very closely and I think it would be a mistake to accept this amendment. The Attorney-General has the right view of section 84, namely, that the obligation will remain with the State and will not go to the Commonwealth. But I say also that if the obligation .is not placed by the Constitution on the State, the Commonwealth cannot impose that obligation.  do that; the amendment merely says that we shall not take the officers unless we make the arrangement.",69

514,Mr HIGGINS,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But if the honorablcand learned member'signifies the conditions, he prohibits - conditionally,-and I do - not see we have the power to restrain by an Act not only the present Government, but future Governments from doing that which the Constitution says .they can do.",69
515,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I find that in the departments transferred to the Commonwealth there are some young men who 'have passed the necessary examination entitling them to appointment in the clerical division of the State service, but. [113] who have not yet been .appointed to that division. Will these men ;be .entitled to receive appointments in the clerical division of the Commonwealth service without undergoing .a fresh examination?",69
516,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"Yes .  would like to direct the attention of the Attorney-General to this particular clause in its relation to clause-29, the consideration of which has been postponed. If it is understood that the definition in clause 29 is to be broadened, then - this clause - will also need to be. altered. .Lost night I moved an amendment having reference to the railway servico .",69
517,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"That will be consequential, certainly.",69
518,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I wish to draw the Attorney-. General's attention to an anomaly which, I am afraid, will give rise to a great deal of heart-burning in the service, but for which I do uot quite see. a remedy. The clause pro- vides that an officer transferred from the service of a State shall have his existing and accruing rights preserved to him. In New South Wales we have-a certain arrangement by which an officer pays so much - per annum to attain .a certain right at - the end of his,service. In Victoria -.the same right, is Tat tained without any payment at all. ' Mr DEAKIN - Not since' 1880 in Victoria.. - Sir WILLIAM - MCMILLAN - In one. case there is a .scale on a -3 per cent, basis, while.in another it is 4.per oent. It . seems to me that it might'be right and generous on the part of the - Commonwealth to consider - whether some scheme could not be worked out by which this disparity .should cease' to exist - I think it would make the public service more .easy : and prevent much heartburning df a scheme, were .adopted by which, where the - burden is. at present heavier, it might - be reduced toon average.",69
519,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I understand that under the New South Wales law certain offioers. pay 4. per cent, towards a superannuation fund. In Victoria no .such..principle, obtains, because .under the existing.law. the .State no longer provides - for retiring .allowances. The only public servants in Victoria who are entitled to retiring .aUowances or pensions are those who joined the service before 1880. Of course, some of these officers remain .although more than twenty years have elapsed. If any of them have been transferred to the Commonwealth they may be working side by side''with others - whose existing and accruing rights will be preserved to them only on the condition that they pay their 4 per cent. Since 1880 the ""Victorian Government have made arrangements for the life insurance of members of the civil service. The employees themselves pay towards the life insurance.",69
520,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND, scale ?,70
521,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"I do not know that. To the best insurance companies tliey probably pay 4 per cent., but to others they may pay more. All our Victorian.officers since 1880 are providing for their own future. It will only be in connection with the long sendee men, who joined the service before 1880, that the discrepancy which the honourable member for Wentworth has spoken of, will arise. But even that is one of the discrepancies which it may bc possible for the commissioner in the course of time, when he has a view of the circumstances of .all the States, to harmonize.",70
522,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," I would ask the Attorney-General clause provides merely for transferred officers 1 Assuming that officers had been in the public service of the States perhaps for eight or nine years, and were not entitled to a pension until they had been there ten years, would any compensation be given to them if they were not transferred to the Commonwealth, but were dismissed from the service of the Government? any compensation whatever be given to them for loss of office? In the event of .'any public servant not being will the Government consider the advisa-bility of giving him some compensation for Joss of office 1",70
523,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND," That is provided for. If the honourable member refers to section 84 of the Constitution Act he will find it is thero provided thatAny sucli officer who is not retained in the service of the Commonwealth shall, unless he is appointed to some other offico of equal emolument in the public service of the State, be entitled to receive from the State any pension, gratuity, or other compensatiou, payable under the law of the State on the abolition of his office.",70
524,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"But I wish to point out that it may happen that there is no compensation provided for undor the State law. Will the Government regard the length of service that has been devoted to the State, and take the matter of compensation into consideration irrespective of what the law may be upon the subject? Otherwise, I believe that in some cases officers would receive no compensation, even although they had been in the State service for several years. These cases I should like to be considered by the Commonwealth.",70
525,Mr DEAKIN,COMMERCIAL AGENCIES AND,"So far I have not heard On what of any such case as the honourable member suggests liaving occurred, nor do I think it is likely to occur. If it does it is one of those matters which will naturally be taken into consideration by the Government, with a view to some proposition being laid before the House. The House could, by an act of grace, grant any recognition, that it thought fit, under such circumstances. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 52 agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.10 p.m. if this Would transferred,",70
