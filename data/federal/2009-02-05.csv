3,Mr SNOWDON,CONDOLENCES,"Lingiari-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (10.01 am)- Mr Speaker, unfortunately I was unable to participate in the debate in the chamber before the message was sent back to us, so, if you do not mind, I will just take a few moments to reflect again on the service of Private Greg Sher. Allow me the opportunity to pay my respects for his sad loss and to make some observations. Many fine words have been spoken about this wonderful man, who died honourably and courageously on behalf of his country. We know that Private Sher was 30 when he was tragically killed on the evening of 4 uary this year in a rocket attack in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan. On 8 January, I had the honour of attending a ramp ceremony in the Middle East along with the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, and the then Commander of Joint Task Force 633, Major General Michael Hindmarsh, as Greg Sher was farewelled from the Middle East by Australian troops. Earlier, a ceremony had been held in Tarin Kowt, in the biting cold of the Afghanistan winter. Australian personnel and their coalition allies stood unwavering as they farewelled Private Sher. That was also the case at the ramp ceremony which I attended in the Middle East. In a very simple yet very moving ceremony, troops from Australia, the United States and Japan formed a guard of honour for Private Sher as his casket was placed on the RAAF C17 to be carried home on his final journey. It was a simple but moving ceremony, and it showed the great respect that his comrades had for him. We have seen evidence of that respect in the contributions which have been made about him since that dreadful day on which he lost his life. You have heard about his family, the love and respect that he had from his parents, Yvonne and Felix, his two brothers, Barry and Steve, and his partner, Karen. But his broader family, the Defence family, also held him in great love and respect. And, with his death, other we remember other fallen Australian soldiers, his Defence Force brothers. The tributes following this sad occasion are truly a great testament to the deep respect in which he was held by those who knew him. Air Chief Marshal Houston has described him as an experienced professional and a great team member whose ‘actions and service exemplified the spirit and values of the Australian Army'. Private Sher was described by the Chief of Army as ‘a dedicated, Janpassionate and well-respected soldier, who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving our nation'. Private Sher has also been described by the Special Operations Commander Australia, Major General Tim MCOwan, as ‘brave, loyal and determined'. In the week following Private Sher's death and his burial ceremony here in Australia, I visited Afghanistan along with the Chief of the Defence Force and General Hindmarsh, and I had the privilege of witnessing first hand the courage and commitment of the many deployed Australian Defence Force personnel. Furthermore, I had the great honour to meet with Private Sher's unit and hear the personal accounts of Greg's passion, enthusiasm and dedication to service and of the great loss that was felt by his comrades as a result of his death. It is clear that this young man, although paying the ultimate sacrifice, has left many, many fond memories and is held in the highest regard by all of those who knew him. This visit to Afghanistan reinforced for me the great challenges that our personnel are facing, the dangers that they confront on a daily and hourly basis and the professionalism and dedication to service demonstrated by all those I had the opportunity to meet. As the Minister for Defence said in his contribution, we have an absolute obligation to continue our support, to make sure that we assist as far as we possibly can with working towards a secure future for the people of Afghanistan so that those servicemen who have lost their lives serving this great nation of ours will not have done so in vain. I would like to acknowledge the loyal support of the families of deployed Australian Defence Force personnel. When you have the opportunity to go and mix and meet with Defence Force families of those who are deployed, it is quite moving to get an understanding of the anxiousness and the concern that family members have for their partners, husbands, wives, sons and daughters who may be deployed in overseas operations on behalf of our country. Private Greg Sher will be sadly missed by those who loved him here in Australia and also by his mates, particularly those with whom he served.",17

7,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I will summarise the amendments that have Sebeen agreed to by the Senate and that are now under consideration in the House. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 is a very important piece of legislation. It goes to the way in which job seekers will be dealt with under the compliance regime. The government has been concerned to ensure that the compliance arrangements for job seekers were effective but also fair. We introduced the bill last year and amendments were proposed. The bill successfully passed the House and there was debate on amendments in the Senate yesterday. There were a series of amendments and the government considered them in turn. We would like to put on the record our appreciation for the constructive way in which Senator Siewert, on behalf of the Greens, and Senator Xenophon discussed these particular matters with us. I believe that some of the amendments have improved the bill and that others were not necessary, but I did not have any particular objections. I will now turn to the amendments and go through them for the benefit of the House. Amendments that were passed by the Senate include amendments (1), (3), (4) and (6). These amendments allow Centrelink, as the final decision maker, to have discretion to apply penalties. Amendments (2) and (5) provide for the deduction of a penalty amount in the period immediately after the penalty is incurred, allowing sufficient time for Centrelink to apply penalties consistently. There was a concern that there would be difficulties administratively without these amendments, and we accepted the proposal put. Amendment (7) includes the CCA in legislation rather than in a legislative instrument, without affecting the substance of the CCA. We believe that this amendment, whilst not entirely necessary, certainly does not affect the integrity or intention of the bill that was proposed by the government, and therefore we accepted it and it is now here for us to consider. Amendments (8) to (13) go to ensuring that job seekers who are in severe financial hardship are not adversely affected by any administrative delays. I think these amendments were well considered. I think they will lead to it being less likely that an unemployed person receiving income support will find themselves adversely affected unnecessarily. We accepted the reasoning of the mover of those amendments and acceded to them. The final amendment, that was accepted, which was moved by Senator Xenophon, establishes an independent review to consider the impact of the compliance regime after 12 months. This was something that we had discussions about with Senator Xenophon and Greens Senator Siewert. Those two senators reached an agreement themselves, we accepted that there would be an independent review and the terms of reference were agreed to. I would also like to place on the record another commitment that the government undertook in discussions with Senator Xenophon, and that was to change the no show, no pay incidences within six months from a proposed six occasions to three occasions. There are a number of incidences or breaches in the no show, no pay approach that would trigger a comprehensive compliance assessment. We believe that the argument that Senator Xenophon put-that reducing the number would provide earlier intervention for those job seekers who might be most at risk-was a compelling argument. We also accept that, if there were people wilfully and persistently breaching, this undertaking by the government would allow for a more effective compliance arrangement. For that reason, we supported that change to the compliance regime proposed. That change will take place by way of legislative instrument. I thank Senator Siewert of the Greens and Senator Xenophon for the constructive discussion that we had with them in improving the operation of the bill. I also thank Senator Fielding for his support. The opposition, which of course are on the record as opposing the bill, moved some substantial amendments to it in this place before Christmas last year, and indeed we divided on them. The amendments that were proposed by the opposition yesterday were withdrawn without debate, so the opposition clearly did not want to proceed and debate the amendments that they had proposed and the amendments that they chose to divide on in this House when the matter was last before us. I think that is probably because the constructive discussions between the senators in question and the government left them with no answer. More importantly, I think the amendments that were proposed by the opposition were not really seeking to improve the workings of the compliance arrangement and indeed were not amendments that would have been acceptable to any party other than the opposition. For that reason, those substantive amendments were withdrawn without any consideration at all. These Senate amendments, as I say, are acceptable. This bill is very important for operation of the compliance regime for the many Australians who are on income support. These arrangements will take effect upon the enactment of this bill on 1 July this year.",20
8,Dr SOUTHCOTT,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008, which outlines the compliance regime that will operate for the new employment services which will begin on 1 July this year. The opposition wish to place on record that we believe that these amendments do improve this legislation. The most substantive of the amendments is the one that was moved by Senator Xenophon relating to an independent review of the compliance regime after 12 months. This will begin on or about 1 July 2010 and it will be a useful review to inform the parliament on how the compliance regime is working. Very importantly also, the opposition was concerned that six no show, no pay failures over a six-month period was too many and that it did leave open the possibility that someone could be slipping through the gaps and missing their obligations without any action being taken other than being docked one day's welfare. I welcome the minister's announcement that this will be done through legislative instrument. We believe that this goes a significant way towards improving the bill. A remaining concern that the opposition does have is the treatment of deliberately missing a job interview which is part of someone's obligations. I accept that missing a job interview has been treated differently under different employment service regimes over the last 15 years. Now we are moving towards a system where there will be three no show, no pay failures before a comprethe hensive compliance assessment is triggered. That does capture when someone deliberately misses a job interview, and would be one no show, no pay failure before a comprehensive compliance assessment. Having said that, the number of job seekers who receive a penalty for deliberately missing a job interview is quite small-of the order of about 200 per month in recent times. We know from the updated economic and fiscal outlook that the outlook for jobs will deteriorate quite dramatically over the next 18 months. On the government's own forecast the unemployment rate will reach seven per cent by June 2010. The numbers of Australians out of work will increase by 300,000 by June 2010. This increase will place enormous pressure on Centrelink, on employment service providers and on the job seekers themselves. It is very important for us as a parliament to make sure that we have a compliance regime which is effective but which also gives the strong message that it does not give up on job seekers and that it does make sure that, although the labour market will look quite bleak over the next 18 months, job seekers do remain actively looking for work and do not become discouraged. None of the other amendments passed in the Senate are objectionable-the discretion for Centrelink, the timing of the penalty amount and putting the comprehensive compliance assessment in the legislation. On reflection, the severe financial hardship provisions are a good improvement. One of the weaknesses with the existing bill was that financial case management to deal with people in financial hardship had been dispensed with. In summary, the opposition agrees that these amendments do improve the bill. Having seen these amendments, the opposition will be supporting this bill. Question agreed to.

9,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (10.28 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fit-out of new leased premises for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Sydney, New South Wales. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, proposes to undertake a fit-out of new office accommodation at 100 Market Street in Sydney and to relocate all Sydney staff to these premises. ASIC currently occupies tenancies at 1 Martin Place, 77 Castlereagh Street and 55 Market Street. The lease for the largest tenancy at Martin Place expires in June 2010. The proposed fitout is for 15,400 square metres over five contiguous floors at 100 Market Street. This will provide a single tenancy for all current and projected Sydney staff and will result in increased operational effectiveness. The fitout will result in a flexible, efficient, collaborative and contemporary work environment First Reading which reflects current industry standards and accords with ASIC's policies in relation to security of staff and information and occupational health and safety. The estimated cost of the integrated fit-out is $30.8 million plus GST, including $2.5 million for security and $4.3 million for IT and communications infrastructure. The costs will be offset by a substantial lessor First Reading contribution to fit-out negotiated as part of the new lease. Subject to parliamentary approval, the planned integrated fit-out will maximise efficiencies in cost and time and will allow the fit-out works to commence in June 2009. This will in turn allow ASIC to take occupation before the lease expires at 1 Martin Place in June 2010. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 December 2008, on motion by Mr MCClelland: That this bill be now read a second time.",23
10,Ms LEY,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008. This bill seeks to amend part 3 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. Part 3 of the act provides for foreign material obtained as a result of a mutual assistance request to be adduced in evidence in criminal and related civil proceedings in Australian courts. This material is most important in fraud and money-laundering cases. The act applies to proceedings in states and territories as well as Commonwealth courts. However, these amendments are initially intended only to apply to Commonwealth proceedings. Provision exists for the application of the amendments to state and territory courts by regulation. Some problems have been experienced adducing foreign business records in evidence in state and territory courts. The problems arise because business records must comply with the rules of evidence of the states and territories, some of the requirements of which are technical. The amendments provide that business records obtained through mutual assistance will be presumed to be admissible unless the court is satisfied that the records are not reliable or probative or that they are privileged. In addition, there are measures to provide for testimony to be admitted where the law in the country of its origin does not require such evidence to be given on oath or affirmation or under caution, provided that there is an obligation to tell the truth. These amendments preserve the court's discretion to refuse to admit evidence where it is in the interests of justice to The use of foreign business records and other evidence is often a vital component of transnational money-laundering and fraud cases. Those cases should not be jeopardised by inconsistencies between Australian jurisdictions as to how or whether that evidence is received by a court. This bill has the support of the opposition.",23
11,Dr KELLY,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (10.32 am)-I rise to support the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008, which was introduced by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert MCClelland, in the last session. This bill appears at first glance to be rather technical but it is in fact a very important piece of legislation. It is important because it will enable the Taxation Office and the government to see that our taxation laws are fairly and efficiently executed and that all Australians pay their fair share of the tax burdenincreasingly important in these circumstances that we face at the present time. At a time when many Australians are facing the possibility of hardship as a result of the global economic downturn, it is important that everyone has confidence in the fairness and integrity of our taxation system. Nobody likes paying taxes, but the Australian community understand why we need a taxation system and they have confidence in the way our tax system is administered. That is why Australians are among the world's most conscientious taxpayers. Support for the taxation system will, however, rapidly erode if taxpayers become convinced that some individuals are able to dodge their responsibilities. Ordinary Australians will soon ask why they should pay their taxes when a handful of wealthy individuals are able to avoid paying theirs. This bill will make the task of ensuring fairness in our taxation system easier. It will do so. do so by enabling the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to gain access more easily to business records and other forms of evidence from foreign countries, thus making easier and quicker the prosecution of those who have sought to avoid paying their fair share of taxation. Although this bill applies only to the Commonwealth, the Attorney expects to have discussions with his state and territory counterparts to examine the extension of its terms by way of regulation to state and territory proceedings as well. The use of evidence gained from foreign countries in Australian courts is governed by two pieces of legislation, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. These acts enable the Commonwealth Attorney-General to request certain types of information from foreign countries for use as evidence in Australian court proceedings. But, in the years since these acts were passed, certain limitations in their scope and application have become apparent, particularly in relation to taxation cases, which can be very complex and which frequently require extensive documentation. This bill seeks to remedy these deficiencies. It is particularly important that these ciencies be remedied now, because the Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police are currently engaged in Australia's largest ever campaign to crack down on tax evasion, known as Operation Wickenby. This campaign began in 2004 and is still ongoing. It is targeting the minority of wealthy individuals who have sought to avoid or evade their tax responsibilities. By the end of 2008, Operation Wickenby had resulted in the launching of 23 criminal investigations involving 249 completed tax audits. As a result of these investigations, 28 people have been charged on indictable offences and more than $200 million in tax liabilities has been discovered. Nearly $150 million in unpaid tax has been collected. Operation Wickenby is part of the international campaign to stamp out tax evasion and money-laundering through the use of various bogus offshore investment schemes. One of the largest of these is based in the Channel Islands, a well-known tax haven. Recently  Figueiredo, head of the Swiss tax haven firm Strachans and one of the alleged principals in the offshore tax schemes used by a number of prominent and wealthy Australians. Australian authorities want to extradite Mr de Figueiredo to face charges of tax fraud. It is important to note in passing that Operation Wickenby was begun under the previous government, presumably with the support of all the members of the Howard cabinet. It is not an ideologically motivated attack on the wealthy; it is an effort to enforce the existing tax law and to ensure that all Australians, wealthy or otherwise, pay their fair share of tax. The Commonwealth DPP has advised the government that the current provisions of the Foreign Evidence Act are inadequate for the purpose of gathering the evidence from overdefiseas which is necessary for the successful prosecution of a number of cases arising from Operation Wickenby. Most importantly, the current act makes it difficult to gain access to foreign business records, which are frequently the central pieces of evidence in cases where tax has been evaded through the transfer of money to other countries or where money has been earned through business activity in another country. If this bill is not passed in a timely manner, there is a risk that some of these cases will be put at risk. I am sure that it is an outcome that no-one in this House would desire. To make it clear that the terms of the Foreign Evidence Act apply to foreign business records, this bill amends part 3 of the act to ensure that foreign business records may be made available to Australian authorities unless they are found by a court to be unreliable or privileged. The bill also creates a presumption that such records meet the requirements for admission as evidence to Australian courts unless evidence to the contrary is produced. In other words, where a judge, magistrate or other officer in a foreign country has certified that testimony was given in accordance with the law of that country, the responsibility for proving otherwise will rest with those wishing to challenge this rather than with the Australian authorities. This will make it much easier for Australian authorities to obtain such records and to use the evidence contained in them to prosecute individuals who have evaded their tax responsibilities. This does not mean that business records obtained from overseas will be automatically admitted as evidence in Australian courts. The courts will retain their current discretion to refuse to admit such evidence at the application of a party to the case. In fact, this bill gives the courts greater flexibility in determining the use to which such material may be put. This bill expands the scope for retaining such material, not the scope for its use as evidence in Australian courts. To reinforce this point, the bill before us removes the obligation on the Attorney General to certify that material received from a foreign country in response to a request under the Foreign Evidence Act satisfies the requirements for testimony. This question will now be left entirely to the discretion of the courts. The court will have the power to reject such material completely or to limit the use which may be made of any given piece of evidence in the case before it. The bill says: The court may limit the use to be made of foreign material if there is a danger that a particular use of the foreign material might be unfairly prejudicial to a party to the proceeding concerned. So this bill actually increases the safeguards for defendants in such cases. The bill also addresses some other areas in which the current law has been found to be inadequate for the purposes for which it was intended. The bill makes it easier to admit as evidence testimony taken overseas by clarifying the question of whether such testimony must have been given under oath. Some countries do not require evidence to be given under oath or affirmation but instead impose an obligation to tell the truth by some other means. In some cases testimony given in a foreign country in this manner has been challenged on the grounds that it does not comply with Australian procedures for the giving of evidence, even though the testimony was given in conformity with the law of the country in which it was given. This bill provides that testimony will be admissible if it was given under an obligation to tell the truth that complied with the law of the country in which it was given. The admissibility of such evidence will still be at the discretion of the court but it will no longer be deemed to be inadmissible merely because it was not taken under oath. The bill also amends the Foreign Evidence Act to broaden the definition of ‘testimony' so as to take into account the rapid changes in technology which have occurred since the act was passed in 1994. Where the act says ‘audio or video tape' it will now say ‘a tape, disk or other device from which sounds or images are capable of being reproduced'. This is a sensible provision which reduces the possibility of relevant evidence being ruled inadmissible on the grounds that it was recorded on a medium which did not exist in 1994, such as a mobile phone text message or a posting on a website. Tax evasion is a serious criminal offence. Not only does it deprive the Commonwealth of revenue needed for the many vital functions carried out by the federal and state governments, such as national defence, the payment of pensions and benefits, and support to our health and education systems; it also undermines confidence in the integrity of our taxation system thus encouraging other people to also evade their tax responsibilities. We all know of countries where there is no social consensus about the payment of tax, where most people feel that it is legitimate to avoid and evade paying tax or where corruption enables people, particularly wealthy and powerful people, to avoid taxation altogether. This is the path to lawlessness and social breakdown. Everybody dislikes paying tax and that is why it is all the more remarkable that most Australians are conscientious about meeting their tax obligations. They obey the law because they know their taxes are being spent on important and necessary programs and because they have confidence that the tax system is being administered fairly and honestly. That is why cracking down on the small minority of tax evaders is so important. Campaigns like Operation Wickenby are not vendettas against the wealthy. They are a necessary part of maintaining public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the tax system. If ordinary Australians-people like the wage earners, farmers and small business operators of Eden-Monaro-whose hard work has built the prosperity we now enjoy, see wealthy lawyers, celebrities and company executives avoiding tax with impunity, they will quite reasonably ask: ‘why should I pay my tax or obey the law in other areas if the law is not being enforced against these people?' This is all the more important as we face the current difficult economic circumstances in which many people face the possibility of losing their jobs, their investments and even their homes. At such times people are quite rightly angry when they see a handful of wealthy individuals enriching themselves by evading their tax responsibilities. That is why it is the responsibility of this parliament to see that the conscientious and diligent officers of the ATO, the AFP and the Office of the DPP do not have unnecessary obstacles put in their way as they investigate and prosecute such individuals. Where legislation is inadequate or out of date, it is our job to see that it is strengthened and brought up to date in a way which makes it easier for these agencies to do their job while, of course, safeguarding the right of defendants to argue their innocence before the courts. That is what this bill does, and I congratulate the Attorney for bringing it forward. It will also complete another vital aspect of the sound regulatory regime that exists in this country which has put us in a much better position in terms of the global financial situation. Therefore, I urge both this House and the Senate to pass this bill without delay.",24
12,Mr SIMPKINS,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008. This bill intends to amend part 3 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994, which is the part that relates to foreign material obtained by a request for mutual assistance to be put forward as evidence in legal proceedings in our courts here in Australia-whether in criminal or civil proceedings. It is understood that there have been problems in using such overseas information because of the need for foreign business records to comply with the rules of evidence in the states and territories. Further, this material has been even more important in money laundering and fraud cases. I will take that point up a little later. This bill will apply to Commonwealth proceedings not only in Commonwealth courts but also in the courts of the states and territories. This bill will establish the presumption of admissibility of information obtained through that mutual assistance, unless the court determines that the records are unreliable or privileged. These are the main aspects of this bill and the amendments that I wish to cover. It is true that in this globalised world this country will continue to face the threats of white-collar crime, fraud and money laundering. It is therefore important that measures such as these are progressed, and they have my full support. It is, however, appropriate to also make mention of the previous important legislation that has helped address these specific problems in recent years. These acts form the framework of legislation to fight money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Firstly, I would like to mention the very important Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988, the FTR Act, which was designed to ensure the reporting of specific transactions of $10,000 or more, the retention of specific documents and the identificatheir tion and knowledge of customers. That act is, of course, administered by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, which was established under the FTR Act as Australia's anti-moneylaundering regulator and specialist financial intelligence unit. The FTR Act covered the cash dealers, including the banks, down to securities dealers and even TABs and cash carriers. The FTR Act has been supplemented by the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, which was another significant regulatory reform by the previous government. That act was initiated to help enable Australia's financial sector to maintain international business relationships, to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorism financing by meeting the needs of law enforcement agencies for targeted information about possible criminal activity and to bring Australia into line with internawill tional standards. Moving beyond the FTR Act, the AML/CTF Act now covers the financial sector, gambling sector, bullion dealis ers and other professionals or businesses, now known as reporting entities. Given the increased requirements, including costs, and regulations, the act was designed to be implemented in stages, with up to 24 months being provided to achieve full implementation of the act, which has now occurred. The obligations that came with the AML/CTF Act included customer identification and verification of identity, recordkeeping and establishing and maintaining the whole program. It also included ongoing customer due diligence and reporting, particularly of suspicious matters, threshold transactions and international funds transfer instructions. The AML/CTF Act imposed a risk based approach to regulation. Reporting entities are now determining the way in which they meet their obligations based on assessment of the risk of whether providing a designated service to a customer may facilitate money laundering or terrorism financing. AUSTRAC has continued to operate under that act in its role as the nation's financial intelligence unit. One of the great regulatory improvements imposed in the AML/CTF Act was to expand AUSTRAC's role as the national AML/CTF regulator with supervisory, monitoring and enforcement functions over a diverse range of business sectors. With these previous acts and with this bill, the question is: what are they designed to deal with? I would now like to speak about one aspect of that-that is, combating money laundering. It is generally considered that there are three stages of money laundering. The first stage is called placement. This is where funds that are derived from illegal activities are actually moved to a more convenient place or into a different form that arouse less suspicion from regulators. The funds can be moved into a retail economy or into a financial institution, whether it a traditional or untraditional kind. The second stage is layering, and this is where the funds are moved in via complex financial transactions. This is done to remove clarity and obscure and hide the money and its trail. The third stage is where the money is converted into what appears to be legitimate business earnings or proceeds through normal financial transactions. The final issue I will raise is the difference between organised crime money laundering and terrorism money laundering. Some commentators have described how organised crime money laundering is circular in its operation because ultimately organised crime is about greed and using the illegal proceeds for the sole benefit of those responsible. The funds have to come back clean, for the use of those who planned the whole process. Terrorism money laundering is linear in its nature because it is designed to move funds from an origin to a destination to be utilised for terrorist activities. Working off estimated figures from 2001-02, the financial flow of funds into terrorist organisations at that time were significant and therefore capable of financing great harm to innocent people. They demonstrate the need for vigilance in the future. I will quote some of the estimated figures. It is estimated that Al-Qaeda had a cash flow of between $20 and $50 million in that financial year, Hamas had around $10 million and Hezbollah had about $50 million. These huge funds give terrorists great capacity to organise their evil and cowardly campaigns, and we should be and are committed to engage them on this level, as we should on all levels. In both the organised crime and terrorism forms of money laundering, the characteristics of these operations are clearly complex. To combat them we need careful regulation and ongoing reviews of our legislation. It is therefore right and appropriate that this bill be passed, and I support its passage.",27
13,Mr MARLES,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008, which will make it easier to conduct criminal prosecutions in this country which involve the taking and obtaining of evidence in relation to overseas activities. In particular, it will allow for easier prosecution of white-collar crime in Australia where that criminal activity has involved overseas activities. The bill will do this by streamlining the process by which we adduce foreign business records into evidence in a domestic proceeding. Business records are a key part of any white-collar criminal prosecution. They provide a rich source of information in a criminal prosecution and that information is often highly reliable and highly relevant. Currently, the Foreign Evidence Act is inadequate in allowing all relevant foreign business records which exist to be considered as evidence in a prosecution in an Australian court. So this bill will make it easier, principally, for that evidence to be brought before an Australian court to therefore allow for prosecution. Some very significant prosecutions and activities are currently underway, which I will come to in a moment, and this legislation will help provide the basis for all the necessary information being considered in those prosecutions. Clause 24(4) of the proposed bill provides a presumption that foreign business records can be adduced into a proceeding in Australia, unless it is found that those business records are not probative, not reliable or, for some reason, are privileged documents. That is a much wider ambit in terms of considering foreign business records in a domestic criminal prosecution than that which currently exists under the Foreign Evidence Act. The proposed bill will also make it easier to admit testimony obtained overseas, again, in a domestic proceeding. Paragraph 22(1)(aa) of the proposed bill will make it possible to admit into evidence, in a domestic proceeding, testimony which is obtained overseas, provided that it is obtained and received in circumstances where the person a far giving the testimony is doing so under a legal obligation to tell the truth. That may be in cases even where no formal oath is given to that person before the testimony is provided. Indeed, clause 22(3) of the proposed bill provides for a presumption that testimony obtained overseas will be able to be used in a domestic proceeding, unless there is evidence to the contrary-that is, that the testimony was provided under a legal obligation to tell the truth. These two provisions are a significant extension of the ability for a domestic court to consider evidence originating from overseas. So, concurrently with that-in a sense, as a check in relation to that-clause 24A of the proposed bill also provides a much greater discretion to the court in not accepting that evidence. It is, if you like, a check on this new, wider ability to review that evidence. It puts that discretion, obviously, in the hands of the court. So, in a sense, it creates a much greater ability to consider information deriving from overseas but puts the court in the driver's seat as to whether or not to use its discretion to accept it. Of course, that discresion tion is based on whether or not the acceptance of the evidence originating from overseas would unfairly prejudice a party. A number of other minor amendments are contained in this bill which are also important in terms of allowing greater evidence originating from overseas to be considered in an Australian court. There is, for example, in the proposed bill a provision which provides that references to evidence which is a recording by audio or video means be extended to include recordings which are made by more modern means of recording. There is a clarification that the Attorney-General's certification of foreign material is limited to what was originally intended-that is, a certification that the foreign material was obtained in response to a mutual assistance request made under the Foreign Evidence Act. That, of course, is what the act originally intended to provide in terms of the Attorney General's certification. The Foreign Evidence Act currently applies to Commonwealth courts, to state and territory courts, to criminal prosecutions and to related civil proceedings. That said, this amending legislation will only apply, at least initially, to Commonwealth criminal proceedings and related civil proceedings, with a view to it covering state and territory courts in the future, where those state and territories agree to or want this additional ability to obtain overseas evidence and to apply it to proceedings within their jurisdictions. Tax evasion by taking money overseas is a very big deal for this country. Indeed, in terms of its tax receipts, Australia loses billions of dollars as a result of this activity. Operation Wickenby, an operation conducted by the Australian Taxation Office, is indeed the largest tax investigation operation ever undertaken by them. It began four years ago and it is directed exactly at overseas tax evaby Australians. It is estimated, in the next four years, to recover $5.7 billion of Australian government revenue. Indeed, in just the last few weeks there have been extradition proceedings undertaken, pursuant to Operation Wickenby. I mention Operation Wickenby in the context of this bill because Operation Wickenby needs this bill. The provisions which are currently in the Foreign Evidence Act do not provide enough of a basis for having all the information that can possibly be obtained and which is relevant to prosecutions under Operation Wickenby, so it is essential that we pass this bill so as to put the proper legislative basis in place to allow all the relevant information to be obtained so that prosecutions under Operation Wickenby, and indeed all criminal prosecutions and related civil proceedings, can consider all the relevant information available. Labor has always been concerned with white-collar crime. We have always been concerned to make sure that there is the proper legislative basis to ensure that whitecollar criminals can be prosecuted. Indeed, the Foreign Evidence Act itself was initially an initiative of the Keating government back in 1994, implemented at the time by the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, and by the honourable member for Denison, the Minister for Justice at the time, Duncan Kerr. The principles then were as they are now. The Foreign Evidence Act then was put in place to facilitate and streamline the admissibility of evidence originating from overseas in domestic proceedings. Indeed, if one looks at the second reading speech for the original act, which was at that point the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993, it reads as follows: Part 4 of the bill sets out a similar scheme, adapted to meet the specific needs of the Australian Securities Commission in civil proceedings arising from the Corporations Law and the ASC law where the ASC is a litigant. The part will facilitate the admissibility of foreign evidence in such proceedings. The globalisation of capital markets in the past few years has required business regulatory agencies such as the ASC to liaise and offer assistance to each other in carrying out their regulatory functions. This will often result requests by the ASC to foreign agencies for information, testimony and documents where the ASC is involved in civil proceedings. Sixteen years down the track, that process of globalisation has gone forward in leaps and bounds. The world that we now live in and the financial transactions which occur are far more complex now than they were then, and it would also be right to say that the activities of white-collar criminals have become increasingly canny and increasingly complex. It is essential, then, that we have a legislative regime which keeps up with this changing world. The Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is a bill which will do just that: make sure that the Foreign Evidence Act keeps up with the world around it.",29
14,Mr DREYFUS,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"The amendments in the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 facilitate the process of adducing business records held overseas as evidence in Australian courts. By changing the Foreign Evidence Act, they will assist in the prosecution of persons who, by hiding money in the world's shadowy places, seek to defraud the Commonwealth. They will add to the federal government's arsenal against tax evasion, money laundering and organised crime. The amendments, by changing or making more simple the receipt of foreign business records by Australian courts, will ensure that Australia's financial intelligence network-which includes the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions-can continue to vigorously pursue investigations into tax fraud both here and overseas. Under the amendments, as long as the requirements of division 3 are met, foreign material relating to business records will be admissible in Australian courts. The court would not be required to consider any other rules of eviin dence under Commonwealth, state or territory law in relation to that material. It is instructive to consider the nature of business records and why it is that, for many years, there have been continuing attempts to make the receipt of business records in evidence in court proceedings a more simple procedure. The explanatory memorandum for this legislation notes: Business records are generally considered an accurate and reliable form of evidence. That has certainly been the view of Australian lawyers and judges for many years, and since the middle of last century there have been reforms made to Australian rules of evidence dealing with the receipt of Australian business records in courts, all of which have been designed to get over the problem that business records might otherwise have been thought to be hearsay, to have been excluded from evidence and not to be admissible in evidence. There are often problems with using business records to establish the identity of the particular record keeper who made the record. There are often problems in establishing the precise provenance of the business records, and thus there might quite often be either a difficulty or an impossibility in having someone directly connected with the making of the business record come before the court to say that the record in question is authentic, proving the document in the way in which other documents are required to be proved in court. Recognising the usefulness of business records, there have been continual amendments to state evidence acts. Indeed, the Australian Law Reform Commission, in its very large recent review of the Commonwealth Evidence Act-which has also been adopted as a model law in New South Wales-has made some suggestions as to how the business records provisions as they appear in the Commonwealth Evidence Act should be improved. These amendments look at foreign business records, which are records of most direct relevance in pursuing the kinds of tax evasion that are occurring through the use of overseas structures, overseas banks and overseas companies and improving the offences that are being prosecuted under Australian law in Australian courts. Very often, is seen as greatly useful to be able to bring into evidence records that are obtained from overseas sources. Perhaps most particularly, these amendments will allay any risk that the current unamended provisions of the Foreign Evidence Act will obstruct a number of current prosecutions that arise from Operation Wickenby-an operation that other speakers in this debate have mentioned-which is Australia's largest tax fraud investigation to date. The purpose of Operation Wickenby has been to detect and dismantle the intricate evasion mechanisms used by a small number of Australian citizens to avoid tax. It has been estimated that these illicit enterprises put in excess of $300 million of Commonwealth revenue at risk. Operation Wickenby has demonstrated a commendable whole-ofgovernment approach to the problem of tax avoidance. It has brought together the expertise of the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and the regulators at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission with the enforcement powers of the Australian Crime Commission and the Federal Police. Since 2004, Operation Wickenby has had considerable success in combating tax evaders who blatantly falsify deductions, conceal their taxable income, use offshore transactions and establish companies for the benefit of other tax evaders. There has been quite a deal of publicity given to some of those prosecutions, some of which involve highprofile people and which have been well reported on. Up to June 2008, the Australian Taxation Office had issued tax assessments in the order of $71 million in tax revenue as a direct result of the Australian Crime Commission's Wickenby investigations. Similarly, the Wickenby examination process has provided invaluable evidence from difficult witnesses for still pending prosecutions. In the year to 30 June 2008, the Australian Crime Commission conducted 203 coercive it examinations and issued 182 notices to obtain intelligence and information. In December 2007, three people were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of $6.6 million and were committed to stand trial. Nothing raises the ire of the Australian taxpayer more than the kinds of people that these amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act are aimed at. An excellent example is the very first enforcement action brought as a result of Operation Wickenby, which was against Adam Hargraves, a Gold Coast entrepreneur whose business, Phone Directories Co., had declared four years without profit. Investigations into Mr Hargraves's financial arrangements uncovered a sophisticated evasion scheme concealing three Porsches, 10 properties and over $3 million in a Commonwealth securities account. To the hard working taxpayers in my electorate of Isaacs, this kind of contempt for tax obligations is infuriating. Tax evaders hold the rules of our society in complete disregard. They take the benefits of our public hospitals, our schools, our roads and all the other services that our taxes make possible, but they contribute nothing. I think of tax evaders as thieves, people who steal the benefits of our community without paying for them. This parliament should do everything possible to ensure that the full armoury of powers is available to Commonwealth investigative and prosecuting agencies to ensure that tax evasion is brought to account. The focus of these amendments on the procurement of foreign business records and their use in evidence will be invaluable in combating schemes like those of Mr Hargraves, the Gold Coast entrepreneur. The businesses complicit in these frauds will generally have documentary evidence, often overseas, that is the key to successful proseforeign cution. By way of illustration, one could at a classic international scam loan arrangement that is outlined in the 2008 Australian Taxation Office publication Tax Havens and Tax Administration. This involves an Australian company establishing a fraudulent tax scheme offering, for example, an $80,000 tax deduction for a $20,000 cash contribution. It runs like this. First, the Australian promoter instructs an international promoter to ‘provide' finance to the taxpayer. Second, the international promoter sets up a finance company outside Australia. Third, the offshore finance company makes a book entry purporting to finance the Australian taxpayer with a non-recourse book entry loan of $60,000, which is paid on paper, but which is not actually paid, directly to the promoter. Fourth, the Australian taxpayer pays $20,000 in cash to the promoter. Fifth, the Australian taxpayer claims a deduction from the Commonwealth of $80,000, being the book-entry $60,000 loan plus their $20,000 contribution. The last two steps outlined in the Australian Taxation Office's publication are that the so called loan is never paid back, and the result is that, at a 40 per cent tax rate, a tax refund of $32,000 is obtained, so that each taxpayer recoups their $20,000 investment and retains a net benefit of $12,000-at, of course, the cost of Commonwealth revenue. These arrangements are difficult to identify. With these amendments, the business records from the offshore finance company-to use the illustration given by the Australian Taxation Office-would be more readily able to be used in evidence in court proceedings, as would the records of the international promoter. It will be harder to set up sham loans like this, because the evidence of whether or not they have been paid back-the evidence that shows that they are in fact sham transactions-will be more readily available to Australian courts. This evidence will be able to be collated look with information from tax returns, from credit and debit cards and from international information exchanges under our relevant tax treaties so as to be able to pinpoint abusive schemes created by tax avoiders and evaders. When monitoring patterns of incoming and outgoing transactions, AUSTRAC will identify an inconsistency between a tax evader's foreign dealings and reported tax outcomes. That is the reason we ask all persons leaving the country to indicate on their departure card if they are carrying more than $10,000 in currency. Evidence is already difficult to obtain from overseas. Companies such as the Geneva firm Strachans SA-the dealings of which were a catalyst for Operation Wickenby-are notoriously secretive. It is no coincidence that Adam Hargraves had a Visa card from the Corner Bank, a private banking institution in Lugano Banca, Switzerland. Of course, access to evidence is dependent on bilateral agreements between the Australian government and governments overseas. Operation Wickenby involves what are known as ‘mutual assistance requests', whereby Australian law enforcement authorities seek cooperation from international counterparts to secure evidence located offshore. For example, in 2005 the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ordered that the Australian Crime Commission be given access to Swiss documents detailing a fraudulent $90 million scheme being run out of Sydney to allegedly manufacture Scotch whiskey. It was through this mutual assistance request process that Australian authorities were able to use their international counterparts, the Swiss Magistrates Office, to procure the information necessary to recover the money defrauded from the Commonwealth. The Swiss authorities were also able to assist in the release of the documents identifying several Australian promoters of these fraudulent schemes. These amendments build on the Labor tradition of protecting the Australian taxpayer. Since Australia's first specialist finanCourt, cial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC, was established under the Hawke government in 1989, Labor has built on this legacy and now introduces these amendments to guarantee the security of Australia's revenue. I commend the bill to the House.",31
15,Mr NEUMANN,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"Blair) (11.18 am)Anyone who practises as a lawyer or as a litigant involving business records knows the challenges of dealing with business records. Business records are in a category all their own in terms of evidence. Often opinion is expressed in those records and often you cannot identify who has drafted the business records, who has put pen to paper, who has typed on the keys to collate those business records. So there is often hearsay involved. Getting evidence adduced in terms of business records is difficult. It is difficult to know who to cross-examine. Courts are notoriously loath to allow business records to be admitted into evidence, and it frustrates litigants and lawyers incredibly. As someone who practised in civil and criminal law for many years before coming to this place, I had many cases involving foreign evidence from Asia, Africa and the United States, and getting evidence was difficult. Making sure it complied with all the technicalities of Queensland jurisdiction and Commonwealth jurisdiction was also a challenge. The main purpose of the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is to streamline procedures so that we can adduce business records as evidence in Australian court proceedings. Initially, it is to do with criminal and civil matters involving the Commonwealth, but I would hope that the state and territory proceedings will also come within the province of this type of legislation and that agreement can be reached with the states and territories so that we have a uniform system in this country with respect to evidence. Rules and regulations under the Family the Federal Court, the Federal Magistrates Service and the civil courts in Queensland-where I come from-all deal with business records, so it is important that we get this right, and the reason for that can be summed up in this way: nothing causes constituents in my area more aggravation than people not paying their way. I subscribe to the view of the father for the Minister for Trade, the former Treasurer of this country, Frank Crean, who once said words to the effect of, ‘Paying tax is the way we civilise society.' By paying tax we pay for hospitals and care for the sick. We educate our children. We care for our aged. So the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that Australians who are trying to evade taxation are compelled to pay their way. That means the Australian taxpayers can be confident in the integrity of our taxation system. Whilst the legislation is known as the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008, it is all about taxation. It is all about government revenue, and it is all about making people pay their fair share to support the Australian community. Part 3 of the Foreign Evidence Act provides a means of adducing foreign material, such as business records, in response to a mutual assistance request to a foreign country, as evidenced in Australian criminal and related civil proceedings. Currently the act requires that the business records must comply with the rules of evidence in the foreign jurisdiction and also with the very technical, evidentiary rules which vary between the states and territories of Australia. The bill before the House today ensures that those technical problems can be overcome and that the evidence can be adduced and is presumed to be admissible unless the courts are satisfied the records are not reliable and have probity or are privileged. That is a very good, flexible amendment. It will improve the transparency and efficiency of our court system and ensure that evidence can be adduced. Overcoming the requirement that the taking of foreign evidence had to be on oath or affirmation is also a good provision and means that, if someone is under a legal obligation to tell the truth, the evidence can be adduced here in Australia. So there are a number of great initiatives. Also in part 3 there is some clari30 fication that really brings the legislation the 21st century by changing definitions of audio and video tape to ‘a tape, disk or other device from which sounds or images are capable of being reproduced' to recognise that we now live in a computer age with all the advances of technology, about which I am sure our children know better than we who sit in this House. The purpose of this particular legislation can be summed up by two words: Operation Wickenby. It is interesting that the Commissioner of Taxation, when he appeared before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on 3 October 2008, said that he expected an extra $5.7 billion over the next four years in relation to that particular operation. That is what this legislation is all about: improving the prospect of the ATO obtaining further moneys to improve the integrity of our taxation system. The Howard government and this government are to be commended for the way in which they have supported the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Crime Commission, ASIC and other regulatory bodies with respect to Operation Wickenby, which commenced in 2004. As I said, its aim is to minimise tax evasion. In a submission put to the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for a hearing into tax haven banks and US tax compliance conducted by their permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on 17 July 2008, the Australian Taxation Office made some very pertinent comments and points which I will refer to. It noted that the OECD estimates that between US$5 trillion and US$7 trillion is held in tax havens or banking secrecy jurisdictions. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, and Australia's Financial Intelligence Unit, FIU, have sophisticated capabilities to track international monetary flows. In the financial year ending June 2007 it is estimated that $16 billion into was sent directly to tax havens from Australia and approximately $18 billion was sent directly from tax havens to Australia. Those are extraordinary sums of money. It is probably also the case that, with nearly a million Australians living overseas and with 45 per cent of people living in this country either having one parent born overseas or having been born overseas themselves, funds and assets are held offshore, often legitimately. But it is quite sad that at times people have to resort to these types of tactics to avoid their obligations to their fellow citizens. Offshore evasion is a concern internationally. There are a number of factors which mitigate the risk here in Australia: our geographical isolation, the existence of AUSTRAC, vigilance of governments of both persuasions, our lack of an inheritance tax or gift duty, the relative size of flow of funds from Australia to tax havens compared to other countries, the generally law-abiding aspects of the Australian people and the ethics and morality that we have in this country, and the message that the Australian Taxation Office has sent from Operation Wickenby and other activities. But we must always be concerned about concealment. Operation Wickenby is really a multiagency taskforce and it has engaged in a huge investigation-a $300 million tax fraud inquiry into offshore accounts. There have been dozens of people charged. A message must be sent to those people who are abusing tax havens and engaging in dodgy tax schemes and to those individuals and businesses using the cash economy in a way to avoid meeting their obligations to their fellow citizens and companies to not engage in these activities, to refrain from these types of people. activities, and that they will be punished severely when they engage in these types of activities. The Commissioner of Taxation has written over 3,500 letters to people in the year asking them to disclose overseas interest. In excess of 820 disclosures have been made and $35 million or more of previously undisclosed income has been disclosed. This is a huge operation which we must support. The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 and the amendments to it in this bill are about supporting the Australian Taxation Office in its endeavours. I believe that constituents in my electorate strongly support these types of measures. They strongly expect that other Australians will pay their way and contribute to building roads, hospitals, schools, community centres and a fair and just Australia. This legislation will go a long way to ensuring that our regulatory bodies undertake the kind of investigation and prosecution which must be undertaken to maintain, in a very difficult time, the kind of lifestyle that we enjoy in this country. I am very pleased to speak on this bill and I commend it to everyone.",34
16,Mr SLIPPER,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"This is one of those items of legislation which enjoy the support of both sides of the chamber. The Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 obviously enjoys the support of the Rudd government, and it also builds on the work of the Howard-Costello government. This is an issue which is important to all Australians, and it comes to the matter of fairness in the tax system. Technology gallops along-who would have known 10 years ago that we would have the technology and various electronic methods of avoiding obligations that we have in 2009? That is why it is always important that governments look very carefully at the law and make sure that it is updated so that they are able to deliver on their obligations to the Australian This bill amends the Foreign Evidence Act. It seeks to make sure that Australia's courts are given the weapons they need to last guarantee that Australian taxpayers are not defrauded and, more generally, that business records from overseas are able to be used as evidence, unless the court is satisfied that the records are not reliable, probative or privileged. The Bill Digest emphasises: - Testimony provisions will operate more flexibly to allow for evidence to be received where an individual is under a legal obligation to tell the truth, even though no formal oath or admonition has occurred-unless of course, there is sufficient evidence to raise doubt as to the contrary. - Courts will be given greater discretion to limit the use of foreign material where there is a danger that it may be unfairly prejudicial to a party to the proceedings. Also, as in so many other items of legislation, there are additional amendments which update provisions and make consequential changes, many of which are important from the point of view of dotting the i's and crossing the t's but do not to any great extent change aspects of the law. There is no doubt that right across the world there are criminals and people who seek to take advantage of loopholes or deficiencies in the law. That is why the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is an important tool in updating the law to make sure that the interests of litigants and taxpayers are carefully observed. Honourable members opposite have pointed out some aspects of the genesis of this legislation. It is one of those items of legislation which ought to become law sooner rather than later. Money laundering is an issue which confronts governments and nations across the world. Because of the fact that the world is now a global village, increasingly we find that governments in one part of the world seek evidence and assistance from other governments to help bring about satisfactory legal outcomes. The concept of a mutual assistance request once might have been quite rare but it is now routine and Australian authorities and authorities overseas cooperate as much as possible, particularly in fraud and money-laundering cases. The act applies to proceedings in state and territory courts as well as to those in Commonwealth courts; however, the amendments in this bill are initially intended to only apply to Commonwealth proceedings. As is often the case, the application of the law may well be broadened by appropriate regulations tabled by the executive. The Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is an important bill and is supported by the opposition. I commend the bill to the House.",36
17,Mr DEBUS,FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I would like to thank members for their contributions to the debate on the Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008. I particularly acknowledge the members for Farrer, Eden-Monaro, Cowan, Corio, Isaacs, Blair and Fisher. I thank the opposition for its support for the bill. The collection of foreign evidence relies on the willingness of foreign counterparts to provide assistance to Australia. The increasing globalisation of business and advances in technology mean that Australia's efforts to fight crime depend ever increasingly on this form of foreign assistance, but our laws governing the admissibility of foreign evidence are not always flexible enough to deal with international differences in procedure. Barriers remain that can prevent the use of reliable evidence obtained from foreign countries with systems of criminal investigation and procedural law which differ from ours. That brings us to the amendments before the House. Requests for business records are one of the most common types of requests for foreign evidence made by Australia. Business record evidence is used in financial fraud and proceeds-of-crime matters-a high-profile example referred to by members being the prosecutions arising out of what we call Operation Wickenby. But business record evidence is also used in prosecutions for crimes like money laundering, drug importation and child pornography and, while business records are generally considered a reliable and accurate form of evidence, compliance with Australia's admissibility requirements is onerous from the point of view of many other countries. These requirements are now adversely impacting on Australia's ability to obtain reliable evidence in a timely manner, and it is therefore appropriate, and indeed necessary, that more flexible rules are introduced to apply to the admission of foreign business records in domestic proceedings. It is also vital for the administration of justice that the law retains appropriate safeguards and that judicial discretion is maintained in this area. In order to protect against the inappropriate admission of unreliable evidence, the bill provides that foreign business records may not be adduced if the court considers the records are not reliable or probative or if the records are privileged. The court also retains a broad discretion to prevent the foreign business records being adduced if justice would be better served if the foreign material were not adduced-that is to say, the discretion of the judge in any particular case is of great significance. The bill strikes an appropriate balance in retaining safeguards while ensuring that there is sufficient flexibility in the law as will stand. I ask that the relatively technical and minor appearance of this bill not detract from an understanding of its fundamental importance as a much-needed legal reform. Indeed, the provisions of this bill are vital the more effective operation of Australian criminal and associated civil proceedings, and I commend it to the House. Question agreed to.

19,Ms LEY,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to speak today on the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. The main purpose of this bill is to facilitate Queensland's entry into the telecommunications interception regime and also to remedy some significant errors in the act. It is worth noting the Attorney General's remarks in his second reading speech on this bill when he said: The inclusion of Queensland agencies will mean that the interception regime established by the T(IA) Act will become truly national. Queensland it is currently the only jurisdiction whose law enforcement agencies do not have interception powers. We should note that it is actually not this bill itself which gives Queensland law enforceto ment agencies their access to interception powers; those powers need to come from the Queensland parliament. But, before the Attorney-General can declare that an agency is eligible under the T(IA) Act, the states need to have their own legislation in place to demonstrate their accountability and recordkeeping requirements of Commonwealth law. For Queensland to be able to comply with these requirements, the Commonwealth must recognise in the law the existence and role of the Public Interest Monitor in Queensland. Once this is in place, Queensland can then enact its own laws relating to telephone intercepts without running into inconsistency problems between Queensland law and Commonwealth law. Queensland will give the Public Interest Monitor the oversight role in the application process that is demanded by Commonwealth law and the Commonwealth must give specific reference to the Public Interest Monitor so that there can be that consistency between the two regimes. That is the main purpose of this bill and its main provisions reflect that. In the Queensland parliament, in August 2008, the Premier announced in her ministerial statement: Members may recall that there have been ongoing discussions between the state and federal governments about making phone-tapping powers available to Queensland law enforcement agencies. I am very pleased to advise the House today that the Prime Minister has written to me confirming that the Australian government will now support telecommunication interception powers for the Queensland Police Service and the Crime and Misconduct Commission. Kevin Rudd has accepted that these powers should be subject to the involvement of the Public Interest Monitor, an independent barrister who represents the public interest. Phone tapping (sic) is a highly effective law enforcement power, but it is also a highly intrusive one. We have always said that we would consider these powers, but we have also said that they had to come with appropriate safeguards for people's privacy, and we make no apologies for that. I would like to emphasise the opposition's view that we understand the need for telecommunications interceptions, but we certainly recognise that there must be strong and appropriate safeguards for people's privacy. That is a balance that all agencies need to strike. It is important that Queensland come into what needs to be a national regime, and a loophole such as has previously existed may have allowed for interceptions that could have led to detentions and arrests for serious and organised crime not taking place because of conversations that were unable to be intercepted in Queensland. It is worth noting that the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act is an act that prohibits interception of communications passing over a telecommunications system. It does not allow it. It prohibits it in a general sense, but then it provides a number of exemptions. It is under these exemptions that the ‘phone tapping', to use the vernacular, takes place. The exemptions under the T(IA) Act include to the officers of law enforcement and security agencies under warrant, if the Attorney-General is satisfied that the telecommunications system is being used by a person engaged in, or likely to be engaged in, or reasonably suspected to be engaged in, activities or purposes that are prejudicial to security. So a warrant needs to be obtained. The involvement of the Public Interest Monitor in Queensland takes place at that stage and there is appropriate supervision of the process. The bill also makes certain technical amendments to correct and clarify the definitions of ‘certifying officer' and ‘appropriate authorising officer'. I do not feel that I need to elaborate further on those technical amendments. In conclusion, the interception of telecommunications is an important weapon in the fight against serious and organised crime. This bill enables Queensland agencies, the Queensland Police Service and the Crime and Misconduct Commission, to use that weapon and it harmonises the regime with the oversight arrangements in use in that state. This bill has the support of the opposition.",38
20,Mr NEUMANN,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. It is interesting that the genesis of this legislation goes back to the 1980s in Queensland, to the Fitzgerald inquiry, which ran from 1987 to 1989. Subsequent to the Fitzgerald inquiry the CJC, as we call it in Queensland-the Criminal Justice Commission-was established. Then we had the Queensland Crime Commission, which was merged into one entity, which we know today as the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission. As someone who was practising in the Brisbane CBD as a lawyer, whose office was directly across the road from the Fitzgerald inquiry when it was being held and whose firm gave significant advice to people in relation to the Fitzgerald inquiry, I am quite happy to speak on this bill. The regulatory investigating bodies were established in Queensland subsequent to the Fitzgerald inquiry continue on in ferent guises, but they are still there, in a uniquely Queensland experience, to look at corruption in the police force and elsewhere. In that very interesting time a great lanx of celebrities and police officers were charged and convicted. Politicians, people involved in law firms and banks, and real estate agents came before the commission. So many people were involved in the inquiry over that three-year period. Tony Fitzgerald is to be commended for it. The recommendations of the inquiry were taken up by the National Party government, and the National Party Premier at the time is to be commended for that. Bill Gunn, then the Acting Premier of Queensland, is to be commended for the courage he showed in establishing the Fitzgerald inquiry. Tony Fitzgerald is to be commended for his hard work and integrity in the circumstances. Subsequent Labor governments and coalition governments in the 1980s, under Borbidge and Sheldon, continued the process. Queensland is very concerned about these sorts of issues, but sadly we have been left out in this particular area of interception. This legislation is a very Queensland response. It ensures that Queensland law enforcement agencies have the same telecommunications interception powers as other law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. We have a peculiar entity in Queensland, known as the Queensland Public Interest Monitor, PIM, which has a particular role in Queensland. This bill recognises the Public Interest Monitor in Queensland and introduces that particular person into the interception regime. It enables the Public Interest Monitor to make submissions to the judge or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal member considering the interception warrant applicathat tion made in the circumstances by the Queensland Police Service or the Queendif- sland Crime and Misconduct Commission. In those circumstances this legislation allows for those agencies to be declared interception agencies under the Telecommunications (Inphaterception and Access) Act but allows the Public Interest Monitor to continue the role which he currently plays in the circumstances-and there is only one Public Interest Monitor, and that is in Queensland. The Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, and her predecessor, Peter Beattie, also argued for a long time that Queensland ought to be brought into the national scheme. It is inexplicable that the Howard government refused to cooperate in this regard. I am pleased to say that the current Labor Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, has accepted the role of the Public Interest Monitor, who is an independent barrister who represents the public interest. His role is now recognised in the system. I just cannot understand why the previous government opposed it in the circumstances. The Attorney-General has introduced this legislation, which will fix up an anomaly. We are well served in Queensland by the current Public Interest Monitor, whose name is Colin Forrest. He is a barrister at the Queensland bar. He began his legal career as an associate to Justice Michael Kirby, the then President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. Subsequently Colin relocated to Brisbane. He has been practising for about 17 or 18 years as a barrister in Queensland and for a couple of years before that as a solicitor. It has been my privilege to find him a tremendous adversary in court proceedings in Queensland. He is a very fine lawyer. He practises in family law, estate law and administrative law. He is a tough opponent and he is a man of real morality, ethics and integrity. He is a very good choice for the role of the Public Interest Monitor in Queensland. He actually serves as a part-time member of the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. He also finds time to work as a part-time member of the Commonwealth Social Security Appeals Tribunal. And he is a wonderful lecturer and speaker at many conferences in Queensland, particularly for the Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland. So Colin is the right person for the job. He has a couple of deputies with him to perform the role and he has given very detailed reports in his role. He wrote an interesting article last year for Proctor, the solicitors' magazine in Queensland. He said this, and I think it is right: It is probably fair to say for lawyers and nonlawyers alike, the role the Public Interest Monitor (‘the PIM') plays in the criminal little known or understood. That is probably true, but there is an oversight, a watchfulness. He is entitled to ask questions of those people who make applications for warrants. He is entitled to stand for the public and play that monitoring role. I think someone like Colin, with intelligence and all-round knowledge of legal proceedings and law in Queensland, is just the right person for the job. He has to report six-monthly to the parliament, through the police minister. As I say, he has a couple of deputies who also serve in this role: Ms Karen Carmody, a barrister, and  ing role and I would commend people in Queensland to know what kind of role these people perform. They discharge their duties on a part-time, fee-for-service basis, and they charge the Queensland government via the Queensland Police Service budget at $300 per hour plus GST-so he told me in a conversation I had with him. But he has been frustrated for several years. In the Proctor article he said: For several years, the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments have not been able to agree on the introduction of telephone interception powers in Queensland because of the central ‘front end' and ‘back end' monitoring role proposed by the Queensland Government for the PIM in the process. For some years, the PIM has supported the introduction of these powerswhich are the basis of the legislation currently before the House. But the Public Interest Monitor could not get the previous government to agree. The article went on: Appropriate resourcing of the PIM is likely to be the challenge. Currently, the QPS and the CMC bring around 80-100 applications per year between them for covert surveillance warrants. Estimates as to the number of telephone interception warrants that they are likely to bring are currently around 300-400 per year based on experience in justice system is other States. So it is very important that the Queensland government adequately fund the Public Interest Monitor and the deputies in these circumstances. I think it is very important that the Queensland government resource it properly so the Queensland public can be sure that civil liberties are protected and yet we are vigilant in attacking organised crime, particularly outlaw bikie gangs, who are often engaged in drug and other criminal activities. It is important that the Queensland government do this. If we are going to give the Public Interest Monitor a greater role and more things to do, the Queensland government, when it passes the legislation which is necessary in the circumstances, ought to resource the Public Interest Monitor and his deputies even further. Colin Forrest says this in his 2006-07 annual report and repeats it in the 2007-08 report: Discharge of the Public Interest Monitor's functions requires a delicate balancing of two competing facets of public interest. The first is the public interest in ensuring that serious criminal conduct is detected, prevented and made the subject of successful prosecution by our law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities, particularly during a time of rapid technological change. The second, and no less important, is that fundamental rights of individual members of our community, such as the right to privacy, are respected and interfered with as little as possible in the process of detecting, preventing and punishing that serious criminal conduct. In addition, a commitment to the principle that independent accountability of our law enforcement agencies strengthens the fabric of our democratic society and aids the rule of law has been central to the creation of the office and the discharge of its functions. You can see why Colin Forrest is the right person for the job in Queensland. In the conclusion to his 2007-08 report he again repeats something he had written in the 200607 report, and I think it is worth repeating in Hansard: I said in last year's report:‘Although the use of covert surveillance devices is often ineffective, due to technical, operational or other reasons, the properly targeted, careful use of the covert surveillance warrant powers can prove very effective in detecting perpetrators of serious crime in this State, particularly in connection with the production and distribution of illicit drugs. At the same time it is my view that the balancing act mentioned earlier in this report with respect to public interest considerations is being appropriately addressed. Charges and prosecutions arising from covert police investigative operations continue to increase. The QPS has complied with its obligations pursuant to the PPRA in the manner in which it maintains its records and its records contain all the information and documentation required by the PPRA. Those records are maintained and kept in secure facilities with effective procedures in place controlling access.' Again, those words are entirely worth repeating this year. The ‘front-end' and ‘back-end' monitoring functions of the PIM continue to be valuable features of the criminal justice system in this state. I commend the bill before the House. It is good for Queensland and it is good for the prosecution of criminal activity in Queensland, particularly in the area of illicit drugs. I think it is about time Queensland came into the 21st century in this area. I am pleased to support the bill.",39
21,Mr WOOD,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. The passing of this bill is well and truly overdue. It is absolutely crazy that in 2009 the Queensland state police still do not have the ability to target organised and serious crime. I heard what the previous speakers from the government side said and I know that under the previous Howard government there was grave concern expressed by members about the Public Interest Monitor. My personal view is that, if the Queensland state government really wants to push this, so be it, because I would rather have it with the Public Interest Monitor than have the ridiculous situation which we previously had where serious and organised criminals basically had a free run in Queensland. That situation finally will change. Bizarrely, Queensland was the only jurisdiction in Australia which did not have interception powers. As a former member of the Victoria Police organised crime squad, it was only when I was on the Australian Crime Commission that I actually became aware of this. I could not actually believe this was the case. The introduction of this telecommunications interception amendment bill will finally bring an end to this situation and have Queensland joining the rest of the state law enforcement agencies. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission has made recommendations several times calling on the Commonwealth and Queensland governments to work together to expedite the granting of interception powers to the Queensland police and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission, most recently in September 2007. I add that I am a member of the committee, which obviously is a bipartisan committee, so all the members were trying to do the right thing by the Queensland police force. Criminal syndicates are quite adept at using technology to carry out their crimes. The Australian Crime Commission's investigation into organised crime revealed that outlaw motorcycle gangs and illicit drug manufacturers are thriving in Queensland, with police unable to monitor their criminal activities that take place using mobile phones and emails. Queensland police are currently unable to access telecommunication interception powers for any investigation other than joint operations and Commonwealth matters. As a result, Queensland police are often reliant upon partnerships with other law enforcement agencies that can facilitate access to phone-tapping powers. Three years ago the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission released a report recommending the introduction of phone-tapping powers for Queensland. This amendment will facilitate the implementation of phone-tapping powers by accommodating the bureaucratic role that the Public Interest Monitor has in law enforcement in Queensland. The Public Interest Monitor oversees all applications for surveilcepts lance device and covert search warrants in Queensland. Queensland police can already execute surveillance warrants and place listening devices. The amendment will enable Queensland investigators to execute warrants for telephone intercepts-the missing link in Queensland police powers.",42
22,Mr KERR,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"And about time too, isn't it.",43
23,Mr WOOD,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I totally agree: it is about time. The Queensland government has for some time feared that without specific reference to the PIM in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act Queensland legislation would be inoperative under section 109 of the Constitution due to its inconsistency with other provisions in the act. Although a specific reference to the PIM in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act had been deemed unnecessary by the previous government, by recognising the PIM's oversight role in application processes for an interception warrant by the Queensland law enforcement agencies the Queensland government can introduce legislation that will comply with the accountability framework established in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act without fear that legislation would be inoperative. Telecommunications interception is an essential and vital tool in law enforcement and has been used with great success in some of the most complex criminal investigations, including the tragic murders of Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rodney Miller in 1988 in Victoria and locating fugitive gangland figure Tony Mokbel in 2006. It has also been used by law enforcement agencies when investigating the illicit drug and organised crime activity. In the world of organised crime and in fighting terrorism and even in relation to homicides and rapes, in nearly every serious investigation police mount, one of the greatest tools is telephone interceptions. Two-thirds of telephone interare used in investigating drug-related crime. Extending phone-tapping powers to Queensland police will greatly assist the Queensland drug investigation unit and Task Force Hydra, the unit investigating outlaw motorcycle gangs, in solving serious drugrelated crimes. The implementation of telecommunications interception powers in Queensland has been recommended many times by both state and federal law enforcement agencies and is long overdue. This amendment will provide consistency between all states and territories and facilitate a national approach for law enforcement agencies. One thing which greatly concerns me at the moment when it comes to law enforcement is the government's cutbacks to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. Where this is relevant is that a number of state-seconded police who have been working with the Australian Crime Commission in Queensland and other states have been forced to go back to their own jurisdictions. In fact, I believe the figures are up to 50 members, of whom 16 are investigators. That greatly concerns me. I mentioned how the Queensland police work with other authorities such as the Australian Federal Police. Again in Queensland we have seen 14 AFP members being offered redundancy packages. To me this seems crazy when yesterday the Prime Minister was talking about a stimulus package to create jobs and now the minister has put the AFP and the ACC in a position where they are forced to offer redundancy packages. Of great concern is what is occurring in the Sydney offices of the Australian Federal Police. Their counterterrorism investigators work on a 12-week budget cycle but, after 10 weeks, investigators are being told: ‘We have run out of money. There is no overtime in the budget. You have to stand down and go home.' They have ongoing investigations. To me, this is crazy. But even more concerning is the intelligence areas in the Sydney offices specifically looking at counterterrorism. If a member is transferred, seconded or receives a promotion, they are not being replaced. It is really unusual for police members to actually speak publicly on this or, as in this speak to me. I suppose they feel comfortable because of my former role in the Victorian police force, and I thank them for that. What is greatly concerning them, especially when it comes to the area of intelligence, is that they have intelligence reports sitting in the offices of the AFP counterterrorism squad in Sydney that are just not being looked at. We have highly qualified and trained analysts who, once they leave or are transferred, are not being replaced. Information in reports is sitting in trays and not being looked at. Of course, if a report comes across a table that is regarded as a matter that quite obviously needs to be acted on immediately, they are doing that, but the great concern I have is that in the world of crime and investigations not everything is apparent. My concern is this: we may have the crazy situation of an intelligence report sitting around that anyone who picks it up will think, on the face of it, ‘This means nothing; there is nothing in this report.' That is a great danger because you never know what little piece this report may be in a huge puzzle. You only have to go back to the September 11 attacks to see that. I can tell the House and members of the Australian public that the planning for those attacks took over four years. It took over four years for the offenders to perpetrate those attacks. What actually happened was that there were all these law enforcement agencies who had bits of information, but they never swapped those bits of information. The offenders were undertaking pilot training and the person involved in training them was greatly concerned. He reported it, so the local authorities were aware of it. There were other reports coming over from Afghanistan saying to expect some sort of reprisals. They were talking about planes et cetera. There was all this information coming in and no-one put the pieces together. When it comes to Australian law enforcecase, ment, the one great thing we have is the ALIEN and ACID databases, where highlevel intelligence is regularly passed across our law enforcement agencies. If we go to what will happen in Queensland in the future, we can have state police monitoring phone conversations and information may be heard over the phones. At that time it may not be apparent how vital that information They may put in an information report on that which goes on to ALIEN and ACID, which are databases for law enforcement agencies. Just so members are aware, not everyone has access to them. You must have specific knowledge and authority to actually have access to the information. The only way these law enforcement agencies can work is if we ensure that any information from the Queensland police, or any other state police force, from anyone who rings up a hotline or from the Queensland, New South Wales or Victorian offices of the AFP is collected and acted upon. Finally, I want to make a point about the Australian Crime Commission. I welcome the appointment of the new director of the Australian Crime Commission, John Lawler. I think that is a great appointment and I gratulate the government on that. But, gee, what a tough task he has. Soon he is going to be doing investigations himself the way the cutbacks are going. I think the ACC are down to fewer than 15 or so actual permanent investigators employed by them. We are talking about over 600 staff down to 15 permanent ones. To my knowledge, by March all the police officers seconded from Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania are going to be taken back by their own units. When we are talking about this stimulus package, what greatly concerns me is that it has been revealed in the Australian Crime Commission hearings that serious and organised crime rips away $10 billion each year from the public, whether it be money seized from selling drugs or money laundering. It is a major issue in this country. That is $10 billion we could actually be going after to put back into the Queensland police force to assist, as we heard before, with all these warrants under this new regime of legislation. The way a telephone intercept warrant works is that someone eventually has to sit down is. and monitor the calls. Organised and serious crime does not work from nine to five. It works after hours. Why? Because that is the obvious time for most of these deals to be done. That is why you need to make sure the Queensland police and all the police forces around the country, including the AFP and the ACC, have the funding to make sure they have the manpower available to listen to what comes over the lines of the telephone intercepts. That is something which we need to ensure happens. I cannot for the life of me understand why the government would force the Australian Federal Police to offer redundancy packages in all areas, right across the field. I am greatly concerned with what is happening in the air marshal program. I understand that that program is one of those areas where, for consecurity reasons, we do not want the public to know how many air marshals are out there. But what concerns me is that redundancy packages are being made available right across the board-it does not matter whether it is counterterrorism, air marshals or members of the child exploitation units. That urgently needs to be addressed. As a previous member of the Victorian police force, having worked closely with the Australian Federal Police and having dealt with members of associations of state and territory police across the country, I can say that members are greatly concerned with what is happening at the moment. I will call a spade a spade: when it comes to telephone interceptions I am on the record as saying that things need to change and that what was going on was absolutely outrageous. I stood up and said that and I was, I suppose, having a go at my own government. In opposition I will say the same things: when it comes to tackling organised and serious crime, this new government must do the right thing by the law enforcement agencies. I was taken aback by the Prime Minister's 40-minute address when he talked about security and basically beat his chest when talking about what he was going to do. It all sounded fantastic, and it got a really good run the next day in the papers. The Prime Minister spoke about no longer having an office of homeland security. The government promised an office of homeland security in the previous election, but they have walked away from that. They said that they did so on expert advice. What has happened to the money for the office of homeland security? It has gone. They looked at other areas, including considering having a national school for counterterrorism, or something similar. Do not just consider this; actually do it. That the important message. At the moment the Australian public would think that as nothing has happened to us, everything is fine. We see no terrorist attacks and everything seems to be going fairly well. Well, if you look at the papers from the last couple of days in Melbourne and Sydney, you will see that a number of people have just been convicted and sentenced for looking at creating terrorist attacks in Australia. They have been given tough sentences, as they should. I would like to remind the public of that. I would also to congratulate all the police and law enforcement agencies who worked on that case. The previous government had to rush through legislation, and I congratulate Kim Beazley, who was the then opposition leader, for supporting that legislation. He knew how serious this potential incident was. The Australian public must be aware that counterterrorism and security issues are still out there. Look what happened in India not long ago. Who were the terrorists targeting? They were targeting what they call the ‘infidels'. They are people like us-people from Western societies who went to Western hotels. Remember that the people from Muslim backgrounds were pulled out and the Westerners were shot. So I just remind Australians that terrorism is still a threat in Australia and that the government cannot take this for granted. The government's number one role is to protect Australian citizens, and I call on the government to immediately give the AFP and the Australia Crime Commission their funding back. That is the policy of the opposition, led by Malcolm Turnbull. Finally, it is about time the Queensland police got the telephone interception powers to really target serious and organised crime.",43
24,Mr BIDGOOD,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I is rise to speak in favour of the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. This bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to facilitate access by Queensland law enforcement agencies to telecommunications interception powers. This will give Queensland law enforcement agencies access to the same investigative tools as all other police forces around the country. That access will come only when Queensland's arrangements comply with the accountability requirements in section 35 of the federal Telelike communication (Interception and Access) Amendments Act. In upholding the law in Queensland and in helping to bring about a safer community, the Queensland police service has my full support. I acknowledge the commitment and professionalism of all our men and women in uniform. Contrary to what the previous member said about underinvestment in police services, I can say that in my seat of Dawson, the Queensland state government has in Mackay, Whitsunday and Burdekin actually increased police services, and there has been excellent Queensland state government representation by the Mackay state member, who also happens to be the primary industry minister, Tim Mulherin. Tim Mulherin has been a very strong advocate for the police service and for the role of our men and women police officers. He has been at the forefront of lobbying for and obtaining a brand new police station in early 2000. He has also lobbied successfully for an increase in police numbers within the Mackay region. I am also pleased to say, in response to the statements of the previous speaker, the member for La Trobe, that a brand new police station has been built in the northern beaches area of Mackay. This area is covered by the state member for Whitsunday, Jane Jarrat. Again, she is another advocate for the Police Service. She is passionate about protecting our community, the role and lives of individuals, their properties and their businesses. A couple of years ago, she was also successful in the establishment and building of a brand new police station in the northern beaches area of Mackay. So the Queensland government, and in particular those two local members, have served people in the seat of Dawson very well indeed. They have done an excellent job, and it is a great privilege and honour for me to put them on the Hansard record as having done that. They deserve credit and praise when it comes to supporting our men and women in the Police Service, who do a fantastic job. The Queensland Police Service is the primary law enforcement agency of the state of Queensland. It fulfils this role throughout my home state of Queensland 24 hours a day, upholding the law and providing assistance to the community when necessary, in times of emergency, disaster and crisis. On this note, I would like to refer to the events of the floodings a year ago in the Mackay region. I saw first hand the exemplary service of the Police Service. It did a fantastic job, in coordination with our emergency services. It played a fantastic role in facilitating and mobilising as many people as possible, particularly with the effect of the floodings on 8,000 homes. I can report that only in the last couple of months have the last of the people from the 400 homes which were completely flooded out finally returned home. I would also like to put on the record that the recent rains that have come have caused a lot of psychological trauma. When we do our assessment of flood damage in these regions we often think in terms of dollar value of not only property, lost business and lost production but also possessions that need to be replaced. We do not always count the cost of psychological trauma. Recently, people in my region have become very nervous and upset that more floods might return to the region-and they have done in the regions of Ayr, the Burdekin River, particularly in Giru, and close to Home Hill. I want to send a message to the Police Service in those areas, particularly in Ayr and Townsville: ‘You do a magnificent job. We are proud of our men and women in police uniform and we will always stand by you. You have my full support.' In the time of disaster and crisis, the Police Service is a true champion of the people. The functions of the Police Service also include: first, the preservation of peace and good order in all areas of Queensland; second, the protection of all communities in Queensland; third, the prevention of crime; fourth, the detection of offenders and the bringing of offenders to justice; and, fifth, upholding the law generally and providing policing services in an emergency. The mission of the Queensland Police Force is to serve the people of Queensland, by protecting their lives, their property and by preserving peace and safety, preventing crime and upholding the law in a manner which has regard for the public good and the rights of the individual. Its vision is that professional police service, dedicated to excellence and committed to working in partnership with the people of Queensland to enhance the safety and security of our community. This bill is about putting Queensland in line with other states with regard to its powers to investigate crime by introducing the Queensland Public Interest Monitor. The bill recognises the unique oversight role that the Queensland Public Interest Monitor has in relation to law enforcement matters in Queensland by introducing the Queensland Public Interest Monitor into the interception regime. The bill will enable the Queensland Public Interest Monitor to make submissions to the judge considering the interception warrant application and to ask questions of the officer applying for the warrant. Importantly, the bill will only permit the Public Interest Monitor to play a role when a Queensland state interception agency seeks a telecommunications interception warrant. Recognition of the Public Interest Monitor in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act will pave the way for Queensland to introduce state legislation that will then enable the minister to consider declaring the Queensland Police Service and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission as interception agencies for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. The bill also implements a number of minor technical amendments. Under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, an agency cannot be declared an interception agency unless the minister is satisfied that the law of the requesting state makes satisfactory provision for the declared agency to comply with specified oversight arrangements. These include record keeping, of a reporting and inspection obligations and the entering into an agreement by the state to pay all expenses connected with the issue of warrants to the agency. I commend the bill to the House.",46
25,Mr HAYES,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I take some pride in speaking on the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 for a couple of different reasons. As I think most people in the House are aware, prior to coming to this place I spent a good many years representing the respective police jurisdictions across this country, and as a consequence I have had a lot to do with the men and women who serve this country wellMr Kerr interjecting",48
26,Mr HAYES,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"in protecting society, as the member for Denison says. It is not an easy job. That job is ever changing and we must provide our men and women in blue with the tools that they need to be able to do the job on our behalf. That is essentially what this bill is about today. I will go to some of the aspects of it. This bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to facilitate access by the Queensland law enforcement agencies to telecommunication interception powers. This will give Queensland law enforcement agencies access to the same investigative tools as all other police forces around the country. The amendment will provide clarity and substantial detail about exactly who has the authority to issue evidentiary certificates, to listen in on telephones and voicemails, and read text messages and emails as they apply to other jurisdictions. The amendment in the bill does not create or expand powers of authorisation of persons and therefore is unlikely to have any financial impact, but it does give the Queensland police, as a law enforcement agency under that sovereign state, the ability to access telephone intercept powers. As the member for Denison will recallwe rely on his learned views-we dealt with this matter in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission back in 2007. In September 2007, in the midst of an inquiry that the ACC did into the future impacts of serious and organised crime on Australian society, one of the things that we were determined to look at was the contemporary measures available to our law enforcement agencies to combat serious and organised crime. One of the things that stood out boldly, quite frankly, in the course of that investigation conducted by the joint parliamentary committee was the fact that the Queensland police were the only policing organisation in the Commonwealth who did not have powers to access telephone intercepts. That meant that, when the Queensland police participated in serious and organised crime detection or investigation, they attempted to do those investigations and operations where they needed telephone intercept ability in partnership with the Australian Crime Commission, because-as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as the member for Denison is certainly aware-that organisation has the power of telephone intercepts and can apply it throughout the Commonwealth. Other than by entering into a partnership arrangement with the Australian Crime Commission, the Queensland police were not able to participate in what I know to be one of the most significant detection methods deployed by our law enforcement agencies across the country in addressing serious and organised crime-that is, telephone interception. The committee was made aware of the inability of the Queensland police agencies to access telephone intercept warrants. We took evidence from Detective Chief Superintendent Barnett of the Queensland Police Service, and this is what he said to the committee: The QPS, in not having telephone interception powers, is unique as a policing jurisdiction within Australia. Consequently, partnerships with policing agencies that can facilitate access to telecommunications intercept, TI, powers are often critical to QPS investigations targeting significant criminal entities and networks. Every major investigation conducted between the ACC and the QPS has utilised telephone interception as a key investigative strategy and this support will continue to be critical to the QPS investigations targeting serious and organised crime. Chief Superintendent Barnett indicated that attempts have been made in the past to facilitate the introduction of telephone intercept powers in Queensland but that these had not been successful. Because they had not been successful domestically, within the sovereign ability of that state, he was quite open in indicating the reliance of the Queensland police on acting in partnership with the Australian Crime Commission in any investigation to target serious and organised crime, because a key investigative tool for those investigations has been and is, right across the country, telephone interception. The committee, during the course of that inquiry, raised this matter with the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. The department, particularly the head of the telecommunications and surveillance branch, confirmed that agencies such as the ACC and the AFP, and agencies in every other state, had the ability to deploy these powers. As was indicated from the Commonwealth's perspective in that respect, there is only one police force, the Queensland Police Service, that does not have interception powers. The Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission also does not have interception powers. These agencies are currently working their way forward with our colleagues in the Queensland Department of Justice and Attorney-General and with us to look at the interception powers of the Queensland police. That was the position of the Commonwealth in trying to broker an arrangement with the Queensland government to look at the development of interception powers in Queensland. It becomes significant in terms of policing if one of our law enforcement bodies does not have powers in the detection of serious organised crime. That makes a significant chink in the armour that protects the community from those who benefit from serious and organised crime. It is not for the Commonwealth to conduct all these investigations-certainly, we play a role in that and we will continue to play a role in targeting serious and organised crime-but there is a domestic responsibility for each of the states of this Commonwealth to do the same and to work as closely as they can in a collaborative arrangement. That, clearly, was not legally possible in terms of the lack of powers of telephone interception in Queensland. A consequence of this-and I may be going into a little bit too much detail about the Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission and its deliberations in terms of the inquiry into the future impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society-was that the committee recommended in September 2007 in recommendation 4: … that the Commonwealth and Queensland governments collaborate to expedite the granting of telecommunications interception powers to the Queensland Police Service and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission. That was the genesis of this bill coming before us today. Certainly, when that recommendation was made, the member for Denison and I were participating in the committee from an opposition perspective, but let me say it was made with the full support of all members of that committee, and I am very pleased that it is coming to fruition today. I heard Mr Jason Wood-I should remember his seat-speak a little earlier. As a former Victorian police officer, he more than aptly knows the value of having these powers of investigation detection available to domestic police services.",48
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION, Mr Wood is the member for La Trobe.,50
28,Mr HAYES,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"Thank you. I am indebted to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I should also indicate that the member for La Trobe is currently the Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. This bill now recognises the unique oversight role that will apply in Queensland under the Queensland Public Interest Monitor and the role it has in law enforcement matters in Queensland. Introducing the Public Interest Monitor into the interception regime itself will enable the Public Interest Monitor to make submissions to a judge or the AAT member considering the interception application and to ask questions of officers who are applying for such warrants. The recognition of the Public Interest Monitor in the legislation will pave the way in Queensland for state legislation to be enabled. It will allow for the minister to declare the Queensland Police Service and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission as having the legal ability to exercise interception powers covering those agencies. The minister will be able to make a declaration once they are satisfied that the Queensland arrangements comply with the accountability requirements under section 35 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. The bill will only permit the Public Interest Monitor to play a role when the Queensland state interception agencies-either the Queensland Police Service or the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commissionare actually seeking to avail themselves of the powers of telephone intercepts using the act. It does not mean, in terms of other areas of operation in concert with either the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Crime Commission, that those powers will need to be oversighted by the Public Interest Monitor of Queensland. There are a number of technical amendments included in this bill, which, I understand, are used to clarify a number of positions, particularly in relation to references to who is authorised to initiate telephone interception-for example, I think it is in the AFP, the term ‘certifying officer' is used in subsection 5(1) of the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Act 2008, which includes the commissioner of police and the deputy commissioner of police. The term also includes a senior executive officer of the AFP-that means he is a sworn member of the AFPwho can be also authorised in writing by the commissioner of police. I do not know about the case of the Hong Kong Bank of Australia Ltd v Australian Securities Commission directly-no doubt the member for Denison, being a Senior Counsel, would be more than aware of itbut I understand from the briefing notes that there was some legal point that turned on whether the Corporations Law could be read as providing a source of power. Not being a lawyer, I will not go to the briefing notes on that. I will let my learned friends take on those matters. What I understand from a layman's point of view is that there is some potential risk that a court could effectively strike down the provisions that seek to confer power in an authority making an authorisation. This bill seeks to put it beyond doubt and to ensure that where power is being exercised it is legally enforceable. I this provision will do only good in terms of law enforcement and, as a consequence, will do only good for those for whom law enforcement works on behalf of-that is, communities. We cannot expect our law enforcement agencies to do all the things that we require of them whilst their hands are tied behind their backs. I take the view that the various criminal entities out there, and certainly there are many, who are involved in crime for the purpose of money are in a form of business. I do not want to cast aspersions on businesspeople, but in the business of crime, as with any other business, you would be looking to where you could maximise your return on capital, where you could actually work out the threats that are posed to you or the industry that you are in, and you would adopt a line of least resistance, or at least a position where you could maximise your return on capital. If we have holes in our law enforcement detection systems that deprive us of using proper detection and investigative powers, we are inviting that sort of criminal business to be visited upon us in the areas where there is a void in those powers. This legislation, with the support of both sides of the parliament, seeks to redress that. This legislation seeks to ensure that Queensland police have the same powers of detection and investigative arrangements as apply to other law enforcement agencies throughout the country. This legislation does a lot to ensure that those men and women who put on their uniform and go out day to day to protect us have the powers that they need to ensure that those people who would do us harm have a lesser chance of getting away with it. I think this is a good piece of legislation. It is certainly a good piece of cooperation on both sides of the House in terms of, firstly, detecting the holes that exist in the law enforcement regimes and, secondly, cooperating believe that with a view to remedy that.",50
29,Mr SIMPKINS,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2008, because we should never take lightly the decision by law enforcement agencies to seek warrants for the interception of telecommunications. It is a very serious matter, and it is an absolutely critical aid for crime fighters. From my past experience in the Australian Federal Police, it was always my understanding that the process of obtaining warrants involved a great deal of work and that they were never handed out on mere speculative theory. This bill creates amendments that allow the inclusion of Queensland's Public Interest Monitor into the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, which will enable Queensland law enforcement agencies to come under the T(IA) Act. I think most of us here know that Queensland has always been a unique place with unique people. In fact, from a Western Australian point of view, all the other states are unique and different from mainstream Australia. I appreciate that the history of Queensland has led certain elements and the current state government to believe in the need for the unique position of the public interest monitor to act in what appears to be an oversight role of the actions of the police. That their decision and far be it from me to question what appears to be a lack of faith by the Queensland government in not only their judiciary but also the parliament itself. That is fine; that is always their call. What I do find interesting is that, when this bill is passed, apparently the police in Queensland will have to go first to the public interest monitor to discuss a warrant and if it is in the public interest before going to the courts to seek the warrant. I would imagine-although I could not find it stated anywhere-that the public interest monitor could then not discuss that matter with any other person. That would have to be a legislative safeguard or prescribed somewhere in order to protect the police investigation. I assume that it is there. I also understand that at the proceedings in court to seek a warrant the public interest monitor is also there to ensure that individual rights are preserved. I assume by that point that the public interest monitor can argue a point and that the presiding officer of the court will then make a decision on the matter. It may be my background in the Australian Federal Police and the military policeit is not in the law but it is related somewhat-but I believe that the rights of people are enshrined throughout acts of parliament. Those acts are created and amended by the duly elected representatives of the people, and these are safeguards. The police are responsible for enforcing those laws, and the magistrates and judges are responsible for administering the processes of those laws. It was always my view that if we as police did not have the evidence to support any sort of warrant then it would not be granted. If it was granted by a magistrate and the case was later heard by a court, the original decision to grant that warrant my be reassessed and evidence gained via that warrant could later be is rejected as evidence by the court. This is the normal system, by way of a simple explanation. Of course, I often share the views of my constituents that the judgments by magistrates and judges in local court cases seem to be all too often out of touch with community expectations. Recently there was a case in Perth where two teenagers, a boy aged 15 and a girl aged 14, were told to leave a railway station because they were swearing loudly, using the f-word repeatedly. Transit guards took that action for the sake of good order and for nearby passengers. It was reported that those teenagers then swore in the same manner, showed aggression and fought with the transit guards. The magistrate at the Children's Court, former Aboriginal Legal Service lawyer Deen Potter, then determined that using the f-word repeatedly did not necessitate the interference of the transit guards. The boy was convicted of kicking a guard in the stomach but, whilst resisting, his elbow was broken. It is my view that we need to maintain a certain set of standards in this country. Young people growing up in this country should not be exposed to examples of the acceptance of swearing as being normal or appropriate in everyday life. If a young person wants a good job and wants to progress, they need to know that there are many occasions where their prospects will be limited if they cannot express themselves without swearing. Their potential will not be recognised because of such a fault. The last thing we need is a magistrate and, in many ways, a setter of community standards saying that loud and offensive swearing is okay in a public place and that it is not offensive. I, doubt a majority of Australians, do not want to be subject to it. I certainly do not want my children asking me what the f-word means. As I have said repeatedly in this place, if you have a go at your children or young people for swearing, do not swear yourself at any time. Do not practise a double standard. Community leaders like that magistrate and indeed all of us should not promote low standards or, worse, the sorts of double standards epitomised as ‘do as I say, not as I do'. Swearing at police and at those authorised to protect public safety or to provide emergency health care should result in arrests. Swearing in a public place such as public transport stations should be the subject of a single warning and then exclusion from that place. These are the community standards, and I say that it is not a right to be able to swear in such places; it is in fact a responsibility of everyone not to swear in such places. Magistrate Potter has made a mistake and I hope that he has reflected on his decision. It does no individual any good when community standards are thrown away. It will not help those Aboriginal teenagers to take advantage of the opportunities provided by society if they behave in an antisocial way, refuse to comply with an appropriate request and then show aggression towards those responsible for keeping our public transport safe. The transit guards in Perth have my respect, my complete confidence and my thanks for maintaining community standards and safety. It is a pity that some community leaders do no uphold the same standards. It is unbelievable that the parents in that case have asked for an apology and compensation. They should apologise to the transit guards for being parents that have allowed their teenager to grow up with standards of offensive swearing and aggression towards public officials. That is somewhat of a digression because and no this matter is about Queensland and their processes. I have tried hard to find information and commentaries on the public interest monitor and the issues with Queensland joining in under the T(IA) Act. There seems to be some opposition from within Queensland to this occurring and I note that the Council for Civil Liberties seems to be against it. Of course, there are no surprises there. I also note that defence lawyers are against it. Surprise, surprise! Yet I think we can be sure that the vast majority of law-abiding Queenslanders are quite comfortable with the modern and highly professional Queensland police force being given every opportunity to quickly and effectively catch and prosecute criminals. I personally think they would be more comfortable with the same system the rest of the country uses without the public interest monitor, but again, that is not up to me or this federal parliament; that will remain a matter for the elected government of Queensland. It is not the intention of the opposition to oppose this bill. In fact, we support it. I remain concerned about the way Queensland will conduct the process of obtaining warrants but I will look forward to seeing how their inclusion will proceed. I remain confident that the Queensland police will conduct themselves in a manner that truly represents their concern for the people of Queensland and their safety. I also look forward to many successful prosecutions of those involved in the illicit drug trade, offences against children and, in fact, all crimes. I look forward to the capability provided under the T(IA) Act being applied effectively for the people of Queensland and I wish the Queensland police every success in the future.",51
30,Mr MCCLELLAND,INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION,"in reply-I would like to thank members for the contributions they have made in this debate on the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. At the outset I should respond to one or two comments that have been made, noting that the opposition is supporting this legislation, which the government appreciates. The member for La Trobe referred to allegations of inadequate policing at least, particularly in the area of counterterrorism. This government takes the safety and security of Australians as its primary concern. That is fundamental to the responsibility of government. I remind the honourable member that at the last budget the government provided $191 million or thereabouts to recruit 500 additional Federal Police officers. Unlike some examples that have been well aired publicly, on which I will not take up the parliament's time now, I think it is fair to say that our police, intelligence agencies and prosecution authorities have never been working as effectively, both individually but, more importantly, collectively as they have ever been in this country. The current government has done a lot of work and the agencies have done a lot of work to ensure that that occurs. They have developed operational protocols between the respective agenciesthat is, when a matter is appropriately an intelligence function, when it is appropriately a policing function and when it does move on to eventual prosecution. It is fair to say that, unlike some dramatic failures in the previous government, some successes we have seen in recent times have been a result of that cooperation. Very useful prosecution guidelines have also been developed in consultation with my department and with the agencies. Agency heads now hold regular meetings. There are regular secondments between the agencies, and there is a program for getting the intelligence and policing functions happening at street level. This was commented upon in the Clarke inquiry in respect of the Haneef matter recently. More work needs to be done in that area to get the agencies, now that they are cooperating tremendously effectively at a federal level, to enhance that cooperation with our state counterparts, but a lot of work is already underway, and it is being undertaken despite 12 years when the previous government had the opportunity of making those sorts of reforms and achieving those sorts of efficiencies. This bill is an important step in ensuring law enforcement agencies can protect the safety and security of Australians wherever they live. Currently, Queensland is the only jurisdiction whose agencies cannot seek or execute an interception warrant. Passage of this bill will clear the way for Queensland to enact legislation that satisfies the accountability obligations set out in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. By recognising a role for the public interest monitor in this act, Queensland will be able to legislate an oversight role for that body without conflicting with the Commonwealth act. The bill maintains the integrity of the interception regime by prescribing a role for the public interest monitor that recognises its importance to the oversight of police activities in Queensland while respecting the independence and integrity of decision makers, as currently set out in the act. I look forward to receiving future advice from the Queensland authorities regarding the passage of their legislation, which I understand will shortly be introduced into the Queensland parliament. I also look forward to notification that Queensland has completed the remaining statutory tasks required under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act to enable me to declare Queensland law enforcement agencies to be interception agencies. I expect this process to be completed by mid-2009. At that point, the interception regime will be for the first time truly a national scheme. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to.

34,Ms LEY,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"The Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 contains a range of measures intended to improve the efficiency of the federal court system. The measures include: introduction of a power to refer all or part of a proceeding in the Federal Court to a referee for report; amendment of the Federal Court of Australia Act to permit a single judge to make interlocutory orders in proceedings that would otherwise be heard by a full court; amendment of the International Arbitration Act 1974 to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court, concurrent with state and territory supreme courts, in matters arising under that act; permission for federal courts and tribunals to negotiate and execute leases on their own behalf; authorisation of court officers to take certain security measures in respect of court premises; and amendment of the Family Law Act to strengthen the enforceability of binding financial agreements-for example, prenuptial agreements. The opposition considers that these proposals have substantial merit. The power to refer issues to a referee for report is one that already exists in most state jurisdictions. particularly important in cases which require detailed examination of financial records or which involve complex technical issues. It has significant potential to reduce the cost and length of litigation. The power to negotiate and execute leases is a necessary component of the self-administration of courts and tribunals. That responsibility previously rested with the now defunct Department of the Arts and Administrative Services. The Attorney-General's approval is required for purchases over $1 million. I welcome the proposal to extend the court's jurisdiction in respect of international arbitration matters. Australia is a centre of excellence in respect of the provision of dispute resolution services and should continue to strengthen its position as the venue of choice for commercial disputes in our region. The Federal Court, with its superb reputation in commercial matters, should be able to play its full part in that process. The amendment in respect of binding financial agreements is a necessary corrective to the decision in Black v Black, which held that strict compliance with all of the technical requirements in the Family Law Act was a precondition to enforceability of the agreement. That decision was widely criticised. The amendment will provide that, provided a party has entered an agreement on the basis of an informed decision, the agreement will not be voided by a mere technicality. I note that this bill has been referred to Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report by 17 February. While the opposition may wish to consider any amendments recommended by that report, the bill in its current form has our in-principle support.",55
35,Mr NEUMANN,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"I rise to speak in support of the Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) It is Bill (No. 1) 2008. This bill makes a number of important amendments, but I will deal with two particular schedules: schedule 1 and schedule 5. Schedule 5 deals with the Black v Black amendments. I will go through the first one in a cursory way and the second one in detail. The first schedule deals with the Federal Court's powers, and there are a number of important measures which will approve the efficiency of the operation of the Federal Court. The idea of appointing a referee to do a report is a good initiative because much of the litigation in the Federal Court is complicated. Issues like native title, trade practice, bankruptcy and other areas are very complex. In addition, the Federal Court has a wide jurisdiction in its administration of law, dealing with all manner of federal law that is passed by the Australian federal parliament. So it is important that the Federal Courts, which deal with our Australian citizenry each and every day, be as efficient, effective, flexible and transparent as possible. The idea of appointing a referee to do a report to assist the effective management of litigation is a good initiative. In fact, it is quite common to do this. The idea of even going further and having, for example, an independent valuer on property issues or an independent expert on medical issues-a single expert-has been common in civil jurisdictions in the state courts as well as in the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates the Court. So it is very common to do this sort of thing. It is a very good idea to have a referee to assist in management if we are able thereby to reduce costs, come to an agreement and reduce the time that judges actually spend in court. It is a great cost to the Australot lian taxpayer to have a court sitting. It is not just the litigants, but also the Australian taxpayers who have to pay lots and lots of money. Resolving commercial disputes as quickly and as efficiently as possible is a good thing for our businesses, particularly in this difficult time. Getting expert advice in the sciences and trades, in native title and in other areas is crucial to aiding a judge's understanding. Judges are often lawyers, and lawyers like to think they are experts on everything, but they are not. And I have to confess that I am not. Many lawyers think they know everything about everything, but they do not, and the truth is that judges need help. Judges are not experts in areas of, say, medicine, trade or science. They are not experts on native title. They need assistance, and referees are important. Judges have practised in various areas-commercial and criminal-as barristers or solicitors, but they often do not have expertise in very difficult areas that involve expert knowledge of other areas of our community. But, of course, judges need to retain that discretion when they deal with these types of reports, and that discretion is crucial in terms of their legal effect. The idea of permitting single judges to make interlocutory orders in circumstances when the full court would otherwise sit is simply a sensible and cost efficient way to do things. In fact, in some courts, there are delegated registrars to do these sorts of things. It surprises me that we have not done this earlier. So this is a good and efficient way to deal with the management of our courts system, and that is what is dealt with in schedule 1. Schedule 5 deals with what I have described as the Black v Black amendments, which are to do with binding financial agreements. The decision of Black v Black caused a lot of media comment, a lot of comment by the Law Council of Australia and a of comment by family lawyers generally. It was an interesting decision and I will turn to it. This particular bill amends, in effect, the Black v Black decision. It deals with the validity of binding financial agreements made under part VIIIA of the Family Law Act. Those types of agreements have been in our legal system since December 2000. They are commonly known as prenuptial type agreements, but lawyers who practise in this jurisdiction call them BFAs-binding financial agreements. The average person who used to come into my law practice and ask about these sorts of things would ask me for a prenuptial agreement. But there is a problem caused by this decision, because it effectively makes the whole operation of binding financial agreements more murky and more difficult. It puts lawyers at risk in terms of law claims and it puts certainty of the resolution of property settlement and spousal maintenance matters at peril. So Black v Black is one of those decisions which the full court of the Family Court, in my view, got wrong. I think the judge in the first instance got it absolutely right. This legislation overcomes the Black v Black decision by allowing binding financial agreements to have a degree of flexibility to ensure there is confidence that if there is a technical problem in the agreement it can be overcome. The binding nature of those types of agreements is restored by this piece of amending legislation. The bill amends the Family Law Act to ensure people who have made informed decisions, got legal advice and come to an agreement before they cohabitated or before they married could then have certainty that if they separate there is a resolution as quickly and efficiently as possible. It takes out the rancour, the disputation and often a lot of the anger. So, for a lot of people, having a binding financial agreement is what they want. Having certainty is important in terms of the resolution of property settlements but also in terms of child support. People who dispute about property settlements often dispute about spousal maintenance, about where the children live, about who has contact with the children and about issues of child support. So taking the emotion out of these types of disputes as much as possible is a good thing and it is good for families who interact with the family law system in Australia and with the Child Support Agency. The family law section of the Law Council of Australia was consulted in the drafting of these amendments and they agree with what the Attorney-General is suggesting in the circumstances. I have got a bit of a confession to make: I do not much like binding financial agreements. I will tell you why. In my experience, binding financial agreements tend to result in a fair degree of injustice to the weaker finantionships. cial party, often the woman. I was called upon to draft many of these agreements by some very wealthy individuals-usually males, mainly businessmen-often with millions of dollars, sometimes tens of millions of dollars, worth of assets. They wanted to protect those assets in the event that they separated from the woman they were going to live with or whom they married. Under the old property law act, de facto relationships and cohabitation agreements were the same as binding financial agreements under the Family Law Act, in effect. I was consulted on many occasions to draft these types of agreements, and I did. I drafted dozens and dozens of them over the years. I was often consulted, particularly by women, who would seek my advice as to whether they should sign these agreements. Almost invariably I advised them not to do so, because circumstances change. When someone marries another person they think that everything is going to be rosy and they do not expect to end up consulting someone like Shayne Neumann at his family law practice, I can assure you. But the truth is that we have a situation in this country where about a third of first marriages end in separation and divorce and about half of second, third and fourth marriages end in separation and divorce. We are in a position where these people who go through the unfortunate circumstances of separation and divorce confront the resolution of property and children's issues. How do we support the children? Who looks after the children? How do we sort out the property settlement? Most people do it using part VIII of the Family Law Act. Many people, particularly high-wealth individuals, have sought the protection of binding financial agreements under part VIIIA, which was introduced into this House many years ago and passed with the consent of both sides. As I say, circumstances change in relaSometimes there are three or four children of the relationship. Sometimes someone has sacrificed whatever career they have on the altar of parenthood. They have effectively ceased to work as a schoolteacher, a lawyer, an engineer or a doctor and they have taken full-time care of their children. That is their choice, and they are not to be criticised for that. Their husband has gone on, advanced in his career, and he leaves the relationship with a high-earning capacity. So he is in a high-earning capacity situation. There are a lot of assets-a lot more than they thought they would have at the end. He has brought in more at the beginning. She is left with two, three or four children to support. If provisions have already been made in a binding financial agreement that say, ‘This is how it should be resolved in the circumstances,' it often results in an injustice to the woman, the mother of those children, because she gets less out of the property settlement than would otherwise be the case. I have yet to see too many binding financial agreements that are very generous to women in those circumstances. Sometimes they are quite generous but not often. So binding financial agreements allow people to opt out of the family law system, but the provisions under section 79 of the Family Law Act, which talk about the contribution a person makes not just of a financial and nonfinancial nature to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of matrimonial assets but as a homemaker and a parent, are effectively ignored in the circumstances of binding financial agreements. The section 75(2) factors are also ignored-age, health, entitlement to a pension, superannuation, care of children. All that is ignored binding financial agreements. But they are here to stay, and whilst they are here to stay we have to make sure that there is clarity and certainty and precision with binding financial agreements. Black v Black left the law murky. It was the wrong decision. It has created mayhem for 18 months or two years. We have seen a lot of problems as a result of that decision. People can get out of binding financial agreements. It is not like it is the law of the Medes and the Persians that cannot be changed. You can always change them if the factors come within section 90K(1) of the Family Law Act-for example, if the agreement was obtained by fraud, if there was an intention to defeat a creditor. That is the Jodee Rich-type provision put in there by the previous government, with our support. You can also change the agreement if it is void or voidable. That is the Natasha Stott Despoja amendment. It was really quite otiose. There was no need to put that subsection in there because, if it is void or voidable, it is out anyway. You can also change the agreement if there is unconscionable conduct or if there is a material change in the circumstances relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the marriage, but that has been interpreted quite narrowly by the courts. For example, there is judicial authority that, if somebody comes to a property settlement and later on the children go and live with the other party, and there is a weightage under section 75(2) of the Family Law Act in favour of that person, you cannot simply overturn it on the basis that the kids decided to up and move their place of residence. That provision has been interpreted quite narrowly. Significantly, under part VIIIA the court has no power to vary financial agreements, so there is no power of rectification. So an ineffective agreement must be set aside and the matter remitted under section 79 for conwith sideration as a normal property settlement. So the stakes in these circumstances are as high as they come for people. When you consider the hundreds of thousands of people that interact with the family law system and the Child Support Agency in this country every year, and the billions of dollars that get paid in child support, you can see this is a very serious matter for the Australian population. So what happened in Black v Black? In 2006, Justice Benjamin, in the Family Court at Hobart, was asked to consider Mr Black's application to set aside a financial agreement executed by the parties in September 2002. It was a short marriage, of 18 months, during which the parties had entered an agreement. The husband was 42 years of age and his earning capacity was affected by a back injury, for which he had received a damages claim. The wife was 41 years of age, worked part time and received a disability pension for injuries she had sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The wife had not yet received any damages for her injuries. The husband brought into the marriage approximately $200,000, which was used to purchase the former matrimonial home. When the parties separated, the total pool of assets amounted to about $347,000. When the terms of agreement were negotiated-you have to seek legal advice in relation to these sorts of matters-the husband's solicitor signed the certificate of independent legal advice and then his client signed the certificate. The wife consulted a solicitor they amended a clause and then signed the certificate of independent legal advice. The wife signed the agreement and gave the amended document to the husband, who took it back to his lawyer for some advice and then to have his signature to the amendment witnessed. But he was not provided with a further certificate of independent advice. At the date the agreement was signed, the wife had commenced a common-law personal injuries action. The agreement provided for an equal division of the existing property and of any funds received by the wife in future for the personal injuries claim. Unexpectedly, the wife received only $41,000 from her common-law claim, a much lower figure than anyone had anticipated-certainly lower than the husband had anticipated. Given his superior pre-marriage contribution of $200,000, if he had gone to the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court he could have expected to get a lot more than fifty-fifty. So what did he do? He argued that the agreement was flawed in a number of respects. He said that his solicitor had not recertified the documents in light of the additional advice, the certificates were not annexed to the agreement and the agreement did not contain within its body a statement of independent legal advice. This was a very technical argument at law. Justice Benjamin, to his credit, dismissed the application. He considered the legislature had made it very clear that binding financial agreements were to be set aside in only limited circumstances or where the parties had not obtained legal advice. He declined to entertain the husband's application, and he told the husband to go away. The husband appealed the decision and it then went to the full court of the Family Court, who overturned Justice Benjamin's and decision, construing section 90G in the most strict legal sense. They made a number of comments about the stringent requirements under the legislation. The implications to practitioners in the area and to people who had signed binding financial agreements were really stark. If you neglected to include a statement of independent legal advice in the body of the agreement, the binding financial agreement had a fatal flaw in it and it could be overturned. You could get out of it that way. So all the tens of thousands of Australians that had signed binding financial agreements since 2000 were at risk if their lawyer had stuffed up or if they had just made a little technical error. It is very difficult to support the full court's decision, when you look at good policy, certainty and precision, in the area of family law. Because they cannot rectify it, what we are doing here is allowing flexibility and amendments. I have gone through in very great detail what the decision was and what it was necessary to do in the circumstances. I will not go through what we are actually doing in detail, but we are overcoming the problems in this area by allowing flexibility and certainty. We are responding to what the Law Council of Australia asked the federal government to do in May 2008 in terms of legislative intervention to overcome the decision in Black v Black, minimise the risk to the Australian population, minimise the risk of law claims, bring certainty to the system and ensure that we have got a fair and just system and certainty in the area of family law. I commend the bill to the House.",56
36,Mr SLIPPER,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"For a number of decades after Australia federated we did not really have a federal court system other than the High Court of Australia, and a decision was made to increasingly have federal courts to look after the administration and judgements on federal matters. The Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 contains a range of measures designed to improve the efficiency of the federal court system. I am one of those who believe that maybe it was not the right decision to create a whole raft of federal courts, and that it would have been better and more efficient for state courts to do what they had done previously and exercise federal jurisdiction where this is possible, with the High Court being the final court of appeal in Australia. Having said that, I think the horse has bolted. The federal court system is well and truly entrenched and it is therefore incumbent upon elected representatives to make sure that the federal court system works as efficiently as it possibly can-and it is always a work in progress. You have a situation where laws might well be appropriate at the time they were introduced but time moves on. Time waits no man-or woman, I suppose I should say now, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke-and it is necessary to update and relook at the laws. Thus the Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008, in seeking to improve the efficiency of the federal court system, includes a number of measures-one of which is the introduction of a power to refer all or part of a proceeding in the Federal Court to a referee for report. This is eminently sensible. Judges' time is very valuable, and sometimes a referee is a person with great levels of expertise in an area. Particularly given the situation with the global economic crisis, it is important that disputes, including commercial disputes, are resolved as expeditiously as possible and this measure to permit the referral of all or part of a proceeding in the Federal Court to a referee for report is a positive step forward. It will improve efficiency and no reasonable person could object to this aspect of the bill. The bill will also amend the Federal Court of Australia Act to permit a single judge to make interlocutory orders in proceedings that would otherwise be heard by a full court. Again, this is an efficiency measure. Again, it is a streamlining measure. It is an opportunity for one judge to do what previously three or more judges were required to do and it makes very sound common sense. The bill also seeks to amend the International Arbitration Act 1974 to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court concurrent with state and territory supreme courts in matters arising under that act. The bill also permits federal courts and tribunals to negotiate and execute leases on their own behalf-and many of us would ask why that was not possible before. The bill authorises court officers to take certain security measures in respect of court premises and the Family Law Act is also amended to strengthen the enforceability of binding financial agreements-that is, prenuptial agreements-and that matter was dealt with quite substantially by the honourable member for Blair, who spoke previously. This is one of those bills which is supported by honourable members on both sides of the House. Given the combative nature of our political system there is a perception in the Australian community that everything a government does, the opposition opposes. Yet if one did a survey of legislation passing through the parliament, overwhelmingly most of that legislation would pass with the support of both sides of politics. This legislation includes amendments to various acts and because it is difficult to get bills on the legislative timetable-and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister would be aware of this-ministers and departments tend to often have omnibus bills to make huge numbers of changes to various bills, because often they have only one bite of the cherry. When they get a bill before the House and get the legislation considered by the parliament, they may as well seek to make whatever changes need to be made in the area of the law being considered. The referral of matters to a referee for port will be particularly efficient and useful in many cases, including where technical expertise is required, and the Bill's Digest actually points out in greater depth some of the reasons for these particular changes. It does not matter, I suppose, how good a judge is. No judge can be an expert in all technical aspects of every level of human existence, and that is why the referral to a referee on many occasions can be very positive. The decision to enable single judges to make interlocutory orders will also help to manage cases. It will help to bring litigation to a speedy conclusion with a reduction in delays and, most importantly, a reduction in costs. Schedule 2 of the bill amends the International Arbitration Act to give the Federal Court concurrent jurisdiction with state and territory courts in a range of areas. Again, this legislation will make sure that the Federal Court is able to play its important role, particularly in the area of commercial litigation. There are a number of other changes, including the one that the member for Blair spent a considerable portion of his contribution outlining. The decision in Black v Black was one which, without wanting to criticise the courts, is difficult to understand and this amendment in the Federal Justice System (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 is positive and important. In these difficult economic times it is always necessary to look at the financial impact of legislation. I am advised that this proposed bill will not have any significant financial impact. Along with other members of the Liberal-National opposition, I am very pleased to support this bill. I commend the Attorney-General on introducing this legislation and I trust that it will have a speedy passage through both houses of the Australian parliament.",60
37,Mr SIMPKINS,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"I think we would all agree that it has been a relong and interesting day. We all enjoyed the evening activities. I was indulgent, personally, and had some sleep from about 1.30. I woke up suddenly early this morning and turned on the TV to observe what was happening here. I thought it was a nightmare, but in fact it was the Treasurer speaking. That signalled my opportunity to speak on the $42 billion cash splash was gone. But let us not linger on that; we will see what the future holds.",62
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,Let's not. Let's refer to the bill before us at the moment.,62
39,Mr SIMPKINS,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think it is important that we move on. This afternoon I would like to speak on Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008. Good government is about effectiveness and efficiency. The federal justice system should be able to embrace these very same responsible qualities. This bill contains a variety of proposals which are meant to increase the efficiency of our Federal Court system by resolving disputes as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible. That is great and, obviously, as others have said, the opposition, the Liberal-National Party team, are completely in support of this bill. This bill gives powers to refer issues to a referee to report upon, which is already the case in most state jurisdictions, thus allowing the system to possibly reduce the cost and duration of court cases. It further provides flexibility and more efficient use of federal judicial resources, which in turn can enable the timely resolution of disputes for all parties concerned. Promoting efficiency reduces undue delays by normal, reasonable procedural issues. This bill also gives more power to negotiate and execute leases as required for the self-administration of courts and tribunals, as it should. On international arbitration, the amendment will specifically state that the Federal Court of Australia has concurrent jurisdiction with other state and territory courts to enforce foreign arbitral awards. It further enables the federal government to enforce a foreign award as though it was an award of the Federal Court. In respect of binding financial rate agreements, this amendment corrects the act in reference to the Black v Black decision, which has received a lot of very informed comment today, so I will go no further in that regard. Provided that a party has entered an agreement on the basis of an informed decision, that agreement will not be voided by mere technicality. Specifically, it will clarify and simplify what each spouse party is provided with before signing a financial agreement and what each party is required to have prior to signing a termination agreement. Additionally, the same will apply to de facto partners. As for security measures in respect of court premises, we need to admit that the world today is a different place to what it was even back in 2000. It is imperative that court officers are to be allowed to take certain reasonable security measures, including removal or search if necessary in the interests of security on premises, if those premises are likely to be occupied on a permanent or temporary basis in connection with the operations of the Federal Court. The bill reduces red tape and promotes common sense and efficient yet binding rules of operating the courts, which are already dealing with many different kinds of cases, as stated in the bill, from complex corporate or commercial cases to social security matters and even migration cases. I think this bill will assist in streamlining procedures and encouraging innovative approaches in order to significantly reduce both the time and cost of litigation. It is not my intention to pass comment on each of the details of this bill, but I would like to take some time to speak on the matter of courtroom and court building security, and by implication the security of magistrates and judges. Although I was never a lawyer, I did work for a period of time investigating security incidents in the court system in Perth. Also, through my time in the Australian Federal Police, I had some security duties at the then Family Court in Parramatta, Sydney. I would like to spend a few more minutes to help out-as I was asked to!-by drawing on the experiences that I had in Perth while conducting these investigations. Some may recall an incident in Perth involving the mass break-out from the Supreme Court. That was a tragic and unfortunate error which was very bad for the city of Perth and led to, I believe, nine serious inmates being out on the streets. I also had the unenvious position of helping to investigate a death in custody and several self-harm incidents by persons in custody. In all these cases, there were common features: either there was a procedure that was not up to scratch or the procedures that were there were not properly adhered to. This is a very important matter. In the state criminal system, I am afraid to say, there are some people who are not very nice; there are some society might even call evil. Nevertheless, there is a duty of care that needs to be complied with and there is also the duty to society to make sure that these people are properly secured. While there were some contributing factors of equipment failures or other problems that you would never allocate as a fault of an individual, it was certainly the case that most incidents were related to mistakes individuals made. Again, barring the intention of people to commit self-harm, and to achieve a self-harm in one case, things could have always been done a little better. In the circumstances we are talking about today, where we are talking about federal courts, you might ordinarily think that you are not likely to see a serious criminal jumping from the dock and climbing up to pass the judge or magistrate and then pushing him out of the way, as unfortunately happened on one occasion. Nevertheless, in the Federal Court system emotion is still there. People feel strongly about certain events and, while maybe escape is not one of the motives of people in these courtrooms, it would certainly be the case that there are seriously grieved parties that might take bad decisions that could lead them into more trouble by assaulting another party to the matter, assaulting a magistrate or even assaulting a member of the public in the vicinity. I would always advocate that, when talking about security in the court system, you must always think about two things: the hardwarethe way the courtrooms and the buildings are built, and the security systems within those buildings-and the procedures as well. It is normally in the procedures and in a failure to adhere to the procedures that risks are realised and people possibly hurt. That should never be acceptable and we should always try to do better. I have wandered somewhat widely this afternoon, and I appreciate your indulgence in this matter. I would like to finish by saying that we on the opposition side fully support these amendments and we look forward to their implementation for best practice and the benefit of all involved.",62
40,Mr OAKESHOTT,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"I rise also to support the Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 and, with the Attorney-General now in the chamber, I can assume I will be brief. My reason for speaking is that, in an electorate like the mid-North Coast of New South Wales and in a country like Australia with the rule of law in place, one of the critical components of the delivery of public policy and the delivery of law is that fundamental human right called ‘access to justice'. These efficiency measures fundamentally allowing single judges to put in place interlocutory orders and allowing for the appointment of referees are all welcome efficiency measures in the delivery of timely justice. I do place a watching brief, however, on the difficult balancing act that comes with access to justice, and that is to make sure that agthis is about better judicial outcomes for members of the broader community of Australia and, in my particular case, the midNorth Coast. That is the very meaning of the word ‘efficiency' in the title of the bill, rather than some sort of resource efficiency from government in a roundabout way denying full access to the law by saving on pennies from a government point of view. It is on the first definition of efficiency that I support this bill. It is important legislation for communities such as mine. The Federal Court does visit the mid-North Coast and there is a significant backlog at times, so anything that can improve that and provide a more timely delivery of justice is certainly welcome within my region and will hopefully deliver better outcomes for the nation. Debate (on motion by Mr Albanese) adjourned. NA Rearrangement",64
41,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"by leave-I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent government business today continuing past 2 p.m. and being interrupted at 2.30 p.m. for Question Time. The Council of Australian Governments meeting has just concluded. The press conference between the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers began a matter of minutes ago. I have spoken to the Manager of Opposition Business and it has been agreed that this would be appropriate, given the importance of the COAG meeting. I should also note, and give notice, that after question time is commenced I will move whatever procedural resolutions are necessary to enable ministerial statements to be given after the conclusion of the matter of public importance debate. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (EFFICIENCY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",64
42,Mr MCCLELLAND,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"in reply-I would like to thank members for their contribution to the debate. The Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 contains a range of measures which demonstrate the government's commitment to making the federal courts more flexible, minimising the costs of litigation and improving access to the justice system for all Australians. As I said when introducing this bill, court efficiency is important if we are ensure that the cost of justice remains proportionate to the relief being sought. The measures in this bill are consistent with the government's long standing commitment to measures to improve access to justice. The government is taking action including addressing the cost of justice. There is a broad range of work for further reforms in this area. This includes working with the federal courts to develop enhanced case management powers and asking the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council to report on strategies to ensure greater use of appropriate alternative dispute resolution options, both as an alternative to civil proceedings and also during the proceedings with a view to resolving the issues in dispute. I note that this morning the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs a wide range of matters relating to the justice system. This unfocused, sprawling inquiry is both unnecessary and a highly dubious use of Senate time and public resources. The government has already taken action in the vast majority of proposed areas for inquiry, including consulting with all interested stakeholders, including the courts and the profession and also consumers of legal services. While the government is taking decisive action to promote access to justice and ensuring public confidence in our justice system, the Greens and the opposition appear content to embark on an inquiry into a rambling grab-bag of issues. Importantly, further to the government's commitment to ensuring that the justice system uses public resources with maximum effectiveness to assist people to resolve their disputes, the bill gives the Federal Court greater flexibility in obtaining expert assistance, particularly in complex and technical matters. It empowers the court to refer all or part of the proceedings to an appropriately to qualified person for report. We have indicated that that power will be particularly valuable in a number of areas including, for instance, in respect of native title. This procedural flexibility, combined with the referee's specialist expertise, will allow the referee to quickly get to the core of the technical issues and reduce costs and delays for litigants, and this will enable the court to more effectively and efficiently manage large gation. Of course, the court is not bound to accept the findings of the referee, and the legal effect of the report is a matter for the court's discretion. The bill responds to the decision of the full court of the Family Court of Australia in Black v Black. The bill amends the Family Law Act in particular to limit the technical requirements that people need to meet to enter into prenuptial agreements, while still providing necessary protections to parties, such as the requirement to obtain legal advice. It will restore confidence in the binding nature and enforceability of financial and termination agreements under the Family Law Act. The bill gives the Federal Court concurrent jurisdiction with state and territory courts for all matters arising under the Interoperating national Arbitration Act. This increases the choice of forum for litigants and puts the Federal Court in a better position to operate as a regional hub for commercial litigation by developing consistent practice across Australia. To allow the Federal Court to more effectively manage cases and avoid unnecessary delays for litigants, the bill enables a single judge of the court to make an interlocutory order in proceedings that otherwise would be required to be heard before a full bench. The bill promotes the efficient administration and management of federal courts and tribunals by removing unnecessary and outof-date restrictions on the heads of the Family Court, Federal Court, Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Native Title Tribunal from acquiring assets in land for the purposes of the Lands Acquisition Act. That will streamline costs and procedures. It also makes it clear to Federal Court officers and also to the public the areas in which authorised officers can exercise power under the liti- Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act in the interests of court security where the Federal Court is sitting on open land or in buildings other than its usual premises. This will have particular application when the Federal Court sits on country, for instance, to hear native title matters, or where a court may move into other temporary premises. I note the member for Fisher's view on the federal courts and take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work done by these courts on a wide range of matters. It is my hope that the measures in this bill will enhance the Federal Court's status as a regional hub for dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region. In conclusion, the amendments in this bill reflect the government's strong commitment to ensuring that the federal justice system is as effectively and as efficiently as possible and is responsive to the needs of litigants. I thank all members who have participated in the debate, and the shadow minister, who has come into the House for this conclusion, and I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",65
43,Mr MCCLELLAND,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT (CRIMINAL JURISDICTION) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 December, on motion by Mr MCClelland: That this bill be now read a second time.",66
44,Ms LEY,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"I rise to speak on the Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008. This bill was introduced at the same time as the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. That bill provides for the criminalisation of cartel conduct, including penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment, and will necessitate the creation of an indictable criminal jurisdiction in the Federal Court for the of offences. Other Commonwealth offences are heard in the state and territory courts. The Federal Court is to be invested with this jurisdiction because of its extensive experience with civil and quasi-criminal cartel cases under the current Trade Practices Act. However, I understand that, where prosecutions involve offences under both the cartel provisions and state or territory law or other Commonwealth offences to which this bill does not apply, state or territory superior courts will be able to hear those matters without the offences being disjoined. The amendments proposed in this bill provide for the complex procedural framework required by the new jurisdiction, including the form of indictments, entry of pleas, bail, pretrial proceedings, empanelment of juries, conduct of trials, sentencing and appeals. The procedural provisions have been modelled upon existing state and territory provisions and will apply in all Federal Court trials, regardless of where the trial is being conducted. For consistency, in this area of law at least, this is preferable plying the procedural and evidentiary provisions of the relevant state or territory. While the criminalisation of serious cartel conduct and the creation of the framework to deal with it have the opposition's support, we have serious reservations about two aspects of this bill. The first of these concerns the accused's right to silence. Proposed section 23CF requires an accused who takes issue with a fact, matter or circumstance disclosed in the prosecution's case to state the basis for doing so. This may compromise an accused's right to silence. The justification stated in the explanatory memorandum is that this will permit the court to narrow the issues to be dealt with at trial. However, efficiency is not an adequate justification for dispensing with trial age-old rights, especially such important human rights as the right of an accused to remain silent. Alternatives exist, using the examples from other Australian jurisdictions. A provision such as that applicable in New South Wales could be adopted, which allows such a procedure unless it will cause prejudice to the defence. Alternatively, there should be no adverse consequences flowing from the accused's nondisclosure, which is the practice in Victoria. The second issue concerns the presumption in favour of bail, which has also existed under our law since ancient times. The proposed section 58DA provides that, if the court refuses to grant bail, the accused cannot make a subsequent application unless there has been a significant change in circumstances. This is more onerous than the provisions applying in any other Australian jurisdiction. Proposed section 58DB is also silent as to whether there is any presumption in favour of bail. In other jurisdictions there is generally a presumption in favour of bail except in specific circumstances. There is also no provision in this bill for the court to to approvide reasons for refusing bail. The right to silence and the presumption in favour of bail are among the individual human rights recognised and protected by our common law for centuries. For a government such as this one, which paints itself as having a human rights focus, it is curious to say the least that its first attempt at a federal criminal jurisdiction would seek to sweep away rights recognised since the Magna Carta. This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on 4 December 2008 for inquiry and report by 20 February 2009. Submissions have been received from, among others, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, the Law Council of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria and the Criminal Bar Association of Victoria. Some of these submissions have been highly critical of the issues I have described. The opposition will not deny this bill a second reading in this place. What we will do is await the full report and recommendations of the Senate committee, with the benefit of expert submissions, and seek in the Senate to achieve the appropriate balance in this bill.",67
45,Mr NEUMANN,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"I rise to speak in support of the Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008. This bill is a cognate bill with Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. It should be enacted at the same time to avoid delays in bringing criminal prosecutions for very serious cartel offences in the Federal Court. This is what the Australian population would call white-collar crime. Price fixingengaging in anticompetitive and anti-freemarket behaviour in the marketplace-by companies is simply unacceptable to the Australian community and to my community in the federal electorate of Blair. They want to know that when they go into the supermarkets the prices have not been fixed between the big players. They want to know that when they go to the petrol bowsers the big petrol companies have not got together and rigged the price. They want to know that when they go to purchase a new motor vehicle deals have not been done to prevent the best possible price being offered. The laws of supply and demand, the laws of the market, should operate to ensure that the Australian public get the best possible price for the produce, goods and services they purchase. This bill is about ensuring that those kinds of cartel behaviours are dealt with the way the Australian community expects them to be. For a long time white-collar crime was treated less onerously and punitively than blue-collar crime was. The media often portrays blue-collar crime sensationally. You only have to look at news reports, at the 6 pm news on a Sunday night, to see that it is all about blue-collar crime. But many people engaged in white-collar crime, cartel type behaviour, often seem to be punished with lesser punishments, and that rankles. It irks and irritates the Australian community that the big fish seem to get away. Having a criminal jurisdiction in federal law that deals with indictable offencesserious criminal behaviour and serious antithe competitive behaviour-is a good legislative reform and a good criminal law reform which will enable the Australian community's faith in the criminal justice system to be reinforced. Too often they feel that the big guy gets away with it. They feel that they are powerless and that if you have got enough money you can get away with anything. Having a criminal jurisdiction in the federal law which prosecutes companies and individuals for serious cartel offences is important to the integrity of the criminal justice system and the Australian people's faith in the criminal law in this country. It is also important because for too long we have had state and supreme courts dealing with areas like this in more costly ways. Often it costs a lot more to go to the Supreme Court of Queensland than, say, the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia or the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, because the procedures in federal law are often more streamlined and geared to early resolution. I know that in Queensland we have uniform civil procedures rules but they are more onerous than the areas of federal law. So bringing criminal law into the federal jurisdiction is the right thing in terms of cost, effectiveness and the expedition of justice. Having a uniform indictable criminal procedure across Australia is right; it is the way to go. My state of Queensland had a dingo fence-legally, in terms of the practice of law-which was eventually knocked down. The truth of the matter is that we have a system of laws in this country with state law based in the states and the complication of federal law with it. I am sure our founding fathers would have thought differently looking at Australia in the 21st century than they did in the 1890s. We are left with what we are left with, and so we have to deal with the system that we have in terms of state and federal relations and the interaction of crimieral nal law. Criminal law, generally, is dealt with in the state systems at the magistrates court. If you go to any magistrates court or court of petty sessions around this country you will see people there on a regular basis-heaps of them-with duty solicitors and legal aid lawyers there to give advice. Most of it is real blue-collar stuff and mostly, if you have practised in the area of criminal law, you have dealt with really small stuff. It is the really complicated, difficult business records, commercial relations and corporate structures that are hard to really get into. They not appeal to the 6 pm news on Sunday night. It is too easy to talk about someone hitting someone, someone running over someone or someone abducting someone. It is easy to do that in 30 seconds on Channel 9, Channel 7 or Channel 10. But the sorts of criminal behaviours that people have got away with for a long time should be dealt with in the federal law. If we are dealing with serious criminal behaviour and trade practices legislation it should be dealt with by the Federal Court. Giving the Federal Court indictable criminal jurisdiction is the way to go. It is consistent with our responsibilities as federal members of parliament, it is consistent with the integrity of the Federal Court system and it is the right thing to do, to have a uniform system around the country. The Federal Court is being given this jurisdiction because it has significant expertise with cartel conduct in civil jurisdiction. The state courts-supreme, district and magistrate-simply do not have the expertise. There is not the jurisprudence or the history of the body of case law and precedent that the Federal Court has. Giving the power to the state courts would not have been the sensible thing to do. Giving power to the FedCourt was the right call. Having a uniform set of procedures will remove the need for judges and officers of the Federal Court to become familiar with the very different sets of rules and procedures for every Australian state and territory. I feel fortunate that I practised law in South-East Queensland in the BrisbaneIpswich area. It would be dreadful to be practising at Coolangatta or Tweed Heads and having to deal with across-the-border issues all the time. You have to be familiar with the different rules and regulations you face if you go across the border between do Coolangatta and Tweed Heads. Getting uniform procedures in this country in terms of federal law in criminal jurisdiction is the right call for us. It is not the case that you expect a judge who practised in commercial and criminal law in Brisbane-perhaps a QC-to know what the situation is in Tasmania. Having a uniform system of rules and procedures will ensure that you do not have to familiarise yourself with the rules and procedures relating to the law in Tasmania. It is consistent with the efficient, effective good operation of our court system. It means that judges will become very familiar with rules and regulations. If you had appeared before any federal magistrate or Family Court judge who dealt with the rules and regulations under those particular pieces of governing legislation-the Family Law Act and the Federal Magistrates Act-you would have seen that those judges and federal magistrates became very familiar with those laws, procedures and rules. I have appeared before many of them, and I know they are able to quote chapter and verse in a snap because they are used to it. But the hypothetical QC from Brisbane who is now a Federal Court judge would not necessarily know what the criminal practice and jurisdiction procedures in Tasmania are and would have to learn them. So it is important we get uniformity. The best features of the state and territory criminal law procedures have been identified by the Federal Court, by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and by the Law Council of Australia. So there has been extensive consultation with stakeholders in the circumstances. No-one can say they have not been consulted, and we have got the best possible outcome in the circumstances. The Federal Court has been given the full range of powers it needs to conduct this jurisdiction, to exercise indictable criminal jurisdiction for serious cartel offences. You can imagine what will happen in these types of cases. They will be very similar to what you would have seen if you had gone through, regrettably and unfortunately, criminal charges against you for common assault, indecent dealing or use of illicit drugs. So the procedures would be very similar. In those state jurisdictions, on serious matters that go to the Supreme Court, say, being charged with an offence such as comand mitting murder, you go through a Magistrates Court procedure, a pretrial procedure, a committal type procedure. There is bail, there is empanelling of juries, there is conducting of trials, there is the sentencing if convicted, with sentencing reports that go to the psychological or psychiatric condition of the perpetrator. There is the victim's response-people also can have the opportunity to say how they have been affected. And there is the opportunity for appeal. In some of the Commonwealth court buildings I have been to around the country we really have not taken enough notice of the actual layout of the building. In some of those court buildings, and I think particularly in Brisbane, South-East Queensland, where I come from, there really needs to be some thought given to the layout. I heard a previous speaker talking about his experiences as a police officer in security for the courts, which is very important. But we need to think better about how we set out our courts. If we are going to give the Federal Court jurisdiction and they are going to empanel jurors, we had better have a good, hard look at how we actually physically arrange the courts. A lot of the courts I have been into really have not got seating and accommodation and are not set up to deal with these types of matters. They are mainly dealing with civil matters, less contentious matters in terms of people's liberty-bankruptcy, trade practices, family law-and they do not necessarily have all the seating arrangements and the security that we need for jurors. So we are going to have to think long and hard and very seriously about protecting people, and their identities as well. We have to think about accommodation for jurors. There are 12 people. There is the bailiff. Where are they going to go? What rooms are going to be provided? We have to think seriously about how we construct the physical layout of the courts, the number of rooms, the security aspects, because we are dealing with very serious matters here. We will have to spend some extra money on setting up our courts. I expect some changes. I expect there will be some discussions about how many extra dollars we will have to spend. It might be good for employment of tradesmen, I imagine, because we are going to have to make some changes. When we are dealing with these types of matters and dealing with complex anticompetitive behaviour, we are really dealing with matters that impact upon people's lives. It is not some airy-fairy thing. When consumers go to purchase goods, they want to know that those goods are being offered at a fair price and at the best price. They want to know also, as I said before, that if people have rigged the price of those goods, if people have acted in an oligopolistic way, in an antiefficient. competitive way, in a cartel type way, they are going to be prosecuted. They want to know they can have faith that if people do these sorts of things they will be dealt with. I want to applaud the Law Council of Australia for what they have done here. They have been a very constructive partner in law reform in this country. We have seen their input in some of the legislation that has gone through the House of Representatives today. The officers of the Federal Court and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have also played an important role in these changes as well. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions I am sure has had a big say in how this has gone ahead, and the Australian Federal Police and the office of the Privacy Commissioner too. I have heard a couple of comments made by the member for Farrer in relation to some of the changes in the legislation and how it might impact upon people and their lives. It is interesting that a representative of the previous government talked about the Magna Carta. I do not think that the previous government had a particularly good record when it came to dealing with people in adverse or difficult circumstances, particularly those who came to this country on leaky boats fleeing oppressive regimes and were put in detention in some terrible locations. I do not think on this side of the House we are to be lectured when it comes to the rights of individuals by representatives of the previous Howard government on these types of matters. I do think it is important to have efficiency in our systems and I do not think that we are looking at a significant abrogation of the right to silence. We are dealing with very serious matters. We are talking about imprisonment for 10 years. These are very serious offences and we have to treat them seriously. We have to make sure our court system is We have to make sure our prosecution services are well financed and our police are given the powers they need to stamp out this sort of behaviour. They need to have the same sort of resourcing that the Australian Taxation Office has got in Operation Wickenby. We need to resource the Australian Federal Police well and resource the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions well and we need to ensure that the court has an efficient way to go about it. I do not think that the Australian public think that if a person has been denied bail that they should then be able to turn around a second, third or fourth time and make an application for bail again. If you are engaged in these types of behaviours, you often have lots of resources. Often it is directors of very big companies that we are going to be prosecuting because they have the resources to engage in these types of behaviours. If they can afford silks, expensive lawyers, they can afford to run into court every day of the week and argue why they should get bail. A provision which says that if they have been denied bail once they can then only make an application a second time if there is a significant change in circumstance is consistent with other law practices. Material change in circumstance is the sort of thing that justifies people revisiting other cases, for example. We have dealt with family law today in this House. In family law, you can bring applications to vary certain settlements if there has been a material change in circumstance. Material change in circumstance is one of the bases for revisiting an order in relation to contact with children-what we used to call ‘custody' many years ago. The Australian public know what that really means. They do not expect the court system to be clogged up by rich litigants able to afford high-priced lawyers to bring in applications every day of the week just because they do not like one judge who denied them bail. I think that the member for Farrer's concerns are misconceived and that she is wrong. I think the Australian public believe in a fair go and that people should have their day in court. If someone is denied bail then they can make an application again once their circumstances change, but not every day. I think it is important that there is integthat rity, consistency and efficiency in our court system. People who are charged with criminal offences have the right to legal representation and their day in court. Any of us who go through these types of criminal procedures because of ourselves, our friends or our families know what impact they have on people's lives. I do not believe the concerns of the other side are-(Time expired)",68
46,Mr SLIPPER,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"I do not intend to delay the House long with this contribution. The Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008 is the first time that any government has introduced criminal jurisdiction to the Federal Court. When I addressed the parliament in relation to the Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 just a short time ago, I outlined how for many decades in Australia we did not actually have a federal court system other than the High Court and that the state courts used to exercise federal jurisdiction. I personally believe that was a better model. But, having said that, we now have a large number of federal courts of various types, including the Federal Court of Australia. The Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008, as was indicated by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech, has been introduced at the same time as the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. As the Attorney pointed out, the latter bill will amend the Trade Practices Act to introduce new offences for serious cartel conduct. Honourable members have spoken at length about the seriousness of cartel conduct and how the Federal Court, because of its civil experience with cartel conduct, should be the appropriate court to deal with criminal matters flowing on from sort of behaviour. Currently the state and territory courts have that jurisdiction and I am yet to be convinced that it is an appropriate way to go to invest, for the first time ever, the Federal Court with this sort of criminal jurisdiction. The government tells us that it does not have any intention of expanding the criminal jurisdiction of the Federal Court beyond this matter, but once you accept the government's decision you will see the bill quite logically seeks to set up all of the infrastructure to enable the Federal Court to carry out this role as a criminal court. The member for Blair talked about the need to have appropriate provisions for juries and so on. I think that, given the fact that the Federal Court is being invested with criminal jurisdiction in only one particular area, the cost of doing this certainly outweighs the benefits. There has been discussion on how judges cannot be experts on different sorts of evidentiary requirements around the country, but we have a system that works now and which I believe is not broken. If it is not broken, why seek fix it? I may well not be in a majority with my attitude to the Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008 but, having said that, I wanted to make the point. I would, however, like to endorse the remarks made by the member who led the debate for the opposition, the honourable member for Farrer, when she spoke about the serious impingement on human rights and civil rights in this bill. When he spoke, the member for Blair addressed us at length about how some of these defendants would be extremely wealthy, able to hire quite costly Queen's Counsels and other senior barristers, and that somehow it was wrong to enable them to make applications for bail on more than one occasion-the way he put it was ‘day after day'. I believe that in a democratic society civil rights are so important that, whatever virtue the member for Blair may have in his argument, civil rights really are very much more important. Having said that, this is legislation which is supported by both sides of the House. I imagine that it will be carried pretty quickly by this place, given the example of the lation last night, and I suspect by the other house as well.",72

48,Mr RUDD,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise to provide the House with an update on the Queensland flooding situation. In recent weeks and months Queenslanders have faced severe storms, tropical cyclones and extensive flooding. Today, 62 per cent of Queento sland is under water and 35 shires have been declared eligible for disaster assistance. The damage bill is over $100 million and is climbing. In Ingham, the Herbert River is over 12 metres. I understand that many homes have been significantly damaged by floodwaters. A number of towns across the state are now completely isolated, and it is not over yet. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast that more rain and another tropical cyclone are on the way. The government has been monitoring the situation closely. Last night I spoke with the Queensland Premier, who shared the devastating impact of the flooding across the state with me. The Premier informs me that Queensland's disaster management system is now in full swing. The government is currently providing a range of assistance to Queensland and I confirm our readiness to provide additional assistance should it be required. Commonwealth financial assistance is already being provided under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the NDRRA, to assist with emergency food, accommodation, essential repairs and hardship grants. This morning the Australian legis- government's disaster response plan, COMDISPLAN, was activated to enable our defence forces to transport aviation fuel from Townsville to Ingham to assist in supporting rescue and relief efforts. The Commonwealth stands ready to provide additional assistance to Queensland should the state government's resources become exhausted. On behalf of all Australians I offer our thoughts and our prayers to all those Queenslanders affected today by these floods.",73
49,Mr TURNBULL,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise today in support of the Prime Minister's remarks regarding the floods in North, Far North and north-west Queensland. Honourable members would be aware that Cyclone Charlotte, which crossed the coast coming in from the Gulf of Carpentaria earlier this year, was followed this last week by Cyclone Ellie, which authorities are anxiously monitoring, concerned that it may reform in the next 24 to 48 hours. These enormous downpours have resulted in rail, roads and many towns being cut off. The town of Ayr, the hometown of opposition spokesperson for Northern Australia, Senator Ian Macdonald, has today been cut off from road and rail. Earlier this week, as the rain poured, the senator remarked that volumes of water the equivalent of Sydney Harbour itself were poring over the Burdekin dam and down the Burdekin River not far from where he lives. Karumba, a fishing port in the Gulf which has become a popular tourist destination, has been isolated except for by helicopter for six weeks. We are told that this may continue for another month. Townsville has been cut off by road in all directions, and last night a freighter left Townsville for Cairns to deliver supplies. We in this House pay tribute today to the incredible dedication, diligence and bravery of our emergency services personnel. Many of these men and women will be at or near the point of exhaustion in their struggle to deal with the challenge of getting vital supplies and emergency assistance to the affected areas. Most of them are volunteers, and we extend the nation's gratitude to them for their tireless contribution. Australians strong and resilient people and as we know there are none stronger or more resilient than those who live in the north of our great nation. They know that nature can be fickle. As Senator Macdonald said earlier in the week, they have learnt how to live with these natural calamities; it is part of the wet season and they know how to deal with it. But the nation too pulls together behind them and supports them as they respond to these natural disasters and supports them and honours them for their heroism and for their hard work.",74
50,Mr TRUSS,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I thank the House and would like to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in their remarks about the flooding in north Queensland. It is an extraordinary commentary on the climate of our great continent that so much of Australia is enduring incredible heat, that the rivers in the Murray and in the south are dry and that much of our country is drought declared, yet 62 per cent of Queensland is flooded. The Gulf rivers join from one to the other; there is water in abundance but it is not where people want it, when they want it. The people of those regions respond stoically to these kinds of circumstances. We have seen pictures on our televisions of people in towns like Ingham and thereabouts battling the floodwaters through their homes. I have also seen appalling pictures of the loss of livestock across the Gulf and the hardship that is being endured by many people through those regions. Our hearts are certainly with those people. I commend the Prime Minister on his announcement today of the willingness of the government to provide support wherever they can. He can be assured of the support of the whole of the parliament in those initiatives. The people in these more remote parts of Australia particularly appreciate assistance when it comes. are Whilst they will fend for themselves bravely as they always do, it is important to them to also know that they have the support of the people in this parliament, the government and the people of Australia.",74
51,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, very briefly, I thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party for their words. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Emergency Management Australia. A number of officers remained awake around the clock, as one or two of us did last night. I would also like to thank the Australian defence forces, and acknowledge that my colleague the Minister for Defence, whose company I enjoy in this House, has been of tremendous assistance in that respect. While we have focused this day on the floods, we should also recognise the tremendous work of all governments and also all agencies in respect of the devastating bushfires that have recently confronted Victoria. Again, there is an indication, as is always the case in Australia, of cross-party support, of cross-government support, working with volunteers and very impressive professionals to assist Australians to cope with these sorts of natural disasters.

I ask the Prime Minister why he himself was not able to rise this morning to vote for it?",75
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to leadership from the Australian Liberal Party, it seems we must turn to the Liberal leader of Western Australia alone, who, today, with every Premier in the country and the chief ministers of the two territories, agreed to a new national plan to implement this national stimulus package and, furthermore, decided to pitch in and do their bit to support this economy, families and jobs, given the global economic recession which is unfolding. I would say this to the Leader of the Opposition: that is what leadership is about. And I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the following: that on votes relating to legislation, which occurred on 116 occasions during the last term of the Howard government, the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was absent on 110 occasions. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",75
55,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the importance of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan and the need for all Australians to work together to see Australia through the global economic recession we now confront?,75
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we have seen in the last 24 hours are two approaches to national leadership-one which says that we should put aside our party political differences, put aside the differences between federal and state governments and work together in the national interest. That is what has been at work since nine o'clock this morning over there at the meeting of the Council of AustraI re- lian Governments-governments, federal and state, governments, Labor and Liberal, agreeing on a course of action to deal with the impact on Australia of a global economic recession, which Australians are not responsible for. That is one model of national leadership. The other model of non-leadership is what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party, who have, instead, decided to stand to one side and simply consign all Australians to have to deal with the impact of this global economic recession on their lives, their jobs, their businesses without any protection from government. That is what those opposite have decided to do. Why have they decided to do that? Because the political interests of the Leader of the Liberal Party have been put first and the national interest has been put last. The politiwork cal interests of the Leader of the Liberal Party are along these lines. He really does hope that the global economic recession-a recession which he has already hauled up the white flag on-worsens so that in a year's time he can turn around and say, ‘Well, you couldn't fix that.' That is what this political opportunism is all about. It is not national leadership; it is simply an exercise in political tactics. If it were just electoral political tactics that would be one thing, but what is worse about it is that it is also internal party politics, directed at the impending challenge from the member for Higgins for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Not wishing to expose himself to an attack from the right of his party, what does the Leader of the Liberal Party do?  of order. The Prime Minister was asked a question about the stimulus package. He was not asked for a commentary on political matters outside the stimulus package.",75
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,76
58,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member for Sturt will indeed be challenged by the events which come his way in a few months time and as to where his loyalties, to the extent that they exist, will lie. Real leadership consists of putting aside differences, in the national interest. A failure of leadership consists of putting your own personal political interests first, your own personal political survival first and that is what we have seen worked out in the 24 hours that has unfolded since the events of yesterday morning. What the governments of Australia have done today is agree on an implementation strategy for this nation-building plan for the future. What the governments of Australia have done is sit down around a table and out a timetable for delivering stimulus to 7,500 primary schools across Australia. They have worked out a timetable for implementing a program to deliver additional funding for science wings and language laboratories in 500 secondary schools across the country. What the governments of Australia have done is sat down and worked out a timetable for implementing $6 billion worth of new outlay for 20,000 new units of social housing across the country. What the governments of Australia have done today is sit down and agree on a timetable to roll out what we will now do about black spots and about the recovery and repair of regional roads, together with additional infrastructure to be delivered to local governments across the country. That is what the governments of Australia have been doing today-sitting down, working out the best way we can advance this core challenge, dealing with the immediate impact of how we go about generating jobs in the near term and how, through that, we support the construction of infrastructure which the nation needs for the long term. That is what governments have been doing. The other thing governments have been doing today is agreeing not just on the timetable but on the machinery for doing it as well. I have confirmed the appointment of a coordinator-general for the Commonwealth, Mr Mike Mrdak from the Prime Minister's department, a public servant who has served both sides of politics well previously in the transport portfolio. Also, there will be coorthe dinators in each of the principal program areas which the Commonwealth is funding through this unprecedented nation-building plan. State premiers and chief ministers have agreed to appoint their own coordinatorsgeneral of works, together with separate coordinators where necessary for each of the program areas. This is the practical business of government. Furthermore, what premiers and chief ministers have agreed to work on now is: how do we best bring together the various labour market programs, training programs, education programs and other programs, including those associated with regional development, to support those who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this global economic recession? That is what leadership is about-leadership we have seen from the Liberal Premier of Western Australia; leadership we have seen from the other premiers and chief ministers; leadership which has been conspicuous in its total absence in the politically self-serving strategy embarked upon by the member for Wentworth seeking purely to save his own political hide.

59,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. fer the Prime Minister to the Treasurer's answer yesterday where he said the coalition's proposal to bring forward the already legislated 2009 and 2010 tax cuts would impose: … $11 billion, on a permanent basis-hence my observation earlier that they are in favour of higher deficits permanently. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, on the contrary, the additional cost of bringing forward these tax cuts is temporary, relating only to the six and 18 months the cuts are brought forward, because from 2009 and 2010 the cost of those tax cuts is already budgeted for? Will the Prime Minister take opportunity to clear up the Treasurer's confusion?",77

When it comes to confusion, what is the current posture of those opposite about either the amount of stimulus they recommend, the type of tax cuts they recommend, the duration they might be for or the latest exercise in this, which is the recommendation in relation to the small business sector and the deferral of compulsory contributions to superannuation-depending on whether that is for two years as in your statement or unlimited as in his statement?

65,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for her question. The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan is about supporting jobs now and delivering lasting investments needed to strengthen the economy, to support jobs and to support business. Of course, the measures introduced in the House yesterday are critical and they are urgent. It is the strong preference of the tax commissioner and the chief executive of Centrelink that they pass this week. Mr Hockey-Forty billion dollars, and we're running to a bureaucratic timetable. It's a joke.",78
66,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not a bureaucratic timetable; it is a timetable for the Australian people to support jobs. Those opposite just do not get it. They do not understand that, because of the global recession, there is an immediate need to boost demand right now. They simply do not understand that, and without these measures more Australians will be out of work. For the first time in the history of this nation, we have had a Leader of the Opposition come into this House and intentionally vote for higher unemployment. That is what they did in this House last night. This is not a time for half measures. This is a time for governments to get cracking, to roll up their sleeves and to do what needs to be done. What is the position of those opposite? This morning on radio the shadow Treasurer had this to say about the plan from the opposition. She was on with Fran Kelly this morning and, in answer to a question about what she would do, she said that what Australia should do is ‘sit and wait and see' how the global recession pans out. Talk about putting the white flag up! Sit and wait while the developed world moves into recession? Sit and wait while growth halves in China? Sit and wait while Japan, the United States and most of continental Europe go into recession? That is the white flag of surrender, and it just shows that those opposite do not have a clue about what they are doing-or maybe they do, and that is even more damning of their actions last night. I want to quote the chief economist of the IMF, who had this to say only on 29 January: Above all, adopt clear policies and act decisively. He went on to say: Delays … in financial packages have cost … a lot already. He went on, and everyone on that side of the House should listen, to say this: Further rounds of debate … will stoke uncertainty and make things worse. That is what the chief economist of the IMF said only a couple of weeks ago, but the opposition do not take that advice seriously. They do not take the advice of the Business Council of Australia. They do not take the advice of most reputable economists. They do not take the advice of anybody who clearly understands the magnitude of the challenge facing this country, because what they are on about is pure politics. Of course, when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition, it is his ego that has come to the fore here. He is playing politics with the national interest because it is in his self interest. That is exactly what he is doing, as the Prime Minister said before. He thinks he can score a cheap political point out of this and he is going for broke, and it is at the expense of the national interest. He has put his ego before our country. That is exactly what he has done. He has let the cat out of the bag again. This morning, on ABC radio, the Leader of the Opposition admitted that we do need to borrow to fund a collapse in revenues. Did you say that? Did you?",78
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will address his remarks through the chair. This is one of the problems when the answers start to debate the question.,79
68,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you admit that it is the responsible thing to borrow to make up for a collapse in revenues, why are you opposing the measures here? It is just too much-is that the objection?",79
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
70,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So you now say it is perfectly legitimate to borrow to make up for the collapse in revenues. Let everybody note that is what the Leader of the Opposition has said: it is legitimate to do that. It takes us to the most important point that has been fudged by the opposition right through this debate, because in excess of two-thirds of future deficits are caused by a collapse in revenue. That is the whole point. What we are doing is the responsible thing-putting in place a stimulus package to make sure we can strengthen growth. That is the responsible thing to do in these circumstances. So I wonder why he is opposing what we are doing. When he thinks it is a responsible thing to do to borrow, when he thinks it is okay to have a stimulus package-just not one as large-why wouldn'the come to the same conclusion that the Business Council of Australia, most other business representatives, most economists right around the country and the IMF have come to? I will tell you why: because he puts his ego and political interests before our country. Taxation",79
71,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation's statement this morning that the coalition's proposal to bring forward to January this year the already legislated tax cuts due to come into force from July 2009 and July 2010 represents a ‘discredited ideological policy mostly for higher income earners'. Given the finance minister's statement later in the interview, ‘We are not going to allow that to occur,' can the Prime Minister advise the House whether the government is proposing to repeal the 2009 and 2010 tax cuts?",79
72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The really disappointing thing about this debate is that it is like watching high school debaters struggling. There is a real economic crisis out there. It is about how we actually seek to prop up demand in this economy now, at a time when it is collapsing globally-net export incomes are going through the floor, private sector investments are contracting and small businesses are contracting-and the real debate is about how you bring forward activity now, and you are having some esoteric debate about a transcript here and a transcript there about legislated tax cuts. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is time we saw real leadership from someone on that side of the House. We have seen some this morning from the Liberal Premier of Western Australia.

I note that her electorate has 64 schools-51 primary schools, six combined schools and seven secondary schools. I note that she is someone who supports the schools in her electorate. She supports the schools in her electorate by supporting the government's $14.7 billion plan, an historic investment in schools right around the country. This plan has been supported today by the leaders of each state and territory in this nation, including the Liberal leader of Western Australia. Despite the Liberal Party being opposed to this plan and opposed to any assistance for our schools, the Liberal leader of Western Australia has said today that he endorses this plan and that he will be working with the Rudd Labor government to deliver it. And no wonder, because endorsements for this plan are flooding in from around the nation. I refer to one endorsement from a school principal at Milton North primary school-a school principal in the federal electorate of Barker. He has written into say that he was so ecstatic when he heard the news, he burst into tears. He said: We are ecstatic about this opportunity not only for the students and staff but also for the wider community. He goes on to say: There are many flow-on effects for the community from a project like this. There will be work for our tradespeople, creating an atmosphere of optimism about the future.

87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,81
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Could I make this point to members of the Liberal Party who are catcalling in their contempt for Australian students and the jobs of their parents: the Leader of the Opposition is wont to wander around saying, ‘We should be looking into the eyes of children and talking to them about the future.' I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, firstly, international studies show that world-class facilities make a difference to the quality of education. In that regard, I refer him to the study of the UK Department for Education and Skills, Building better performance, a report which indicates that school outcomes and the quality of school facilities are related. So if we want Australian kids to get a world-class education today so they can have a fair chance of getting the high-skills, high-wage jobs of tomorrow, then we need to be investing in our education system. And that is precisely what this program does. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, when he is talking about looking into the eyes of those children, there is nothing more important to the future of those children than their parents having a job. This program is about supporting and sustaining employment in this country with a historic $14.7 billion program. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, given that he has voted against this investment in schools and given that he has voted against the jobs that it think would support, what his solution is. We know the Leader of the Opposition has no solution, but I was interested to see today that the member for Higgins-who is obviously taking every appearance he gets offered this week-made an appearance on ABC Radio and verified that the Liberal Party stands behind Work Choices. Now we do know what their solution is of order. Clearly the Deputy Prime Minister was asked a question about the schools package and the spending package. She was not asked about Work Choices. She is now talking abut Work Choices",81
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Prime Minister knows that she must be relevant to the question, and I suggest that she brings her answer to a conclusion.",81
90,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. This historic investment is about responding to the global financial crisis, investing in world-class education and supporting jobs. Of course, the only Liberal Party solution is the member for Higgins' solution: Work Choices-make it easier to sack people and cut their pay. That is what the Liberal Party stands for. The member for Higgins has made it perfectly clear.  Prime Minister to table the so-called email from which she was quoting earlier in her answer to see if it is actually genuine or not.",81
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Was the Deputy Prime Minister quoting from a document? Ms Gillard-Yes, I was, Mr Speaker.",81
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Was the document confidential? Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, the document has two sections. I will get the email and I am happy to table it. Mr Secker- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a list of schools in the electorate of Barker provided by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. It shows there is no such school as Milton North.",81
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Barker will resume his seat. Is leave granted? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, there is no need because we know where we are supporting infrastructure in all those schools and they are opposing it.",82
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the member for Moncrieff have a point of order? Mr Ciobo-It is actually a point of clarification and to seek direction from you, Mr Speaker. I was just seeking your direction. I know that the leader of government business in the House repeatedly makes the point about spurious points of order, so I made it very clearMr Albanese-So you are taking one? Mr Ciobo-No. I actually made it very clear from the outset that it was a point of clarification, and I would ask for your clarification on that, Mr Speaker. Mr Albanese-What's the point of order-clarification?",82
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have not in the past asked people to come to the dispatch box to indicate whether they are objecting to leave being granted or the granting of leave. That has been a practice from time to time in this place. So the clarification, if it was quired, is that that was all that happened and it was by way of taking a denial of leave. Taxation",82
96,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and I refer to his failure to answer my previous question. Will the Prime Minister advise the House whether the government is committed to delivering the 2009 and 2010 tax cuts?,82
97,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have said on multiple occasions in this House that the government's legislated tax cuts proceed. There is nothing remarkable about that. The debated question here is about tax cuts versus stimulus now. I draw the honourable Leader of the Opposition's attention to comments from the chief economist of the IMF who said that tax cuts are not the most effective stimulus. He says-and he is the economist-that taxes ‘tend to have less effect in the short run than measures which increase spending'. The Business Council of Australia says: A significant body of research highlights that additional tax cuts, unless very … targeted, tend not to be the most effective measures for stimulating demand in circumstances of rising unemployment and poor confidence. Greig Gailey of the BCA says: Well our concern with tax cuts other than the offset taxes for low income earners which we absolutely support, our concern on tax cuts is that the tax cut will actually be saved when in fact we want to stimulate the economy. Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group says: The higher level income tax cuts are more likely to be saved. We are in no hurry to see those brought forward. The body of advice internationally and nationally from the credible business organisations is that, if our task is to provide stimulus here for the economy, it is to take measures such as the government is currently supportreing: investing directly in infrastructure-and, together with the premiers and chief ministers, we agreed this morning on the type of infrastructure and an implementation planand providing support for households, about which there has been some debate in the House in the last 24 to 48 hours. As to the decision of those opposite, I seem to recall the Manager of Opposition Business said that it was unanimous within their party room-though Fran Bailey seemed to have a different view on radio this morning and various press reports seemed to indicate that various members may have had a different view. But let us just say that they resolved that this was the right course of action for them politically. What they need to answer in their own minds and in their own communities is this: what will you say to each one of those farmers who will not receive a one-off hardship payment? What will you say to each one of those families who will not be assisted with their back-to-school bonuses? What will you say to each of those families who are doing it tough and may, in fact, be suffering from the prospect of unemployment, when you, by your action, are seeking to prevent them from access to those one-off tax bonuses? What will you say to each school across the country when they come forward with each of their proposals for an assembly hall, for a new resource centre, for a new library, for a language laboratory or for a science laboratory, when each one of you is saying, ‘No, no, no; we can't do that'? If the policy reasons advanced added up to something, maybe we could have a discussion. But if you look at every piece of serious advice from every credible economist, from every credible business organisation, from the international monetary and financial authorities themselves, there is no policy argument. There is no argument in terms of helping people who are doing it tough and schools that need the help. Do you know what this is all about? This is one man's personal political interest and his struggle against the member for Higgins. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",82
98,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Tourism. Would the minister outline for the House the benefits of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan for the tourism industry?,83
99,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dawson for the question. As a member representing a key regional seat, he understands the importance of tourism to areas such as the Whitsundays, Mackay and Bowen, which featured so prominently in the film Australia. He also understands that the tourism industry is doing it tough at the moment as a result of the global financial crisis. It is interesting to note that the World Tourism Organisation has predicted that global tourism this year will decline for the first time since the Second World War. That is important because both international and domestic tourism are important to Australia. The government is about doing everything we can to try and assist the tourism industry in Australia to get through these tough times. That means we have to continue to invest in overseas markets so as to maintain a market presence. The industry understands that if we walk away it is going to be tougher to get back into the international tourism sector. It is also important that we understand that 75 per cent of the tourism industry in Australia is of a domestic nature. It is about time people on the other side understood that tourism is about competing for the discretionary dollar. I was pleased to note in the Herald Sun today an article including the member for MCEwen speaking out against the opposition's determination to bomb this package in their party room yesterday. While she might have described their opposition as political suicide, I hope that in her contribution to the party debate yesterday she was actually thinking about the national interest. The debate about the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is a debate about what is in Australia's national interest. When you think about Australia's national interest, you should actually think about those small business operators and the 480,000 Australians directly employed in the tourism industry in Australia. You should also remember that a lot of those people are actually employed in small businesses in rural and regional Australia. Unlike the opposition, they understand that the Nation Building and Jobs Plan builds on the 2008 Economic Security Package of the Australian government, which was about putting more dollars into the pockets of Australian consumers to maintain employment. Small business operators are concerned about cash flow, and putting dollars in the hands of consumers is about putting cash through those operators' tills, which may assist them to take up the government's initiative particularly aimed at small business and claim the additional 30 per cent deduction for eligible assets to assist them in this tough economic environment. For those reasons, I think it is about time the opposition joined with the tourism industry and gave the government the support it deserves for trying to do the right thing in Australia's national interest. In that context, refer to solid support given to the Australian government in its endeavours. I refer, for example, to a statement by Matt Hingerty, a key tourism representative known well to the member for North Sydney. Mr Hingerty said on Tuesday in response to the government's package: ‘The timing of the cash bonuses was well positioned just ahead of the school holidays and Easter break.' He said that because he understands that there are 121 million days of accumulated annual leave in Australia. He understands that these payments link up with the Australian government's endeavours with key employer organisations such as ACCI to encourage Australian workers to have a holiday. Mr Ciobo interjecting",83
100,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is about time the member for Moncrieff stopped talking down the Australian tourism industry and stopped talking about a crisis. It is also about time members on the other side of the House joined with members such as the member for Dawson, the member for Lyons, the member for Leichhardt, members on the Central Coast and members in Wollongong and Newcastle-key tourism areas-and supported this package. Perhaps the members for Wide Bay, Herbert, Kalgoorlie, Flinders and Forrest, for example, should start thinking about key tourism areas such as Noosa, Townsville, Broome, Mornington Peninsula and Margaret River and join with the member for MCEwen, because she understands the importance of tourism to the Yarra Valley. If when they return to their electorates this weekend they go and put their feet under the table of a local restaurant or cafe, they should think about what Peter Doyle, the President of the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association, and John Hart, its CEO, said in a media release on Tuesday of this week: I The stimulus package also contained a number of cash payments that will see their way into the hands of restaurant consumers. They went on to say: … consumers now spend nearly 10% of their household income on meals out (on average) and these additional payments, which will come just prior to the next school holidays, will be spent in restaurants and cafes. But perhaps more importantly-because this debate is about the national interest and keeping Australians in employment-they concluded with this remark: The hospitality industry is a very labour intensive industry. Spending in restaurants is a very efficient way to create or maintain employment. I leave the opposition with that thought. Back a winner-back the national interest, not the opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition. NA",84

102,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Why does the government need to increase the borrowing limit of the Commonwealth from $75 billion to $200 billion immediately?,85
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. We are increasing the borrowing limit because we have to fund the accumulated deficits over time and, if she knew anything about this process, she would know that it is not all done at once. So we are seeking to put in place an ample amount of money to cover those accumulated deficits-deficits which flow principally from the collapse in revenues imposed on this country by the rest of the world because of the global recession. There is nothing unusual about this; it is normal practice.",85
104,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
105,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is nothing unusual about borrowing on financial markets and the issuance of Commonwealth government securities. Even the member for Higgins engaged in that practice. The catcalls across the chamber just demonstrate what is motivating the opposition. It is not good policy, it is naked political advantage which stands in the road of the government doing the right thing by Australia to put in place vital measures which will stimulate demand-as the Minister for Tourism was just saying-and to provide for vital investments that will support jobs and growth over time. Of course, you can contrast that with the approach of the opposition. I was referring earlier to the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she said this morning on Radio National's Breakfast program that we should wait to see how this global recession pans out and how it affects Australia. That is what she said. In the face of all this evidence, she thinks that we should just sit around on our hands and do absolutely nothing. That is the doctrine of calculated neglect. That is what it is, and it is dangerous. It is a dangerous approach that we are having from this opposition, because it adds to uncertainty. As the chief economist of the IMF said in those remarks that I quoted earlier, that is a dangerous thing to do in these circumstances. In these circumstances it is a time to be bold. In these circumstances it is not a time for half measures. In these circumstances it is a time to back the national interest and do the right thing by the country. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",85
106,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister outline to the House what additional funding the government has provided to improve rail, community infrastructure and create local jobs? Are there any threats to these plans?",85
107,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. At the COAG meeting chaired by the Prime Minister this morning, all state premiers and chief ministers agreed to sign up to the new nationbuilding program by 1 March-and I thank the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who is here today, for being a part of that. They therefore will be eligible for funding under the government's $150 million increase in road maintenance, available and intended to be spent this financial year for economic stimulus and to make our roads safer. This program, the nation-building program from 2009-13, is the biggest road and rail investment program in the history of the Commonwealth. The investment is $27 billion, with the Commonwealth contributing $22.3 billion. It means that we can get on with the job of working together-the Commonwealth and the states and territories-to build our road and our rail network and to provide jobs and economic stimulus around the nation. And we are getting on with the job. I announced, through a media release earlier today, that construction work has now commenced on the 36 kilometre southern ydney freight line. That is a $309 million project. I have been asked about how many jobs. There are 500 direct jobs and 1,000 indirect jobs. This is a 36 kilometre dedicated freight line that will unclog the single largest bottleneck on New South Wales's interstate rail network. Last December, as part of our nationbuilding package, we announced an additional $1.2 billion through the ARTC for 17 rail projects to be rolled out across the try to enhance freight movement and to create local jobs. This will see freight times along the Melbourne to Brisbane corridor reduced from 37 hours to 26 hours-a 30 per cent improvement. Our largest investment is in the Hunter-$1 billion. Mr Baldwin interjecting",85
108,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This will directly employ-since you ask for the figures-650 people in the Hunter. That is 650 people, and it is supported by the member for Hunter, supported by the member for Charlton, supported by the member for Newcastle and supported by the member for Shortland. The member for Paterson, however, votes against jobs in his local community. We are investing $125 million to replace old wood rail sleepers with new concrete rail sleepers in order to increase efficiency on the network, creating local jobs in factories and employing extra people right now as a result of our commitment in December. Those people are being employed in Geelong, in Wagga Wagga, in Grafton, in Mittagongthese are jobs for regional Australia. And we are not only doing it through road and rail; we are doing it through community infrastructure. As COAG was meeting, there was also today the inaugural meeting of the steering committee of the Australian Council of Local Government. Regardless of political colour, background and ideology, it came together with an absolute consensus: that we need to get on with the job of nation building and providing jobs in local communities. Every single one of those mayors has welcomed our $800 million community infrastructure package-the package that those opposite voted against-with those local programs being delivered around the nation. They also agreed that local government will play its counpart in assisting the COAG agenda that was being debated at the same time, making sure that the development applications for local schools get fast tracked and that we get those jobs on the ground in those local communities. But much of that funding, of course, is in jeopardy due to the reckless attitude of those opposite-the reckless, opportunistic attitude of those opposite, who, at the same time as they were voting against it, were lobbying me around the corridors of the house yesterday, asking for programs in their electorates to be funded. That is the hypocrisy that we see from those opposite. We will see whether they support these programs put forward by local government in those communities. Of course, they are confused. Their strategy is dazed and confused. Yesterday, the Manager of Opposition Business said this on 2UE: ‘We're not blocking it; we're voting against it.' It got better. Today, on Sunrise, said: ‘If it's too good to be true when people receive all these handouts, it is not true. not real.' Well, when the Senate passes a program of $950, they will know that it is real. I do not think the Manager of Opposition Business can ever make an interjection like that again. But it gets better, because, on radio 2UE on 5 February, he said this: ‘When somebody holds a gun to my head, you know, maybe it's a bit silly, but I say, “Well, mate, pull the trigger.”' I say this to the member for North Sydney: your leader has done it. Your leader has done it to everyone along the front bench and along the back bench by opposing community infrastructure, by opposing nation building, by opposing jobs in local communities. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition has done, because he is not interested in nation building; he is just interested in himself.",86
109,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. How many jobs have been created by the December $10 billion cash splash, and how many jobs will be created by the proposed March $11 billion cash splash? What will be the annual interest cost of financing the $21 billion of those handouts at current interest rates?",87

112,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am coming to it; I am just getting it right. The second was the current package and the",87
113,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,87
114,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have got that. And the third one was the interest rates. First of all, he the government's Economic Security Strategy was announced last October. It was deIt is livered in December. As the honourable member would know, the full employment impact of that would not be known for some time. But, as the honourable member struggled yesterday with the most recently produced retail figures for the nation, to their collective dismay and disappointment, this country outperformed practically every other country in the world in terms of retail sales at that time. Obviously there will be some form of spillover of that investment into the support packages for households into the year 2010 as well. Secondly, as the honourable member knows, the package that the government announced two days ago of some $42 billion represents, as we have said, a total employment impact in terms of supporting jobs of up to 90,000. On the breakdown of the indiEconomy vidual components of that: I will of course provide those to the Leader of the Opposition later. I do not have them with me, but I will be happy to do so. Thirdly, he asked a question about debt. On the question of the impact of the borrowings which would flow, I am advised that the interest payments would equal something in the vicinity of an additional 0.2 per cent of GDP at the time that they begin to be paid. If there is any variation on that, I will come back to the honourable member before the end of question time. Could I also say to the honourable member who has asked the question that, as they seek, as is their democratic right-and they are members of this parliament",87
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,88
116,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know those opposite do not wish to actually debate that which is real here, which is: how do you deal with providing the stimulus which the Australian economy needs because of the global economic crisis? We have a program put forward. It is costed. The assumptions have been backed by the Treasury, and we stand by those because they represent for us a credible strategy to see Australia through this crisis. The alternative is not just sitting on the fence, not just carping from the sidelines, but an avalanche of politically opportunistic negativity from those opposite. But here is the ultimate irony for those opposite. There they are, representing the forces of neoliberalism around the world. There they are representing the forces of unrestrained greed. There they are, representing the forces of unrestrained markets, representing the forces also represented by unprincipled merchant bankers operating with under-regulated markets-their entire ideology, which has brought this crisis about-and yet they are unprepared to lift a political finger to support this government's efforts to deal with the consequences of that crisis. This is the ultimate irony, the ultimate hypocrisy of those opposite: the unrestrained greed, unprincipled merchant bankers, under-regulated financial markets-at the absolute core of neoliberalism-causing this crisis worldwide, and there they stand back, smugly, seeking to take political advantage of this government's attempts to deal with the consequences of that crisis for working people. Those opposite have contested whether in fact they are really neoliberals. Remember, as the Leader of the Liberal Party has said in response to this debate on unregulated financial markets: ‘Let us simply let the market run its course.' Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would just ask the Leader of the Labor Party to refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his proper title, please.",88
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members should be referred to by their parliamentary titles.,88
118,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has said on multiple occasions, ‘Let the market run its course.' That is the very heart of the neoliberal agenda which has brought about this mayhem on markets worldwide, with impacts on working people, who now pay the price through the loss of jobs right across the world and in our country as well. The Leader of the Opposition reinforced that in the debate in the parliament on Tuesday when he began citing as his new authority on fiscal policy Professor Taylor from Stanford University in the United States, who is himself one of the archdeacons of neoliberalism. Remember what Professor Taylor said? He always asks himself each morning: ‘What would Milton do next?'-that is, what would Milton Friedman do next? And then you have not just these statements of ideology but also the action itself of ideology, which is to block this government's efforts in the Senate to actually deal with the stimulus needs necessary to repair growth, growth which has been undermined by neoliberal wanton behaviour around the world which has brought this crisis about in the first place. So there you have this extraordinary contradiction-their ideology wreaking havoc on the world economy and them refusing to support any course of action to deal with the consequences of their ideology's spectacular failure. How about, I say to the Leader of the Opposition, you just stand up one day and say, ‘Maybe this neoliberalism, maybe this market fundamentalism-maybe we just got it wrong.' How about a word of apology about all of those investment bankers around the world who creamed it, who scored tens and hundreds of millions of dollars out of this? How about just a word of apology which said you might have got it wrong? And how about a word of action to support a government's efforts to clean up the wreckage after you? That is the moral challenge here, a moral challenge which has been failed by the Liberal Party corporately and by the Leader of the Opposition personally. Economy",88

127,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why is it important for the government to seek expert advice in dealing with the global economic crisis? What does the advice indicate about various options for responding to the crisis?,89
128,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is dealing with an unprecedented economic crisis consequent upon the global economic challenge, and naturally the government has sought advice. The government has sought advice from Treasury, from the IMF and from the financial regulators, and it is paying close attention to the opinions of market economists, to industry organisations and to governments of other major developed nations. Naturally in an economic crisis, Mr Speaker, you would expect that a government would pay attention to the advice, to the opinions, of people who know something about economics. Amazingly enough, this is not a universally held view-that in an economic crisis you might ask people like economists what they think about how to deal with it. In fact, the opposition believes that that is the last thing you should doactually talk to economists. Twice yesterday the member for North Sydney said that the last people you would talk to about dealing with an economic crisis would be economists. He said on 2BL: Economists will always go to extremes. Economists will say in downturns, ‘Spend, spend, spend.' And then in the MPI he backed it up with: They should not be listened to in those good times, just as surely as they should not always be the bible during bad times. This is the guy who has just become the frontrunner for the member for Curtin's job as shadow Treasurer. His view of economic advice is that, in order to be the Minister for Finance-and Deregulation-or indeed the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the last thing you do is actually talk to economists, the last thing you do is seek advice from people who have got some expertise in that area. You wonder who in fact he would consult-maybe some faith-healers would be the idea, or numerologists or astrologers. I see him there in his office late at night with the lights off, with a ouija board out there, going: ‘Milton, Milton, are you there, Milton? Tell us what to do, Milton.'",89

131,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of relevance: I listened carefully to the question to the minister for deregulation from the member for Calwell, but I heard nothing in it requesting a vaudeville show. Could the minister return to some facts and figures?",90
132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has the call.,90
133,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was mentioning Milton Friedman to make the point that in fact what the member for North Sydney said yesterday was not literally accurate, not precisely correct, because there are indeed a few select economists that he and the opposition do listen to-a few people like Arthur Laffer, John Taylor and Milton Friedman. And they just happen to be the people who believe that tax cuts for wealthy people and knocking over the rights of working people in the workplace are the solution to every economic problem. It does not matter what the issue, it does not matter what the debate, the answer is always: tax cuts for the rich and knocking over the rights of working people in the workplace. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear the views of the member for North Sydney on Sunrise this morning, where he stated: Broadly based tax cuts will provide long-term incentives for people to continue to work. I wonder which people that would be. For the ordinary working people I know, their incentives to continue to work are to eat, to pay the rent and the mortgage. They do not need big tax cuts for the wealthy in order to have an incentive to work; they have to work. It is hardly surprising that the Leader of the Opposition and his troops cannot make up their minds about whether Australia is going to have a recession or not. The Leader of the Opposition says that a recession is avoidable, that it may not happen. And yet we have had within the space of a couple of days the member for Sturt, the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the member for Warringah all saying that it is a red-hot certainty that Australia is going into recession. It may well be just a coincidence, but I think all three of them are Costello supporters; I think they may all be supporters of the member for Higgins. The government in turn is interested in expert adviceMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If the minister for finance is not going to be relevant, if he is not going to have anything meaningful to say, then I would ask you to sit him down.",90
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will address the question, and can I suggest that he brings his answer to a conclusion.",90
135,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will indeed, Mr Speaker. The government is acting in accordance with advice from Treasury, from the International Monetary Fund and the vast bulk of opinion both in Australia and around the world from expert economists, from industry organisations and all people with expertise in these areas. We are interested in taking action to protect and to sustain jobs and economic growth in this country, not to fight the obscure ideological and class-based battle for the rich which is the preserve of opposition. We are facing in this country a global economic crisis that has largely been caused by investment bankers. The investment banker running the Liberal Party is so arrogant that he thinks he can run Australia from opposition in the middle of that crisis. Indonesia: Merauke Five",90
136,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what are you and your Minister for Foreign Affairs doing to secure the return to Australia of Old Bar resident Mr Keith Mortimer, who is one of five grey nomad senior Australians who went on an hour-long fun but illconceived joy-flight from Thursday Island, Australia to Mopah airport, Papua, Indonesia, and because of this seniors moment they have now been unfairly sentenced to two years in an Indonesian jail for visa confusions, much to the distress of family, friends and the relevant local communities? Prime Minister, surely sense can prevail and surely we can return these Australians soon.",91
137,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and the fact that he legitimately raises the interests of his constituents here. In terms of our dealings with the Indonesian government, we of course will exercise every effort on that. But to further update the member on actions taken by the government to date, with the indulgence of the House, I would ask the Foreign Minister to add to that.",91
138,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to add to his remarks and I thank the member for his interest and his concern. The five Australians generally now known as the Merauke Five arrived in Merauke, part of Indonesia, allegedly without visas or appropriate travel and aviation authority. As a consequence of that they were detained by Indonesian authorities. Effectively from the moment of their dethe tention, Australian consular officials from Indonesia were there and rendered consular assistance. After appropriate investigation by Indonesian authorities, they were charged and subsequently tried and convicted of offences which I have referred to generally. They were sentenced and that sentence has been the subject of an indication by them that they are proposing to appeal. Australian officials have ensured that they have had access to legal advice, and my most recent advice is that that appeal process is in the course of being prepared and will be lodged in the near future. They received an opportunity to apply for bail but decided, in conjunction with the advice of their lawyers, not to apply for bail, on the basis that any time they served in detention following their sentence in the first instance would be held in account for any sentence they were subject to in appeal. I make this point, which is often not understood. When an Australian citizen, an Australian national, comes into contact with the legal system of another country, there is a limit to what Australia can do. That is not to say that Australia cannot or does not do anything. There is simply a limit to what we can do when one of our citizens in another country has to go through their legal processes. And the reverse of course applies. If a national of another country falls within the processes of our criminal legal jurisdiction, they are subject to it. On more than one occasion an Australian government has indicated to a foreign national that it would be inappropriate for the government of the day to seek to interfere in the legal processes of our own country. The same rule applies in respect of the legal processes of another country. We have made the point to the Indonesian authorities through our officials in Indonesia that we are very concerned about their welfare, very concerned and interested in the outcome of the legal processes. On the basis of personal conversations with our ambassador and consultations with our consular officials, I am satisfied that everything that we can do in a consular sense, everything that we can do in terms of expressing our concerns to the Indonesians authorities, has been and continues to be done. In the meantime we await the outcome of the Indonesian judicial and legal processes. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",91
139,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. How will the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan benefit rural and regional Australian economies?",92
140,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I stood here a year ago the first time. I answered a question and mentioned that I came to this portfolio with very little background knowledge, it never occurred to me at the time that the leadership of the National Party came to this parliament with even less. As we conclude this week in parliament, the member for Ballarat will be able to go back to Ballarat and, when asked by any of the more than 200 farmers who will be in receipt of the farmers' hardship payment what she has done, she will be able to tell them that she has defended it for them. In the same way, she will be able to explain to them that hardship and drought have an impact not just directly on farmers but on entire towns and that projects such as the upgrade of schools have an extraordinary impact not just on the students and teachers themselves but on employment opportunities for construction workers, the transport industry and subcontractors. All of that feeds into local retail as well. The leadership of the National and Liberal parties have put the people who sit behind them in this chamber in the most extraordinary position this weekend. While members like the member for Ballarat will be able to go back to their electorates and answer questions very easily about how they have defended and tried to help their constituents, when the member for Barker is asked, ‘Which schools are you going to support an upgrade of?', he will already have the list of every school he is trying to prevent from having an upgrade. When people opposite on the backbench go back to their electorates and are asked in good faith by their constituents whether or not they are eligible for any of the bonus payments, they are going to have to say, ‘Oh, no, the leadership of the Liberal and National parties is trying to prevent you getting any of those bonus payments.' When people ask whether or not they are going to be eligible for the farmers' hardship payment, while the member for New England will be able to say to more than 350 farming families that he has defended it for them, the people sitting in the back rows on the other side of the chamber are going to have to say, ‘Oh, no, we are trying to stop you from getting any of that money.' I deliberately blame the people who sit on the front row of those seats opposite because there are people who sit behind them who actually have understood for some time the importance of a package like this. I quote with great authority-and I was impressed to hear the words-back to 23 October last year the member for Gippsland because he said: Investing in regional infrastructure will help local communities to withstand the worse of the global financial crisis and I encourage the government to act quickly in this regard. I table that press release. The people who in the front row opposite have sitting behind them people who actually understand and are now going to be forced into the humiliating position all weekend-it might only last two days but it will be a very long weekend-of explaining why they are not supporting a plan that they know is in the national interest. Economy",92
141,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement on 24 January that his new fifty-fifty $4 billion partnership, the Australian Business Investment Partnership, known as ‘Ruddbank', has the capacity to borrow a further $30 billion for expansion into the commercial property sector. Prime Minister, is it prudent to have these special purpose vehicles borrowing more money in addition to the $200 billion the government has already sought and yet not fully disclos- question. ing it as more Commonwealth government debt? Prime Minister, how much debt are you piling on to the next generation of Australians?",93
142,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney, the Manager of Opposition Business, has asked me a question about the Australian Business Investment Partnership. This investment partnership was put together with the cooperation of the major banks and the support of the property sector across the country for one very good reason. It is not just the employment intensity within that sector, some 150,000 people; it goes to what happens to the value of property assets across this nation if there is a retreat from this nation of foreign bank syndication of current Australian bank loans to that sector. The consequence for the whole economy of a collapse in asset values in this sector would be catastrophic. The quantum of the refinancing due in 2009 across the Australian sit economy-and there are varying estimates of this-is somewhere in the range of $50 billion to $75 billion. The question arises: what is the proportion of that represented by existing bank syndication from abroad which could be withdrawn, as you see evidence around the world of that happening? The answer to that flows into the category of some tens of billions of dollars. Therefore, you have two courses of action. The Liberal Party is saying let the free market ripMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To assist the Prime Minister, yesterday the Prime Minister asked for $200 billion. I referred to a fifty-fifty partnership which has the capacity to borrow $30 billion. What is the status of the additional debt in these special purpose vehicles?",93
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the,93
144,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will return to what I was saying before, because the honourable member raises an important question: why have we embarked on this course of action and what are the consequences that flow from it and the consequences that would flow from not doing it? If you have a withdrawal of foreign bank syndication, what would happen therefore is that there would be a further factor fuelling the collapse of asset prices in this country. If that occurred-and all serious economists and economic writers are concerned about this-the flow-on effect to the general economy would be huge. That is why, based on the advice we received, this was the most prudent course of action. I say to the honourable member that when the joint vehicle, the Australian Business Investment Partnership, is activated, of course it will involve the Commonwealth in the acquisition of assets. Therefore, assets will appear on the Commonwealth government's overall ledger. That is a key point that he should bear in mind. The further point I make is this: as the Liberal Party embarks upon what is plainly its political strategy, which is about deficit and debt, those opposite think that they are onto a real political winner. Their political strategy is clear for all to see. They do not care about the consequences on the property sector in Australia, they do not care about the consequences for families who are struggling with the impact of the financial crisisMr Simpkins interjecting",93
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan is warned!,94
146,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and they do not care about the collapse in construction, which we seek to deal with through the construction program that will come off the back of the primary schools investment program. They do not care about any of that, because they are driven by a political strategy that is all about deficit and debt. Those opposite need to reflect on this in a moment of intellectual honesty, which is getting harder and harder for them to do. Firstly, as the Treasurer indicated, there has been a $125 billion collapse in government revenues. Given that that has occurred and that it is a global phenomenon, I ask those opposite if they would borrow to fill that gap? If you say you would not borrow to fill that gap, there are two courses of action available to you: to cut government expenditure by that equivalent amount-that is, $125 billion-or to increase taxes by an equivalent amount. Which is it-you can borrow it, you can increase taxes or you can cut expenditure? Those opposite refuse to provide an honest intellectual answer. If you are going to balance your budget, every government in the world has those three options in these economic circumstances. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister seeks compliance from the opposition in all things and I am very happy to provide him here with the answer that he has so earnestly sought.",94
147,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,94
148,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is quite critical to where we are going. The first huge impact in terms of the borrowing requirements of the Commonwealth was the collapse in Commonwealth government revenues-$125 billion. We have said how that has occurred; we have detailed the tax categories. That is happening right across the world. Is Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, going to say that he would not borrow for that? Mr Turnbull-I would be delighted to answer the Prime Minister's question.",94
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will address the question.,94
150,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be very keen to see an unequivocal statement in writing from the Leader of the Opposition as to whether he would do that or not. That goes to the core of the intellectual fraudulence of the substantive case that they are arguing. Secondly, what further addition is there to government borrowing? Further additions occur as a result of having an increase in social security payments, which are a consequence of people becoming unemployed. That also affects the forward estimates and therefore that becomes a second area of unanticipated expenditure. Then you come to the third area. The third area goes to the quantum of the stimulus. We have said upfront what the quantum of our stimulus is. We have said that it is $42 billion. That is what we regard as being necessary to support the economy now.",94
151,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
152,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear again the avalanche of intellectual honesty coming from those opposite! How much stimulus do they support? One moment they say that it is about $15 billion, then at a different moment they say might be $20 billion. I looked at the member for Aston's statement earlier today where he talked about $20 billion plus, because that is Treasury's estimate of the cost of the proposal that he has put forward. His proposal is for small business not to pay the superannuation guarantee levy for two years. That would therefore be met by the taxpayer. Therefore, when you put all of their costed stimulus packages togetherMr Schultz interjecting",95
153,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hume will withdraw that remark. Mr Schultz- Mr Speaker, I withdraw. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I bring the Prime Minister back to the question; how many of these special purpose vehicles are going to be set up; where are they being set up; and how much debt",95
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Prime Minister knows the question and will address the question. On this occasion I suggest that he bring his answer to a conclusion.,95
155,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked by the Manager of Opposition Business goes to the question of debt. What I have sought to do in going through this in some detail is to expose the intellectual fraudulence of their argument. There are three components here: (1) will they borrow in order to meet the collapse in Commonwealth government revenue-that is, a $125 billion collapse, most recently added to by the quantum of $75 billion; (2) there are other unanticipated expenses which arise from social security payments; and (3) there is the quantum of the stimulus package. Those opposite call for a stimulus of about $20 billion, more depending on whether you listen to the member for Aston or not. We say $42 billion. What is the difference in the overall quantum? It is it something in the order of $20 billion. What I would like to see is some intellectually honest accounting from those opposite about what they would support by way of borrowing or otherwise. Instead, they have embarked upon a political strategy. I conclude my remarks with those that I began question time with today-that is, this is all directed by the leader of the Liberal Party against his uncertainty about the member for Higgins. It is politics pure and simple. Housing Affordability",95
156,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and the Minister for the Status of Women. Will the minister inform the House how the new spending on social housing will support jobs and local communities?,95
157,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a very keen and hard working local member. The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes an historic investment in social housing-$6.4 billion to build 20,000 new homes for needy Australians, including pensioners, homeless Australians and low-income families. There is also money to repair 2,500 homes. We know yesterday that the HIA suggested that this package would support 35,000 jobs in the construction industry in towns, suburbs, cities and regional areas. The construction sector is one of the largest employers in this country. It accounts for about nine per cent of all jobs, which is almost one million workers. If these measures pass, work can start almost immediately, building and repairing homes right across Australia. States and territories have repair and maintenance backlogs. They can call tradespeople into start that work straight away. But there are also whole new projects ready to go. The land is set aside, the plans are drawn up, approvals have been given. It is all systems go. What they have been waiting on is funding. If this funding flows then we know that local builders, plumbers, tilers, electricians and carpenters can be employed. These people are facing less work otherwise and some of them are facing no work. I have asked my state colleagues to tell the sorts of proposals that they will be putting forward in our first tranche of building. The Victorian Minister for Housing, for example, has given me a few proposals that he would like to bring forward. I know that the member for Corangamite and the member for Corio will be very interested to know that it is proposed to build 89 homes in their area of Geelong. I know that the member for Ballarat will be very happy to know that 45 homes are to be built in Ballarat and Horsham. It would be very good to see the member for Mallee supporting this initiative to support those jobs in his local area. The members for Indi and Murray might be interested to know that tradies in their electorates could be employed to build 51 new homes in their areas. That includes a 10unit development for aged pensioners in Wodonga. Would you like to see that built? Would you like 10 units for aged pensioners in Wodonga? Each of these projects will support vital jobs in regional areas, keep tradespeople employed, keep apprentices busy and keep money in local communities. The government has a plan to support jobs to build our nation for the future. It is a shame to see the Leader of the Opposition playing a political game when jobs are at stake, when small businesses and contractors are already doing it very tough. I am very sorry to see members opposite voting against construction jobs in their electorates, voting against work that will keep builders busy through these tough times-2009 will be a very tough year for the construction sector, anyway. And what the opposition wants to do is make that year even tougher. Economy",95
158,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the government's plans for a Commonwealth debt of $200 billion and ask him, me in his capacity as chairman of the Australian Loan Council, how much additional debt will state governments need over the next four years?",96
159,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. It is the case that Australian state governments do borrow on financial markets and, most particularly and most importantly, they borrow to finance critical economic infrastructure. They have been doing that for some time because it builds the nation, it creates jobs and it expands our productive capacity. So the states are borrowing. I could not give you the figure that they have out there at the moment, or what the total amount of state government borrowings is, but they do that and they do it with the approval of the Australian Loan Council. If the member wants to know what the total amount of state government borrowings stands at today, I could not give her that final figure, but I would be more than happy to supply it to her after question time. I am quite happy to supply that. But I would make a more general point about debt, and this is very important becauseMr Robb-This is unbelievable!",96
160,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is?,96
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer has the call. The interjectors will stop interjecting.,96
162,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The state governments borrow different amounts at different periods of time. That is what they do.,97
163,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
164,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked; the Treasurer is responding.,97
165,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to make this point, because those opposite have now admitted that they would borrow to make up for the gap in government revenues which has been caused by the global financial crisis. We are going to borrow to do that. Governments in the past have borrowed to do that. The federal government has a AAA credit rating. We have a very sound balance sheet, and net debt in this country is very low by international standards. It is very low, and that is a good thing, and it is one of the things that gives us the capacity to respond to the global financial crisis. Net debt, shadow Treasurer would see in the papers that we have published this week, is expected to be about five per cent of GDP at the end of the forward estimates. That compares to 45 per cent across the OECD. So we have a strong balance sheet, a strong capacity to borrow to support jobs and economic growth in this country, and that is the responsible thing to do. The states do the same, and they did the same under your government, the Howard government. They borrowed for critical economic infrastructure. It was ticked off by the Loan Council, just as it is ticked off by this government. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As the Treasurer has confirmed that the Commonwealth will be borrowing in excess of $200 billion and he has said during his answer that he would come back with the answer to the question of how much the state governments will borrow over the next four years, I ask that he provide that information before the end of question time today.",97
166,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no provision for the chair or anybody to demand that. The point has been made. Education  the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on problems for schools and communities, which will be addressed by the Building the Education Revolution initiative, and any obstacles to resolving those problems?",97
167,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Chifley for his question and acknowledge his advocacy and support of the 38 primary as the schools, nine combined primary-secondary schools, 18 secondary schools and one special school in his electorate, all of which will benefit from our Building the Education Revolution program, which is there to benefit every school in this country. This program, of course, is supported by the people who care about education, particularly the Australian Primary Principals Association, which said: The education package provides much needed support for our building industry but more importantly it is a long term investment for Australia's young children. I table that press release. Of course, it got strong support from the Australian Special Education Principals Association, who have talked about how it is ‘a shot in the arm for special schools around the nation who have been struggling to provide quality learning environments for students with disabilities'. They go on to talk about the problems of teaching those students in temporary, fabricated, non-purpose-built classrooms that are up to 30 years old. I table that press release. In view of this endorsement from the education community, what we know at the end of this sitting week, as parliament draws to a close, is that members of parliament on this side of the House will be able to go back to their local communities saying that they have a Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Members on that side of the House will go back saying that they have no plan. Members on this side of the House will go back to their local communities saying that they are united in their determination to work with Australians as they face this global financial crisis. Members on that side of the House will go back deeply divided, as the cracks in their position already show, with members like the member for MCEwen and the member for Menzies not endorsing the foolish strategy being pursued by the Leader of the Opposition. Importantly, members on this side of the House will be able to go back to their communities saying that they are pursuing the national interest, whereas members on that side of the House will go back trying to defend their rank political interest. Members on this side of the House will go back to their local schools able to talk to them about new investments, meaning new jobs, in their local communities. It really does amaze me what members on that side of the House are going to say to those local schools. To give you some indication of the kinds of twists and turns members on that side of the House are going to have to engage in, I have, of course, received correspondence from members on that side of the House about the circumstances of their local schools-schools they now say should not get a cent from the Building the Education Revolution program. I refer to correspondence from the member for MCEwen, who said, ‘Healesville High School is in desperate need of better facilities,' and I table that respondence. What is she going to say? I am the minister with a program that you voted against that could assist Healesville High",97
168,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
169,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly! I have the correspondence of the member for Parkes, who wrote to me about the circumstances of Gulgong High School. He wrote: I am writing on behalf of Gulgong High School, who are in great need of further capital and maintenance works to school facilities. I table that correspondence. What is he going to say to that local school? On the same day he wrote to me again, saying that he was writing on behalf of Moree Secondary College Student Representative Council, who had great concerns over the terrible state of a number of student facilities at the college's Carol Avenue campus. I table that correspondence. What is he going to say to that local community? Then I refer to correspondence I received from the member for La Trobe, who raised with me the circumstances of Sassafras Primary School. He wrote: Minister, I have very strong concerns about the need for funding for upgrades to Sassafras Primary School. What is he going to say to that local school? I table that correspondence. On the question of the school communities of the member for Barker, which was raised in this parliament earlier today, I table for the House the list of 104 schools in the Barker electorate that are eligible to benefit from the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program of the government, a program he is opposed to. Dr Southcott-Where's Milton North?",98
170,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am coming to that. I table for the benefit of the House the list of cor127 schools in his electorate that would be eligible to benefit from our national school pride program, a program he is opposed to. I table for the benefit of members in the House the list of 19 secondary schools in his electorate who would be eligible for our 21st century science and language centres program, a program he is opposed to. Finally, for the benefit of members in the House, I table an email. I am going to apologise: it has been the sort of week where the name ‘Milton' has been on the brain. But, yes, this is a piece of correspondence from the headmaster of the school at Millicent; undoubtedly the Leader of the Opposition would like it renamed ‘Milton'. But, because of the Rudd Labor government, this is a school eligible for our Building the Education Revolution program, and I would be interested to see what the member for Barker has to say to them when he gets home, seeing how excited they are about this program. I table this piece of correspondence. Members of the Liberal Party are opposed to building an education revolution, they are opposed to local jobs, they are acting in their rank political interest, and now they are going to have days and days back at home trying to explain that to their local community members. It is going to be an interesting sight to see. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA  Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",98

177,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Calare proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse effects of high levels of ment debt on regional Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",100
178,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Calare) (4.24 pm)Last night, this House passed a bill, which will now go to the Senate, which not only contains provisions for the government to spend $42 billion but also allows them to go into debt of up to $200 billion. That is $9½ thousand dollars-nearly $10,000-for every man, woman and child in Australia. It will be our children and their children who will have to pay that back. With regard to the $42 billion, this is not job creating. Anybody who has been reading what informed economists-rather than political commentators-are saying, will realise that. If you want to create opportunities, if you want to get a bang for your buck, you could look at what the new President of America, Mr Obama, and the Democrats are putting up. They are getting somewhere between a dollar-for-dollar return and 1.7. By the Treasury's own figures, we are looking at something like a 30c return for every dollar of that $42 billion. If you want return in terms of jobs, it needs to be spent on infrastructurenot of a social nature but of an ongoing nature-like transport. It needs to be spent on what will help productivity, what will help employers know that they will get a faster delivery and fewer impediments in their productive cycle. That is what we need to do. Rather than putting money into a stimulus package, a social package, we need to put money into productivity, into creating jobs, into knowing that what we are doing is ongoing-in other words, that it will produce. At a time like this, when we are looking at not just a few months but a long period of tough Governeconomic times, we need to produce taxes and GST in the future, because it will have to be paid back. The last time the Labor Party took these sorts of steps, we ended up owing $96 billion. That took 10 years-a full decade-of very hard and very good economic management to pay off. Just imagine if, during that decade of hard, tough growth that it took to pay off that $96 billion, we did not have to pay the interest on it let alone repay the capital. The interest alone paid on the $96 billion would have built a new four-lane highway over the Blue Mountains, joining the eastern seaboard with western New South Wales. It would have put a dual highway across the entire length of the Pacific Highway, built the inland railway link between Melbourne and Brisbane, fixed our ports, blacktopped thousands of kilometres of road, provided new classrooms and amenities for schools and built new hospitals in regional Australia. Instead, the coalition had to make incredibly hard political and economic decisions to pay back not just the interest but the capital as well. Regional Australia is still scarred by the last Labor ‘recession we had to have'. I had friends who were paying 23 and 24 per cent interest rates in small business and agriculture. I guess we had a debt burden that resulted in government investment in jobcreating infrastructure being curtailed. A $200 billion debt, which by the Treasurer's own admission we are going to go to or exceed, will have an effect on everything. It is going to have an enormous effect because not only will the debt have to be paid back but the government, when we get through this very tough economic time, will have to pay the interest. It is going to have to repay the money. While the effect on interest rates of government getting into debt to this extent will not necessarily push them up in the immediate sense-in a recession we would normally expect to have low interest rateswhen the corner is turned and productivity and growth start to increase again, having $200 billion of government debt putting government in competition with farmers, small business, homeowners and home builders is going to have an incredible effect. When we look back to the pressures last time that interest rates went through the roof, government competition had an enormous effect. Farmers in small business in regional Australia do know about debt; they understand it; they deal with it. It is an industry which, because it is so capital intensive, is also very debt intensive. It is a well-known fact. A few years ago, 80 per cent of most of the debt in regional or rural Australia also produced about 80 per cent of the production. It is a strange thing, but I guess if you owe money you have got a good impetus to produce. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",100
179,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"An article in today's Financial Review sums up an awful lot of what is involved in this $42 billion proposal. It says: The Rudd government's stimulus package provides little bang for the buck. I believe the Financial Review is right when it states: Of more concern is the heavy weighting of the infrastructure spending towards social infrastructure such as school buildings and public housing, which has low and distant returns, and the negligible investment in higher-yielding economic infrastructure. As I said before, instead of a 1.7 return we are looking at a 30c return on a dollar. You do not have to be that smart to know that to come out of a recession as quickly as possible, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, it is about jobs, jobs, jobs. Without doubt, regional Australia took the brunt of the high unemployment during the last Labor credit card binge. We know about unemployment and we know about the pain it causes. We need an economic stimulus that provides jobcreating infrastructure not just now but also into the future. When the member for Gippsland made his remarks, he was certainly talking about infrastructure. He was talking about job-creating infrastructure. He was talking about roads. He was talking about things that have an ongoing ability to stimulate and keep regional Australia positive about jobs. As I said before, what is going on with the Rudd government's $42 billion package is that it has a very low return, because it is investing in those things which do not have ongoing returns in terms of jobs, in terms of tax and in terms of GST-which might help get the Treasurer's mates off the hook in the future. If we have to go into debt to provide an economic stimulus, it should go towards building infrastructure that helps business to be more productive so that they can employ people and so that employers can keep people on and put more people on. We already have additional cost burdens in regional Australia because of the tyranny of distance and the need to compete. Obviously, because the options are fewer, we need the stimulus more than most places do. The options are far fewer in regional Australia. A headline in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday sums up, without doubt, many of the feelings of people in regional Australia: ‘Thanks for the help, but it could be better spent.' The article quotes a Mirrool farmer, Buster Fairman: ‘I think [Prime Minister Kevin Rudd] should sit on some of this money until times get really tough… The financial crisis has only just begun.' The article continues: Mr Fairman, 56, will be putting his $950 aside a rainy day. Quite obviously, that is what has already happened with the $8.5 billion. No more than 20 per cent of that has been spent. People are not silly. The Prime Minister walked around the whole of December saying, ‘Spend, spend, spend,' and then he walked around the whole of January telling everybody how terrible things are. Let us remember that all of this is exacerbated in regional Australia. People are not silly. Of course they put it in their pockets. Some spending went up, but less than 20 per cent of that $8.5 billion was spent. People are not stupid. Yes, they do want infrastructure spending, but they want it on things which are going to be ongoing and produce jobs, not just on things which have an end period and which are way out in the future in terms of return to the nation. In regional Australia we have real health issues. In New South Wales in particular, we have health issues that you would not know about. I take my hat off to the Minister for Health and Ageing for acknowledging in question time today the state of health in western New South Wales. On Tuesday evening I related an incident about just how bad and how biased things are in New South Wales west of the Blue Mountains. Going into debt to the tune of $2 billion, and just getting warmed up with $42 billion is going to leave regional Australia in the most awful position as far as ongoing money in the future for health and for education. In the hard years we went through from 1996 on, paying back that $10 billion, it was a long time before we could put serious money into roads, health and education in regional Australia, because of what we were left with last time. Last year the government used the excuse of the inflation genie being out of the bottle to cut billions of dollars out of services and infrastructure in regional Australia. In fact, I for well remember that the very first act of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation was to slash $640 million out of services and programs around Australia, and guess where three-quarters of that came from? It did not come from Wollongong or Newcastle; it came from regional Australia. It was not Sydney or Melbourne that lost that. This should be about jobs. In my electorate of Calare, we have lost well over a thousand jobs in the last four months. There is nothing in the mining industry. There is nothing in this package which is going to help reinstate those people or find alternative employment for them. In fact, most of them were on over $50,000 so they would probably not even be eligible for the $950, because I think that was as of the end of June last year, on the last financial year's return. So they are not going to do terribly well out of that. If the government were to just take a look at what is going on around the place, instead of stripping all the water out of the Murray-Darling Basin and making things even worse, they could put money into some infrastructure which would help efficiencies, help production, help the diversity of the irrigation industry and pay that money back in the future-which it would-and there would be jobs to go with it. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was scathing a minute ago because, as I said earlier, the member for Gippsland said that we wanted infrastructure. We do want infrastructure, but we want to spend on infrastructure which is going to do things. Out of $42 billion there is a bit for the investment allowance, but people are not going to invest all that much in the current situation. They are going to go on about the $860 million that they are putting into various forms and classes. Well, $500 million of that-half a billion-is going to councils, once again to be spent on social infrastructure which does not have those ongoings. This is about keeping people in a job here and now and over the next few years while we get through this crisis. It staggers me every time. I hear the Treasurer get up and say that we just do not get point. We do get the point. Regional Australia has been there before. We were there before when we had to deal with the $96 billion and, like the rest of Australia, we had to deal with what it took for those who were in government in 1996 to pay it back. We had to wait before we could get a few programs to get some seed money into regional Australia to get going again. If it took that long-a decade-to pay back $96 billion, what is going to happen when they get up over, in the Treasurer's words, $200 billion, especially if we happen to still have a government who do not give a damn about that part of Australia? As I said, we have been there before with 23 and 24 per cent interest rates, no money for roads and no money for health or schools in regional Australia. All that money was going towards paying the cost of federal and state government debts at the time instead of putting a highway through the Blue Mountains, instead of putting roads out- (Time expired)",101
180,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Watson-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (4.39 pm)Every now and then when you read out part of a document, you wonder, ‘Should I table it? Should I give them access to the rest of it?' I thought I would do the right thing and table it. I have listened carefully to the ments that have just been made by the shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry where he has wanted to characterise what the member for Gippsland really meant when he uttered those prophetic words in his media release, saying: Investing in regional infrastructure will help local communities to withstand the worse of the global financial crisis and I encourage the government to act quickly in this regard. The shadow minister was effectively claiming that I had misrepresented those remarks because he said that what the government was offering, essentially-and I do not think the I am mischaracterising it here-was shortterm infrastructure projects, and what the member for Gippsland was really talking about was long-term infrastructure, like roads. So I had probably better read a little more of that media release. Mr Gray-Please do.",103
181,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is the one with this heading, which will help to explain to the member for Calare his concept about the long term infrastructure and road projects that the member for Gippsland was really talking about. The media release begins like this: ‘Chester calls for netball courts funding'. In terms of the long-term infrastructure that the shadow minister was just talking about, I give a few suggestions. First of all, I suggest that the member for Gippsland understands that projects themselves generate construction jobs and you get a whole lot of knock-on areas in the economy. For those members opposite, it is something that seems to be better understood by their backbench than by their front-bench. I would also be dearly concerned about the member for Calare's possible occupational health and safety concerns if he sees a netball court in the future as a road. Beyond that, I make the suggestion that a document is tabled so that you can have a look at it rather than try to guess what the commember for Gippsland really meant. I think he really meant what he said. It is available on the public record-and these are projects which do not meet the characterisation at all of what the shadow minister kept asserting. Mr John Cobb-Look at the big picture, mate.",103
182,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is an interesting concept with respect to what the shadow minister just interjected, about looking at the big picture. He should understand, with the portfolio that he has, that part of understanding the big picture in a country as diverse as ours is making sure that you tend to the local picture in every part of the nation. We have a whole group of local members of parliament on this side of the House who understand how to do that in their own areas and who understand the importance in their own areas of making sure that, because a primary school is a local project for a relatively small number of people, it is still part of the big picture. When you are talking about investing in every school-it does not matter whether it is a primary school or a high school, a government school or a non-government school, in the private system or in the Catholic system-all throughout the country, you get the big-picture benefit. You get the benefits in education because of the upgraded facilities. You get the benefits in the actual process of building those facilities-the benefits in terms of what happens for local contractors and the construction industry and the challenges that they are currently facing in the context of the global financial crisis. You get extra benefits because those contractors do not just receive the money and leave the town; the money gets spent in the area. This generates real economic activity at a time when all the advice that is coming to the government says that we need to make sure that we are generating economic activity and that we should be doing this not just in major cities but also in every school throughout the nation and looking at those black spot programs and saying, ‘Now is the time to make the investment and start fixing those', and to actually go to the situation of the level crossings. Members opposite would understand the frustration over years of delay on doing something about level crossings and the impact that that has. Once again, you have the impact on the jobs and the workers involved in doing the job and you have the spin-off industries with them then spending the money that they have earned in the local area, and you have the long-term infrastructure improvement of local roads. All that is part of the big picture. The Leader of the Nationals made the complaint that not every farmer will receive the $950. That is true-it is not every farmer, but it is pretty close to 21,000 of the most needy. We are making sure that they get some extra money. In terms of the business expenses that they have on their farms it is certainly a modest amount of money, but the impact that it could then have on local towns is deeply significant. The shadow minister for agriculture knows that the towns where there are the most people on EC payments are the towns where not just farmers are suffering but also every contractor and every shopkeeper is suffering. People having that extra EC money helped to generate economic activity in areas that needed it desperately, before we had ever heard of the economic crisis. Those areas desperately needed help, economic activity and assistance long before the world went into recession. Our plan provides some more money to help generate long-term economic activity, and the money will not disappear from the economy the first time it is spent. Mr John Cobb-People would much rather hear that EC is going to be continued.",104
183,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have to pause at that. There is a deeply irresponsible fear campaign that the shadow minister has been involved in time and time again when people's EC comes up for assessment by the National Rural Advisory Council. We are talking about people who have the greatest mental health problems and the highest suicide rates in the nation, and you decide to run a fear campaign when you know full well that we are running the assessments with the same panel under the same rules. Mr John Cobb-Tell them it's going to be rolled over.",104
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order!,105
185,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Communities are doing it tougher than they were when they were last given EC, so logically you can tell where that is going to end up. You know full well that there is a process that I am followingthe same process that was in place under the previous government. Mr John Cobb interjecting",105
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Calare is warned!,105
187,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the member for Calare feels proud of scaring farming families, of raising fear amongst some of the most vulnerable people in this country, then be his head. Mr John Cobb-You've already scared the hell out of them!",105
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Calare has been warned.,105
189,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Be it on your head if that is what you want to do. I have given the guarantee time and time again that EC will be granted under the same rules. There is nothing more irresponsible than running a fear campaign amongst people who are already so desperately vulnerable in so many ways. The projects that are part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan are designed to make sure that we can help to generate economic activity and support jobs at a time where comparable nations are in recession. We are in a global recession, and if you were going to be anywhere in the world you would want to be here. We want to make sure that as a government we act decisively and early to make sure that we continue to generate economic activity with long-term and lasting benefits. On this side of the House we support the $950 payments going to singles. For so long we as a parliament have made sure that we have provided assistance for families, but how many times have singles missed out, even though they have been suffering and have tremendous bills to deal with? For the first time in a long time there are bonus payments for them. On this side of the House we support the farmer's hardship bonus, which members opposite are trying to block. We support those bonuses because we understand the situation that the globe is in. Years ago there was a Supertramp album cover that was all doom and gloom except for a little bit of colour where someone was wearing sunglasses and sitting on a banana lounge. The album was called Crisis? What Crisis? That is the world that the opposition it on are living in if the comments from the shadow minister are any guide. It is as if they think the global economic crisis does not demand immediate decisive action. It is as if they have no idea how our economy interacts with the economies throughout the rest of the world. It is as if they do not understand that drought is but one of the challenges that farmers are facing. It is as if they have no idea about world commodity prices and what has happened over the last year with fertiliser and chemical prices. We know how responsive our economy is to what happens in the rest of the world. While the rest of the world is in such extraordinary hardship and recession, members opposite say, ‘Sit back, relax and take your time. But this government is going to make sure that we act decisively. Our Nation Building and Jobs Plan covers different policy areas and will be felt right throughout the nation. The measures include free ceiling insulation for around 2.7 million Australian homes; building or upgrading a building in every one of Australia's 9,540 schools; building more than 20,000 new social and defence homes; $950 one-off cash payments to eligible families, single workers, students, drought affected farmers and others; a temporary business investment tax break for small and general businesses buying eligible assets; and significantly increasbeyond ing funding for local community infrastructure and local road projects. When members opposite go back to their electorates this weekend, to each and every constituent who asks, ‘Am I eligible?' they not only will have to explain whether or not they would be eligible under the government scheme but also will have to say, ‘You'd be eligible under what is proposed but we are trying to stop it.' Make sure that you explain to the farmers in your electorates who are on EC-midway through trying to scare the hell out of them, as you seem to want to dowhy you do not believe in a $950 payment for their family. Tell them why, in your judgement as the shadow minister for agriculture and representative of the National Party, you do not think they are worthy of that $950 payment. Go and visit your schools tomorrow. Ask them first what sort of infrastructure project they would like, and then explain to them that you are trying to stop them from getting it. Explain that to the local contractors who would have got the work. Explain it to the construction workers who would have had an economic opportunity. Explain it to the subbies who would have been able to get a job. Explain why you are opposed to it to the people in retail who would have benefited from there being a higher level of economic activity in the town. If the members opposite do that this weekend, we will see if they are still as irresponsible when they come back next week. The people of Australia understand. The people of Australia are able to watch the news and understand what is happening in the rest of the world. They want to make sure that there is strong and decisive action so that we are not exposed to the full level of pain that the rest of the world is having. They want to make sure that we have a plan that generates immediate economic activity and, that, makes sure that we have the long-term infrastructure for which people have been waiting for such a long timesuch things as improvement of black spots on roads, dealing with level crossings and upgrading schools. These are things that members of the Labor Party are proud to have always believed in and are proud to be able to now deliver on. We are proud that we are able to be seen as members of the Labor Party. We are proud that we are able to look at our constituents in good faith, that we can see people in genuine need and be able to say that we are on their side, notwithstanding that we sit in this chamber and face people who want to take benefits away.",105
190,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this MPI and I certainly wish to note the passion of my colleague the member for Calare in supporting regional communities, because he is all too aware of what the impact of debt is on regional communities. The member for Calare is all too aware of the impact of high levels of debt on farming operations and knows that, just as high levels of debt have adverse effects on businesses-and on farming operations in particular-they also restrict the ability of governments to deliver services to the people of Australia. We had Kevin Rudd during the 2007 election campaignMr Burke-Call him the Prime Minister!",106
191,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We had the Prime Minister during the 2007 election campaign pretending to be some sort of fiscal conservative. He appeared in this rather glossy ad in front of the skyline of Brisbane and he said to the people of Australia, ‘People of Australia, I am a fiscal conservative. I am against debt. I am against living beyond our means.' And what do we see when the Prime Minister has been elected to government? We see he has morphed from a fiscal conservative into the advocate of one of the greatest debt binges since Federation. We had Whitlam, with his good friends Mr Khemlani and Rex Connor. We had the Keating era, with massive debt handed on to a coalition government that had to clean up the mess. But compared to what has gone before, the debt binge that we are embarking upon in this year of 2009-when the objective should be the creation of jobs, jobs, jobsmakes the efforts of Keating, Hawke, Khemlani, Connor and Whitlam look like small change. In the year when the objective should be jobs, jobs, jobs, we have a $42 billion stimulus package that is going to turn, in the first year of its operation, a $22 billion surplus into a $22½ billion deficit. It is going to deliver a $70 billion deficit over the forward estimates-all of this from a fiscal conservative! If you believe that, you can believe anything. As I highlighted earlier, the real problem is the impact of debt on reducing the ability of the government to deliver services into the future. The real problem is the impact of debt on the young people in regional and rural Australia whose employment opportunities are nowhere near as strong as they are for those in the cities. In regional and rural Australia we lack the numbers of large employers and big businesses that can provide very strong employment prospects. In regional Australia we are very dependent upon small business. The impact of high government debt on the small business sector is huge. We saw it under Whitlam, we have seen it under Hawke and Keating, and we are going to see it again under this alleged fiscal conservative. There has been quite a bit of disquiet about this new package. I think that the members opposite believed that the people of Australia were going to rain rose petals at their feet and thank them for all the money that was going to rain down upon them. But in fact the reaction has been quite different. The people of Australia realise the impact of debt. The people of Australia realise it is not the Prime Minister and it is not the Treasurer who will be paying back that money; it is the taxpayers of Australia. Yesterday, legislation was introduced and passed that is going to increase the borrowing capability of this government to $200 billion-that is Hawke-Keating by more than two to one. In the House today, it was absolutely stunning that the Treasurer, when asked, could not say what the debt obligations of the states were going to be. Just a day after seeking authority from this parliament to raise the debt levels to $200 billion, he could not say what the states were going to be borrowing. The Treasurer of this land knew what the Commonwealth obligation would be, but he did not know what those apparently irrelevant states were going to borrow. That is astounding. That is incompetence. That is negligent, because it is the taxpayers of those states and territories and the taxpayers of the Commonwealth who have to repay that debt, and our Treasurer was oblivious to the financial position that this country is in. It was interesting to look at some of the editorial comments in the Financial Review today in relation to that package. I would just like to read a couple of sections. The Financial Review editorial starts: Labor, which opposed virtually every major reform of the Howard government in opposition, is in uproar at the Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull's plan to oppose the $42 billion stimulus package. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday accused “those free-market fundamentalists”those evil free marketers who created wealth over 30 years and who created growth in this country… in the coalition of “cheap politics” for not instantly saluting his plan, and for good measure insinuated they were somehow responsible for the global financial crisis. But it is Mr Rudd who is playing politics with his transparent attempt to fit his stimulus package into a road the opposition into passing a massive set of appropriation bills in 48 hours. Quite rightly we should be challenging this package. It is our job to place this package under great scrutiny. As time goes on and as the unintended consequences become more obvious to the Australian people and they think about the debt which they are having forced upon them, they will be quite rightly delighted, I would say, that the opposition has stood up for the them against the cheap politics of the Labor Party-dressed up as some alleged attempt to build jobs. When we look at the productivity of this package, the Prime Minister asks us to believe him-to take it on trust-that this is the most efficient and most effective way to create jobs, that it is the most efficient and most effective way to ensure that the economy rebuts, if you like, the impact of the global financial downturn. The editorial goes on and makes some interesting observations about the relative weightings of investment in social infrastructure. It talks about the fact that the weighting in spending towards social infrastructure, which has low and distant returns, and the negligible investment in higher yielding economic infrastructure would actually cause a lower multiplier effect on economic activity than the stimulus package proposed by Obama. So we have a package that appears less effective, according to the Financial Review, than the package being put forward by President Obama in the United States, yet we have the Prime Minister telling us that this is the package that is going to deliver the goods and that this is the only set of measures that is going to deliver for the people of Australia. It is quite clearly absurd. Michael Knox, an analyst from ABN AMRO, made some interesting observations and calculations in relation to this package. political ploy to rail- He said: In 2008-09 we are spending 1.7 per cent of GDP in stimulus to get an increase in GDP of 0.5 per cent. That means we are spending $1 in stimulus to only get 30c of GDP. This is a multiplier of just 0.3, very low by international comparisons. We have been asked by the Prime Minister to take this on trust, and we see from this analysis by ABN AMRO that the multiplier effect is only 0.3. It is less than what would be expected internationally. How does that provide for the needs of the people of Australia to have jobs createdMr John Cobb-I don't think the agriculture minister got that.",107
192,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right-and growth underpinned, particularly in regional areas, because regional areas are already hard hit by rising unemployment? The member for Calare chronicled the loss of jobs in his electorate. Some 1,000 jobs in mining have gone in the last few months. I know that in the electorate of Cowper, which I represent, across all the small labour market areas unemployment is rising in the order of about one-half of one per cent to, in some cases, 0.7 per cent and, in the Nambucca Valley, 0.9 per cent. Those latest figures in relation to small labour market areas were only for the September quarter. That predated the December quarter, when we know unemployment accelerated. Quite clearly, in the current quarter, unemployment is only going to continue to rise at a far more rapid rate. The needs of regional and rural Australia are urgent. We do not want to see suboptimal expenditure of government funds, as is the case with this stimulus package. The opposition have opposed this package for precisely that fact. We believe the money could be better spent. We believe this current debt binge is only going to put a burden on the people of Australia into the future, and it is about time that the members opposite woke up to that and brought some sense into the package that they are putting forward.",108
193,Mr GRAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (5.03 pm)-What a lazy way for those opposite to finish the week. Having started the week in a lazy fashion, last night, when an important debate was taking place in this House, they slept and their leader slept. Their leader did not get out of bedMr Hartsuyker-Your leader slept!",109
194,Mr GRAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and did not come in here to debate the very debt issues that you now claim to be important. Why do you claim that they are important? It is not for any reason of principle but purely for your own lowrent political expediency. You knowbecause the story has been well chronicled by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-the way in which the National Party today spends its time in fearmongering and trying the best it can to spread fear amongst farmers and regional communities that our government does not have the interests of regional Australia at heart. I was hoping for a real debate here this afternoon. I was hoping for a debate about jobs, about the global financial crisis, about education, about infrastructure and about economic activity. But you do not get that. What you get from a clapped out, tired National Party-tired in the first week of sittings-is a pathetic attempt to disguise politics as principle. That is not even a sad reflection on those opposite. It is just the truth-and you know that to be the truth. You know that if members opposite really believed in this motion they would have been in here last night and this morning to vote. You know that the National Party was the most underrepresented party in the parliament. While we worked, members of the National Party slept. When it came to voting on the very important matters that are allegedly the subject of the debate today, members of the National Party and their leader were simply in bed. Let us face the facts. You do not really have a problem with debt. Your own performance as a government, your own performance with Regional Partnerships, was criticised in a three-volume, 1,200-page National Audit Office review, which pointed to the absolute collapse and failure of good governance and good administration and decent public policy. You know that the interests of the National Party are not the interests of good governance and good public administration. What we are debating today is the plan which the government has for nation building and job protection. And what is that plan? It is about school facilities upgrades for 9,540 schools. It is about insulation for 2.7 million homes. It is about cash payments to families of $950. It is about the construction of 20,000 social houses, public houseslike the ones that I and my friend the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government grew up in-that, in almost every speech last night from members opposite, were criticised as being a waste of money. We know the view that those opposite have of renters. We know because that view has been published time and time again over the last 15 years, and we know that the previous Howard government did not put one cent into public housing. We know it did not have a minister for housing. We know that, under the last government, the public housing stock of our nation declined, and we know that homelessness increased. We know the lack of care and the lack of concern. The announcements this week by the government also go to the creation of specific tax breaks. They boost local community infrastructure. The package is about support for jobs. It is about decisive action. It is about aligning monetary policy with fiscal policy, something which those opposite never considered in their entire period of government. To have the Reserve Bank of Australia pushing down interest rates while monetary policy is boosting our economy is exactly the balance advised by the IMF and by insightful economists, and it is the advice taken by the Rudd government. It has not been at any time the policy matrix pursued by those opposite. In fact, as you know and we know, fiscal policy and monetary policy for the bulk of your time in government worked in opposite directions. You spent like drunken sailors and you pushed up interest rates in order to compensate, forcing hard working families to have higher mortgages to pay for the profligacy of your government. It was a disgrace, and the people of Australia quite properly treated your government with the lack of regard that your government treated Australian families. You say in your matter of public importance that the issue is about debt. It is not really about debt. It should be about caring for families, in cities and in regions. It is actually about putting the interests of the National Party first. That is interesting because members opposite in the National Party do not do that themselves. In your own lives, in your own work in this place, you do not put the interests of the National Party first. The great leaders of the National Party of the past would never have put a matter of public importance before this parliament in the way in which you have. MCEwen would not have. Doug Anthony would not have. Charles Blunt would not have. John Anderson would not have. You know Tim Fischer would not have. Ian Sinclair would have. Mark Vailehe would not have. Year on year we have seen the National Party decline, at its own hands. In 1996 there were 18 members of the National Party in also this place. By 1998 there were 16 members of the National Party in this place. By 2001 there were 13 members of the National Party in this place. By 2004 there were 12 members of the National Party in this place. By 2007 there were 10. Currently we have nine, when they are not asleep, when they bother to turn up in this chamber and represent the interests of the families and communities who voted for them. It tells you something about the people of rural and regional Australia-they were onto something when they decided the National Party was not for them. Barnaby Joyce knows that. Let us look at the National Party leaders: Mark Vaile gone, seat lost; Tim Fischer gone, seat lost; Ian Sinclair gone, seat now lost; Doug Anthony gone, seat now lost-at your own hands. Your ability to whittle away your own party, your own base, is why you come into this place at a late hour on a Thursday afternoon and practise what you preach, which is merely fearmongering and the invention of stories about how our government behaves to communities. Worse still, there are occasions when I think you actually believe it. We have had a package already, in 2008, which was designed to get our economy through the difficult fourth quarter of 2008. We had a bank guarantee that has held our banking system in good stead. We have had engagement with the G20, with the IMF and with global institutions. While we work, if those opposite are not asleep, they spend their time undermining public confidence. They spend their time trying to crush business confidence. They try to destroy our national confidence. For what? For pure political advantage. Let me explain why this matter of public importance is so weak and so pathetic. It is because people-kids, families, workers, farmers-in regional Australia are actually doing it hard. Let us talk about the real impact of the global financial crisis on jobs in regional Australia. In Western Australia in the last quarter, in Kununurra, Argyle Diamonds shed 300 jobs; at Koolan Island, Mount Gibson Iron shed 190 jobs; and at Leonard Shelf, in zinc and lead, Xstrata shed 300 jobs. At Spinifex Ridge-these places are all through the Kimberley and the Pilbara-at Moly Mines, 70 jobs were lost. At a tantalum mine, 200 jobs were lost. At Telfer goldmine, a Newcrest operation, 400 jobs were lost. At FMG's Cloud Break iron ore mine, 180 jobs were lost. At Mount Keith nickel mine, 300 jobs were lost. At Waterloo nickel mine, 150 jobs were lost. At Golden Grove zinc-copper mine, 70 jobs were lost. I am only at the central west of Western Australia. The impact of the global financial crisis on regional Australia and on mining communities is immense, and it is likely only worse. That is why our government has acted early and acted with decisive intent and with a precise set of policies to respond in a way that will help families, help our regional committees and help Australia.

195,Mr NEVILLE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hinkler) (5.13 pm)Madam Deputy Speaker, you will not be getting any gloom or doom from me. Nor will you be getting any fear tactics. Nor do I think the member for Calare was on about fear tactics. I think what he was on about was getting certainty for EC and country areas so that farmers do not have to wait, year on year, to know whether they are going to receive assistance. There is a lot of concern in country areas, after a prolonged drought and floods, about the fragility of primary industry. If you really want to help them-as the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia said-and have a trickle-down effect to contractors and small businesses and the like, then certainly you will get some resonance from a $950 grant. But let me make an even better suggestion. If you really are concerned about the continuation of country people, why not give a two percentage point subsidy on farm debt, say, with a three-year ceiling? Then you would have money flowing in. You would have money flowing from the farmers to the contractors and to the small businesses-not just in one splash but on an ongoing basis-and you would give farmers the capacity to support those contractors and small businesses. When it comes to the upgrade of schools, I beg you not to give the money to QBuild or state works departments, because it will never get done in the time and it will be twice the price. Feed it out to the principals and the P&Cs, as we did in the Investing in Our Schools Program-which people on the to get government side freely admit was a very good program. Get the money to where it needs to go. That way, the money will go to contractors, painters and so on in country towns, not the ones QBuild will bring out from Brisbane or the works department will bring from Sydney or Melbourne. We have got to stimulate. That, by the way, is the subject of today's MPI: it is all about stimulating business and stimulating economic energy in country areas. When it comes to road funding, do the same as we did before. Give it in a Roads to Recovery type program where you let the councils make the decisions about where the money goes. You will always get a bigger bang for the government buck. I cite two councils in my former electorate area of Eidsvold and Parry, two of the smallest shires in Queensland at the time and two of the most efficient with their roadworks. That is another thing you could look at. We talk about level crossings and, having done a report on level crossings for this parliament in 2004, I support the principle very strongly. In one sense $150 million is a lot of money and in another sense it is not, because it will cover 200 boom-gate type level crossings and I am sure most of those will go to the capital cities or the larger provincials and their environs. If you want to help create a trickle-down effect in country areas, bearing in mind that there are 9,400 level crossings in Australia, and if you really want to help to get some of those level crossings, put lights on some in country areas. You do not need boom gates but certainly put on lights. On a country road where there are only a few trains a week, put a hundred metres of bitumen and rumble strips either side, because you will not have electricity there to provide either lights or boom gates. Do an integrated thing that trickles down into country areas and provides employment and the like. My problem with the splashes of cash in all the recent programs is this: I am sure they work, I am sure the $1,400 and the $2,100 payments were welcome, but infinitely better for pensioners would have been a $500 grant and a $30 increase in their pension. Over the first year that would have been better than $1,400. Going to the $950 package, let me take those receiving Austudy as one example from the whole list of people getting it. Don't you think parents in country areas trying to get their kids to school would rather have $30 a week for the whole course than a $950 splash once? Let us get fair dinkum. I will finish on another one. If we are really interested in opening up inland Australia, creating employment and generating economic energy, we should put in the inland rail. We on both sides of this parliament talk about it; we have been talking about it for 10 years. With $42 billion at hand, wouldn't you think that three-quarters of a billion or a billion put into that inland rail would generate jobs galore and confidence galore? (Time expired)",111
196,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I take heart from the member for Hinonly kler, a man whom I respect a great deal and also a man with some good ideas. The member for Hinkler has regional Australia at his heart and always has had, and so do I and so do many on this side of the House. I take heart from the member for Hinkler because to this point I have been very worried. The member for Hinkler clearly supports our package and would make a great contribution by offering a number of projects for regional and rural Australia. You clearly support it and I am amazed that you did not vote with us last night. You know that this package is clearly designed to help rural and regional Australia, as it is to help urban Australia. What worried me first and foremost before I heard you is this. We have got a problem, we have got a challenge and we have got to do something about it. This package is designed to do that. The other worry I have is that, apart from the member for Hinkler, those on the other side are not going to do anything about supporting this package for rural and regional Australia as well as urban Australia. Today I was pleased to hear through the COAG communique the unanimous support for this package from all states of Australia-including the Western Australian Liberal Premier-and also the representative of the Local Government Association of Australia. They clearly endorse our package. With this package goes a series of programs and outlays that we developed and have put into place since the budget of last year. The member for Hinkler talked about a rail project. I do not know the details of that but I am sure that if it has merit then it will see way into Infrastructure Australia. We have a mechanism and a process for that to happen, not just for urban Australia but for rural and regional Australia. I can tell the member for Hinkler-and he knows I come from a rural and regional area myself-that my community of Braddon sees hope in this package and sees the good intention of it. This package is designed to try and support and sustain jobs-not to lose them but to support and sustain them. It is part and parcel of a much wider program that began when we got into government. You only have to look at the programs, initiatives and commitments we made before the election that were in our budget of last year. They will roll out over the next three years, along with what we did in October and December and what we are doing here. They are part and parcel of a much broader program. It is about jobs; it is about supporting communities. This silly talk that we are ideologically driven to put this country into debt is silly and those opposite know it, and the Australian people are sick to death of the stupidity of these arguments. This package may not be the bee's knees. There may be issues with it. No doubt the member for Hinkler, in his wisdom, will be able to assist with the projects for his region. He is going to benefit from this as well. He is a political representative, after all, and we expect him to do his part in promoting this and not oppose it. I say to him: do your bit for this, warts and all. Its intention is for both jobs and communities. We heard the shadow minister speak about infrastructure in schools as if it did not mean anything. Infrastructure is needed in our schools; we know that. In some states it is in appalling condition. Also, this package will generate jobs. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer, our front-bench and the rest of this side have said, ‘We are its interested in this program more than anything'-and this goes for the COAG communique-‘because we want to localise this.' It is all about local jobs and local people and supporting local infrastructure and local families. Just as it is in Braddon it will be in Hinkler, Cowper and other places in this nation.",112
197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Situation in Sri Lanka,113
198,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leaveOver recent weeks and months, the Australian government has consistently stated that its strong view remains that Sri Lanka's conflict cannot be resolved through military means alone. Australia notes that the Sri Lankan government continues to report battlefield gains, further to the recent capture of Kilinochchi and Elephant Pass. Australia recognises that this is a significant development in Sri Lanka's decades-long conflict. Australia considers a political solution to be essential for long-term peace in a country which has suffered so long from bitter conflict. Members on both sides of the House have expressed to me their support for a resolution of the conflict in Sri Lanka and their support for Australia's approach to this difficult and complex issue. Australia remains gravely to work concerned at the worsening humanitarian situation in the north of Sri Lanka. Australia has been actively involved in international efforts to assist those adversely affected by the conflict in Sri Lanka. We are especially concerned by reports of civilian casualties, the continued vulnerability of civilians caught in the conflict and the difficulty of delivering aid and humanitarian assistance. Earlier today I announced that Australia will contribute $5 million in additional humanitarian assistance to those affected in the north of Sri Lanka. This is in addition to the $4 million in food aid Australia recently announced for Sri Lanka through the World Food Program. This new assistance will help ensure that civilians caught up in the conflict have access to basic goods such as medical supplies, shelter, water and sanitation. Australia will deliver this assistance through the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations, and Australian and international non-government organisations. I informed the Sri Lankan High Commissioner of this in a meeting this morning, during which I reiterated Australia's views on the situation in Sri Lanka. Australia calls on all those involved in fighting to make protecting civilians an absolute priority: - All parties must respect ‘safe areas' nominated by the Sri Lankan government and not fire into or out of these zones or in the vicinity of the PTK hospital or any other medical facility; - All parties must ensure medical evacuations are facilitated and life-saving manitarian aid is delivered frequently and safely; - All parties must ensure that civilians can leave the conflict zone safely. Australia calls on the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to declare a temporary no-fire period to allow for the evacuation of civilians. Australia calls on the LTTE to allow civilians caught in the conflict zone to leave. The government also calls on the Sri Lankan community in Australia to add its weight to this call to help ensure that civilian life is protected. Australia welcomes the call of the so called Tokyo Co-Chairs-Norway, Japan, the United States and the European Union-for the LTTE to discuss with the government of Sri Lanka how to end hostilities, including: - the laying down of arms; - the renunciation of violence; - acceptance of the government of Sri Lanka's offer of amnesty; and - participating as a political party in a process to achieve a just and lasting political solution. Last night, I spoke to the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, about a range of matters, including our shared concern about the situation in Sri Lanka. I told Foreign Secretary Miliband that Australia also welcomed his joint statement with Secretary of State Clinton of the United States in the support of the Tokyo Co-Chairs. Like its international partners, Australia encourages the Sri Lankan government to take steps to ensure the civilian population has confidence in the government's commitment to their protection. The Australian government takes this opportunity to thank the Sri Lankan government for its assistance in helping to ensure hu- that an Australian UN official, who had been trapped with UN staff in the conflict zone in northern Sri Lanka, is now safely away from the fighting. We reiterate our call for a political solution to this conflict. The long-term security and prosperity of Sri Lanka will only be achieved through a political solution that meets the legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Goldstein to speak for 4½ minutes. Leave granted.",113
199,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Robb speaking for a period not exceeding 4½ minutes. Question agreed to.,115
200,Mr ROBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise in response to the ministerial statement on the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka. In my previous role as shadow minister for foreign affairs for the coalition I became acutely aware of this ongoing conflict taking place in Sri Lanka, a civil conflict which has been raging since July 1983 following the most destructive explosion of communal rioting in the history of that island nation-a period in Sri Lanka's history commonly referred to as ‘Black July'. This conflict has taken the lives of over 70,000 people and displaced some 400,000 people, who are now living in refugee camps. The coalition welcomes any welltargeted measures that extend humanitarian assistance to those innocent victims of this conflict and helps facilitate both parties following the path of a sustainable peace agreement. Under former Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer, the previous government provided more than $30 million between 2005 and 2007 to experienced and reputable multilateral organisations to provide humanitarian relief across a range of areas to those affected civilians in Sri Lanka. We also welcome multilateral actions such as the statement by the so-called Tokyo CoChairs-Norway, Japan, United States and the European Union-urging the Tamil Tigers to discuss with the government of Sri Lanka ways to end the hostilities, including the laying down of arms and the renunciation of violence and to assist those desperate civilians caught up in the conflict and unable to leave the area. The coalition strongly urges the Tamil Tigers to free civilians currently trapped within the conflict. The lessons of history confirm that a political solution is the only effective way to end the violence, resolve the conflict and provide a durable peace in Sri Lanka. The coalition joins the Australian government in calling for peaceful resolution to this conflict as soon as possible for the sake of all the citizens of Sri Lanka. House adjourned at 5.31 pm",115
