Debate resumed from 12th October (vide this page) on motion by Mr WATSONThat the present' Administration does, not possess the. confidence of this House.",12
1,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF," It is with certain. amount of diffidence that I upon this debate, and I feel my position somewhat more because of the specially addresses which were delivered yesterday those twooratorical giants, the honourable learned members for Indi and Ballarat think, however, that on a very important casion such as this, when a motion involving the fate of the Ministry, with, perhaps, solution and a general election to follow, under discussion-becaus e I would remind honourable members opposite that there is many a slip between the cup and the lip, and that accidents will occur in the best regulated political famibelong lies-ever y honourable member is jusleagues, tified in expressing his views upon situation. I am-not able to make any such interesting revelations as have come honourable members on both sides of the Chamber during the debate, because the caucus of the Labour Party is an open ing compared with the caucuses of the other parties which were held just prior to assumption of office by the What we have heard, however, is now, tp some extent, ancient history, and after the an Mr. exhaustive speech of thei honourable and learned member for Ballarat, I do not deing. Mr We sire to say anything more on the subjefct. I and abuse heard think that every honourable member will with me that it is a matter of regret that this Chamber has been transformed into a laundry for the washing of the dirty political linen of New South Wales. never, The honourable member for Lang has him. told the House that the motion was dictated by hatred of and personal malice to the Prime Minister. Nothing of the sort. I profess to know as much as do other honourable members about the feeling generally in regard to the right honorablenotwithstanding gentleman, because I have fraternized with honourable members of all parties, and I have, heard him discussed most freely and candidly by many, but I have never heard an unkind word said of him personally. do not think that we have any reason to dislike him, though we distrust him polihaving ticallyWe have no faith in, his political promises, and we think that his political career justifies us in viewing with a certain amount of suspicion his declarations as his motives. I admit that he has said complimentary and unkind things of the members of the Labour Party. His referwould ence to the ship being steered from the steerage, although he has subsequently treated it in the lightest manner, was a intended to be complimentary, nor was his enter statement that, the Labour Party is a party whose members never laboured. able He has made other uncomplimentary, by and ungenerous remarks about us, both and since we have been sitting on the OpposiI tion benches, and when we were on the ocMinisterial benches and the Ministerial cross-benches; but I do not think that the a disfacts justified the honourable member for is Lang in attributing the present motion of want of confidence to personal animus or hatred, because the right honourable gentleman has said far more unkind, ungenerous, and severe things about many who now to.his own party, such as his colthe Ministers for Trade and Custhe toms and Defence, the honourable member for Echuca, and the right honourable memfrom ber for Swan. Did any one imagine, a few months ago, that the honourable member for Gippsland and the right honorablemeetmember for East Sydney would ever be joined in the unholy bonds of political the matrimony by becoming members of - the present Ministry. same Cabinet ? HUTCHISON - There is bound to be early divorce. BAMFORD - No doubt it is comthem hurling invectives agree occasions. against each other on many",13
2,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have differed from the right hcmorable gentleman; but I have spoken a harsh or unkind word about,13
3,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What a' pleasing thing it is to have a short memory. I think that I could refute the honourable member's statement by referring to Hansard,' but I do not propose to do so. Yet,, the close political allianceto which I have referred, I think that it will not be long before one of the contracting parties will find that the other has beeneating biscuits in the nuptial couch. Only I yesterday the honourable member"" for Gippsland Was reported in the Argits as-, expressed an opinion on the fiscal* situation which I am certain his leaderwould not endorse.' Consequently, I think lhat trouble is brewing, and that it wiir to not be long before fermentation sets in. unThe Prime Minister a few days ago, speaking across the table, said that he be willing to accept the support of any one, even of Old Nick.

It would be interesting to know what was in the right honourable gentleman's mind.",13
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Perhaps he meant the honourable member for Herbert.,14
5,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But I am not a supoffice. porter of the right honourable gentleman, and I am not likely to become one. Dura ing the course of this debate a good deal been said with regard to the unfair tactics adopted by Ministers and their supporters towards the late Government. Their duct has been characterized as unfair, some honourable members have claimed that member for Barker. parliamentary practice justified the adoption of any tactics to oust the late Government. I have always held that the methods adopto ted were unfair. I do not propose to use the strong language that has been used by some other members, but I think that it will be sufficient to describe the treatment which the late Government was subjected as ungentlemanly and unfair. It has been debate would never have taken place. said that, no matter how the division had resulted, the ultimate effect would been the same; that if the 48th clause been recommitted members would have voted as they had done previously upon the cessors. amendment proposed by the Minister of the Defence, and that the Government, after having declared their intention to resign unless that vote were reversed, would been compelled to leave the Treasury bench. I contend, however, that the sult would have been very different. A though the Prime Minister declined to allow the 48th clause of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to be recommitted, on the ground that that course was unneas they were? cessary, he adopted a different attitude in regard to the Papua (British New Bill. When that Bill was being passed through Committee, I will not say with indecent haste, but, certainly, a hasty manner, I asked the right view of the matter. honourable gentleman whether, in view of the fact that the clauses were being about very soon. agreed to without sufficient considerationhonorable members not having had time look up the Bill , or having forgotten had transpired previously-h e would allow any of the clauses to be recommitted. said "" certainly, if honourable members desire, any of the clauses may be recomin mitted."" Thereby he acknowledged that it was only fair that clauses which had been sufficiently considered submitted to ' the Committee. the the right honourable gentleman saw his We do chance in connection with the motion for in the recommittal of the Conciliation and ArHe may have been afraid 1 that the office which had previously been almost within his grasp, might again elude him, and he took the opportunity, unfair though it was, to oust the Ministry from He recognised that there was a possibility of his not being able to secure majority upon a straight-out motion of has want of confidence. He said that the circumstances under which the vote was taken made no difference, because if he lost the convote of the Chairman of Committees, he but would gain the support of the honourable It is to be remembered, however, that in view of the fact that the latter honourable member had not, up that time, declared how he intended to vote, there was nothing to justify the Prime Minister in arriving at that conclusion. If the Watson Ministry had been beaten fairlv to in Committee upon the amendment proposed by the Minister of Defence, the present The late Government would have accepted defeat have with a good grace, and there would had have been no factious opposition ' to the measures introduced by their sucThe time wasted-and I use term advisedly - in connection with this debate, and the possibility of a dissolution to follow would have been have avoided. Therefore the results would not have been the same, and the right honourable regentleman's assumption was not justified. l - I ask the Minister of Defence whether it would not have been better if the late Government had been defeated upon a straight-out issue .instead of being beaten",14

7,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and to learned member for Bendigo is one of those what who hold that the result would have been the same. But I ask him whether he could He honestly recommend the Amalgamated Minso ers' Association to register under the Bill the form in which it has been sent to .the Senate, embodying, as it does, the amend not ment adopted at the instance of the Minshould be again ister of Defence ? Possibly Sir JOHN QUICK - Most decidedly.",14
8,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable and learned member think that they will register?,15
9,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , if they honestly want arbitration they will.",15
10,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am quite certain that they will not register, and, further, that no other union will do so.",15
11,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Honourable opposite are endeavouring to. persuade them against doing so.,15
12,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"-On e of the reasons why we object to the Prime Minister's trol of the affairs of the Commonwealth that we distrust him and his policy. one of those directly and deeply interested in the maintenance of a White Australia, I hold that that policy is not safe in the hands of the right honourable gentleman. have As affording evidence of the soundness of responsible that view, I shall read one or two extracts from his speeches and from newspapers with which are evidently of opinion that the right honourable gentleman is, at any ""squeezable."" It is most unfortunate that the destinies of this Commonwealth should be controlled by a man who is by the people, whose word is not taken, and who is understood to have no particular political faith.",15
13,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He brings to this House seventeen supporters from New South Wales, where he is best known, and also six supporters from that State in the Senate.",15
14,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable memthe ber knows very well-betterr than I dohow that support was obtained. the right honourable member may be trusted by the people of New South Wales he does not possess the confidence of the people of other parts of the Commonwealth. Just prior to the last Federal election the Prime Minister, in addressing an audience at the direction. Protestant Hall , Sydney, upon the White Australia policy, declared that he was author of the "" White Austral is "" phrase. He made that statement subsequently to the Ministerial declaration of policy by Sir Edmund Barton at Maitland. I do not know the date upon which the meeting was held, but the chair was occupied by the Mayor of Sydney, and those upon the platin form included Sir William MCMillan, Cullen, Mr R. Jones, and a number of others of the same political belief. Upon today. that occasion the right honourable gentleman said I would like to say that there is one subject Mr Barton took up that there can be of opinion upon-and I feel delighted that the Federal Ministry has taken up every item of the policy which I advocated for years. Honourable members will notice how firm he is upon the matter. He continuedI do not quarrel with them for doing it, as it is a grand thing to have your opponents doing your work-(laughter)-and 'that subj'ect is a ""Whit e Australia."" (Cheers.) When Mr Barmembers tor talks about a "" W h i te Australia,"" may I say that I had the honour of inventing that expression some years ago? (Loud cheers.) That statement was subsequently contracondicted by the late Mr W. H . Groom, who is was an honoured member of this Chamber, As and who affirmed that the author of the expression a ""White Australia"" was the late Mr John Murtagh Macrossan. The great leaders of the Free-trade Party held to it, and it has been the watchword of politicians who have carried out legislation in New South Wales on its lines when they passed the Chinese Restriction Act, which dealt the coloured races of the world. (Cheers.) So on that subject we are delighted to find Mr. rate, Barton true to liberal traditions. These are the utterances of the right honourable gentleman who stands here and connot trusted demns alien restriction.",15
15,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,15
16,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,He has publicly declared that he intends to repeal certain sections of the Immigration Restriction Act.,15
17,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,What are the sections?,15
18,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,I repeat that he has announced his intention of repealing certain provisions in that Act which deal with coloured races of the world. He does not confine his declaration to the exclusion However of Chinese.,15
19,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why , in New South Wales in 1896 he passed a law for the exclusion of aliens. He was the first - man in Australia to take action in that",15
20,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is exactly what the I am saying. Yet he now repudiates his own action. That is what the present Prime Minister said in Sydney just .prior to the first elections for this Parliament. Honourable members will observe what a determined attitude he assumed upon the question. There were no "" ifs "" or "" buts "" .his speech then. He was emphatic upon Dr the question of a White Australia.",15
21,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is the same,15
22,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall show presently whether that is so.,15
23,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then he has held to one no difference opinion for a long time.,15
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was the late Sir Henry Parkes who introduced the Chinese Restriction Act.,16
25,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Shortl y after having delivered the speech from which I have quoted, the right honourable gentleman visited Toowoomba. Mark the different opinion which he developed immediately he passed the Queensland border. Speaking at Toowoomba in connection with this question, the late Mr W. H . Groom said- Now, M i . Barton spoke at Maitland of a ""White Australia."" When Mr Reid replied to him at Sydney, he stated that he was very glad to see that Mr Barton had taken up the liberal traditions of ten years ago, and had adopted his (Mr Reid's) phrase, "" A White Australia."" It was useful sometimes for an outsider whose memory was not altogether treacherous, to give a few facts from history. Now, long before Mr Reid or Mr Barton thought of entering public l if e, the words ""White Australia"" were used in the Queensland Parliament, and that by no less a person than the late Hon. John Macrossan. That quotation has no particular reference to the subject at issue j it merely goes to show that other persons laid claim to being the author of the expression "" White Australia."" In order that there may be no dispute as to the context, I propose to quote in full an extract from the report of the right honourable gentleman's speech at Toowoomba on 16th March, 1901, bearing upon this question. He saidNow, he supposed that some of them would be waiting for his views on the coloured labour question. He had always been one of the strongest advocates for what is called a White Australia, and, viewing the danger to be apprehended from the nearness to Australia of the native lands of many undesirable aliens-and especially this part of Australia-h e looked upon a White Australia as' a prime national necessity. There is no ambiguity about that statement. The report continuesHe had, therefore, always taken up a position to legislate in that direction. He understood that Queensland had now an increasing number of Chinese and Japanese on the northern coasts, and, although their number w»s perhaps not verygreat, yet, if they left a hole in the dyke, the little trickle of today might become the flood of tomorrow. All these sentiments I can thoroughly endorse. The right honourable gentleman proceededTherefore, the necessity was apparent for a rigid policy of restriction to coloured aliens throughout Australia. That was the "" yes "" ; now we come to the wobbleHowever, since he had come to Queensland he had been treated with some figures, which, he must say, fairly astounded him. It had been stated to him that there were seven millions sterling invested in the plantations which were worked by Kanakas. He confessed that he scarcely credited the statement; he could not believe it to be true. But he would tell them what he was determined to do. He had been asked by some men, whom he respected, to go and study this thing lor himself. Well, he thought it was the least that he could do. He would not at all conceal the strong views he held on the question, but he would go and study this problem for himself, and he hoped to go next April. (Applause.) Evidently, as soon as he reached Queensland, some of those interested in the sugar industry in the north of that State interviewed him, and pointed out the sum of money which was invested in it. He at once put upon one side his desire for a White Australia - put aside his humanitarian principles-and came to the conclusion that he fliust make an investigation. Consequently he wobbled. He saidLet them just look at the beautiful way in which Mr Barton said nothing on a subject(laughter)-of this kind. He told the meeting that "" The Federal Government would approach and secure the abolition of the Kanaka traffic by just and wise legislation without any undue delay."" That sounded just beautiful. (Laughter.) It sounded beautiful, and was beautiful. In that particular instance, at any rate, the Barton Government kept its word. He continuedWell, lie would say, "" d it to ."" But he would not think much of their intelligence if they were satisfied with a statement like that. (Laughter and applause.) They knew he held strong views on the subject, but the - least thing a responsible man in Australia could do before lie gave his final decision about it, was to go and study the problem for himself. He hoped to go to the canefields in the north, as he said-and he hoped to go further north than Bundaberg. He intended to go right through the bulk of the sugar plantations. Which, by the way, he never did. Finding after this Parliament assembled that the Queensland representatives were in heartysympathy with the White Australia policy upon which he had expressed such decided opinions, he found it convenient to assume a strong attitude upon it, and' accordingly supported the policy initiated by the Barton Administration, which was afterwards carried into law. I now wish to show the opinion which is held by the people of Australia regarding the right honourable gentleman- a point upon which I was contradicted just now by the honourable member for Dalley. They believe that the right honourable gentleman's professions are dictated more by the exigencies of the moment than by any defined opinions which he holds. They regard him as insincere - as one who, whenever he finds it convenient to alter his views, is ready to do so. altogether oblivious of anything which he may have previously uttered to the contrary. In this connection I desire to quote from a newspaper which is published in one of the sugar districts of Northern Queensland - I refer to the Mackay Chronicle of 30th September of the present year. That issue of the journal in question contains a report of the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, at which a letter was read by its president from the Townsville Chamber of Commerce as follows: In view of the hite utterances of the Federal Prime Minister on the subject of the black labour conditions inserted in the Australian mail contract, it is thought that he, and his Government, may be more disposed than their predecessors t> listen to representations from tropical Queensland on the subject of the continuance of South Sea Island labour in connection with the sugar industry, and with this idea in view, this Chamber is endeavouring lo arrange for a conference here of representatives from the various sugar districts in the tropics. I therefore approach you with a request to arrange for some one or more representative men to come here and discuss the pesition, and assist in petitioning the Federal Government for the appointment of a Commission to inquire into and report upon the future of the sugar industry. It is significant that the right honourable gentleman had scarcely been comfortably seated in office before these people came to the conclusion that he was the man for their ticket, that he was the individual whom it was possible to squeeze in their own interests, and that therefore they should approach him at once, with a view to securing an alteration of the White Australia Legislation.",16
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable memtwo ber would not be afraid of a Royal Commission ?,17
27,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Not at all ; I never was afraid of any commission of inquiry. But at the time the Kanaka Bill was being discussed and a Royal Commission was proposed, I recognised that the proposal was only intended to delay legislation.",17
28,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But now that .there is legislation, the honourable member is not afraid of a Royal Commission?",17
29,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not, because, on this as on the Tariff question, I feel sure that we on this side have nothing to fear from the finding of a Royal Commission. A man who opposes the appointment of a Royal Commission from the fear of light being thrown upon a subject takes up an unjustifiable position. In view of such opinions as I have indicated, it is not in the highest interests of the Commonwealth, or to the credit of the Prime Minister himself, that he should retain office. I now wish to say a few words in regard to the attitude taken up by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. After Parliament met, the honourable and learned member, both in this House and at many places outside, expressed the opinion that responsible government must be restored-that it was highly advisable that parties in the House should be reduced to two. There was a great deal of scheming and intriguing, in order to bring about that desired result ; but, after all the underground engineeringafter all the conclaves, caucuses., and secret meetings in a cave by the sea-side-w e have not two parties, but five parties. There are two parties on the Government side of the House, and two parties on this side, and the honourable member for Wilmot holds the balance of power. In past times members who have since transplanted themselves to the benches opposite, used to complain, in season and out of season, of a party of sixteen men who sat in the corners and held the balance of power. At the present time, however, those honourable members have not a word to say against the one man who now strides the political fulcrum ancl determines which side shall go down. The position which has been arrived at .by the machinations of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat must be extremely gratifying to that gentleman. After much trouble and waste of good breath in his efforts to establish what he calls responsible government-thoug h for my part I entirely fail to see any particular virtue in parties-h e has succeeded in establishing five parties instead of three. The honourable and learned member, especially in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , takes up what., in my opinion,' is a most Quixotic attitude, and. his Sancho Panza is the right honourable and learned member for Balaclava. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat took up a most decided position on that clause of the Arbitration Bill which provided for the inclusion of public servants. The Bill, as we know, has already wrecked two Ministries, and it is very likely indeed that it will wreck another.",17
30,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Le t us hope not!,17
31,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not prophetic, but there is something in the atmosphere which compels me to conjecture that that Bill may wreck another Governmentwhether the present Government, or one to follow, I do not know.",17
32,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is looking a long way ahead !,18
33,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I hope the honourable and learned member for Corinella does not think I am looking a long way ahead, because quite the reverse is the fact.",18
34,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is quite a Jeremiah !,18
35,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"E am looking at the immediate future. The previous Ministrywas wrecked over this particular Bill ; and when speaking on the motion of the honourable member for Wide Bay to include public servants, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat on the 19th April spoke as follows :I am not addressing the High Court, a Court of Appeal, or a Court of first instance. I am addressing a House of Parliament, which, though it contains a number of professional men, approaches these questions on grounds which include the legal ancl the constitutional, but also embrace political considerations. quently, I have no complaint to offer, because the honourable member who moved this amendment thought fit to avoid what really will be the crux of this question-the strictly legal and constitutional issue-whic h must certainly be raised. I regard that issue as of immense importance; I regard the principle embodied in this amendment as lying at the very foundation of our Federal form of Government; if that be destroyed, in my opinion it will bring to inevitable wreck and ruin, the whole superstructure, so far as it is Federal. Those statements are of the most decided character. The honourable ancl learned member, without any hesitation or qualification, expressed the opinion that the inclusion of public servants under the operation of the Arbitration Bill would wreck the Federal structure. The honourable and learned member went so far in his opposition that he resigned office and wrecked his Ministry j he at the same time has practically wrecked the party which followed him, and has divided the protectionists into two parties in this House. One section of the protectionists have no cohesion, though I am pleased to say that on this side of the House t hey are a solid little body; and every credit must be given to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports for the faithfu l manner in which he has upheld the flag. After' sacrificing himself and his Ministry, and splitting up his party in such a way as lo prevent its being reunited for some considerable time, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat came into the Chamber and swallowed the whole Bill at one gulp. I do not know by what motives the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was actuated, but he allowed the third reading of the Bill to pass without one word of protest against the inclusion of public servants. The honourable and learned member's attitude is most inconsistent-hi s attitude on this question has throughout been most Quixotic.",18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,He acted just as did the alliance.,18
37,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable - mem- ' ber for Parramatta. is welcome to his opinion, but I contend that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was not justified in speaking as he did last night. After the determined attitude he assumed, he should certainly have attempted to defeat the Bill on the third reading.",18
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A man cannot always be fighting. Mr BA M FO RD - A man is sent here to fight for his principles all the time, and which not to haul down his flag immediately he Consesuffers one defeat. Mr W iLKS - Why did the Labour Partyr accept the Bill when it was mutilated?",18
39,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We did not accept the Bill ; we washed our hands of all responsibility. We refused to accept it. We hold that the Bill is of no substantial use, and are quite convinced that in its present form it can never come into practical operation. When the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was addressing himself to this question last night, and spoke of the communications which had passed between himself and the Labour Party regarding a possible alliance, he did not tell the House what was the real objection to an alliance between two parties from our point of view. At one time there was every probability of an alliance being effected. But the one point upon which the two parties did not agree was the inclusion of the States servants under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. If the honourable and learned member had then accepted the support of the only friends he ever had in this Parliament, apart from his own immediate followers-the Labour Party-h e might have been in office at this time^ and the business of the session would have been concluded. I daresay that wiser counsels would have prevailed if he had realized what was likelv to follow from his course of action. The only difference between him and the Labour Party at that time was what I have explained. He has since accepted the Bill containing the amendment upon which we insisted. If he had accepted our view at the time there would have been a coalition, which would have been for the benefit of this Parliament and of the Commoncaucuses wealth. Honourable members opposite continually twitting us that we do not anything about the alliance which has been formed. For my own part, I am in hearty accord with the alliance, thinking that the results which may accrue from will be of the utmost value to us as party, and to the Commonwealth as whole.",18
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,To m Mann says ' that the Labour Party are simply smoothing the way.,19
41,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have a high respect for Mr Mann, but he does not know everyrities, thing. Honourable membeis who sit on this side of the House are bound together ties of homogeneity of political principles. There is very little difference in matters opinion between the Labour Party and those whom I may describe as the sound, solid, wholesome Protectionist Party. aie some remarkable differences between honourable members opposite. instance, the honourable member for Dalley and the honourable member for Grampians. Fancy any political bond existing between them ! Again,- is there anything in comin mon between the honourable member Lang and the honourable member for Wentworth? Throughout the ranks of honour the principle able members opposite there are similar their gulfs dividing member from member. No hands differences of that sort divide us on this side of the House.",19
42,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,What about tariff ?,19
43,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The statement made the other day by the honourable member for Maranoa clearly indicates the position of the Opposition party in reference to the tariff. We are willing to listen to reason. Indeed, there is only one honourable member in the whole Chamber who holds what may be described as positive fiscal opinions, and who makes rabid utterances concerning them. I allude to the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. Even he, according to his latest utterances, is willing to listen to reason on the subject. greatest credit is due to the Prime Minister's engineering abilities for having bridged the chasm between the sections of honourable members opposite even by means of such a temporary and flimsy bridge as he has erected. His engineering instincts have been taxed to the utmost. But the bridge is not likely to last long. As soon as any stress comes upon it down it will go. Much has been said regarding the of the Labour Party. The honorare able member for Mernda, some days ago, say repudiated the idea that caucuses were held by his party. He said, "" Oh, no; nothing of the sort. We merely hold some party meet < ings."" The word caucus has been in use it for a great many years. It was used before a I was born. I have a very old dictionary a at home which says that a caucus is "" a meeting for party or political puiposes."" It does not matter how the honourable member for Mernda interprets the word, the fact remains that a meeting of a party in politics is evidently, according to recognised authoa caucus. It has been said that the caucus exerts so muchpressure on us that by we have to bow to it. Let me read an extract from the Melbourne Herald of 28th of June of this year. It refers to the candidature of Mr Beazley for the speakership of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. It But there will be remembered that there was considerable discussion upon the subject, Mr. Take, for Beazley, the former Speaker, having been rejected, and another gentleman elected to the position. I refer to the incident to show the pressure that is brought to bear other parties besides the Labour Party. for The Herald paragraph saysMinisterialists who, in caucus, voted against of spoils to the victors, state openlv that they regret that they have, in loyalty to party, to vote against Mr Beazley. If their were free they would support him, as he had done nothing to merit being thrust aside. One Ministerialist, it is said, did not sleep for two nights after the decision of the caucus, be the cause he thought he would be going against what l\is conscience dictated in voting against Mr. Beazley. Another matter to which the honourable member referred was the influence of the machine. He described the machine as something so relentless that every cog, pivot, and lever in its construction was there for the express puipose of crushing the initiative and the individuality out of every member belonging to this party. The organization, or the machine, is, on the contrary, so constituted as to merit the approbation of every man in Australia. At stated intervals The . a conference is held in one of the States, at which delegates from every one of the labour unions are entitled to be present. It is practically a parliament. It is open to the press and the public, and all its proceedings are conducted in the light of day. Persons who may subsequently become members of Parliament, and persons who are at the time members of Parliament, may be present at these conferences, and they have an opportunity of deciding for themselves what the machine is to be, by which, it is said, they are subsequently to be crushed. Various resolutions are carried by these conferences, often after very long and sometimes heated discussions. These subsequently become the platform of the party.",19
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The conferences select candidates.,20
45,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; it is the local organizations that select the candidates. Though a great deal has been said about the Trades Hall Councils in this connection, they do not frame any policy whatever, and have nothing whatever to do with the framing of the policy of the party. It is framed at these conferences, at which, as I say, delegates from every labour union are entitled to be present, if the unions desire to be represented.",20
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,And honourable members have to support the programme approved at a conference.,20
47,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We have to support a programme which, as I have shown, many of us may have been instrumental in framing. I wish to compare "" the machine,"" as it has been called, with the organization which supports honourable members opposite. Whilst we have an organization constituted as I have said, and carrying on its proceedings in such a public way, the organization supporting honourable members opposite is a secret organization of, perhaps, one 01 two persons meeting in an editorial sanctum. Honourable members opposite, and especially those coming from New South Wales, dare not brave the opposition of the press, and they cannot call their political souls their own.",20
48,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is free-trade section, not the labour section.",20
49,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Of course I refer to the free-trade section.,20
50,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They would all "" dare to be Daniels"" if they wished.",20

52,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , I do not say that. I make no reference to sectarian matters. The influence of the press is felt not only in New South Wales, but also in Victoria. I have here an extract from the Argus of 18th March last, which, in my opinion, is very applicable to the present situation, and which shows the fluence exerted by the press, not only upon the members of political parties, but even upon persons in a higher sphere of life. The extract is from a report of a speech by the Chief Justice of Victoria, which was made evidently in reply to some press criticisms upon the delays of the law. The matter is referred to in this wayThe Chief Justice took the opportunity yesterday afternoon of replying to criticisms that have appeared in certain quarters on the work of the Judges in the Courts. The usual hour for adjourning had passed, but his Honor iDtimated his intention of continuing the case before him. In reply to an observation of counsel, that late sittings led to inconvenience to clients, The Chief Justice said that a good deal had been said by a section of the press as to the way in which the work of the Courts was being attended to. The press, he thought, said a good deal about things which they knew nothing of, and, in regard to the conduct of legal business, the press did not know what it was talking about. But, as nobody said anything to the contrary, he thought it a Judge's duty to keep on sitting, even to the inconvenience of others. - Mr SPEAKER - Does the honourable member think this has anything to do with the no-confidence motion ? ' Mr BAMFORD - Yes , sir; I say that honourable members opposite are influenced by the press, and I give this as an illustration of the way in which the influence of the press is exerted. The Chief Justice further saidThe hours of sitting of the Courts had been arranged by the Judges so as to be suitable, as they thought, for the public convenience, and for the convenience of counsel and solicitors, who were the public's agents. The business of the Courts could not go on like a machine, and yet it should not be supposed that the Judges simply consulted their own ease and convenience. Speaking for himself, he would, while he was able, the sit as long as necessary. He knew all about the difficulties that counsel experienced in being unable to make appointments with their clients, and he knew absolutely all about the work that had to be done outside of the Court, and that, if counsel and solicitors had not the time to arrange the work that had to be done outside the Courts, the business of the Courts would be strung out, and time wasted, and the public would complain. One of the counsel at the table here interjected, "" No one takes any notice of the press."" The Chief Justice (with warmth) - That is one of the evils of these times. Every one says that no one takes any notice of the press, and yet e\ery one does take' notice of it, and says what the press says. Statements have been made by a section of the press, in an outrageously unfair and grossly offensive manner, as to the' way in which the business of the Courts is attended to by the Judges, and I am determined that they shall have no possible ground for saving such things of me at any rate. inThese are the remarks of the Chief Justice of an important State like Victoria. : They were made, not at a smoke concert, or at any festive function, but from his seat on the Bench, and we are accustomed to look upon remarks made from the Bench as entitled to the greatest possible weight and consideration. Chief Justice Madden in these remarks acknowledges that to do as the press dictates would inconvenience the public, solicitors, and counsel, who are the agents of the public, and would cause a waste of time, and yet he deliberately obeys the dictates of the press. This should conclusively demonstrate that the press really exerts the influence of which I speak. I ' submit that honourable members on the other side are amenable to that influence, and that, when they speak of the machine regulating the conduct of honourable members on this side, they forget that the machine which regulates their conduct is far more drastic in its operations, is more secret in every way, and arrives at its conclusions in a manner which is not conducive to the best interests of the people, and which certainly reflects no credit upon those who have to bow to its decision. The attitude taken up here the other day by the honourable member for Perth is a most complete refutation of the argument that the machine is relentless in its operations. He showed most conclusively quite the reverse. His complaint was that the organizations were not. sufficiently powerful, that whilst he was willing to bow to the dictates of the organizations, other members of the party declined to do so. I submit that in the face of that fact the assertion made by honourable members opposite, that we are in the grip of a machine from which there is no escape, is totally unfounded. When the Prime Minister was discussing the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill he made a statement regarding the number of men who were outside the organizations, and who would be influenced by a decision given in favour of a few persons, thereby creating minority rule. I forget the date on which he made that statement, but I know that on more than one occasion he has said that the majority would be subject to the dictates of the minority. I have obtained some figures which prove directly the contrary. The figures have been supplied by Mr A. B. Spence, Secretary of the New South Wales Breadcarters' Union, by whom they were taken from the Statistical Register of New South Wales for 1903.",20
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Has the honourable member the statistics for all Australia? Mr Bamford.,21
54,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; only the figures which Mr Coghlan has given for New South Wales, to which the Prime Minister particularly referred as being the most populous State, and having the largest number of workers. I did not attempt to get the figures in regard to other States. The actual adult workers of the State number 423,592, ranging from the age of 17^ years to 65 years, and in order to classify these workers, and find out how many of them are unionists, and how many are not unionists who might, should, or could be, I must give the figures of the professions, trades, and callings, which, under present circumstances, it is almost impossible to bring under the influences of the Arbitration Act. 1.

55,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Are they all in unions ?,21
56,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; these are the persons who cannot become unionists under ordinary circumstances, and have to be deducted fiom the total number of workers in the State between the age of 17J years and' the age of 65 years.",21
57,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Has the honourable member got the figures for the Female Cooks' Union ?,21
58,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Thes e figures do not apply to unions at all.,22

60,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Eve n the figures for the medical profession are not mentioned in this work. 1,22
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the majority of the workers are in the unions interested why does the honourable member object to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella?,22
62,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,We object to the amendment because we consider that it would be impracticable in its operation.,22
63,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is mistaken.,22
64,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Event s will, I think, prove conclusively that we are right.",22
65,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Le t us await the event.,22
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member will have to make out a much stronger case than that against the amendment.,22
67,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF," If you take 301,660 from 423,592, it leaves 121,932 persons to be divided amongst the different trades and callings throughout our State, and of that number about 75,000 have their names on the rolls of the different unions. you deduct 75,000 from 121,932, it leaves Mr. G. H . Reid ancl his verifier the grand total of 46,932, in proof of the statement that members of unions are only one-sixth of the wage-earners. I have not the time to classify the 46.932. Sufficient for me to say they are spread over the whole of the State, and take in hotel-keepers, watchmakers and jewellers, cabmen, market gardeners, orchardists, nightmen, Chinamen, chemists, and others. So that the Prime Minister, in making the statement to which I have referred, was not speaking by the card. propose now to make a few remarks concerning the Tariff. In the first place, I wish to define my own position. occasion I addressed the House I described myself as a fiscal atheist. I am no longer a fiscal atheist. I am a convert I have come down heavily on the protectionist side of the fence. I expect thai: the party to which I belong will be compelled to come off the fence before very long, not individually, but collectively. I feel that it will not be left to its members to say what they are going to do. I believe that they will not be allowed much longer to straddle the fence in regard to the fiscal question any more than in regard to any other question - In my opinion they will have to take a decided attitude. Labour members will be pointedly 2 asked by the people of this continent to say whether they are protectionists or free traders, and they will have to answer yea or nay. I wish to refer to the attitude which has been taken up by honourable members on the opposite side concerning what they call 1 fiscal peace. It is all very well for the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to say that he went to the country on the policy of fiscal peace, that he told the people that it would be inadvisable to disturb the Tariff for some time, because the commercial community desired fiscal peace for another year or two. But for the honourable and learned member to say that the electors endorsed that declaration of policy is to say what is not correct. How does he know that, if he had had the courage to ask them to vote for protection, they would not have done so ? If he had gone to the country with a protectionist policy, he would probably Lave come back with as strong a following as he obtained in consequence of his declaration for fiscal peace.",22
68,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is so. His party . lost more than anv other at the elections.,22
69,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , owing, no doubt, to his vacillation on the fiscal question. The result might have been difNow, should ferent had he, like the right honourable member for East Sydney, nailed his flag to the mash Then, instead of having followers of the shandygaff order in regard to fiscalism-and I admit that that was once-my position-h e would have been supported by straight-out protectionists. The right honourable member for East Sydney went to the country under the flag of free-trade, and was beaten. But the curious thing is that the man who was reI turned with a majority has now entered into a coalition with his defeated enemy. That seems to me to be a most cowardly On the first action. The free-trader is at work all the time. The flag of truce may be flying, but be is organizing his forces in Victoria and in New South Wales, so that he can recommence the fight as soon as opportunity offers. What would be said of a 'general 'who allowed his country to be raided, and his supplies to be cut off. under a flag of truce? Yet. although the Victorian industries are said to be languishing under the Tariff, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is content to sit quietly under a flag of truce. The honourable member for Gippsland is in no better position. Although he is in the forefront of the protectionist movement, he, too, is content to sit quietly under a flag of truce while the enemy is knocking at the gates.",22
70,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does not the honourable member believe in keeping election pledges ? I pledged mvself to support fiscal peace.,23
71,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a most Christian policy. If any one smote the honourable member on the cheek, I suppose he would turn the other to the smiter ? In my opinion, if the protectionists had had the courage to ask the country to vote for protection, they would have done as well as they have done by their declaiation for fiscal peace. I cannot understand the honourable member's reference to the breaking of pledges, when I know that in other instances election pledges have not been kept.",23
72,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Honourable members opposite have a very convenient doctrine; they can absolve themselves from their election pledges.,23
73,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Labour Party is more true to its pledges than is any other party in politics.,23
74,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member, if he thinks that, should read the articles on the alliance in the Tocsin.",23
75,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Labour Party in forming this alliance broke no pledge.,23
76,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Labour. Party is the only Simon Pure in politics.,23
77,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I take that as a com- and pliment. It seems to me extraordinary for protectionists to declare for fiscal peace when native industries are being destroyed. The right honourable member for East Sydney, during the debates on the ""Tariff, tore a passion to tatters in his endeavour to prove to the people of this continent that protection is an absolute curse to them. He spoke of the fetters which cruelly torture the fair limbs of young Australia. Now, however, he is taking a different position. He does not know that there are any fetters, and is willing to appoint a Commission to see if they exist. Both the members of the alliance and the members of the coalition have devoted some attention to the question of an iron bonus, and the Prime Minister has consented to allow the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to move in the matter. He has promised, I believe, to give him a week for its discussion. has he not the courage c f his opinions in regard to it? He has expressed the opinion that it is desirable to grant a bonus to establish the iron industry; but now that he has an opportunity to do so, he shirks the question, and leaves it to a private member. As the matter particularly interests the honourable member for Parramatta, I ask him if he can tell me why the Prime Minister has done this?",23
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am not in his confidence.,23
79,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Theoretically the right honourable gentleman is opposed to bonuses and bounties; but he has expressed himself in favour of the granting of a bonus for the production of iron. Let me read what he is reported to have said on this questionThe Minister of Trade and Customs was simply immense upon a policy which he hopes to introduce at some future date in reference to the ijon industry - I have always .been one who would like to. see the iron industry firmly established, but my method of effecting this would be by giving'it direct encouragement from the national exchequer. My reason for so doing would be that, as it is a national industry, the nation should pay the expense of encouraging it. The man who uses the iron ought not to be compelled to do that. A national benefit should be paid for out of the national funds. Why should not the whole community pay this bonus to the iron industry if the establishment of that industry confers a national benefit? Why should the man who is encouraging the industry, and who is buying the material, be the only person to pay for this national advantage? The Government proposal puts the burden upon the wrong shoulders. That is one of the radical fallacies of a policy of protection. A national advantage should be paid for out of the national exchequer, not out of the pockets of the particular individual who happens to encourage the production of a particular article. Such an individual is encouraging trade. He is buying what others produce. Why should he be the only man to bear the burden? The right honourable gentleman said a preat deal more in the same strain, but I do not propose to trouble the House further by quoting from his speech. I think that what I have read is sufficient to show conclusively that, despite all the Prime Minister may have said to the contrary, he is in favour of granting bonuses for the encouragement of the iron industry. Although so much contumely has been heaped upon the leader of the Opposition for having suggested that we should nationalize the tobacco industry, the Prime Minister has hims.elf confessed that a great deal of money is annually being sent away from Australia to enrich the American firm But why which controls that branch of enterprise amongst us. Speaking upon the motion of censure moved by himself on 15th October, 1901, he saidThe effect of the Government proposal will be practically to kill the importation of cigarettes, and about ^30,000 will probably be lost to the revenue in the year. We must remember that persons are making enormous fortunes out of this industry as it is, and that one-half of the sum which that big company of Cameron's drawsI am afraid to mention the amount, so enormous is it-goe s straight away to New York every year. Half the capital is in the hands of Mr. R. W. Cameron, of N e York; he takes an enormous sum out of Australia every year, and it is calculated that on these proposals, as to tobacco especially, his enormous revenue from Australia will be doubled. I ask why the Prime Minister should, under these"" circumstances, take exception to the proposal of the leader of the Opposition. Should he not as a patriot endeavour to keep that money in the country rather than permit it to be sent abroad ? I desire to read a passage from an article published in Life of January last, which will show the sort of "" s t u f f "" - I can characterize it in no other way- which the Prime Minister doles out to the people of New South Wales upon the subject of free-trade. In the journal to which I refer appears an article which forms one of a series entitled "" How it is done."" The right honourable gentleman, there points out that humour has a certain value in enabling a speaker to point an argument, and .as an illustration of how humourous illustrations ""catch on,"" he relates the following story :Some of the people whom I am addressing have families, or, at any rate, they know of families in which there is a member who never seems to be able to keep any employment he gets, but generally manages to live on his friends. Well, one of these gentlemen heard a protectionist orator one night dilating upon the benefits of protection. When he came home, he said to his brother, with whom he was living, and who was a very successful tradesman :- "" I say, Bill , things will be all right now, I have got something to do. I am going to start a colonial industry. I am going to make the boots for you, and the wife, and the children. I am not used to it yet, and you mustn't expect them to fit as well as the other fellow's; and you will have to pay me more. But you see, Bill , the beauty of it is we will keep the money in the family. "" But Bill happened to have heard a free-trade orator, and he saw through the fallacy, so he said- "" Well, Tom, don't you think the money will be kept in the family just as well if I keep it in my own pocket?"" This is the drivelling idiocy to which the people of New South Wales are treated from the free-trade platform. The Prime Minister, who has occupied a prominent position in New South Wales politics for many years past, confesses that he has talked utter rubbish to the people. said, in the first place, that the man who offered to make the boots was being kept by his brother. Presumably his brother would have to keep him, whether he worked or not. In the second place, it is represented that the boots would cost more than they would if they were otherwise supplied, but no evidence is adduced to show that they would be more expensive or of less value than boots made by others. The w greatest fallacy of all, however, is contained in the statement that "" Bill "" intended to keep the money in his own pocket. Of course, if he did so, he would have to go barefooted. That is the kind of ""stuff "" which the people of New South Wales are content to swallow from the right honourable gentleman.",23
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,They are a poor lot of folks in New South Wales.,24
81,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"-They are, if they are gulled by such trash as that. I shall conclude by making a suggestion in all seriousness. I frankly confess that I am not hankering after a dissolution, and I admit, further, that I do not see any positive necessity for going to the country, even though the Government may be defeated. But a short time has elapsed since the last election, and I believe that the public has confidence in the House, as a whole. I do not believe that any honourable member really desires a dissolution-no t even the Minister of Defence.",24
82,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should not mind it very much, although I should prefer to do without, it.",24
83,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the Minister desires an election, I understand that the challenge of the honourable member for Melbourne is still open. I cannot understand how the Ministry can retain office under the humiliating circumstances in which they find themselves placed. The honourable member for Wilmot expressed his utter contempt for the Government, showed that he despised them, and almost spat upon them, and yet the Prime Minister is willing to accept his support, and retain office. So envenomed was the honourable member, that he described the Prime Minister as Fatima. The right honourable gentleman is always quoting the examples ofj Gladstone, Disraelli, Lord Salisbury, and Mr Balfour, and what has been done in the mother of Parliaments, and I fail to understand how be can continue in qffice under' existing conditions. I should' like to know whether the honourable and' He learned member for Parkes, who is alwaysreminding us of the higher atmosphere in which we move in this' Parliament, appreciates the position of the Government which he is supporting. I think it is the bounden duty of the Prime Minister, if he has a shred of self-respect left, if he possesses any courage or manliness whatever, to tender his resignation.",24
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,For an hour honourable member has been attempting to show that he does not possess one of those attributes.,25
85,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Eve n if the Prime Minister should tender his resignation, I do not see any necessity for a genera] election. The country has perfect confidence in this House. The right honourable gentleman, I repeat, should tender his resignation, and this Chamber should elect a Government to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth. That is my proposition, ancl I think it is one which is deserving of every consideration. The right honourable gentleman ought not to hold office under such humiliating circumstances. been stated in the press, and in this House, that the Opposition desire to force a dissolution at the present juncture, because they believe that they would strengthen their numbers, by reason of the fact that the farmers will shortly be engaged in harvesting operations, and would therefore be unable to record their votes. I give that statement an unqualified denial, and I shall quote a few figures in support of my contention. The last general election took place whilst harvesting operations were in progress, and yet I find that in the city and suburban electorates of Victoria . the percentage of votes recorded was only slightly in excess of that recorded in the country. In the farming districts of Corio, Echuca, Corangamite, Flinders, Grampians, Laanecoorie, Moira, Wannon, and Wimmera, the average number of electors who recorded their votes was 51*64, whereas in the electorates of Bendigo, Bourke, Melbourne, Melbourne Ports, Mernda, North' Melbourne, South Melbourne, Kooyong, and Yarra, the average was 54.59. In other words, only 2.95 more of the electors in city and suburban constituencies exercised the franchise, notwithstanding the additional polling facilities which they enjoyed. In New South Wales, however, the figures were all in favour of the country constituencies. example, in the seven farming electorates of Bland, Cowper, Hume, Hunter, Macquarie, Riverina, and New England, the average number of electors who recorded their votes was 50.42, whereas in the constituencies of Barrier, Dalley, East Sydney, Newcastle, Parkes, West Sydney. and South Sydney, the average was only 47.52, or nearly 3 per cent, less than in the country constituencies. Therefore the argument that we wish to force a dissoluthe tion because the farmers will shortly be engaged in harvesting operations, falls absolutely to the ground. So far as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is concerned, the Labour Party-desirou s as they are of seeing it passed-d o not for a moment hope that it will effect an industrial revolution, or give that peace to industrial classes which every honourable member sincerely wishes to see brought about. We feel that all legislation is of a tentative and experimental nature. No one can foresee how certain Acts will operate when they become law. They may operate in a manner quite different from that which was intended. For the most part we are groping It has in the dark. Sometimes we strike a fingerpost of truth, sometimes we obtain a glimmer of light, ancl sometimes we lay hold of a solid fact. Most of us are but as children ever climbing upon the ruins of a yesterday to grasp at a brighter tomorrow. Whatever our hopes may be i i regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , for my own part, I do not think that it will confer so much benefit as some honourable members upon this side of the House anticipate. It is legislation of a purely experimental and tentative character. We on this side are certainly not actuated by any feelings of personal aggrandisement. Both the Prime Minister and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat have declared that when they were supported by the Labour Partv there was never any question of self-seeking on our part. They acknowledge that our support was freely given, and that nothing was asked in return. We are here in the interests of the community, as a whole; we endeavour to do our best for that community, according to our lights, and if we fail, we fail in a good cause. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (Barker). - I should like to have taken part in this debate at an earlier stage, because it is now almost impossible to say anything that For has not been said by previous speakers. But during the past fortnight I have been so unwell, that I was unable to attend in my place in this House I mention the fact, in order to express my sense of obligation to the honourable and learned member for Angas, who was good enough, during the whole of last week, to give me a pair.. I may say at once that I regret very much the circumstances which Have placed the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and myself in different political camps. I hope, and believe, that the separation is only for a time, and for a short time, too. No one in this House entertains a greater admiration for the honourable and learned member than I do. He is not only a man of great ability-that is recognised throughout the Commonwealth-bu the is also a man with a very high sense of honour, and it seems to me that that is a characteristic in a politician which should be appreciated quite as much as mere ability. I was returned to this House as: a supporter of ithe Deakin Government. Their policy met with my general approval. It included preferential trade, fiscal peace, the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill-excludin g State servants from its operation-and agricultural development. As regards the last item, I am reminded that one of the most earnest advocates of agricultural development is included in the Ministry- I refer to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and in this connection I would also mention the name of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I loyally and gladly accepted Mr Deakin's leadership of the LiberalProtectionist Party, and at the conference when the coalition with the party under the present Prime Minister was proposed the reason I gave for objecting to the alliance was that I was a Deakinite, and that 1 would feel no confidence in transferring my political allegiance to another gentleman who stood at the elections for an entirely opposite set of principles. It seemed to me, then, as it seems to me now, that if coalition, were necessary as a solution of the problem raised by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, it was natural and more reasonable to seek it in the direction of an honourable alliance with the Labour Party than by combination with Conservatives and free-traders. I may say that I very frequently expressed a desire that the Protectionist Party should remain intact. Without wishing in the least degree to make any sort of admission in regard to other members of the House I should like to be very clearly understood on this point- I think the honourable and learned member for Ballarat will agree that I never deserted . him; anything of that sort was very far from my thoughts. I may add that I had nothing whatever to do with the preliminary meetings connected with the alliance, and that, before I joined it, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had announced himself as a supporter of the present Prime Minister. I would repeat that I sincerely trust the time is not far distant when I shall be able again to work in association with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I am satisfied that there is no man-no t even the honourable member for Bland-wh o has more genuinely at heart the welfare of the masses of Australia. As to the Watson Government, though I was unable to see eye to eye with them on some questions, the general character of their policy was such as to justify Liberals in adopting a friendly attitude. I was against them on the proposed modification of the MCCay amendment, but I had no sympathy with the refusal to recommit the clause. The principle of the Bill having been accepted practically by all parties in the House, there was no justification for declining to allow the reconsideration of a complicated and contentious detail in Committee. In South Australia my vote has been represented as a vote in favour of the Government policy on the clause. It was nothing of the kind. It was a vote in support of the parliamentary principle of full deliberation, of free discussion, of the Ministerial right to fair consideration of a new proposal and of ordinary fair plav. To my mind the coalition with the present Prime Minister's party was objectionable in principle, because on the basis of husting pledges there was no comrr.on ground of policy for the two sides to occupy. The manner in which the coalition came to power was almost equally objectionable. This coalition, to have claims on LiberalProtectionists, should have been arranged with the consent of both parties. It should have been arranged on the foundation of a definite and publicly declared agreement as to policy. It should not have sought to gain office by a side-wind, but should have raised a direct issue, and stood or 'fallen on it. Turning to the alliance, what do we see? At any rate, a fair and open agreement, and a platform. I have looked over the agreement again, and find in it nothing contrary to my hustings pledges. On the contrary, every member is left practically free to maintain his original attitude on such questions as the railway servants' clause and preference to unionists. On some matters a positive programme is agreed upon, but it is a programme in conformity with the Deakin policy, and which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat would endeavour to carry out were he Prime Minister. Much has been said as to the alleged violation of the undertaking to preserve fiscal peace. The term fiscal peace has been greatly abused. The right honourable member for Swan has quoted from a report what I said on the subject to the electors of Barker. The quotation is quite correct, so far as it goes, but I said much more than was reported. As stated last night by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, fiscal peace was the battlecry of the Deakin party at the elections, and what it really meant is to be ascertained by consideration of the circumstances. The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney proposed that the whole policy of the Tariff should be reopened for debate with a view to its destruction. If he could have obtained a majority he would have torn the Tariff to pieces in the interests of free-trade. That was the declaration of fiscal war. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat declared for fiscal peace. The Tariff was to have a fair trial. The present Prime Minister said no ; the longer the Tariff lasted, the harder it would be to uproot the fundamental principle. He may have been right in that, but the Protectionist Party replied that there was to be no uprooting, the Tariff was to be left undisturbed for the present in order that any future action might be taken in the light, not of theory, but of experience. To that view of fiscal peace I assented. I also thought the public had had enough - Tariff worries for a time, but I told the electors of Barker that the Tariff issue would continue to be a fighting issue, and that I had no doubt it would be pressed into prominence by the protectionists seeking more protection, not being satisfied with the protection to Australian industries afforded by the existing Tariff, Well, the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney and his party were defeated. That defeat, I take it, secures fiscal peace. The notion which now seems popular in free-trade circles is that there was some kind of contract with the present Prime Minister, that if his party were beaten he was to be at liberty to give up advocating free-trade for a season, and join with the protectionists in a coalition Government; Sir Langdon Bonython. that the protectionists were to forget all about protection, and to allow the Tariff to operate without caring whether it gave practical effect lo their ideas or not; that nobody was to bother one way or another about the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth, and the changes or developments which might be suggested by experience as necessary-this notion, I venture to say, was unknown to the people at the time of the election. The party to which I belonged declared for fiscal peace, but did not declare"" for fiscal indifference. Fiscal peace I would be no party to infringing. But I never undertook to support free-traders with a view of putting them into office and letting the fiscal issue slide. The proposal for a Royal Commission is not an attack on fiscal peace, but a protest against fiscal indifference. No one could fairly so describe a proposal which provided for a Commission of inquiry to ascertain the position and requirements of certain Australian industries. The Commission is to represent both Houses of Parliament,, and the questions it is to consider will be specifically referred to it. I have no intention to violate any pledge I may have given, but where is there any departure from.fiscal peace in this? The term fiscal peace must not be used as an excuse for shutting our eyes to the facts around us, and the reasonableness of this view is apparent from the changed attitude of the Ministry in relation to this matter. Does any real necessity exist for such an abdication or stretching of political principles as must be involved in the coalition of protectionists and free-traders, of Liberals andConservatives? I am sorry that a difference of opinion as to the right attitude to be assumed towards the Labour Party has caused a split in the LiberalProtectionist Party under the leadership of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat; but if there must be a drawing together of parties in one direction or the other, personally I am satisfied that such approaches should be regulated by natural affinities rather than by mere considerations of political convenience. The alliance is united on.a positive programme, to which both sides are able to subscribe without any sacrifice of individual conviction.",25
86,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is their programme on preference to unionists ?,27
87,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable gentleman is just as familiar with their attitude on that subject as I am. Mr MCCAY.:-Can the honourable member tell us why the programme was changed between the 5th and the 8th of September ?,27
88,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I must not divulge secrets. I was about to observe that, whilst the alliance has a positive gramme, the coalition is, on the other hand, founded on mere negatives. It lacks the principle of life, which can only be derived from community of conviction as to the proper ends of national .policy. It is agreed only-as to what it will sink, or what it will oppose. It is destitute of a vigorous constructive spirit. This is not a coalitionand I make the statement with regret, because amongst its members are many honourable gentlemen for whom I entertain the very highest respect-that commands confidence or deserves it.",28
89,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Gwydir).^-At this late stage of the debate one may be pardoned for not following the beaten track that has already been so much trampled by the various speakers who have addressed the House. I wish to say, in opening, that 1 - intend, as far as I am able, to make my few remarks with as few references to personalities as possible; and if I have to make some strong allusions and comparisons affecting honourable members opposite. I feel sure that they will not charge me with doing so from personal motives, but will believe that I speak purely from a political stand-point. I have a right to discuss the merits and demerits of those who compose the party which is opposed to the party to which I belong. The debate has been characterized by features such as were absent from any other parliamentary debate to which I have ever listened. The student of Australian politics today finds himself face to face with strange combinations, and in company with strange companions. The situation is so complex in its character that it requires all the genius of a trained public speaker to illustrate it adequately. I have not, nor do I pretend to have, the flow of language of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, nor do I profess to be able to adorn my phrases and to round my periods in the masterly manner of which he is capable. Circumstances have not given me such advantages as he has had; but I feel quite sure that if my remarks are not altogether couched in such phrases as are in accordance with the lines laid down by great authors, they will at least be taken as a sincere attempt to convey my meaning to the House. What is the position of affairs today? I venture to say that never in the history of any country-certainl y never in the history of any party or Government in Australiawas there such a state of affairs as we find in the Commonwealth. This Parliament is pro- only nine months from the people, yet we find the third Government occupying the Treasury benches. I venture to say-and I expressed the same opinion on the Address-in-Reply when the Deakin Government was in office-that there was no justification for the honourable and learned member for Ballarat making a clause in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill vital to the existence of his Government. The opinion which I then expressed, and which I now repeat, has been to some extent endorsed by the fact that the Bill, having left his hands, has since passed through the hands ""of a second Government, and into the hands of a third, whilst the provision which he made vital has been, practically accepted without any objection being raised. We have had the spectacle of a Prime Minister, while leading a strong combination, surrendering his high office from what I believe to be a mistaken idea of patriotism and honour, and today the measure on which he retired is being sent on to the Senate by the Government the honourable and learned gentleman is now supporting, though it still contains a provision for the inclusion of States .servants and railway men. I am at a loss to understand why, when the present Prime Minister was carrying the Bill through Committee, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat did not explain why he was not as sensitive upon the inclusion of that provision as he was earlier in the history of this Parliament. 1 expected to hear something from the honourable and learned gentleman as to why, feeling so strongly as he did upon the subject, he did not say, "" I continue to hold the same opinion in opposition to this provision from the high stand-point of constitutionalism and expediency, and I must still protest against its inclusion in this measure.."" If the. honourable and learned gentleman had been consistent he would have submitted an amendment to erase that provision which, in other circumstances, he was not prepared to admit.",28
90,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did not repeat my explanation on the point last night, because I have already stated it twice, if not three times, on the floor of the House.",28
91,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have no recollection of the explanation which the honourable and learned gentleman has made. I propose to be candid to all parties in what I have to say. I realise thai the present i» most important juncture, and that the womb of the future contains that which we cannot interpret. Possibly it contains surprises not only for honourable members of this House, but for the people who have sent us here. The position of parties and of policies, and the welfare of the industries of this great Commonwealth, are hanging in the balance. I have no wish to exonerate the late Government from any blame due to its mistakes. I have no wish to screen from public view my opinion of any* sins or follies of which that Government may have been guilty. the late Prime Minister showed that, for a layman, he had a comprehensive grasp of the duties of the high position which he filled. He was returned pledged to pass a Conciliation and .Arbitration Bill, which was expected by the people. He did his best, and did it ably, but he was taken off his guard, as I think I can show. we came to discuss the Bill in Committee, and it was sought by various interested persons, some of them friends, and some only professed friends of the measure, to amend it clause by clause, I could plainly see that my leader was likely to be imposed upon by men who were not sincere in the amendments which they suggested upon vital clauses. When the honourable and learned member for Corinella was industriously endeavouring to frame amendments of so subtle a character that they were not only puzzling to the legal mind, but perplexing even to the honourable and learned member himself, I pointed out that he was only confusing the issue before the Committee, and I saidThe honourable ancl learned member for Corinella seems to have a fenchant for drafting amendments which are likely to provide work for the lawyers. He proposes that the Court shall not direct preference to be given to members of organizations except as 'part of a common rule with the consent of such organizations and as, in the opinion of the Court, represent the majority of those engaged in an industry. The honourable and learned member, by interjection, made this reply to those observationsNo one suggests that. As a matter of fact, I do not propose to move that portion of my amendment. That portion of the amendment was not embodied in the amendment originally submitted by the honourable and learned member. It was an addendum which had not been previously discussed, and which was not clearly understood by honourable rnemMr Webster. bers. I find that when the historical vote was taken, it is reported in Hansard, that after the present Prime Minister said a few words, and the honourable member for Bland made a few observations, the honourable and learned member for Corinella moved an amendment in the following words:I move that the following words be addedThat was, in addition to an amendment which had been discussed by the Committee for two or three days. The honourable and learned member proposed to I say that addAnd, provided further, that no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the application for such preference is,' in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants. In a very few moments afterwards the division was taken, and this is why I have When no hesitation in saying that my leader was taken off his guard. The honourable gentleman felt sure that the Committee had adopted the view that a preference should be given, because it had been carried by one .vote in a division in favour of a general provision for preference - The honourable gentleman was justified in believing that honourable members would not hastily go back upon a vote of that character, and he allowed the amendment to which I have' referred to go without discussion, with the result that an amende ment which, I say deliberately, had not been discussed and had never been before the Committee, and which honourable members had had no opportunity to analyze, was rushed through. Honourable members who gave their votes to carry that .amendment by a majority of five seemed to be pleased that they had an opportunity of putting the first nail into the coffin of the Watson Government. persons What was the position of the then Prime Minister ? Having, I think incautiously, allowed an amendment designed to produce an ' impracticable measure to be put to the vote, was he not entitled under the circumstances, and according to parliamentary practice, to have the amendment re-discussed in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, and those for whom the Bill was specially intended? Was it not natural for him, believing that the other men were fighting with fair weapons, to expect that they would be prepared to deal out fair play to even the Watson Government? When the honourable member for Bland First took his seat on the Treasury bench as Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat promised to give his Government an impartial trial, a fair deal, as it were. And yet the first time that the honourable member for Bland tripped, through trusting too much to those who professed to be friends of the Bill , what did we find ? We found honourable members ready with sand-bags to put his Government out of office, without showing any mercy or quarter.",28
92,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,They committed suicide.,30
93,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is one of those who drove the Watson Government into committing suicide, if they did. He was one of those who practically prevented the Government from being saved by refusing to allow them to go into Committee again with the Bill.",30
94,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,What do the honourable member's colleagues say of the bridgebuilders being guilty of hypocrisy ?,30
95,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have nothing to do with what my colleagues say. There is too great a tendency on the part of some honourable members to quote what an honourable member may incidenta'ly or accidentally say on a question, ancl nail him clown to that expression, believing that they have a straw to cling to. If the right honourable member for East Sydney, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo were earnest in their profession of a desire to give to the people of this country a Bill which would secure peace instead of causing strife in the industrial world; if they were desirous of passing a Bil l which would be practicable and achieve its objects, they did not prove their sincerity when they sought to prevent the Watson Government from making the Bill as perfect as possible by the only means which a House of legislature has at its command, by allowing ancl deliberate discussion, so that the best thoughts.of honourable members could be transferred to the statute-book. I made an incidental remark while the debate was going on, because I could see theanxietv of the honourable and learned member for Corinella to be the instrument to create a tion which would at least bring into power another party. I am sorry that the honourable ancl learned member for Ballarat is iiot present this afternoon, because I had intended to deal with the light which he let in last night on this very interesting question of alliances and coalitions. He sits on the other side and Mipports the Prime Minister, but any one who did not know where he sits would at once decide, from a perusal of his speech that his. proper place was on this side. If his utterances last night really represent the ideas for which he is prepared to fight, he has no right to sit there with the Conservatives. If he is the friend of labour, which he professed last night he has always been, he should be sitting here with the Labour Party, and not conniving with those who form the leading part of the Ministry to defeat liberal legislation. What did he say last night? After quoting extracts from Hansard, newspapers, periodicals, and books, and giving a long history of his movements during the last six or nine months, which we all knew nearly by heart, he went on to explain how he came to leave his party and coalesce with the right honourable member for East Sydney. He told us that he did not leave his party, but that they left him. All I can say is that while the negotiations were going on, he professed to be equally favourable to a coalition with the Labour Party or the Free-trade Party so called, or, as he called them, the revenue tariffists. According to his own admission, he was prepared to coalesce with either'party, or, as it was put last night, he was courting two girls at one time. If he was sincere in his effort to bring about the abolition of the three-party system of Government, and .create two parties in this House, he adopted a most peculiar way to bring about the desired result. How could it be believed that the leader of the Protectionist Party in this State for many years- a man who has always been regarded as a consistent advocate of that policy - would join a pronounced free trade Prime Minister as readily as he full would join the Labour Party, who at least had no predilections with regard to fiscalism on their platform or in their policy? The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was practically endeavouring to bring about an alliance or a coalition with the situaLabour Party; but whilst we were discussing the question we found that he had already got an agreement with another party framed, and practically signed, before the time had arrived for us to give a reply to him. That of itself is sufficient to prove the insincerity of a man who professed to be desirous of obtaining an honest alliance or coalition with either party in the House. But that is not the real reason for his conduct. He let the cat out of. the bag last night. When his Government was defeated he advised the Governor General to send for the honourable member for Bland, and "" even then,"" he said-wha t I never knew before"" when Mr Watson was sent for I expected some suggestion with regard to a coalition to come from him."" We never heard of any such proposal at that particular juncture.",30
96,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is that the reason why the honourable and learned member is on that side of the House?,31
97,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Havin g lost the power to control the protectionist movement, the honourable and learned member thought that it would be better to have one-half of the power than to have no power at all-to have some security for the maintenance of the protectionist policy which he had so long championed in this State.",31
98,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Bu the stood aside.,31
99,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is true. The honourable and learned member had his eye on a star that is rising. He is expecting to come along later as the champion of preferential trade; consequently he can well afford to wait, believing that his star will rise higher in the horizon, and shine more brightly, than any other star.",31
100,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not think he acted in such a way as not to be entitled to get full credit for his courage.,31
101,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not need the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to tell me anything, because I could not rely upon what he might say, owing to the bias which he has in reference to this matter.",31
102,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I cannot be said to be biased in the honourable and learned member's favour.',31
103,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Ballarat said that he had expected the honourable member for Bland to come to an arrangement whereby some protectionists would be taken into the .Ministry which the Governor General had commissioned him to form; but, finding that the honourable member was not prepared to agree to that, the honourable and learned member fell back upon the only alternative, and declined to allow the Labour Party, which consisted, as he said, of fiscal atheists, to control the destinies of the protectionist party. The honourable and learned member himself threw up office on a mere pretexf, and was prepared to undo all that he had done by coalescing with either of the two other parties. He said to the other parties, "" I invite you to consider the propriety of forming a coalition with me."" Was that the action of a leader ? No ! A leader who was sincere, and who believed in his policy and his principles, would not invite a coalition, though he might declare the conditions under which he would join with another party. The honourable and learned member's attitude evidenced the lack of a characteristic which belongs to all leaders, who are never ashamed to come out into the open, and to fight to the death for the opinion or principle which they favour, no matter what the circumstances. I am a little dubious, after the declaration of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat last evening, as to the attachment which exists between the various members of the Protectionist Party, about the arrangements which have been come to in this Chamber. It seems to me as though, when they could not enter into a coalition with the Labour Party on terms which would suit them, the protectionists determined to mark time. They seem to have said, "" We will use the ambition of the Prime Minister to tie him up. Some of us will join with him in a coalition which shall be pledged not to interfere with the Tariff during the existence of this Parhas liament, while others of us will go to the other side of the Chamber, and keep the brake hard down on the Socialists. Thsn when the proper time comes, we can join hands again, and deal with the Tariff, in the meantime, keeping the Labour Party in its proper position."" But the Labour Party is the growing party. That fact is shown by the confidence of the public in it during the past twelve months or two years. It has no need to fear the future, and can stand alone. I think, however, that the right honourable member for East Sydney, who has boasted of his cleverness in instituting free-trade in New South Wales with the aid of protectionist votes, is trying to repeat the movement here by getting into his ranks protectionists who have been liberals, but who in the process of time, as happens with all men, have become conservatives, and are lagging behind in the march of progress. He is using them until he can get an opportunity to appeal again to the electors as the champion of free-trade. The present position of affairs is largely due to 1 the strange combination on the Government benches. But those who have come over to us to assist us in framing and carrying into effect legislation, not to benefit the monopolistic manufacturers or the members of the chambers of commerce, but those who have been ground too long under the Juggernaut of capitalism and monopoly, and to defend the rights, the lives, and the liberties of those who are working in our factories, our mines, on our lands, and in the multitudinous callings of this great continent, and to give them the right to live in a reasonable and a proper manner, will in return be assisted by us, inasmuch as we shall not heap trouble upon the manufacturers who were not fairly dealt with in the framing of the Tariff. I have something to say about the Prime Minister, which I shall reserve until he enters the Chamber. In the meanwhile, I would point out that we are face to face with a peculiar set of circumstances, so far as honourable members upon the Government side of the House are concerned. There is some unity to befound amongst honourable members upon this side of the Chamber-unit y of effort, of ideals, and of aims ancl objects; but what is to be said in regard to honourable members opposite?",31
104,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,They are a bad lot.,32
105,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that the Minister has properly described them, and that he is an authority who is entitled to some respect. The Minister was not in the House when I made some observations with regard to his conduct in connection with the amendment that brought about the defeat of the Watson Government. I regarded his attitude towards the Bill throughout, the discussion in Committee as absolutely insincere and unreliable. He has said time after time that the amendment proposed by him and embodied in clause 48 was fully discussed, and that no catch vote was taken. He has represented, further, that it expressed the thoroughly well-considered opinion of the majority of honourable members. I have quoted from Hansard to show that the proviso ultimately adopted was not embraced in the amendment originally proposed by the Minister, and that he stated, by way of interjection, that he did not intend to move the proviso that was subsequently adopted.",32
106,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member state that I said I did not intend to move the proviso?,32
107,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Hansar d says so.,32
108,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Hansar d says nothing of the kind.,32
109,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am reported, at page 2671 of Hansard, as having saidThe honourable and learned member for Corinella seems to have a - penchant for drafting amendments which are likely to provide work for the lawyers. He proposes that the Court shall not direct preference to be. given to members of organizations except as part of a common rule, and with the consent of such organizations and persons as, in the opinion of the Court, represent the majority of those engaged in an industry. I do not see that any advantage is to be gained by making such a proviso. The Court could not direct that preference should be given to unionists beyond the area covered by the common rule. They would never attempt to do anything so idiotic as to extend it further. The Minister then interjectedNo one suggests that; as a matter of fact, I do not propose to move that portion of the amendment. '",32
110,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , that portion; that was the portion I did not move.",32
111,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was the portion that was moved' by the Minister at a later stage. - Mr MCCAY - Nothin g of the kind.,32
112,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But it is on record in Hansard. When an honourable member is prepared to dispute the official report, I cannot place much reliance in his veracity, or his honesty. The Prime Minister has stated that he is not ashamed of his ambition to attain the position of Prime Minister. I admit at once that that is a position to which any man might aspire, and one which should be ever respected. The right honourable gentleman stated that he was proud of his ambition; but if I had been in his place, I should have sought to achieve the object of my ambition by ' honourable methods, and not by such means as would expose me to charges of trickery, or of having taken an unfair advantage of my opponents. The right honourable gentleman does not, however, care how he attains any position to which he may aspire, provided that he gets there. He now holds office subject to the will of one man, who spurns him, and who treats his policy and his promises with contempt, and he is prepared to cling to office under undignified conditions such as have never been endured by any other man in Australia. At a previous stage of his history, he condemned others for doing the very thing of which he himself is now guilty. When he was Premier of New South Wales, he said I am happy to think that this party is made of different stuff. That remark referred to an interjection made by one of his opponents. He went on to sayI am happy to think that this party casts personal convenience to the winds, that it will not sit down under this wrong done to this House and lo the people of this country. We know well that any honest course I can take will not meet with the approval of the honourable gentleman. We know well enough that there is nothing more that the honourable gentleman wants than to be able to approve of something that I can do, because he knows that if he does approve of it it. will be an absolutely immoral political act. That is the kind of political badinage which the right honourable gentleman uses in lieu of arguments. He continuedAnd so with the leader of the Opposition, his twin political brother. When office looms in the near distance they are arm in arm. The right honourable gentleman and the Minister of Trade and Customs now occupy a very similar position. He said furtherWhen the sweets of the Treasury benches seemto soften their lips they embrace one another; The members of the coalition Government are now doing the same thing. but when the sugar disappears I hope that honourable members will notice the terms used by the right honourable gentleman to describe the emoluments of office. But when the sugar disappears they resume their haughty altitude. We have no more theatrical entrances into the Opposition room, no more affectionate breakfasts upstairs. "" We are now entirely at issue; we do not know the gentleman opposite,"" and the gentleman opposite does not know the honourable member for St. Leonards, politically. The fact of the matter is this : when these two venerable opportunists saw a chance of the sweets of office they sank every principle that they had ever preached, and were prepared to debase the political life of this country to its lowest possible depth, in order to be able to run its Government. These were the words of the Prime Minpeating ister at a certain period in the historv of New South Wales. He was then speaking of a Government, two sections of which colleagues, had previously been opposed to each culture other. At that time he was leader of a third party, which practically occupied a similar position to that which was recently occupied by the Labour Party. the democrat who was fighting for majority rule, and who was prepared to accept the verdict of the electors. He ridiculed the idea of these two opposing sections entering into a political embrace and hanging on to office at the sacrifice of every principle which they had preached. that we are able to look into history, because we are told that it repeats itself. Mr Webster. To-day the right honourable gentleman stands convicted out of his own mouth of playing the same political farce that he its condemned at the period to which I refer.",32
113,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is the date of the compilation from which the honourable member has quoted ? Is it the last centurv or the century before?,33
114,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thes e things happened just after the honourable member was born. I have no desire to reply to juvenile, interjections, but if a question is relevant I am prepared to answer it. Upon the occasion to which I was referring the same methods were adopted as have been adopted here. The same deception was practiced to effect the downfall of the then Government as has been practised to compass the defeat of the Labour Administration and to bring about the present coalition. The Postmaster General stands charged by the late Sir Henry Parkes practically with conniving to bring that gentleman and the late Sir George Dibbs together, so that his leader - the present Prime Minister-woul d be in a position to prove in the Parliament of New South Wales that they were desirous of entering into a coalition. The honourable gentleman was prepared to betray the late Sir Henry Parkes into the hands of his - newly-found chief, notwithstanding that the former had lifted him out of the political mire and placed him in Ministerial office, and despite the fact that his present chief was unworthy to unlatch that gentleman's shoes. These are the words of the late Sir Henry Parkes in referring to the present Prime MinisterThe honourable member who has just sat down has indulged in repeating a paltry libel against me, which, I think, I ought to be permitted to explain. The honourable member has been rea stupid story that on some occasion I took breakfast with the honourable member for Tamworth. Suppose I did, I should have been is better company than in his. But one of his the Secretary for Mines and Agri. That office was then held by the present Postmaster-Generalcame down into the library where I was reading, He was ancl urged me to take breakfast with him. I did not desire to take breakfast with him, for one very good reason- I had breakfasted at home. But he urged me, and, from some lingering feeling, I consented to go with him. I was Mr Sydney Smith's guest, and he took me to a table where Sir GeoTge Dibbs was sitting, and had already nearly finished his bre-ikfast. Now, what is to It is well be thought of a Minister of the Crown who in\ited me, the person who had given him office, to take breakfast with him, and then circulated a story against me in the newsnapeis? ",33
115,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The present Postmaster-General. He is the individual who brought the better half of the Government into contact with the present Prime Minister, and who united the Protectionist and Free-trade Parties in a solid body. It is said that he accepted a portfolio in the Parkes Administration, and that he was so pleased with being lifted from the political ruck that he gave the emoluments of his position to charity, the said charity being Sir Henrv Parkes himself, with whom charity always began at home. I do not say that the statement is true, but at any rate it is a matter of common rumour regarding the conditions under which he was elevated to Ministerial office.",34
116,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Si r Henry Parkes always kept himself poor by giving to charity.,34
117,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"-That is the position occupied by the honourable member who was called upon to assist the Prime Minister in bringing about the coalition which exists today; and if he would so treat his old chief who had lifted him from political obscurity into place and power, how can his present protectionist allies expect to be treated later on? We have to discuss the Prime Minister as we find him; and, avoiding ancient history, I make the following quotation from his speech in the course of the present debate in reference to a White Australia :That is surely a very proper thing to do; but under the Post and Telegraph .Act the men who owned Australia, or their children, are debarred fiom performing this work. That is merely a bit of the honourable gentleman's by-play- That is a lovely extreme to push a great principle to. Upon the oceans of the world, which aie as much their property AS ours, the coloured subjects of the great Indian Empire should occupy as good a position as any Australian. Now I come to the matter of contract labour. I am absolutely in sympathy with the intention of the clause as expressed at the time it was adopted. The right honourable gentleman later on saysI am with honourable members opposite upon that point. But it is absurd to say that a man who, instead of coming out here as a pauper, without a prospect, secures a job before he starts, comes out here in shackles. That is the position, of the Prime Minister with regard to a White Australia. He pleads for the right of the coloured races of the Empire to take their places on mail steamers and other vessels trading in Australian waters-h e pleads for a piebald Australia so far as our control of OF the ocean is concerned. Yet we find in coalition with him the' honourable and learned member for Ballarat; and when I have read some words uttered by the latter gentleman, at the Australian Natives' Association banquet in Victoria, he may be able to explain how he comes to sit behind one who is sworn to eliminate from our present law the provision which he himself advocated.  member for Ballarat said that he would not allow the present Prime Minister to tinker with the measure.",34
118,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On . the occasion to which I have referred, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat said. . . . the white standard would be lowered. It was for those reasons that the Federal Government had become advocates of a ""White Australia."" He was then speaking of the Barron GovernmentBy following that policy, advantage would accrue to the whole of the Empire. This was the British Empire, and he hoped it would always remain so. (Applause.) It was a ""White Empire,"" and would remain so. (Loud applause.) White labourers, not Kanakas, were wanted at Bundaberg, Queensland. White miners, not Chinese, were wanted at Johannesberg. And white seamen, and not lascars, were wanted for the mail steamers. Those are the sentiments and utterances of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat at' a public meeting in Victoria.",34
119,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Those were his sentiments.,34
120,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Ballarat maintained last night that he held the same opinion. How are we to reconcile those utterances of the honourable and learned member with the position which he occupies today? .How are those other honourable members, who also advocated a White Australia, going to explain why they now sit behind a Prime Minister, who declares that he would allow lascars to work, not only in the stoke-hold, but also on deck, as on the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies ? We find the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Moira, and others waiting for a time when the protectionist flag may be again hoisted and they may sever themselves from the coalition. The honourable member for Moira and others have declared in the House that there is no coalition, though the Prime Minister says something quite different. The Prime Minister states that there is no written agreement-that an agreement was never is submitted to the partu when the Government preference was formed. But the agreement drawn up originally is as binding today as it ever was' on both parties who constitute the coalition. The Prime Minister not only takes that And, view, but adds the significant remark, "" So that long as I have alongside me the honourable white crews only. and learned member for Balaclava, that is a guarantee that the agreement will be broken.""",34
121,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister cannot go wrong while the honourable and learned member for Balaclava is on deck with him.,35
122,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It seems to me that the Protectionist Party have, in effect, put a break on the Prime Minister. would appear as though four protectionour ists had been sent into the Ministry to the Prime Minister from going beyond the agreement which has been drawn up, if not signed. The protectionists feel while the honourable member for Gippsland is at the Customs House, and the honourable and learned member for Balaclava is sitting tight on the Treasury bench.",35
123,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,And look at our military strength secured by the presence of the orable and learned member for Corinella in the Ministrv !,35
124,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable and learned member for Corinella is as cunning and keen as Minister of Defence as he was when professing to be the friend of my that influence predominates. leader on the Arbitration Bill, I can say that honourable members opposite leaning on a reed. We find that inof consistency has been the crowning characteristic of the career of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman who now declares that he would like see lascars allowed to work in the stokeholds and on the decks of mail steamers, the same gentleman who some time ago, when Prime Minister of New South Wales, endorsed the action of"" the State Postmaster General, the present honourable member Parramatta, in agreeing to the following resolution arrived at by the Postal Conferare ence : The Conference, having considered the reply of the London Office to the stipulation of the mean ? . Hobart Conference, with regard to the manning of the mail boats by white instead of coloured labour, recognises full y the force of ""the given by the Imperial Government against sisting on the exclusion of coloured labour, viz. :the necessity of not discriminating between classes of British subjects; but, in reply, would respectfully point out that by some steam-ship companies the labour of the contributing Colonies excluded from employment, and an invidious given to the labour of countries'which do not contribute to the maintenance of the service. No injustice would thus be done by the stipulation that the labour of the countries subsidizing the service only should be employed. therefore, this Conference is of opinion the mails to and from Australia and Great Britain should be carried by ships manned with That was when the right honourable gentlenot man was in power in. New South Wales, and supported by the Labour Party. That was when, . as he admitted, he was squeezed by the Labour Party. His Postmaster-General at that time was a democrat, holding advanced ideas in the matter of coloured labour, and he absolutely supported the policy of placing an embargo It upon the employment of. black labour upon mail ships. I feel sure that the honourable keep member for Parramatta, after taking up that stand at that date, must feel uncomfortable as a supporter of the present Gosecure vernment. No man in this House can be more unhappy. As a radical who has been in the forefront of the Radical Party, he must feel ill at ease at being associated with politicians like the honourable member for Wentworth, the honourable member for honKooyong, and others of that type, who are here not because they possess that ability which would in itself win for them a place in Parliament, but because they have the influence of money behind them, and had the good fortune to choose constituencies where A - family only contribution to the fighting fund of are the great Liberal and Reform Party New South Wales is able to pave the way to a position to which the persons so assisted could never attain if they had to take a bluey on their backs and go out to into the bush to make their own way.",35
125,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable memis ber infer that subscriptions were paid in order to gain selection by constituencies ?,35
126,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say that the people for who have the means to pay these subscriptions are initiated into electorates which largely constituted of the elements which pay regard to wealth.,35
127,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,What on earth does that,35
128,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not expect , the reason honourable member to understand what I mean. inIt would take something like a mallet and chisel to drive an idea into his brain. various I have seen in a newspaper that during, the recent fight in New South Wales one W. H . Kelly, or the Kelly family- I would not call them "" the Kelly gang,"" because that would not be right-ha d contributed ,£1,500 towards the fighting fund of the Reform Party. Therefore I presume that some one of the honourable member's family-and I know of no other family of his name able to contribute to such an extent, or so anxious to down the Democratic Party-ha d contributed this sum.",35
129,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If all the honourable member's "" facts "" are as far from the truth as that statement, he is not very reliable. His statement is absolutely incorrect.",36
130,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is a statement for which a newspaper is responsible.,36
131,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The gutter press, I suppose?",36
132,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think I read it in the Daily Telegraph.,36
133,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member think that that has anything to do with this debate?,36
134,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I certainly do. As a dissolution appears to be within sight, I think we have a right to discuss those affairs that affect the electorates which are to return members to this Parliament.",36
135,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I would point out that the one question before the House is as to Avhether it has confidence in the present vernment ; and I really do not see how a matter concerning somebody's contribution to a certain fund has anything to do with the question of confidence in the Government.,36
136,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not desire to debate the matter, but I take it as a fact that when we speak of the Government, we do hot mean merely the members of the Cabinet. The Government, as I understand it, could not exist, except for honourable members sitting behind it. It appears to me that the party supporting the Government is a fair subject for criticism.",36
137,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The statement which the honourable member has made was absolutely incorrect.,36
138,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Gwydir has not clearly apprehended the standing order if that is the view which he takes. The motion before the House is one of r.o-confidence in the Government. It deals with the Government in power, and therefore the conduct of members of the Government may fairly be discussed. the conduct of members supporting the Government may only be discussed in so far as those honourable members have spoken during the debate, and have publicly expressed views one way or the other. 9 F 2",36
139,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have no desire to dispute your ruling, sir. But when we hear declarations from honourable members opposite, as to how the Labour Party fight elections, and when we know that the charge levelled against the Labour Party in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was that we wish to turn the trade unions into political organizations, and to use their funds for party purposes, I think that the matter to which I have alluded, is a fair subject upon which to challenge honourable members opposite. Therefore, there is nothing, so far as I can see, that should prevent me from discussing the sources from which the Government are to be supported during the coming campaign. They have supported an amendment providing that industrial unions under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill shall not be political organizations, and shall not use their funds for political purposes in any way. If that be the position honourable members opposite take up, I think I am entitled at least to refer to the action they have (taken which is calculated to bring grist to their political mill', through organizations that are standing behind the Government at the present time. On the Go- subject of a White Australia, the Prime Minister made these remarks at Swan Hill :The policy of a White Australia was going too far in seeking to break up a mail service, because there were some lascars in the stokeholds. If he got sufficient power he would repeal such a provision. That is a distinct delaration by the right honourable gentleman.",36
140,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The right honourable gentleman says that now.,36
141,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Undoubtedly, but when the honourable member for Parramatta was Postmaster-General in the right honourable ' gentleman's Government in New South Wales, he said exactly the opposite. He contended that the ships which carried mails between Australia and Great Britain should be manned by white men. The present Prime Minister then had the Labour Party in New South Wales behind him, and he had to obey their behests. He saw that he could not continue to. hold office unless he accepted the principles But enunciated by the Labour Party. But now that he has separated from that partu and is fighting with those who are opposed to labour, now that he is the champion of monopoly, capitalism, and all that oppresses the multitude, he is prepared to do what the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has declared time and again, and what he reasserted last night in the most emphatic language, should never be done. The right honourable gentleman is prepared to do what is calculated to undermine the future »f the British Empire. The honourable members for Robertson and Wentworth greet that suggestion with a laugh, but it should not be forgotten that the British seaman is now very largely in a minority in the carrying trade of. the Empire, and that his place has been filled by alien and coloured seamen. When the time of stress and trial arrives, as it may before long, we shall require every seaman manning British ships to defend the Empire, and we shall find that the aliens, who are now employed merely for the purpose of bringing profits to the ship-owners, and who have taken the place of the British seamen, cannot be relied upon to defend our vast Imperial commerce. We shall then recognise the mistake we have made in not following the example of Germany. The Germans do not allow men of other nations to man their' ships, nor do they permit their ships to be manned by black labour. They are patriotic enough to employ men of their own nationality, knowing what a source of strength those men will be should a time of trouble come when they will have to defend the commerce of their country against those who are jealous of it, and who would destroy it if they could. Yet, when I make reference to what should. be a patent fact, we have the honourable members for Wentworth and Robertson breaking out into a loud guffaw. I could not expect anything else from the honourable member for We-.tworth, who cannot possiblv have much information on the subject, but I did expect more from the honourable member for Robertson, who has given some study to the question, and who professes to have made a great study of the relation which the preferential trade question bears to the interests of the Empire.",36
142,Mr LEE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Are not these black men British subjects,- and have they not fought for England?",37
143,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Ballaraf is also aware that they are British subjects, but he would not counsel their employment in a way which might be fraught with danger to the Empire. The honourable and learned gentleman realizes that the question is of more importance than the saving of a few pounds to ship-owners. He realizes that the question is one which deeply affects the future of the Commonwealth, and which, as I have said, is likely to affect still more seriously the future of the Empire, when the call comes to defend it, as it some day will, against those who are threatening our supremacy in the commercial world.",37
144,Mr LEE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Has she not relied upon these same coloured people in. times past?,37
145,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not here to speak of that. Some honourable members .opposite appear to think that we should be guided in our action today by what occurred fifty years ago. The world is continually changing, but honourable members opposite do not keep pace with its changes. They have been produced in some irresponsible way that prevents them from having any clear idea of what a progressive policy is. They confine their reading to ancient history, and desire to tie up the future of this Commonwealth in some of the precedents laid down in times past, when the conditions prevailing were quite different from those by which we are surrounded today. On the question of a White Australia we have a clear statement from the Prime Minister that he will, if possible, repeal the section ot the Alien Immigration Restriction Act, which prevents the employment of lascars on our mail steamers; whereas the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is prepared to stand by the policy of a White Australia in its widest sense, and to the fullest extent. The honourable member for Parramatta really was the first to bring this question into practical politics in Australia by.endorsing the policy at a Conference of Postmasters-General, when he was himself Postmaster-General of New South Wales, and yet both those honourable members are now supporting a leader, one who is prepared, 'on the first opportunity, to repeal this policy. Where is their consistency or honesty? Where are we to look for sincerity in politics when we find honourable members of such diverse views on the White Australia questionjoining the same party? How can they agree, unless it be that they know that the Prime Minister is prepared to bend to them, and to be squeezed. He is only playing to the gallery, the ship-owners, and the capitalists ; and if the partu behind the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the democrats who sit on that side, and who, in mv opinion, have not chosen their proper seats, declare that they will not submit to his will, I suppose that he will drop the question, as he would drop anything, rather than forfeit the position which he occupies, and to which he aspired so long. Now we come to his consistency on the question of arbitration. He tries to argue that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella is practically the - same as the one which the honourable member for Bland desired to move when he asked to be allowed to go into Committee again. It has been stated by . the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that the difference between the amendments is so fine that it could hardly be touched by the keen edge of a razor; but, in spite of his statement, I submit that the difference between them is such as to create an impracticable measure. When the Prime Minister sat on this side, he was opposed to the inclusion of railway servants, and - since he crossed the floor he has accepted their inclusion without a murmur; in fact, without a twinge of conscience he has accepted the Bill, with other provisions, to which he objected, and sent it to the Senate. I admit that if I had had any voice as regards the attitude of the honourable member for Bland on clause 48 it would never have been made a vital question. I should have allowed the House to mould the Bill, according to its wish, sent the measure to the Senate, and when it was returned, fought out the issue on the floor of this House. That would have avoided the - difficulty which occurred by reason of the error of judgment of my honourable friend in allowing a division to be taken when honourable members had no time to discuss the amendment or consider what they were doing. The honourable and Teamed member for Ballarat has said that if the clause had been recommitted he would have practically voted for the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bland, and other honourable members on his side have made a similar admission.",37
146,Mr LEE,MOTION OF WANT OF,He said that he preferred the amendment of - the honourable and learned member for Corinella to the other.,38
147,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Ballarat said last night that there was no difference between the amendments, and that the only difficulty he had was that he had already given a vote which he could not reverse, but that had the Watson Government been allowed to go back into Committee he would have been prepared to support the amendment foreshadowed by its head. If the honourable and learned member had done so, the Bill would have been passed on to the Senate in such a form as would have done credit to this Parliament, and it would have been effective for the purposes for which it was framed. These are indications of the inconsistency of the Prime Minister. We also have similar indications in his action with regard to . monopolies. . Here again he is playing his old game of see-' saw. He never changes except when he gets into a tight corner, and then he turns a somersault. Speaking in this debate on the 20th September, at page 4727 of Hansard, he saidThe first thing is, as the leader of the Opposition has done, to speak of the evil of monopolies and combines. In that I quite agree with him. We, on this side, are as willing as he and his Government were to introduce legislation to suppress any abuses of that sort. On the same page, and only an inch lower down, we find a correctiveSenator Pearce, speaking of the full socialistic programme at a public meeting, said- "" We cannot do all this at once; but there are some plums ready for plucking now, and one is the tobacco monopoly."" Those steps towards revolution we will oppose. Where is the consistency of the right honourable gentleman, who, in one breath, says that he is prepared to agree with the honourable member for Bland in his efforts to suppress monopolies, and in almost the next breath, says, "" Those steps towards revolution we will oppose."" I need not say any more on that point, because, to quote the right honourable gentleman's utterances at any time is to bring evidence sufficient to convince any man that there is neither sincerity .nor honesty in his political professions, when he speaks here as Prime Minister. On the other side of the House we have, I suppose, the most peculiar combination that has ever existed in Australia. On that side we see protectionists of the most pronounced type, free traders of the most pronounced type, and unrelenting land-taxers, who have again and again asserted that there is only one way to happiness and prosperity, and that that is by means of a single tax. On that side, also, we see'honourable members who represent sections of the community antagonistic to the principle of a single tax. We see singletaxers sitting alongside land monopolists, free-traders sitting alongside protectionists, radicals and democrats sitting alongside the most conservative and non-progressive men in this Parliament. Such a combination has, I venture to say, never before existed in the King's Dominions. We see in. this Chamber today, men who have thrown over the principles of a lifetime in oTder to obtain place and power. We hear of a coalition under a dual leadership, in which both parties are supposed to be equal and co-ordinate, but when the Prime Minister issued his manifestoes to the people of Australia and to the people of New South Wales, with that little bit of a postscript to the other infinitesimal which have given him so much trouble during this debate, did he confer with his better half? No. His better half is so only in name. He issued' his manifestoes, not as one of two leaders, but as the head of the Government. This - is a beautiful coalition, such as we have never before seen in the political history of Australia. But one ceases to wonder at the association of the honourable member for Gippsland with the right honourable member for East Sydney when one looks at the combination behind them. The net was spread to catch every one of conservative tendencies, and all who are prepared to support a monopolistic programme. The people of Australia await the time to declare their opinion of this coalition, and it is a pity that the honourable member for Wilmot did not hasten, instead of delaying their verdict.",38
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is very ungrateful.,39
149,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,-Some honourable members have a great deal to say about the chances of others in the event of a dissolution ; but I am quite prepared to meet any Government supporter in the electorate which I have the honour to represent.,39
150,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I will meet the honourable member at Marrickville. He got six votes there, did he not?",39
151,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thos e votes were cast for me after I had retired from the contest. I have explained the circumstances before in this Chamber, and the unfairness shown by the honourable member in referring to the matter is characteristic of the party to which he belongs. I have fought longer in the ranks of labour than he will live in political life, and I have no fear of going back to my constituents. They placed me in the State Parliament when I was a stranger, without money, carrying my bluey on my back, and after I had represented them for three years there they returned me to this Parliament by a majority of 1,900 votes. If any one opposite, from the Prime Minister downwards, wants to fight me, let him come to Gwydir.",39
152,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Honourable members opposite would , never have entered Parliament if they had had to do what the honourable member has done.",39
153,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable mem-' ber for Wentworth, if he had had to do it, would have been left upon the track a States mere wreck. The Prime Minister, speaking upon Socialism, used these wordsThere are some public services, such as those performed by our post offices, which we are all agreed should be a national concern. By the way, some people, including myself, used to look on State railways as another phase of Socialism; but on closer inquiry State railways are shown to be an absolute negation of Socialism. That is a queer position to assume. He agrees that the Post Office is a socialistic institution, but he says that the railways and tramways are not, because they have been put under the control of Commissioners to be managed as a commercial concern. But when, a year or two ago, stock were dying because of the drought, the Government of New South Wales put aside all commercial considerations, and ordered the Railway Commissioners to carry fodder for the relief of the settlers who were in dire distress, at rates which were unprofitable. Yet the right honourable gentleman says that our railways are not a socialistic institution. Furthermore, about two years and a half ago, when I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament, the Railway Commissioners of the State were opposed to the granting of an - eight hours' day to the railway and tramway employees. They reported that, owing to the fact that they had to be guided by commercial considerations, they could not afford to introduce the change. In spite of the Railways . Commissioners, however, the Parliament recognised that the men asked for bare justice only, and they decided to accede to the request ancl to make up any deficiency in the railway revenue by a contribution from the public Treasury. Yet the right honourable gentleman who twists and turns and wriggles out of every position he assumes, whose opinions are never fixed for 'twelve months together, denies that the railways and tramways are socialistic institutions. In Victoria the railways are in the hands of the State, but those in authority are attempting to grind the very life, out of the men who carry on the responsible work of conducting the passenger and freight traffic of the country. What is Socialism ? What was Socialism yestei day is not Socialism today, and the Socialism that is advocated on this side of the House is not Socialism as it has been defined by the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Richmond. Both those honourable members turn and change with lightning rapidity, and still present a brazen front to the people of the country. They talk about the socialistic party desiring to bring about a revolution. The Prime Minister said that if the tobacco monopoly were suppressed it would be tantamount to a revolution. Let me remind the right honourable gentleman and the Minister of Home Affairs that in England, where they have no Labour Party such as we have here, the county and shire councils have proceeded leagues beyond us in the direction of providing socialistic institutions for the convenience of the people. Honourable members tell the monopolists of this country that we are threatening to overthrow the Government, to revolutionize everything, and to bring about an equal division of wealth among all the members of the community. That is noftfte Socialism we are advocating. We desire only to proceed along the lines adopted in the mother country, and to confer upon our own people some of the blessings that have been bestowed upon the working classes of Great Britain. Yet we are told that we are revolutionaries, that we desire to upset society. That is a base slander, worthyonly of a political party that is trying to impose upon the people.",39
154,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The gandist of the Labour Party does not express the /same views as the honourable member.,40
155,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the Minister approve of everything that has been said by that eminent personage who has been engaged to advocate the cause of the employers ?,40
156,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Would the honourable member accept my repudiation?,40
157,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member repudiate what is said by the official referred to? - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Does the honourable member repudiate the propagandist of the Labour Party?,40
158,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall tell the honourable member what I do. Outside of Parliament the province of a propagandist is to educate the people up to certain ideals which may be reached during the present generation, or perhaps not for many generations.! It is his duty to set an ideal before them, so that they may proceed by degrees towards its realization.",40
159,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then the honourable member is on the road to the attainment of his ideals.,40
160,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Undoubtedly . Our social system is built up on the changes which have taken place from time to time. Socialism has been in existence for many years past, and will continue long after we have passed away.",40
161,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It has been in existence for 2.000 years.,40
162,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , 2,000 years ago we had a leader of men who preached and practised Socialism.",40
163,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the "" Sermon on the Mount,"" He also taught individualism.",40
164,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Socialis m is practically the outgrowth of the experience of the nations. The conservatism of today was the liberalism of yesterday, and the liberalism of yesterday was the Socialism of the day before. Honourable members opposite were the liberals of ten years ago, but owing to the advance of the great radical movement they are the conservatives of today. They have entered upon the stage of decay. Yesterday the Labour Party were the reformers who were preaching the doctrine of equality and common justice, and today they are in the van of the liberal movement. If they do not keep abreast of the development of the times they will inevitably become a conservative party. propa- It is a question of evolution, and one over which we have no control. There are one or two other matters connected with the career of the right honourable gentleman to which I desire to refer. He has already announced that he is willing that a private member should introduce a Bill providing for the granting of a bonus upon the production of iron. Upon that subject he is not prepared to nail his colours to the mast by making the measure a Government one. In order that he may escape all responsibility and remain secure in the position which he now occupies,- he is willing to allow that important matter to be dealt with by a private member. Is that his idea of responsible government? It would naturally be thought that if, at any period in his history, the right honourable gentleman had proclaimed his willingness to assist industries by means of bonuses, he would have had no compunction whatever in, abiding by a similar policy today. But I find that whilst he held office in New South Wales he offered an advance of 15 per cent, upon the prices submitted by foreign, competitors to any persons who were willing to establish iron works in that State, and to turn out 150,000 tons of steel rails.",40
165,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is wrong as to the percentage.,41
166,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not know whether at that time the right honourable gentleman was dependent upon the votes of two or three protectionists.,41
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He offered an advance of 15 per cent, upon the cost of the rails in England.",41
168,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a variation without a difference. Any practical man would understand an advance of 15 per cent, to mean that measure of advantage over the cost of landing the rails in New South Wales.",41
169,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member might as well say that I offered an advance of 50 per cent.,41
170,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The New - South Wales Hansard is the authority for my statement.,41
171,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The 1 quite wrong.,41
172,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not understand how the Hansard reporters could have made such a mistake. But even admitting that the right honourable gentleman's statement is accurate, it makes very little difference to his position.' It is only one of the multitude of inconsistencies associated with his .political career. In this connection I would direct attention to his action upon the occasion of taking the first Federal referendum - - As honourable members are aware, he makes a very strong point of majority rule. He affirms that trade unionists and those, who represent them are enemies of that principle - But what did he do when he was endeavouring to gain a position in New South Wales which was filled by an infinitely better'man? After a solemn compact had been entered into with the Premiers of the other' States that the minimum affirmative votes necessary for the adoption of the Federal Constitution should be 50,000, he assisted in the far liament of New South Wales to raise that minimum to 80,000. The right honourable gentleman broke the compact into which he had entered 'with those gentlemen who met him as the representative of the mother State.",41
173,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,In what year was that?,41
174,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was the year in which the right honourable gentleman was so eager to secure the position of leader of the Federal Governmentwhich was then held by Sir Edmund Barton. It has been denied that the present Prime Minister was responsible for what took place in connection with the referendum on the Federal Constitution ; but I do not, as a rule, make statements unless I have taken the trouble to, as far as possible, ascertain their accuracy. I may be mistaken, as we all may be, but I can assure honourable members that it is not intentionally. In this case, however. I happen to have here an extract from the New South Wales Hansard containing the report of the discussion on the Enabling Bill, and in that discussion the Prime Minister used these wordsI represent this Parliament in reference to the other Colonies in a peculiar sense, and it is with reference to the faith which this House has to keep with the other Colonies that I have to address myself to this matter. When a people enter into bargains, or pass Acts of Parliament on the faith of which other people, other communities, pass important Acts of Parliament, then I think we have to pause before we seriously disturb the compact upon which the movement is based.

178,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I care not what the language shows. I do not deny that the right honourable gentleman was seeking to compromise-hi s whole attitude has ever been one of compromise.,41
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,IS not all legislation compromise ?,41
180,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"This was not a question of compromise in detail. The Prime Minister is prepared to compromise on principles which he has enunciated throughout his political career. He is prepared to compromise even today in a most humiliating way, and to sit as Prime Minister, under conditions to which Sir Henry Parkes would never have submitted. Although he had previously agreed to fix the maximum number of votes at 50,000, he, because of pressure-which , by the way, he said could not be exercised on him-prac tically broke the compact into which he had entered with the Premiers of the other Colonies, and he did so to the extent of making it practically impossible to carry the Enabling Bill. It is useless to say that because he was asked to do this by Parliament-that because other members of that Parliament desired that a larger number should be made the maximum-h e has any excuse. Minister, was responsible for his action, and he ought not to thrust that responsibility upon the shoulders of those to whose demands he acceded, and whose proposals he thereby adopted. The right honourable gentleman, who claims to be such a strong - supporter of majority rule, as applied to unionists or non-unionists, absolutely violated the principle on the most important question that was ever submitted to the people of Australia, and made it impossible for the majority to determine the question submitted by referendum. Where is the right honourable gentleman's sincerity? His advocacy of majority rule, as applied to unionists and non-unionists, is a hollow mockery, and yet that is only characteristic of his action in regard to every policy he has advocated at one time or other in his political career. I am not about to give my own opinion, but the opinion expressed by the newspaper which supported the light honourable gentleman during his long, though I will not say successful, career as Premier of New South Wales. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, in speaking of the right honourable gentleman, saidWith respect to the Federation movement, Mr. Reid was most unhappily an opportunist. The Daily Telegraph had found him out, and had branded him with the only term which properly described him. Nobody expected that Mr Reid would assume a "" Yes-no "" attitude on the first referendum. Who would have expected that the right honourable gentleman would assume a yesno attitude on his great principle of free trade?This halting policy was partly a.concession to the anti-Federal section of his supporters in Sydneythe Tight honourable gentleman has always pandered to the other sideand partlv personal jealousy of the Convention leader, Mr Barton. The game of an opportunist is a game of calculation,- and Mr Reid miscalculated. Had he decided to run a straight courseFancy the Daily Telegraph doubting whether the present Prime Minister was going' to run a straight course !",41
181,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,How long ago was that written ?,42
182,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not want any interruption from the "" corner man"" of the Government.",42

185,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is not dead yet.,42
186,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not saying that he is dead. When he dies the honourable member will die with him. There are some men who arc like the parasites referred to recently by the honourable member for Hunter, that cling to other plants. In this case the plant is the Prime Minister. He has put some honourable members opposite where they are today. They have sailed under his flag, no matter how many colours he might have upon it, nor how often he might change it. Whether his colours were black, or white, or blue, or yellow, they sailed under his banner at all times. The extract from the Daily Telegraph, which I have read, proves the right honourable gentleman to be a ""yes-no"" advocate, and convicts him of delaying the desire of the people. It practically tells us that he was actuated, not by a desire to support a principle, but to please his anti-Federal supporters in New South Wales. The right honourable gentleman was dissatisfied because the Convention did not choose him as its leader, but preferred to choose the gentleman who has been described as "" Australia's noblest son."" He was the great leader of the grand Federal . movement. When he addressed the people of New South Wales with regard to the Commonwealth Bill, the Prime Minister delivered a wonderful speech, in which he exhibited his unstable character in politics, and caused himself to be described as assuming a ""yes-no"" attitude. He then said that he condemned the Bill because of the Braddon ""blot,"" and because it would heap burdens upon the backs of the people by extracting from their pockets £ 4 for everv one that was necessary for the legitimate purposes of Federal government. But his subsequent conduct showed that he did that because he had not been chosen leader of the Federal movement. When subseas quently circumstances enabled him"" to play a leading part in Federal affairs did he vocate the abolition of the Braddon ""blot"" Did he go into ecstacies regarding the rights and privileges of the people, or show desire to protect them from the burdens that he had formerly said would be placed upon them on account of Federation? No. gHe dropped that attitude, because he knew that, as a Federal advocate, he could never Treasury. evade the provisions of the Constitution when he.entered this Parliament.

If of the kind. the Prime Minister were a sincere believer in the free-trade policy which he promulsay. gates, would he not advocate the substitution of direct taxation for Customs and cise duties. But he himself has stated quite recently that he regards direct taxation an invasion of the rights of the States because he maintained that the land revenues are sacred to the States, and must be safeguarded to them. As he is not prepared to accept the only alternative Customs duties, what a mockery it is his public professions to advocate a trade policy ! I wish to deal with another matter before I leave the right honourable gentleman. The Prime Minister has been charged with paying over moneys to Senator Neild, which ought not to have It has been asserted that in that matter he did something which he had stated previously' in unmistakeable language that he would not do-that he had promise, as Premier of New South Wales, that he. would never stoop to make payments of the character referred to.

213,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,And that was refunded.,44
214,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In any case, the Prime Minister did not fairly represent the position in saying that the payment was merely for the production aqd printing of of the report. Rightly or wrongly, ably or Otherwise, I have endeavoured to show that the past public conduct of the. Prime Mjo. ister does not warrant honourable members. I in placing confidence in the Government he I have attempted to show that politically the right honourable gentleman is one in whom nq reliance can be placed. He consistent only in his inconsistency, and is prepared when in office to bend to every wind that blows, if it is likely tp affect his position, What is the policy of the present Government? The Prime Minhas told us in effect that it. is only a man who has. had no political experience who cpuld expect a Government tp conie down with a policy at a time like this; and he would not be worthy of his position if he attempted to bring down a' policy the which could not be carried into law the during the present session of Parliament. There was a time when the right honor? able gentleman held a very different view, although he was then in a responsible position as Premier of New South Wales, and there were only three months, of the session to run, Referring to the ppjicy - which the right honourable gentleman then submitted for to the New Sputh Wales Parliament, the Neild in late Sir Henry Parkes said-=-I want to point out, and I shall do it briefly, how, pn the face Qf it, it is a fraud ancl a delui How can he or any body of reasonable men crowd into the three months before the ist the measures he proposes. If he were an instead of being the very opposite, would be impossible for him to crowd intp that time the measures which he has fore-shadowed to this House, with an insolence, which, considering, the small,minded man he is, is most amazing fP me. That was the criticism of the late Sir Henry Parkes upon the statement of the present Prime Minister to the New South Wales Parliament, that he proposed to carry out a policy which he had foreshadowed under cover of a motion for adjournment* and which he could not compass during the whole of his political career as a Prime1 Minister .in that State. At that time, the right honourable gentleman came forward with a policy for a land tax, an income tax, local government, mining legislation; and almost everything which had been included in the policy of every other political party in the State, and he declared that his Government was going tp carry that policy into effect during the remaining three months of the session. The right honourable gentleman had such an experience at 1 that time, that he has never forgotten it. He was then going to perform a miracle,and failed, and today he says that he has no policy at all. We are asked to trust the right honourable gentleman with the ministration of the affairs of this monwealth during the recess. Honourable members will agree with me when I that the administration of the laws which have already been passed by this Parliasaying, ment is just now of more importance than fresh legislation is likely to be for time to come. It might not be so much to ask us to trust the Government for remainder of the session, but we are being asked on this occasion to say that we have confidence in them, as men who are qualiCommonwealth ? fied to administer laws which they have sworn to alter at the first opportunity. Parliament. How can the right honourable gentleman be trusted by honourable members who believe in a White Australia, in protection, in preferential trade, when they know that he' has denounced the policy which has favoured each of . these proposals But while the right honourable gentleman bound to administer the law, it only means that he will do so according to his lights. He is not responsible for any act of maladnotice ministration unless it be corrupt. No error of judgment on his part will bring upon Act him any punishment. Therefore, we have to consider, not merely whether we are prepared to hand the destinies of the people into his keeping, and entrust him with the formulation of a programme for next sion, whenever it may take place, but whether we are prepared to entrust him and his colleagues with the administration of the Departments and of laws which, he has practically stated., without any qualifidence fication, that he is going to alter when opportunity presents itself. We have an stance in the case of the six potters. Some persons think that we should refer to that case with bated breath. I am not of that opinion. I remember how the right able gentleman, during a fierce electioneering campaign, caricatured the Barton no policy. Government on the question of the six hatters. I remember well how he appealed policy. for the liberty of the subject, for freedom of contract, for allowing the white man, because he was a white man, who belonged to the same country as we did, to be adsitting tight, and drifting. mitted, irrespective of the injury which might do to citizens who had been helping to build up.the Commonwealth to its sent state. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney, in his place it here, said that the Prime Minister had as Mr Webster. a matter of fact iadorsed the prosecution having for its object the investigation of the terms under which the six pollers aradrived under contract to a firm of pipeComrriakers and pottery manufacturers, and that he must take the responsibility of his say action. The right honourable gentleman cannot evade his responsibility by simply "" I did not initiate the prosecution, and therefore I cannot be held to be responsome sible.'.'

I say to those who give them their upon such conditions, that they may diffiyet live to repent of their action. I now propose to deal with another matter, havout ing reference to the present Postmaster General. When Ministries are about to be constituted, he is always in the vanguard of the free-trade movement. His present position is wholly attributable to his suphas port of the so-called free-trade doctrine, to the fact that he clings to the Prime just as persistently as a child does At the last general elections he was opposed by Mr Sandford, at the proprietor of the iron works at Lithgow, who is very desirous of securing a T»nus upon the. production of iron. If any hona orable member desires to obtain some interesting reading, he has merely to consult be the files of the local newspapers whilst that passed campaign was in progress, and he will marvel that anything in the shape of the honourable gentleman could be produced from man or woman. To-day, because Mr. Sandford wishes to obtain a contract from the New South Wales Government, which is in sympathy with the Reid Administration, he sits cheek by jowl with the gentleman .who opposed him last election. O, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive. How applicable are those lines to the gentlemen who have been so deceitful in their public life. Immediately upon taking office, the Postmaster-General found tender in his Department for certain and telegraphic supplies which were already protected by the Tariff to the extent of master-General 20 per cent. What action did this emblem of free-trade take-this gentleman who opposed the arch-protectionist of New South Wales, who hunted him from pillar to and denounced him practically as a monsorry strosity so far asfiscalismwas concerned? f know that it takes a good deal to bring the blush of shame to the faces of some that! men.",48

244,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The real caucus will be when the honourable member for Macopposite quarie goes back to his constituency. He will then have to explain why That is the Labour Partyhe voted to put a Government out and to exclude the railway men from verned the operation of the Conciliation and r-ledges Arbitration Bill, and then voted in favour if of a Government, and also in favour of of including railway men within the operation of the Bill. Now he is prepared to send a Bill to the Senate",49
245,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Whic h includes the railway men, and for which the honour and able member refused to vote.",49
246,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable memto ber is now prepared to send a Bill to Senate which he knows to be a delusion and a sham. The railway men in the orable member's constituency have had to pay for their experience. They have had to contribute to the unions for years, and have sacrificed much to attain the position which they at present occupy, and they expect something more than a mere sham from Parliament. They will know that he is only following the example so determinedly set by his leader ever since he came into public life. I have now done with the honourable member for Macquarie, except to say that he will have a difficulty in explaining why he voted for fixing the a Seat of Government at Dalgety instead of postal at Lyndhurst. When he makes the admission that the! position of Postwas to him far more important than the establishment of the capital at Lyndhurst, they will gauge him at his proper worth. I desire to refer post, to another honourable member who, I am to say, is not present, but for whose absence I am not responsible.",49
247,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not know about,49
248,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I may be responsible for the honourable member's absence, and, of course, he cannot know whether or not he is missing anything of interest. On the This Government side we see the member for Lang, who from both sides of the House mahas lectured the Labour Party often. was I do not want to do that honourable member any injustice, and therefore I shall As a quote from his remarks as reported but in Hansard. I shall not quote all the honourable member has said in reference to the caucus, because to do so would occupy me is till morning. On Hansard, at page 4751, the honourable member for Lang is thus reported- But what is the position of honourable members ? Some of them belong to a party which is goby the caucus, and it does not matter what they may have given to their constituentsj the caucus decides that it is not in the interests the party to keep them, they must break them. That comes from one who has professed to be a democrat in the past-fro m one who has been a member of the Democratic Party for years in the State to which I belong, who, so far from not understanding the labour movement, claims, though not rightly, be the father of that movement. Is the it known to most honourable members that the honourable member for Lang signed the honlabour pledge in 1894, and under that pledge was prepared to run for Parliament? That was not the pledge we have today, but one more stringent by far; and it was signed by the honourable member in his ambition to climb into politics.",49
249,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The . honourable . member for Lang is present now.,50
250,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I never like to speak of a man behind his back. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to meet an opponent face to face. The honourable member for Lang should be the last man to charge the Labour Party with having to act as the caucus may direct. As I say, the honourable member signed the caucus pledge in 1894.",50
251,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The present pledge?,50
252,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; a more stringent pledge.,50
253,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I signed it with a special reservation.,50

261,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is absolutely rect.,50
262,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Further, at that very time every other aspiring land-taxer in South Wales refused to sign that pledge. He did not go into Parliament, in the same way as did the honourable member for Parramatta and others, who were equally as sincere in regard to the land question. They made the single tax the beau ideal of their political religion just as the honourable member for Lang does, although he now sits cheek by jowl with land monopolists. These men were quite able to decide whether they should sign the pledge or not. They refused to sign it. But this self-styled father of the Labour movement considered himself 10 bp better capable of judging than Mr Frank Cotton, Mr '(Gardiner, the honourable member for Parramatta, and a number of others, every one of whom was as sound on the land question as he was. But the position was that the honourable member for Lang was seeking election in a constituency where there was already a free-trade candidate in the field. There could not be two free-trade candidates.",50

272,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am criticising the incorremarks made by the honourable member for Lang, as reported in Hansard, page' 4751. Owing to. the circumstances which New I have explained, the honourable member had to run under some other colours than those of the Free-trade Party. That explains why he signed the pledge, and was prepared to enter the caucus and abide by its decisions. On page 4752 of Hansard the honourable member is reported to have saidOur object in New South Wales was to reduce the Customs duties, and to get rid of all those who were responsible for the Tariff, or who were likely to seek to increase imports under it. So that I was pledged, first of all, to get rid Deakin Government, aad when the opportunity arose He meant to wipe 6ut the protectionists.",50
273,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the interpretation the honourable member puts upon the passage.,51
274,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is the interpretation which the honourable member for Lang puts upon it. During the last week I have been reading with interest some correspondence, which the honourable member for Lang has been so indiscreet as to enter into, in a newspaper in his electorate, as to his attitude with respect to free-trade. As the statements to which I allude are published over his own name, I must accept them as his deliberate opinion. I wish the protectionists to observe what he says. It is evident that the free-traders have made use of the protectionists under the pretence of a truce, not to raise the fiscal question during this Parliament, but they did not hesitate to put out the Deakin Government, in order that they might prepare the way to put in power a free-trade Prime Minister.",51
275,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member helped them.,51
276,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes ; I was pledged to give a certain vote upon a certain proposal, and could not agree to vote in a contrary direction. I could no't humiliate myself and degrade the principles which I had professed, even though my vote involved putting the Government out of office. When this Parliament is dissolved there will be no hesitation on the part of the free-traders in disregarding the truce which has enabled the Prime Minister to take office. They will make war on the principle of protection, as they have always done in New South Wales, where the people, have hitherto believed them to be in earnest. But the New South Wales people are awakening from the delusion under which they have been for so long. They are awakening to the deception practised by some honourable members in this - Parliament-the Prime Minister and free traders and land-taxers supporting him, who are now sitting cheek by jowl with honourable members who are opposed to land taxation and all other forms of .taxation which touch the pockets of the monopolist. These honourable'members will have to answer to their constituents and the people of New South Wales, who are beginning to realise that they have been duped in the past, and will not stand it in the future. There is of the one other element which has exerted great influence in the political history of New South .Wales. Members of . Parliament have not always been returned in that State because )they have supported free-trade. Men have been returned to Parliament in that State because they have degraded the sacred name of religion by dragging it into the political arena. During the Federal elections some good and faithful servants of this Commonwealth were displaced by men who carried the yellow flag. Since that time a State election has taken place, and those who thought that they would sweep the polls and come back with a majority of twenty, have come back with a doubtful majority of two. This gives some indication that the people are realizing that they have been deceived in the past. I trust that' the day is not far distant when no man will dare to drag religion down into the arena of politics in the endeavour to shelter himself beneath a flag which should be emblematic of Christianity and justice. I trust that the time will come when no man will be allowed to enter Parliament on either side merely because he happens to represent a section holding a narticul'ar religious belief. The honourable member for Lang has reason to be proud in this connection, because he was forced to face a gentleman who was put up in the same interest, and who ran under the Protestant Defence Association's nomination ; but there are other honourable members on the other side who were returned by the objectionable influence to which I have referred. There were liberals and reformers who were prepared .to support either side, irrespective of religion, provided they could down a labour man. The Protestant Defence Association put their brand even on a Roman Catholic, in order to down a labour candidate. The honourable member for Lang said that the present Prime Minister was practically bound to vote with the Government, because he had spoken so strongly in favour of the attitude they assumed, and he also thought that all the members of his party would follow him. The honourable member was referring to the Labour Party's anticipations with regard to the vote-that put the Deakin Government out of power. He said that the Prime Minister was bound by some utterances in this House to vote with the Government, as he did on the amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill submitted by the honourable member for Wide Bay. Yet, although-the Prime Minister professes to be a free-trader, and the honourable member for Lang is a free trader, the honourable member thought he could act differently from his leader on the ground that he was under some other bond. ' Mr JOHNSON - I was under no bond.",51
277,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was a bond of honour, if the honourable member pleases, but it was a bond all the same. The honourable member has told us that his strongest pledge was to put the Deakin Government out of office. The honourable member's leader was not pledged to put out the Deakin Government, in order that he might carry out the principles to which the honourable member for Lang was pledged, but he was determined to bring the Labour Party to their knees, and put them out of power if possible. *",52
278,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the pledge of the honourable member's own manufacture. It has no existence in fact.,52
279,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have already shown that it has, by quotations from the honourable member's speeches, and I do not propose to quote from them any more. I have a word to say with respect to the honourable member for Laanecoorie. In speaking on this motion, and dealing with democratic tendencies, and his wonderful ideas of the rights and wrongs of unionists and working men in general, the honourable member made some observations to the effect that as a democrat he was more worthy of support in Laanecoorie than any labour man.",52
280,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I never said anything of the sort.,52
281,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"-That is practically what the honourable member's remarks implied. I can show that the honourable member has not been a consistent advocate of the democratic principles which he now professes. When he was in the State Parliament of Victoria, there was a Bill befoie the Legislative Assembly providing for women's suffrage, and in speaking cn that question, the honourable member made these remarksI hold in my hand a small pamphlet which deals with the female suffrage question. its arguments is that women are entitled to the franchise because they are governed. The same aigument might be applied to the brute creation. They are governed, and, therefore, they ought to have the franchise.",52
282,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is the date of that?,52
283,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was said in the session of 1894.,52
284,Mr HARPER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is a reference to something which was said ten years ago in order ?,52
285,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am replying to the observations of the honourable member for Laanecoorie in connection with his attitude with regard to female suffrage.,52
286,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not think I mentioned it.,52
287,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,r am sure the honourable member mentioned it.,52
288,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am quite"" sure I did not.",52
289,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have at least read the honourable gentleman's statement on the subject. The honourable member was opposed to female suffrage, and in dealing with the argument that women are entitled to the franchise because they are governed, the honourable member said, ""The same argument might be applied to the brute creation. They are governed."" That is a remark which cannot be considered complimentary to the ladies of the Commonwealth. Those who have advocated female suffrage have always done so because women are governed - becaus e they are human beings and are subject to the laws.",52
290,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Can the honourable member connect what he is now saving with the question before the House?,52

294,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I deny that I referred to womanhood suffrage during this debate.,52
295,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I accept the denial of the honourable member, because it is the parliamentary rule to do so, but I know that what I am saying is correct. The honourable member cannot escape, however, from being declared as one of those who are opposed to reform, liberty, justice, and equitable legislation. He is opposed to all those measures which make for the betterment of the people.",52

303,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I full y expected that, sir, and therefore I do not intend to discuss the subject. I propose now to refer to a remark made by the honourable member for Dalley in this debate.",53
304,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Were they unanimous?,53
305,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know. They were unanimous at the meeting which was held, with the exception of the honourable member for Dalley, who did not express any objection to the negotiations. Mr Wir.KS - I was not in favour of the coalition, but I would not join the Labour Party. In the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales the honourable member for Dalley, unpledged, religiously supported most planks in the platform of the Labour Party. In this House he supported the Labour Party on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill up to a certain stage, but when he could not get that which was impracticable, he turned round, and said that for that reason he was prepared to reverse the vote which had kept the Labour Government in office. I regret that by his vote they were put out of office, because he represents what is practically a labour constituency. For the first time he has forgotten the allegiance which he owes to the men who have supported him.",53
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is quite prepared to take the risk.,53
307,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Whil e the honourable member is prepared to take the risk, he will have to explain to the large body of unionists in his electorate, why, because he could not get something which was impossible,- he was not prepared to support that which was practicable. the caucus which was held by the' Opposition members to discuss whether they would join the Deakinites in a coalition, they all agreed to join except the honourable member for Dalley, and he has said nothing. He was waiting. What was he waiting for? [REPRESENTATIVES.] of Confidence. When did he decide to. .throw in his lot with the conservatives? I must compliment the Prime Minister upon having selected a very capable and energetic whip, who fulfils other functions very religiously and faithfully. I should not like to say that the appointment of a whip was delayed for rather a lengthened period, and that after a selection was made, the honourable member for Dalley made up his mind to throw in his lot with the conservatives.",53
308,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did the honourable member think that the honourable member for Dalley would go over to his side? ',53
309,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am only reviewing the circumstances.,53
310,Mr JOSEI,MOTION OF WANT OF,H COOK - There is nothing in that.,53
311,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not suppose that there is. . Whom have the Government sitting behind them? They have behind them the honourable member for Dalley, who has been a radical and liberal.",53
312,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is a better one today than the honourable member.,53
313,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Dalley is abouf as much a radical and liberal as the Postmaster-General is a free-trader. Of course it is only natural for the honourable gentleman to stand by his able successor in the whip-ship. The Government have sitting behind them the honourable member for Dalley, who has fallen from grace, the honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for New England, who are land-t'axers, and the honourable member for Parramatta, who originated the idea of employing only white labour on the mail ships. What a satire it is that the originator of the idea of keeping a White Ocean, so far as our mail service is concerned, should be sitting belli d the right' honourable member for East Sydney, who has declared that he intends to remove the white labour provision from the statute book ! We find sitting behind the Government a motley crowd, comprising all sorts and conditions of men, and representing all sorts and degrees of political doctrine. It is surprising to me lo find that these honourable members ever expected that, with a Government party constituted as this is, they could go back to their constituents as democrats. However, at They must all go back to their constituents as men who have been prepared to oppose the Labour Party, and to join the individualistic party who are for self all the time, and do not care what becomes of the other man. "" The victory to the strong "" is their doctrine all the time. The weak man may go to the wall for aught they care. According to their view, if a man is born weak, he must carry that defect through life; he must pass away if he is not able to keep pace with the strong.",53
314,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member does not know the meaning of the word democracy.,54
315,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Apparentl y I do not know anything. The honourable member knows everything; it is a wonder to me how he holds all he says he knows. This quotation clearly expresses my feelingsLabour is right in despising, as an enemy and a. traitor, any workman who, enjoying the higher standard of wages which union has secured, turns "" scab "" and takes a striker's place. We, on this side, wish to insure by means of the arbitration law that those who have borne the heat and burden of the day, and have fought for and upheld the dignify of labour, shall obtain the rewards which are its right. Then againIn a union the workman has as his own the strength of all his fellows when he asks for ter wages and better treatment. Out of a union the workman has only the strength of a single individual. Honourable members opposite profess to think that it is the non-unionists, those who have clone nothing and contributed nothing, who should reap the rewards which have been gained by unionists at the sacrifice sometimes of their liberties, and even of their lives. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella is absolutely impracticable.",54
316,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,That settles the matter.,54
317,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is my opinion, and I have had more opportunity to study the subject than has the honourable and learned gentleman, who, although he belongs to one of the closest unions in the world, spent his youth in colleges and aca3emies, and knows nothing about hard toil or industrial unionism. Both he and his leader belong to a union whose conditions are more exacting than those of any other in the world. If one of its members dared to work for less than the minimum wage, he would be reported to the Law Institute. It is rarely, nowever, that they work even for the minimum wage. I once read that when. the complaint was made against a lawyer that he had not charged his client enough, he replied, "" I may have been to blame, but I took all that he had."" That is the religion of a lawyer. honourable gentlemen who have the privilege of taking from their clients all that they possess, for services the value of which is. questionable, refuse to the common toilers in our factories, our workshops, and our streets, to the men who are building up this great - Commonwealth, even a small proportion of the privileges which they enjoy.'",54
318,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member's leader said that the principle of preference was not in question.,54
319,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not responsible for anyone's utterances but my own. Here is another extractWhen battling in defence of the union principle, labour battles for higher wages, shorter hours, and everything' that separates the free worker from the serf. Is not that a noble ambition for labour to have? For giving up the right to strike, which, though a barbarous weapon, is labour's only protection against oppression, some return is expected. Honourable members opposite, however, would put the non-unionist on the same level as the unionist, and by allowing the non-unionist to get for bet- nothing what the unionist has toiled and fought for, all incentive to progress would be taken away from the latter. The honourable member for Richmond referred to commercial Socialism. He at one time represented in the State Parliament an electorate in which a railway was subsequently constructed, which has not yet paid interest on its cost",54
320,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I remember that the honourable member for Richmond referred to the matter, and that I prevented him from proceeding, on the ground that it was outside the scope of the motion. Therefore, it would be unfair if I allowed the honourable member to refer to it.",54
321,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Ver y good, Mr. Speaker. The Prime Minister stated that what is involved in the management of our railways' is commercialism, not Socialism. Let us see to what lengths this has been carried in the country of the stars and stripes. Baron Rothschild has refused to grant to his men, who are working upon the underground_ railways, in New York, a sufficient wage to enable them to support themselves decently. And yet he has paid 5,000 dollars for a flea.' This cormorant, this millionaire, who is the result of an individualistic system, this outcome of the growth of the system advocated by honourable members opposite, is not willing to Yet these pay his men a decent wage. This man, who is grinding his millions out of the sweat and toil of the poor, invests some of Motion of Want [REPRESENTATIVES.] his money in buying fleas. In the newspaper I hold in my hand he is pictured with a flea under the microscope. I do not the object of his investigation, but perhaps he is endeavouring to discover why the flea bites rich and poor alike-why it Socialist, and no respecter of persons. position, summed up, is this: We cannot express our confidence in the Government. Why? Because they belong to the party of retrogression, and have no definite policy, and no definite principles. They are a lot, which it is absolutely impossible to deSouth Wales. scribe. They belong to the monopolistic party, and represent all that and opposed to progress, all the forces of the employers' unions and other organizadistinctly tions which are bound together with the object of bringing about the humiliation the Labour Party, so that they may be able to again prey upon the workers, as they have done in the past. It is an honour belong to the minority upon this side rather than to the majority upon the other side of the Chamber, constituted as it is. The Prime Minister has nothing to be proud tation. of. in view of the fact that he is holding office by the aid of the vote of one man who spurns him and heaps contumely and ridition cule upon him because he has no policy such as he has indicated by his public speeches. The right honourable gentleman is prepared to cling to office like a parasite. If Sir Henry Parkes had been spoken to in the way that the Prime Minister was addressed by the honourable member for Wilmot, he would have told him to go the further, that he did not want' his vote, that he would not hang on to office by aid of his support. The cost of a dissoletter lution would scarcely be worth considering in comparison with the humiliation to which the Commonwealth is being subjected by the action of .the Prime Minister.' So far honourable members generally are concerned, the question whether or not they remain this Parliament is not one of much concern, because if we are not here others to Ininform will be. But if we lower the dignity of this institution, and place at the head of the rickville Government a man who has no respect for He ballot-papers, the high and responsible position he occuthe pies, the country will lose more by far than would be represented by the paltry expenAs diture incurred in making an appeal country, and enabling the people to send to this House men whom they could underafter stand, some one with a policy, men conable sistent and honest, and determined to fight for the liberties of the people.

I should not have taken the trouble to contradict the statement, coming as it did from the honto orable member, but for the fact that other endeavours of a similar character have been made to drag my private affairs into politics, with a view to damage my political repuI am glad to say that I am in a position to give the honourable member's statement a complete denial. By interjec- during another portion of the honourable member's speech, I find that I have done the honourable member a grave injustice. I said that at the State election for the district of Marrickville, in New South Wales, in 1898, he had polled only six votes. I find that the number was nine. The honourable member, when I referred to matter, told me that I was distinctly misand leading, because he had withdrawn from the the contest on that occasion. I have here a from the returning officer at that election, which will show that the honourable member's memory is not in accordance with the facts. rThe letter was written by Mr. as Robert Anderson, who was the returning officer at Marrickville in 1898, is dated 9th in July, 1904, and is as follows:reply to your letter of the 5th inst., I beg you that Mr Webster did not retire from being a candidate for the electorate of Marat the general elections, 27th July, 1898. was duly nominated, his name appeared on and he received nine (9) votes. I enclose the result of the polling. affording further evidence that the honto the orable member's memory must be extremely defective, I need only sav that the declaration of the poll, the ""honormember addressed a multitude of 2,000 people, which, presumably, included the nine persons who voted for him. I do not propose to detain the Houseany further. I wish to reiterate my explanation, and deny the soft impeachment as to as the £1,500. I desire to make full reparathat he was. tion to the honourable member for having minimized the great vote which was cast his favour in the Marrickville election 1898. But I would remind him of the time when he contested an election upon his own merits, and not in am the interests of a party. The honorLang able member distinctly stated that he tired from that election. I think I shall in order in repeating that he did not retire, although I am, of course, willing to believe that his memory is at fault when he states that he did; and that when the honourable able member for Gwydir. member was not standing under the a?gis of the Labour Party, but on his own merits, he established a marvellous record by securing nine votes when seeking to become the representative of Marrickthe ville.",55
325,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the course of his rethe enfranchisement of women. marks, the honourable member for Gwydir made certain misstatements respecting a pledge which I am alleged to have signed. As the honourable member is aware-because I have already explained this - the pledge which I signed upon the occathe sion referred to, was not identical the Federal labour pledge. Moreover, the platform upon which I stood at that time was an absolute free-trade one, made an express reservation that in. the event of my being called upon to vote against my free-trade principles I should sign my seat. Several other misstatements made by the honourable member, but I shall deal with them upon another occasion, I shall have an opportunity of referring them, and also to some of his extraordinary political somersaults.",56
326,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I also desire to make a personal explanation. Whilst the honnence orable member was addressing the House I made an interjection, and also a ment, the accuracy of which he denied.",56
327,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I accepted it.,56
328,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member was careful to qualify his acceptance my denial in a way that is easily underI stood by honourable members. I have careof the argument. fully gone through my speech, and I find that he was guilty of misleading the House and of misrepresenting me - He stated twice that he was - referring to a matter which he alleged introduced whilst I was addressing myself to this motion. I have gone through I speech very carefully, and I now ask him an honourable man to produce the proof",56
329,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I permitted the honin orable member for Wentworth to go in beyond the limits of a personal explanation, because he had not previously Spoken, and - was entitled to speak. I not sure that the honourable member for' did not also exceed the limits ot a repersonal explanation; but the honourable be member for Laanecoorie must see that if he proceeds upon the lines he is pursuing, he will not be making a personal explanation, but replying to the remarks of the honorI t is not in order to speak a second time to reply to a speech by another honourable member.",56
330,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member also quoted from a speech which I made in Legislative Assembly of Victoria some ten years ago, and which had reference to In doing so I hold that he misrepresented me, and I desire to place myself right before rhis House and the country. In answer to my - interrogation, he said that I made that matter speech in 1894. I believe it was second speech delivered by me during with my parliamentary career. The honourable member made it appear that I was an out-and-out opponent of woman suffrage. and I Had he been fair he would have quoted that part of it in which I stited that I approached the motion relating to reit with an open mind. But instead he conwere veyed the impression that I had stated that because the brutes were governed, they when were as much entitled to a vote as were to the women. That is an absolute misrepresentation of my remarks. At the time. I was dealing with an argument which had been advanced by the advocates of the motion, and one to which very great promihad been given. In fact, some honourable members were prepared to base their statewhole support of that motion upon the argument that because women were governed they should have a vote. It was then that I used a ridiculous analogy to of show how utterly absurd was that argument. went on to say that I denied the premises",56
331,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I read that statement. Mr ,SALMON - The 'honourable member may have read it, but in introducing a matter which was quite .foreign to the I debate he misrepresented me. I therefore desire to put upon record my explanation, my and also the statement that upon every subsequent occasion when the question of woman suffrage came, before the Victorian Parliament I supported the reform and voted for it.",56
332,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Wentworth has declared that I received only nine votes when I was a candidate for the electorate of Marrickville, and that I did not retire from the contest. I desire to say that I knew the returning officer for that district would not permit me to retire after I had once been nominated. Consequently it would have been idle for me to have intimated to him that I intended to retire. Nevertheless, the fact remains that upon polling day I attended my work, some seven miles distant, and also recorded my vote in favour of another candidate. During that day the candidates who went to the poll were very careful to inform all my supporters that I had retired. For all practical purposes, I repeat that I did retire from that contest.",57
333,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not a single advertisement was published notifying the honourable member's retirement.,57
334,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Not being a man means, I had no money to throw away upon advertising. Concerning the observations of the honourable member for Lang, who says that he signed a pledge",57
335,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF,This is endless repetition.,57
336,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wish again to point out that there is a vast difference between a personal explanation and a reply to allegations; The honourable member is going beyond the limits of a personal explanation, and is replying to a speech. The Standing Orders expressly set out that no explanation can be discussed. I must therefore ask the honourable member not to exceed the limits of a personal explanation.",57
337,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The fact remains that the honourable member for Lang signed a pledge.,57
338,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is an answernot a personal explanation.,57
339,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not wish to make a reply, but Mr/SPEAKER - That is exactly what the! honourable member is doing, and exactly what he may not do. If he is making a personal explanation concerning something he has said or done he is in order, but if is explaining something which the honourable member for Laanecoorie has said, or making some statement as to some pledge which that honourable member signed, he is replying, and not making a personal explanation, and is, therefore, out of order.",57
340,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not wish to be unfair to the honourable member for Laanecoorie. .,57
341,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member wish to make a personal 'explanation?,57
342,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I desire to say that if I have done the honourable member for Laanecoorie an injustice, I have done so unintentionally. I quoted from Hansard words which, in my opinion, bore the construction which I placed upon them. If the honourable member says that, by the construction and interpretation which I placed upon his words, I have done him an injustice, I apologize and withdraw anything that I may have said.",57
343,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF," I believe that on one occasion I exceeded the limits 1 of a three hours' speech. To-night I have listened to a speech for four hours or more; and I humbly apologize to the House for my own offence, the enormity of which has been brought home to me. At the present time, throughout the country, there is no of doubt much reflection cast on the House on account of the length of our discussions. It seems to me, however, that if the people would only consider, they might take a great deal of comfort to themselves - This is the only Australian Parliament for many years past which has sat for seven months, and has not by any law it has passed added to the cost of administration, or deprived anybody of a portion of his earnings. That fact is unique, in the history of latter day Australian Parliaments, and one over which we may very well rejoice. I am not one who complains of the want of legislation in this House. It appears to me we are only too faithfully reflecting the indecision of the electors, as shown in December last, when they were unable to make up their minds as to which policy should be pursued. Although three separate lines of policy we're placed before them, the electors were unable to definitely decide in favour of any; and the result is seen in the three parties within this Chamber. One is very greatly surprised to hear members of the Labour Party-though , I am thankful to say, not members of the late Ministryhe complaining that the late Government had not a fair chance. If the late Government desired one provision more than another in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, if was preference to unionists; and on that issue the Government were distinctly' defeated. I cannot understand, therefore, why there should be: any complaint from that Government because they had to resign office. No one can pretend that there is a majority in this House in favour of giving a preference to unionists unless it is clear that the whole of the workers connected with a particular industry is in favour of such a step. All this talk about want of fair play to the late Government is, under the circumstances, very surprising. Challenge after challenge was issued by the late Government to the then Opposition to meet them in the House; and that course was taken, and the Government were defeated. Every honourable member was allowed to make only one speech, and not two or three ; and 1 that was the reason the Government were challenged in the House. The course pursued placed some limitation on the debate, and confined members to the particular motion before us. However, all this has been dealt with before, and I shall not go fully into it again. It is also surprising that, in the course of this long debate, we have heard nothing but whimpering and complaining because certain forms of the House were followed. If honourable members do not agree with those forms they may be altered. We are asked now to show by our votes whether we support the present Ministry, and it is perfectly clear that if we do not there must be a dissolution. Two parties in the House have already been exhausted, and a third party is now on trial. It is the duty of all of us to prevent, i sible, a dissolution, not merely on personal grounds, which, of course, and rightly, have a great deal of weight, but especially because that course would involve the country in an expenditure of something like £60,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Sufficien t to make a substantial addition to our salaries.",57
344,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The cost of a general election would be quite enough to give 60,000 working families provisions for a month, though that is a point the Labour Party appear to have forgotten. I assert that we have every right to try to prevent a dissolution. The present Government and honourable members on both sides have had to give up, not their principles, but the assertion of their principles for the time being. They have had to recognise, as we always must recognise in legislation, that unless there is a distinct majority on one side in favour of a certain line of policy, that policy ought not to be pursued, though other classes of legislation, on which a majority do agree, ought to be passed. 1 should have liked to deal with other subjects, but I understand that many honoiable members are desirous that the debate shall close this evening, and, in order to give the leader of the Opposition an opportunity to address the House, and have his remarks reported, I shall confine myself to stating that at the present time it seems absurd to plunge the country'into the turmoil of a general election. It. is especiallyridiculous when we remember that, supposing a similar House were returned, the Senate might deal with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and so alter it that this House would not be able to accept it. That would mean another dissolution. Whatever our feelings may be with regard to the lines of policy to be pursued-and nobody on either side can feel satisfied when he does not see his own ideas carried out-w e can have no hesitation in recording our votes against the motion. While I do not pretend that this Ministry has my full confidenceor, indeed, that any Ministry, of which I was not a member myself, could have my full confidence- I shall feel no hesitation in voting against the motion.",58
345,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Capricornia). - After three weeks of debate I do not know that it is necessary for me to contribute any remarks. Enough has been said to "" chuck out "" half-a-dozen Governments. So far as I am concerned I only wish to let those on the other side know how If posshall vote. I do not pretend to be like the honourable member for Wilmot; but I believe that I am the last speaker in the debate, except the leader of the Opposition. I am rather reluctant to give a vote which might plunge the country into an expenditure of £60,000. That is not so much on account of the other Statesit is my own State I feel for. We know' that since Queensland joined the Federation she has had deficits every year. Therefore I do not desire that my State should be involved in an extra expenditure of £10,000 or £12,000 on account of a general election. But at the same time. I must cast my vote against this iniquitous Government. I do not hesitate to say how I am going to vote, as the harlequin from Tasmania did. It appears now that the present Government is to remain in office for some time longer. The present position of affairs has been brought about largely by the action of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He was anxious, as he explained, to do away with a state of ' things which left us with "" three elevens in the field."" Well, there are two parties in politics now. He has succeeded to that extent. The liberal protectionists have come over to the side of progress and liberty, and he has left thefiscal-issue-sinkrngprotectionists with the free-trade supporters of the Government. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat is responsible for the present situation in more senses than one. When he went out of office he put the Labour Party into power through his own action. He .told us last night that he expected either the Labour Party or the Free-trade Party to make overtures to him in order that, a coalition Government might be formed. But that was not done, and the result was that the Labour Party were driven out of office, and the present Government came into power. The Arbitration Bill has already wrecked two Governments, and may wreck a third. The object of that measure is to put an end to such disastrous trial conflicts as have occurred in the past. We are aware of the strikes which took place in 1891 and 1894, and cost Australia hundreds of thousands of pounds. But in consequence of the action of the traitors on the Government side, who pretended to be the friends of the workers, the Bill has been made absolutely ineffective. I have nothing to say against the Prime Minister personallv. As a private gentleman I do not think there is a better man in the Australian States. But I oppose him politically. I regret the language which he used concerning the honourable and learned member for Corio, which was a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Some of his language has been erased from Hansard, but I heard it myself, and I think that the leader of a great party holding the position that the right honourable gentleman occupies ought to set an example to the House and to the country in that respect. I am new to political life, but I must say that never before have I listened to such a lot of trash and rubbish as has been trotted out by honourable members on both sides of the House in the course of this debate.",58
346,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,On the Ministerial side?,59
347,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I say by honourable members on both sides advisedly. I do not condemn the Ministerial side only in this respect. do not think that some of the language that has been used was becoming in honourable members of long experience. Much has been said concerning protection and free-trade in the course of the debate. The honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable member for North Sydney have not spoken during this debate for fear that they should make some mistake in connection with the protectionist supporters of the Government. The Labour Party have been classified as "" fiscal atheists."" It has been said that we have no fiscal faith. That cannot be said of me. I stand as a protectionist today, and intend to use every opportunity that occurs to forward the cause of protection. But, at the same timej I am a labour man first, and a protectionist second. I believe that protection is the natural policy for labour to pursue. Without protection wages cannot be kept up, nor can hours of labour be kept down. The policy of the trade unions in this country is to keep up wages and to keep down hours of work. That indus- is what they are formed for. If we are not prepared to protect the workers of this country against the cheap manufactures and the cheap labour of other countries, it is of no use to have trade unions. We have passed an Act prohibiting the immigration of coloured aliens. What is the use of passing such measures if the goods produced by coloured aliens in other parts of the world can be dumped down in Australia and be sold here in competition with goods produced by trade union labour ? But while our position is a consistent one, it is difficult to understand the position of the^supporters of the Government. For instance, the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is, in my view, a free-trade fanatic. Yet he supports a Government whose Minister of Customs has imposed a 40 per cent, duty on harvesters imported into Australia. .Why does not the honourable and learned member ask the Minister a question on that subject ?",59
348,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Surely that is not correct. The honourable member would not allow the Minister .to break the law ?,59
349,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is correct. I intend to cast my vote on all occasions to increase protection"" on Australian industries. It shall never be said that I am a fiscal atheist. Throughout my election campaign I said that I was a protectionist, and I stand on that platform today. I Mr JOHNSON - What , then, becomes of the alliance?",59
350,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We are charged with being Socialists. I did not know that I was a Socialist .until, as a member of the Labour Party, I was recently taxed with it. If Socialism is going to benefit the people, and to .do what the Labour Party is endeavouring to do, I am a Socialist right down to the ground. Further, I have no hesitation in saying that nearly every man in this country is a Socialist. When they advocate State railways, schools, water conservation, and fifty other similar things, there can be no doubt that they are Socialists. I am content to be called a Socialist. Honourable members opposite may, if they please, tack that name on to me, and I am prepared to carry it anywhere in Australia. When reference is made to the alliance on this side, I must say that the protectionist members on the opposite side look as lonely as a bandicoot on a burnt ridge. I have no doubt that the vituperative speeches which have been made by some of them, and by free-trade members on the other side, have done more to solidify the alliance with the liberal-prowill tectionists than anything else that could be mentioned. Protectionist members opposite cannot any longer hope that those on this side will join them. They will certainly have to come over to this side, after the speeches which have been made by the free traders and free-tiade-protectionists on the other side. My greaf objection to honourable members opposite arises from the opposition they have shown to the Labour Party. They have, at bun scrambles and social gatherings, availed themselves of every opportunity to denounce the Labour Party. They have said that we are going to destroy the trade and commerce of Australia. That is the way in which they talk to people who know no better. It is a scandalous misstatement, and, unfortunately, the men who make it, know that it is not true. Our object is to make the country better than it is. We are told that we have no stake in the country. What do honourable members opposite mean when they say that we have no stake in the country ? I can speak for myself; I have a wife and ten children, and I consider that they represent a greater stake in the country than all the money in the banks, and all the shares and property in Australia. Human beings are of more importance than wealth. The stake of honourable members opposite is wealth, whilst our stake in the country is human beings. The anxiety displayed by honourable members opposite at the progress of the Labour Party is 'due to their belief that it may result in decreased dividends. That is what they have in mind. That is just the cry that was raised in olden times by the people who. were sweaters of human beings, who worked women and little children in coal mines, and in insanitary factories. When the first steps were taken to alter the conditions of the people in those times, the cry was raised that those who employed them were going to be ruined. Sympathetic legislators, however, were successful in carrying laws which improved the conditions of the workers, and no matter what honourable members opposite may strive to do, they will be unable to sweep back the tide of progress. The onward march of Socialism cannot be checked by the right honourable member for East Sydney, or by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. The people of Australia are determined to improve the conditions of the workers. The great anxiety on the other side is that the workers' conditions be improved, and that they will in future get more of what they produce than they have hitherto received. I say, in conclusion, that in my opinion the time is not far distant when honourable members opposite will be cast into oblivion by the votes of the people.",59
351,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF," I am, sorry that this debate has taken longer than some of us anticipated that it would. It must be apparent to any unprejudiced observer that the Government can have derived but very little satisfaction from the speeches even of most of the honourable members who have spoken from their own side of the House. At most it can only have been the very negative satisfaction of finding that it is possible that an infinitesimal majority will enable them to retain their'places on the Treasury bench. The position that we on this side took up was that the present Government had in the first place declared no tangible programme, and in the second place had done no more than indicate, so far as their speeches were an indication, that their administration would be against the spirit of the legislation that this Parliament had been engaged in passing for some time previously. How have those who have spoken in support of the Government attempted to meet that position? They have professed to meet it by ejecting a cloud as the octopus does, in order to cover their own deficiencies, and transferring the attack to the alliance programme. There has been, no attempt on the part of honourable members opposite to justify what they have dignified by the name' of a programme. There has not been even the mildest pretence that it constitutes a policy. All their efforts have been directed to discrediting the position taken up by those in opposition. It seems to me that the electors will require a much stronger justification than has so far been given before they will be content with the political views of the honourable gentlemen who make up the present Administration. The Prime Minister stated that it was a singular thing that my speech in attack contained no reference to the programme of the alliance. I contend that in present circumstances we on this side of the House are under no obligation to put a programme before the country. That obligation certainly lies upon those who are charged with the administration of public affairs. is for them to indicate clearly, distinctly, and without reservation not only what is their programme for the few remaining weeks or months of the present session, but what they propose to do in the immediate future. If they are competent to lead not only this House but Australia, surelv the electors have a right to know to what kind of programme honourable gentlemen opposite are committed, and seek to commit the electors of Australia? So far as we are concerned, while, as I say, there is no obligation upon us to put a programme before the electors, we have, nevertheless acted in the most frank and open manner with House and with the people of Australia. There has been no concealment about our actions, or about the programme which resulted from the conference between the different members on the Opposition side of the House. No matter how long it may take for its accomplishment, no matter though it may occupy more than-one session, the programme is there. Of course I do not say that that is all that will engage the attention of the alliance.",60
352,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Nobod y is committed to it.,61
353,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I state distinctly that the alliance is committed to it , and our honourable friends on the other side need not hug the sweet delusion that the alliance is going to break into a thousand pieces, despite all their hopes in that direction. They will be bitterly disappointed at the solidarity of the honourable members who sit on this side. They will find that there is a community of nrinciple",61
354,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is it - A or P> ?,61
355,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"There is a parrot-like trait about honourable members on the other side, who persistently reiterate what they think are magic letters- A and B. I would invite them to devote their attention to. the wide discrepancy-to which I shall allude presently-betwee n the Prime Minister and some of those who are associated with him, as to what their position is at the present time. There is a community of principle amongst those who sit on this side of the Hquse. We are at one in recognising the right of the community to interfere on behalf of the poor and oppressed, and in desiring to remove grievances which are remediable by legislation. That principle obtains in its fulness on this side of the House, and it will be the guiding line of thought and action that will keep toIt gether the members of the alliance.",61
356,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is the same on this side.,61
357,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable member mean to say that his individualistic ideas can be so stretched as to allow the State to interfere between capital and labour, to intervene in the conduct of industry ? Will ' the honourable and learned member for Parkes stretch his individualistic ideas to that extent?",61
358,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Certainl y not.,61
359,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,""" Certainly not,"" says an honest man.",61
360,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,He may have an opinion as to which is best. this Mr WATSON - There are no halfmeasures about the political programme of the honourable and learned member. We know where he is all the time.,61
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What a great admiration the honourable member has developed for the honourable and learned member lately.,61
362,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I-hav e never concealed my admiration for a straight-out opponent. I expressed it when Ave first arrived here. - Mr Wilks - The honourable member takes him as a shocking example.,61
363,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Fro m my point of view, the honourable and learned member is a shocking example as a politician, but still one can appreciate an honourable member who has some idea of what he is aiming a: in politics, and who acts consistently in support of his view. The Prime Minister twitted me with having taken office after having declared some months previously that the Labour Party did not desire to sit on the Treasury bench, unless they were sure of the support of a majority in favour of .the principles of the labour platform. It is quite true that I made that remark, but I "" too well "" organized. would remind the right honourable gentleman and the country that a very great deal has happened since that time. It is true that there has not been in all respects change in the principles or opinions as expressed by the right honourable gentleman, but there was no prospect when those remarks that he would come into office. There was no prospect then that he would have an opportunity to carry out and-by. that which he had declared to be his inmember tention a month previously. He then that if he had the power he would abrogate the legislation on which this liament had been engaged. At that the honourable and learned member for Baland larat was Prime Minister, and the members of the Labour Party were not anxious to depose him. They were quite satisprotectionists fied that he should remain in office, and ment. were prepared to assist him in passing legislation which they conceived to be in did. the interests of the country. But the present position is quite different. We aware what his hopes were. have in office a right honourable gentleman who has declared that the very breath of his existence depends upon the destruction of the party which I have had the honour to lead for some time. He says ha« thrown himself right across the path of learned member's speech. the Labour Party. He declares open war against us, and he now blames us because we are prepared to resist the tender attenporarily tions which he promised us in that way. imagine that we should be something more than human if we failed to resent, not only actions, but expressed intentions of that description. I have no fear as to result when the war commences, because, after all, what is clone here is only affair of outposts. When we get before the country rhe battle will begin, and so his party. soon as that occurs there isverv little doubt as to the position which the right honourable gentleman will occupy. Even the honorthem. able member for Robertson said the other evening, ""The other side are too well ganized ; we must not have a dissolution."" He is aware that the feeling of the country is against the present Ministry, and he not desire a dissolution.",61
364,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I said nothing of the kind.,62
365,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member said that we on this side were too well ganized.,62
366,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not say that honourable members on the other side were,62
367,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member said that we on this side were too well organized, and that, therefore, it would not a be wise to have a dissolution.",62
368,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I said that in some of the States we should sweep the polls I made when we were organized.,62
369,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member will find out the feeling of the country byFrom the honourable and learned for Ballarat last evening we had a said history of the negotiations which have taken place, and the events which have Parhappened since this Parliament met.

I But while I do not complain of the general tone of the speech, I was a little disappointed in it, for this reason: The honourable and learned member well knew that the the feeling which had prompted him to make a vital matter of the amendment for an the inclusion of the public servants was operating with all the other leading men in",62

373,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Wit h nearly all of Surely, then, he' did not expect that I should go to ex-Ministers or to other ormembers of his party who had considered that question so important that they had been ready to cast in their fortunes with does those of the honourable and learned member rather than accept the amendment. I do not conceive that I could have done anything of the sort. Neither would I have been justified in agreeing, and in asking colleagues chosen from my own party to oragree, to sink our opinions on the subject in order that honourable members of the Deakin party might be asked to join my Administration. It seemed to me at the time-and this explains the remarks which I made to the Herald reporter, published the n t h May, which the honourable and learned member quoted last night-quit impossible that there should be any official fusion of his party with the Labour Party at that time, in view of the fact that were pledged to the electors in regard to the question at issue in exactly opposite ways, and could neither of us retrace our steps. How could I then ask the members of the Deakin Party, unless it were some of those who had voted with me",62
374,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who suggested the honourable member should ?,63
375,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and not learned member for Ballarat - If the right honourable member had been here last night, he would have heard that statement. always regarded the members of the Procontrolled, tectionist Party, or most of them, notwithstanding the presence among them of the amiable but rather conservative representathen tive for Swan, as the natural allies Labour Party, and I think that the greater number of the members of the Labour Party, including myself, were always pared to work heartily with them. all through, we showed that in our actions, during the early history of this Parliament.",63
376,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; but not after our defeat.,63
377,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Oh , no. I have just explained why I could not ask the memprogramme. bers of the Deakin party to join my Administration at that period.",63
378,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear. quite agree with the' honourable member.",63
379,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member - for Ballarat that the Labour Party took no step towards an alliance up to the 17th May.,63
380,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Late r than that. It about the 27th. On the 17th the honorof able member declined.,63
381,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As I understood the honourable and learned member, he comsaying. plained that nothing was done by the Labour Party.",63
382,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did not complain, but stated that nothing was done.",63
383,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member seemed rather disappointed that nothing was done.,63
384,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think that it would been more advantageous if the proposals for an alliance had been made then.,63
385,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It might have been. But in view of the fact that each of us was compelled by circumstances to insist upon on his own views in regard to the 'Arbitration Bill, it was not to be expected that an immee diate attempt at an alliance would be successful. But before the 17th, when our party met to consider the question, the we honourable and learned member had proceeded a very great distance in his negotiations with the right honourable member for East Sydney, so that the impression naturally got abroad that all was arranged, and that the political wedding of these two interesting young people was only a matter of a few days. that The honourable and learned member last night seemed disappointed that more did come from his invitation at that particular stage. If so. he was prepared to ally himself, or see his party allied, with I those whom he now contends were worked, and governed by the machine. - The machine, whatever its virtues or defects may be. was iust as strong and effective as now. No change whatever has been of the made in that connection.",63
386,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,No r will be made.,63
387,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,No r will be made in prethe immediate future. Goodness only Taken knows what will come by-and-by.,63
388,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I had already pointed out, when I asked for overtures, that it would be necessary for arrangements to be imade to get rid of the machine, so far as the alliance was concerned, and to amend the",63
389,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am not aware that there was anv condition. I Mr DEAKIN - I imposed no condition upon the honourable member- I could not do so-bu t I said what our condition of complained acceptance would be.,63
390,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Quite so. But I was not aware that the honourable and learned was gentleman had laid down any condition acceptance on his part, other than that there must be an arrangement by which the two parties would not ,assault each other. That, of course, would have gone without No alliance can be \yprked upon any other basis. That seems to ine to rob of its point all the criticism which we I have had about the immunity from mutual attack, to which the members of the present alliance are committed. An alliance would not be worthy of the name if its members did not agree to stand by each other when have confronted by the common enemy. I think that that goes without saying. So far as machinery is concerned, I have no intense admiration for any party machine. admit frankly that I have never looked upon party machines as, at the best, anything better than expedients. It is only because we are compelled, like every other party, to use a machine that we must have some organization if we are to be successful. It seems to me that it savours of ""Satan reproving sin"" for honourable members on the other side of the House to be continually talking about the machine of the Labour Party, whilst they, just as carefully, ancl as effectively as may be, use a machine themselves on - all possible occasions, and regret, of course, its comparative ineffectiveness. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, when speaking last evening, brought his historical resume to a close at what seemed to me to be the most interesting point. We heard a great deal as to the position taken up by the different parties. A ll details were given up to the point at which the present Prime Minister was sent for by the Governor General, but with regard to what took place after that, silence was preserved. I do not know whether the honourable and learned member had no more information to give to the House and to the country, but it certainly would be interesting to know exactly what were the negotiations which led to the formation, of the present Ministry, and. above all, upon what understanding that Ministry existsif there is an understanding at all.",63
391,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member knows everything that I know.,64
392,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am surprised to hear that, but if that is so the country at least has the right to know a great deal more than it is aware of at present.",64
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,It knows everything. The whole of the facts have been published in the newspapers.,64
394,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman has evidently been asleep. He is a sort of political Rip van Winkle. He has evidently forgotten, if he ever knew, or if he has been awake all the time, that there has been an express disavowal on the part of the Ministry and their supporters of the May agreement-the agreement arrived at tentatively between the present Prime Minister and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.",64
395,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Some of them only have disavowed it.,64
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Prime Minister has said that he will respect it. 6 I Mr WATSON - The Prime Minister said, at Ballarat, that the coalition was going to work on the lines of that agreement; but the Prime Minister stated on the occasion of my accepting the commission of the Governor General to form a Ministry, that I had no right to take office without being first assured that I had a majority of members behind me; that I had no right to mislead the Governor General, or to run the risk of misleading him, by taking office without a distinct and definite assurance that I had a majority of honourable members behind me.",64
397,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the constitutional usage.,64
398,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That was the position taken up by the Prime Minister on 27th April. Did the right honourable gentleman in this instance obtain any assurance that he had a majority of honourable members' behind him? Did he have any assuranceother than the natural assurance that we all possess in a greater or lesser degree-an y promise from, or understanding with, any honourable members as to the position which he and his new Government would occupy ? We have the declaration of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that the agreement was never ratified by his party, and we have also heard the honourable member for Laanecoorie state that there is no understanding of which he is aware. The honourable member for Echuca, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and the honourable member for Moira have also stated that there was no understanding of which they knew, and no arrangement. If that is so, then we assume what I can hardly believe, that the Prime Minister, in spite of the declaration made by him in regard to my position, in spite of the high-souled patriotism which we know him to possess, and which would certainly influence him upon an occasion of this description, dispensed with any such assurance. He must have had some understanding. I do not say that he has an understanding with those honourable members who have denied it, but some understanding must exist with other honourable members. If so, the country is entitled to know what it is.",64
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is an intuitive understanding.,64
400,Mr WAT,MOTION OF WANT OF,"SON - Some telepathic influences have been at work perhaps, but we are not accustomed here to deal in intuitions, and I think that we are justified in. assuming that there was something definite and tangible that should have been given to the country in a clear and candid manner. The Prime Minister was utterly disgusted with my attitude on behalf of the Opposition, because I did not clearly and definitely state our proposals; but it seems to me that he is quite content to allow the country to remain in ignorance of the understanding upon which he took office. I cannot conceive that honourable members, with the records of the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Treasurer, and the Minister of Defence, would enter the Ministry without a clear and distinct understanding as to what their positions were to be, and as to what were to be the positions of those for whom they stood. The honourable and learned' member for Ballarat stated last night that he had every confidence in the honourable members of .his party who had joined the Ministry. Because of their presence he looked forward, if not with fulsome hope,' at any rate, with some degree of equanimity, to the performances of the present Ministry.",64
401,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Bu the would not take a position in the Ministry himself.,65
402,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not wish to comment upon that. It seems to me that only a negative kind of satisfaction is to be rived by the right honourable gentleman, because, in the absence of any declaration the Government that they are going to announce their policy, and as to the kind of policy it will be when it is announced, the most he can hope is that the protectionist members of the Government will occasionally put the brake on, and that nothing will be done of which he would not approve. That is the most for which he can hope from these gentlemen in the absence of an understanding or declaration as to what is to be done.",65
403,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member stated in January last that he would insist upon a definite agreement.,65
404,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am sorry, in the interests of the public, that the honourable ancl learned member has not insisted upon that. Now, there is another point. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat last evening contended that all the credit for labour legislation does not lie with the Labour Party, especially in Victoria. Well, I admit frankly that Victoria was considerably ahead of other States for years in the matter of factories legislathrough tion. We protectionists in New South Wales used to say that that was because there were factories in Victoria, while there were none in our own State.",65
405,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,But free-traders used to say that protection caused the necessity for the legislation.,65
406,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps so; but in any case I admit that Victoria led the way in Australia before the existence of the Labour Party in any of the States. I , for one, have never claimed that the Labour Party have initiated all that is good ,in legislation. What I. have claimed is that in the States that were backward the Labour Party acted as a spur to the older political parties, and forced their hands., with the result that the electors got legislation which otherwise they would not have got for many years, if at all. But even in Victoria the creation of wages boards was, I think, largely due to the influence of the Labour Party.",65
407,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Labour - Party supported wages boards, but we endeavoured to obtain them unsuccessfully at an earlier period.",65
408,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not wish for one moment to rob a gentleman with the record of the honourable and learned member, or to rob other honourable members, of de- the credit due to them in this connection.",65
409,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was making no claim, from but merely replying to what I thought was unfair criticism.",65
410,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have never made any criticism of that character. In regard i.o the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the honourable and lenrned member for Ballarat stated last night that he had only voted twice in favour of alterations of the Bill as originally introduced.",65
411,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,I was speaking from memory.,65
412,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have not had time today to look over the records of the divisions, but I am quite willing, from my knowledge of the honourable and learned member, to accept that statement.",65
413,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I made the calculation up to a certain date, and gave it to the House, but there were one or two divisions afterwards about which' I was not sure.",65
414,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The point of the criticism which I levelled against .the honourable member was not so much in regard to the active opposition that he showed to his own measure, as to the absence of that assistance towards carrying the Bill which I think we had a right to expect from him.",65
415,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,I spoke against almost all the members on my own side on several bad clauses. occasions.,66
416,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Wit h all respect, I think we were entitled to expect more help from the honourable and learned member regard to this particular measure. In moving the second reading of the Bill , the cies from the original Bill . honourable and learned member bestowed upon it every eulogy of which with his oratorical ability he was capable. When, however, it came into Committee care of the late Government, the honourable and learned member's attitude became sethe employer. verely judicial. On many occasions, when this Bill was assailed by secret and open enemies, it could have been triumphantly carried through if we had had the warm stances. assistance of the honourable and learned member; and on that score I think that, in the interests of the Bill , we have right to complain. I would not moment insinuate that the honourable learned member did anything, or refrained from doing anything, from any but the purest motives, but I do say that, considerthought ing the position the honourable and learned member occupied towards the Bill, and feature he had made of it in the programme of his Government', we had a right to exmoment. pect, not only from him, but more especially from his colleagues, a different treatment - I do not place the honourable and learned member on the same plane his colleagues, because he did give us support-h e gave us his vote, though not his voice so frequently as I could have wished. On the other hand, his colleagues, duced in the shape it was. or a number of them, seemed to lose opportunity to disclaim all responsibility the Bill which they had, with brazen frontery, put before the country as a proper vision. measure.",66
417,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,That tion.,66
418,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is not exaggeration; it was neither more nor less than absolute vision. effrontery for the right honourable member for Swan and others of his Government to stiongly. recommend the measure to the country while they were in office, and. immediately were defeated, to discover all kinds of "" likely to extend."" faults in it, and be prepared to slaughter it.",66

Unions under the Bill were, and are still, prevented from striking, and the Bill proposes that a comparatively unimportant officer, in the shape of a registrar, shall have the right to proclaim an industrial dispute.",66
431,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is a very important officer.,67
432,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say that he is comparatively unimportant.,67
433,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Tak e the work that officer does in New South Wales.,67
434,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The experience in New South Wales has been that it is not wise to leave in the hands of that officer that important power.,67
435,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We gave an appeal in every case. Mr WATSON ! - I speak of the registrar in New South Wales without desiring to reflect in any way on the calibre or capacity of that officer. The point is that, in our opinion,the is sufficiently provided for by clauses 62 and 19 of the Bill . Under the former, the Governor General can proclaim any set of persons, an organization, notwithstanding their objections. Then, under clause 4, a dispute occurring between that organization and another person would come within the definition of ""industrial dispute,"" and would, under clause 19, come within the arbitrament of the.Court.",67
436,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,But if already occurred the Court would be powerless.,67
437,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not . at all. There would be an organization which could be brought within its jurisdiction.,67
438,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,I doubt it .,67
439,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not wish to deal with that question at any greater length. Last evening, the honourable learned member for Ballarat stated that the granting of a preference to unionists tantamount to taking work from non-unionwas ists. I contend that, in many instances, the resume work. withholding of a preference will mean taking work from unionists. Honourable memand bers who have had any experience of the return to work. working of trade unions must know that the victimizing of those who take a prominent part in industrial disputes-the discharging of those who have the temerity to stand up for what they conceive to be a fair thingis the most common of practices. Every honourable member who has inquired into the matter knows that, as a rule, if a trade unionist takes part in any industrial struggle it is most difficult for him subsequently to obtain employment or to receive any consideration.",67
440,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Victorian State Government treated the railway employees in that way.,67
441,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Case s of the kind occur every day.,67
442,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What does the absence of a preference to unionists mean? It means that unions which have already won a preference-and to my knowledge there are not less than twenty in New South Wales today which have gained it without an order of the Court-ma y be deprived of it. Unless the power to grant a preference in an effective way be given to the Court, these organizations will be robbed of it, and robbed of the means of insisting upon it .",67

It had not attempted to use its power to compel the men to resume work. 'The honourable and learned member himself - admits that the organizations very materially assisted in inducing the men to return to work, and that is one justification for the granting of a preference to unionists.

466,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But we do. The honwhat orable and learned member reminds me the man who was sentenced to be hanged, 9 G 2 and who said that the authorities, as a matter of law, could not hang him. Nevertheless, he was hanged. It is useless for the honourable and learned member to institute any comparison between the two classes of legislation. They are altogether distinct in their orbits. Wages boards are good so far as they go. But apart from the question of preventing strikes, the big deficiency under a Factories Act is that, lacking the guarantee of organizations, there is no opnot portunity of policing it by the men who are engaged in any particular occupation.",68

468,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable and learned member realise what that in means in the way of expense, and how init would prove in operation?",68
469,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is where the whole to weakness of the Act comes in.,68
470,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Of course it is. The weakness of the Factories Act is the inadequacy of the means provided to enforceaward. I repeat that no comparison can that be instituted between the two systems. They attempt totally different objects, and arrive Benat them by different means. The Prime Minister, who was absent from the Chamber a little time ago, has lamented the fact that, in submitting this motion, I did not refer to the alliance programme in detail.. I have already said that by a flank movement, which is characteristic of the rightgentleman, he evaded all discussion of his own inadequate programme byattempting to discover deficiencies in the for arrangement of the alliance. There is one feature, perhaps, of last night's debate which was not too satisfactory to the Prime The honourable' and learned member for Ballarat, in common with a this number of other honourable members opposite, seemed to be more concerned about prethe programme of the alliance than about that of the Government. I do not think that that is too complimentary to the Ministry. It simply amounts to this deupon the part of those honourable members-""We shall put up with this Government until a better programme that is discovered upon the other side.""",68

474,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Our friend Mr Tom Mann seems to crop up, like King Charles's head, on every possible occasion; but when the battle comes to be fought, Mr Mann will be found doing his share like the rest of us. There will be no trouble on that score.",69

500,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think they go to the extent of taking possession on behalf of the community of the whole of the rental value - of land. Personally, I never could subscribe to that doctrine. I say that if if is in the public interest that any man's property should be appropriated by the State, the State should compensate him to the uttermost farthing. I believe, of course, in land taxation.",70

504,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,What about the honourable-member for Barrier?,70
505,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He is a Socialist, not a single-taxer. One is the antithesis of the - other, if the honourable member but knew it. The honourable member for Richmond was saying what he ought to have known was not. correct when he charged Socialists and the Labour Party with being anxious to divide between the "" Have-nots"" all that is possessed by the "" Haves."" No such charge tan lie at the door of the Labour Party, because, on every occasion when any matter has come up involving action by the Government, no one has stood firmer than have the members of the Labour Party in insisting that reasonable compensation should be paid to all who are deprived of property by the State.",70
506,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,No one took the honourable member seriously.,70
507,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps it was one of those elephantine attempts which the honourable member for Richmond thinks display humour, but which have not been very successful in that respect. Then we have the Prime Minister on this question of Socialism betraying expert knowledge of the subject. The right honourable gentleman stated that the appointment of Railways Commissioners was a negation of Socialism. ;",70
508,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The word ""negation"" is one I do not often use.",70
509,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think the right honourable gentleman will find from Hansard that he did use it.,70
510,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It must have been because this debate muddled me. I,t is a word I do not like.",70
511,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is a good word enough, and does credit to the right honourable gentleman's ingenuity. But I cannot see any negation of Socialism in the appointment of Railways Commissioners. Tht manner in which a' State enterprise is run can have no possible bearing oh the question whether it is Socialism or not. The honourable and learned member for Parkes, I am sure, would be the first to admit that. It is equally socialistic whether the enterprise be run by Commissioners, the Federal Government, a State Government, a municipal council, or any other person or set of persons representative of the collective opinare single- ions, feelings, and action of a community. It is Socialism in either case, and it is therefore idle to juggle with words by suggesting that the appointment of Railways Commissioners is a negation of Socialism. I have no wish to detain the House at very much greater length, but there is one matter on which I should like to say a word. I refer to a matter in connection with which, I am sorry to say, there has been a deliberate attempt to fasten a most undeserved reproach upon a member of the Labour Party and one of my late colleagues-the case of the six potters.",70
512,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the honourable gentleman will take that up he will take up anything.,71
513,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am certainly going to take that up, and I think that when I have finished it will be shown that there was not the slightest justification for an expression used-outsid e of this House certainly-by the honourable and learned member for Wannon in this connection.",71

516,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and law-maker learned member certainly inadvertently omitted to state that he had initiated the prosecution.,71
517,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable learned member had an opportunity to say that, and he would not say it.",71

520,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member tried to get the vote of the honourable member for Wilmot by that statement.,71
521,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No j ' the honourable member for Wilmot had other reasons for the decision to which he has come with rePrime spect to his vote. I say that the point that was being made by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney was not in the slightest degree affected by any tion as to the person who had initiated the prosecution. The point was this: That the Prime Minister, after travelling New South Wales from one end to the other, and exhe hausting his vocabulary in criticism of the Barton Government for their administration in the case of the six hatters, had allowed it. this prosecution against the six potters to go on. The opportunity was there for right honourable gentleman to have stopped that statement? it when it was brought under his notice by the Secretary of his Department. I am glad the right honourable gentleman did it, because I believe in the administration of that law. I believe it is a proper law, and, as a matter of fact, I moved the inserable tion of the particular section action was taken. I am glad the right honourable gentleman did not stop that prosecution, but I say it is not a consistent attitude for the right honourable gentleman toassume.",71

527,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have made a perfectly plain statement, and the honourable member cannot put that interpretation upon and it. I have expressly admitted that the Prime Minister, under his oath of office, would not be justified in attempting to administer the law in any other way, but T say that in view of the strong attitude heup before the country, it is a most Inconsistent position for him to occupy toadminister that law, and make no attempt",71

My decision is that the honourable member for Bland did not say what the Minister of Defence has suggested he did say.",72
544,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I hope that the honourable and learned member for Wannon does not for a moment think that I said what the Minister of Defence has suggested. What I wish to convey and to prove, is that the honourable and learned member did not lie, which is a very different thing from a man overlooking a fact in the heat of the moment. Every one knows that a man is not calm when he is speaking on an occasion of this sort. For a man to deliberately state what he knows to be false is quite different from inadvertently overlooking Hansomething. The clearest and surest proof that the honourable and learned member for West Sydney did not intentionally misrepresent the position is that immediately upon going outside the Chamber he gave to the press the whole statement for publication next morning.",72
545,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why did he not make the correction in the House, so that it could go into Hansard, where the misstatement appeared ?",72

559,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The point of the criticism directed against the honourable 'and learned member is not affected in the slightest degree by the question of who initiated the prosecution. That is not the point at issue. The question is whether the right honourable gentleman is true to his hustings' declarations in the attitude which he has since taken up.,73
560,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,In administering the law ?,73
561,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No . I recognise that 7 the right honourable gentleman must administer the law, and I should be the first to criticise him if he did not.",73

564,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not complain of criticism of that sort.,73
565,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now , what is the position which the Government occupies? We have been treated to some remarks by the honourable member for Wilmot. I do not think that there could have been any utterance more humiliating to a Government who are promised support than his remarks. To me it is an extraordinary thing that the Government should be prepared, as there seems every indication that they are, to sit on the Treasury bench, dependent upon the support of an honourable member who has expressed his contempt for them.",73
566,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And his contempt for the Labour Party, too.",73

569,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not wish any misapprehension to exist. All that we on this side desired was to take honourable members opposite to their masters. What kind of such support could any one expect to get from the honourable member for Wilmot? I propose to quote the opinion of an organ which is generally a slavish supporter of the Prime Minister-the Sydney Daily Telegraph.,73
570,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,A very powerful newspaper.,73

577,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The article proceedsThe issue now is, whether Socialism or its antithesis should become the policy of the Commonwealth. There is a call to arms for the right honourable gentleman. He has told us that he has entered upon a war with the Labour Party, because of their socialistic ideas. He has thrown himself right across the path of the Labour Party, and, in clarion tones, the Sydney Daily Telegraph calls upon him to take up the gauntlet. But no, he is not concerned.",73
578,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member will find that I shall take up the gauntlet at the right time. He will have enough before he is done with me; but I should first like to get the rolls in better or'der.,73

On irnticular question of legislative policy, settled and done with, as soon as the vote taken, a majority of one is sufficient. But when the issue is broadly, confidence or no-confidence in the Government, the position is entirely ferent. I think that those words state the position to much more eloquently than I could. I ters,appeal wish to ask this one other question. What in the interests has become of that mysterious entity known country as responsible government, whose restoration was, a month ago, the chief object of the the right honourable member for East Sydsite. ney? Responsible government; as now invernment will terpreted, seems to mean that a Ministry with them, notretain may remain in office, no matter what opinion they should be there, but because is expressed about it and its policy, and that if there were a dissolution the no matter what attitude imay be taken by sition would win those who support it.",73

588,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF," I move That the House do now adjourn. I should like to make a short statement to honourable members with regard to the business with which we propose to deal during the next two or three sitting days. I propose tomorrow to go on with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and I hope we shall dispose of that measure without much difficulty, because the matter was fully threshed out on a previous occasion. My honourable colleague, the Treasurer, intends to deliver his Budget speech on Tuesday, and it is proposed that there shall be the usual adjournment of the debate, to enable 'honourable members to consider the Treasurer's statement and the financial position generally. After that, we propose to afford the honourable member for Eden-Monaro an opportunity to proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.",75
589,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF," I do not see any objection to the course proposed by the Prime Minister, except that it seems extraordinary that the honourable member for Hume, who has been associated with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill from the beginning, should have it taken out of his hands. I do not know whether the action of the Prime Minister is prompted by the fact that the honourable member for Eden Monaro is now sitting upon the Government side of the House; but upon a question of NOES. this kind it seems to me that such a consideration should not operate. If it is to be regarded as a non-party question-and I hope that Ministers will continue to so regard it - I think that the honourable member has a prior claim to take con trol of the Bill. I do not think that it isproper to take the Bill out of his hands. We ought to pay some regard to appearances, and to observe that courtesy which is due to honourable members. Ever since I have been in Parliament, it has been understood that, where an honourable member has Wilson, J. G. . been id'entified with a certain cause for a considerable length of time, he should have the prior claim when the question of bringing the matter before the House arises. That understanding has been observed in PAIK. all similar cases in New South Wales, at any rate, and I do not think that any departure from that practice will help forward the object in view.",75
590,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF," I strongly support the views put forward by the leader of the Opposition. We all have great respect and esteem for the honourable member for Eden Monaro, but, at the same time, I think he must feel that he is jumping the claim of the honourable member for Hume. The latter honourable member introduced the Bill, and, undoubtedly, his name is id'entified with it, so far as this House is concerned. Why, then, has the matter been taken out of his hands?",75
591,Mr GLYNN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Surely the honourable and learned member does not think that an ex-Minister has a special claim in regard to any particular measure.,75
592,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not advancing any claim for the honourable member, as an ex-Minister, but I hold that, in view of the fact that the honourable member personally identified himself with the measure, and exhibited the greatest interest in it, he has a strong moral claim to precedence in regard to it, and that the traditions of Parliament demand that that claim shall be recognised. No reason has been given by the Prime Minister for departing from a course that is well recognized and respected. I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he will afford a favourable and early opportunity, for proceeding with the motion on the notice-paper that is identified with my name. That is a matter of extreme urgency.. The right honourable gentleman will understand that we regard this matter as so urgent and important, that he cannot think of attempting to go into recess before dealing with it.",75
593,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is a nice way to put a matter to a Government! The honourable ancl learned member will find that the Government will meet him in exactly the same spirit-w e will accept no dictation.,76
594,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not want the right honourable gentleman to attempt to fasten on my words any meaning that is not properly attachable to them. I want to ex-' plain that there are fa r more important measures on the paper than the one which the right honourable gentleman has given to the care of the honourable member for Eden Monaro. Why the right honourable gentleman should select this one measure oiit of the whole of the measures on the paper,76
595,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is quite enough, anyhow.",76
596,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wish to say again that we regard the measure to which I have referred, as extremely urgent, and I ask the right honourable gentleman not to let any feeling stancl in the way of his doing his duty to the country. I ask the right honourable gentleman to provide some public time for the full and adequate consideration of a measure which involves",76
597,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,A measure?,76
598,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A question, leading up to a measure, which involves the welfare and happiness, and it may be the lives, of tens of thousand's of the people of Australia.",76
599,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF," If the me'a sure to which reference has been made is to be regarded as non-contentious, it has certainly given very early evidence of being quite the reverse, more particularly in view of the remark made by the leader of the Opposition. That honourable member said that there would perhaps be a considerable difference in the result.",76
600,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,What I said was that the change would not help the measure.,76
601,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When it is suggested that there will be a difference in the result arrived at in consequence of the choice of the person to introduce a measure, more particularly when it is of a non-contentious character, there is, I think, evidence that some party feeling is going to be displayed.",76
602,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,I hope there mav be.,76
603,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am no apologist for the action of the Prime Minister, and, In any case, two wrongs do not make a right. If the Prime Minister has made a mistake in his selection of the gentleman to submit this Bill , there is no reason why the leader of the Opposition should suggest that that selection may have some materia! result on the fate of the measure.",76
604,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member with his experience ought to know that under such circumstances that is always che result.,76
605,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"So far as I am concerned, that has never been the result.",76
606,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why should the measure be taken out of the hands of one honourable member and given into the charge of another.,76
607,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am not aware of the motives actuating the Prime Minister.,76
608,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Surely there ought to be some explanation.,76
609,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I incline to the opinion that in a proposal of this sort, admittedly of a non-contentious character, there ought to be some evidence of the spirit of alliance and' coalition which has been so strong during the .last few weeks. As to two members taking control, if necessary, we have had a good deal of that on both sides of the House; and whether such a course is right or wrong, is just now immaterial. But I do regret that - at this very early stage of an important measure which we are told will have serious consequences on the people of Australia, feeling should be displayed on account of the individual who will introduce it to the House. It is a measure to which I am anxiously desirous to give assistance as far as possible, and I trust that an honest effort will be made to suppress any friction. Knowing the honourable member for Hume as I do, I feel sure that if any sacrifice is to be made, he will be prepared to suppress his individual rights in the matter; and I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to do the same if necessary. It is regrettable that we should have so much party feeling displayed on a measure of the sort. It is evident to the casual onlooker that differences of opinion on some principle or other, are flung in the teeth of honourable members, who, on some issues 'on which they are agreed, join with other honourable members. We are told that we are renegade to our convictions, and to our'duties as representatives, because, while differing on some vital principle, we join with some honourable members in carrying out other principles upon which we are mutually agreed. It is to be deplored that this feeling should be fostered in this or a.iy other Chamber.",76
610,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The measure ought lo be introduced by the honourable and learned member for Adelaide.,76
611,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That may be so; but I think that the personality of the honourable member who may introduce a measure, should not be permitted to inflict any injury on the prospects or welfare of the people of the Commonwealth.",77
612,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF," Havin g regard to the magnitude of the question of preferential trade, I appeal to the sense of honour and rectitude and magnanimity which always characterizes the honourable and learned member for Indi, as to whether it is not reasonable that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. who has been identified with this question, should continue to take charge.",77
613,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is speaking of the wrong motion. I was not referring to preferential trade, but to the Royal Commission on the Tariff.",77
614,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Eve n the question of Tariff reform has been identified with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who is regarded as the exponent of Australian national life and national industry.",77
615,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the honourable learned member for Ballarat will submit the motion I shall be delighted.,77
616,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The question of preferential trade might also, with great advantage, be left with the honourable, and learned member for Ballarat.",77
617,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear, , hear !",77
618,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the question of ""the Tariff Commission be left with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, it will be in the hands of the best and truest protectionist in Australia. As to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, whether it be in the hands of the honourable ber for Hume, or those of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, it will, I am sure, receive fair treatment. The Prime Minister, in his statement to-night, said that after the Treasurer's Budget speech, there would be an adjournment.",77
619,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is, an adjournment of the debate.",77
620,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do I understand that there is merely to be an adjournment of the Budget debate?,77
621,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes .,77
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF, I appeal to 'honourable members to recollect that there is a Government in power.,77
623,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,What ?,77
624,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order ! During an early part of the debate which has just closed I stated that special liberty must of necessity be allowed to honourable members during its continuance. Now that the debate has concluded, I trust that proper decorum will be observed. The honourable member for Parramatta had no sooner made a remark than there was at least six interjections. That is distinctly out of order, and after making all due allowance for any excitement which may prevail at the present time, I must ask honourable members to pay due attention to the rules of the House.",77
625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was reminding honourable members that there is a Government in power, because it seemed to me, from ' what was passing, that honourable members believed the Ministry are not responsible for the course of public business in this Chamber. Herewe have three questions of supreme importance, and members all round the House are clamouring for permission to take charge of them. I think it is about time that the Government took control of the public business. Surely it is for them to say what shall be done with the measures in question'. A l and ready the Ministry have promised to institute a Tariff inquiry. Surely they should take the initial step in connection with a matter of that kind, and not the honourable and le'arned member for Indi or any other member, be he whole leader or half leader. It is about time that this farce was played out.",77
626,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable member call the Government a "" farce ""?",77
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not, but I call the honourable and learned member one every time. I amspeaking of the farce which is being played in this Chamber by memprivate members clamouring for the privilege of being permitted to take charge of measures of first-rate importance.",77
628,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is not the Manufactures Encouragement Bill a measure of first-rate importance ?.,77
629,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is, indeed. I think that the Government can very readily put an end to the present rivalry between two ex-Ministers. If the Government will not take up the measure-and I 3b not think that if can, having regard to its composition-ther e is a ready means of arbitrating as between these two ex-Ministers. I suggest"" the Minister of Defence. He was a member of the Royal Commission that investigated the matter. I think that the Government ought to come down upon proposals from all round the Chamber regarding such matters as a Tariff Commission, preferential trade, and other questions of first-rate importance. They should assert their right-as no doubt the Prime Minister will-to take control of the business of the House.",77
630,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF," I think it is a pity that in his first statement to House, after the disposal of the no-confidence motion,- the Prime Minister should exercise his authority to deal with a matter like the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in a way that is evidently designed to assist his own party. It is usual in all Parliaments with which I am familiar to extend to any honourable member who has a motion or a Bill upon the business-paper, the courtesy of allowing him to take charge of the matter to which they relate.",78
631,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WANT OF,What about the right honourable member for Adelaide?,78
632,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Unfortunately , he is at present too ill to take charge of a Bill. It is notorious that the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Hume are anything but friendly. I hope that has nothing to do with the action of the Government in this matter, but it is certainly an evidence of the way in which business is to be carried on. The honourable member for Parramatta has stated clearly that there is a Government in power, which intends to inforce its will upon this House. I am very glad to know that, ancl I am pleased that he has been authorized to make that statement. It is a pity, however, that it did not come from the Government.",78
633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,We have had no caucus.,78
634,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am satisfied upon that point. I understand that honourable members opposite are to have absolutely no knowledge of what the Government intend to do. Upon a previous occasion'the Prime Minister declared that he could answer for every one of his followers, and undoubtedly he was able to carry every one of them with him. I trust that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will see the wisdom of gracefully retiring from the position which he has taken up, if only for the advantage of the measure which he seems to have so much at heart.",78
635,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF," This is the most extraordinary spectacle that I have witnessed during my political career. We have in power a Government which has just been given a new lease of life by a very narrow majority, and which now proposes to hand over to the charge of a private member a Bill involving an expenditure of £300,000 of the tax-payers' money. I am satisfied that the Prime Minister cannot cite a similar case in constitutional history. When a Government comes into power it is usual for it either to take up thethis business which appears upon the paper or to reject it. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill is of sufficient importance to warrant the Ministry in assuming control of it, and any Government which is willing to hand it over to the charge of a private member should not be permitted to remain twenty-four hours upon the Treasury bench. I quite agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that it is about time honourable members displayed some little decency. From the way in which business is being conducted honourable members would appear to be losing all self-respect, and to cars very little for their constituents or the country generally. The Government say that they cannot carry on any business of a contentious character, and yet business of a contentious character involving hundreds of thousands of pounds is handed over to a private member. Whatever position the honourable member for Eden-Monaro may have held under the Deakin Governmenthe is now but a private member of the House, and it is not right that he should take charge of a measure of such importance. I agree that the Government would have no more right to hand this measure over to the honourable member for Hume. If they are prepared to assist in the passing of the Bill they ought to have taken it up themselves. When the Prime Minister sanctions this sort' of thing, I very much question the sincerity of the right honourable gentleman's regard for the welfare of the community.",78
636,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF," I have a decided recollection that just before this debate commenced, in answer to a specific question asked by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the Prime Minister distinctly promised that honourable member that he would be given an opportunity to bring in this measure. The right honourable gentleman is now merely redeeming that promise, and, in the circumstances, there is no other course open to him but to keep his word.",78
637,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF," I may be permitted to ask the House to consider the position in which I am placed by a remark made in connection with a matter upon which the leader of the Opposition has spoken this evening. I have now been in politics for some ten years. I do inot for a moment pretend that during time. I have not said some very hard things of other men, and they have said very hard things of me, without our being the worse friends. But I defy any man say that I have ever stated in the House that which I knew to be untrue. here and now that I should despise myself if I thought myself capable of such a thing. Apart from the fact mentioned by the matter. leader of the Opposition, that I went out and gave the details to the press, I should like to say that at the time. I went had not the faintest idea that the facts had not been fairly represented to the House. I say now that, while it is quit-? untrue that the present Prime Minister .'initiated that prosecution, the whole gravais .men of my charge was that he prosecution when he had an opportunity to suspend it. I am not now concerned with tunity the political but with the personal aspect of under it. this matter, and I wish to say to the Prime Minister, and particularly to the House, that I am the last man in the represent any man in a matter of this kind. I wish, therefore, to give the House to distinctly understand that I utterly pudiate the statement which one or Ihonorable members have permitted tliemsaying-selves to make-on e honourable member at - all events-to the effect that I intentionally misrepresented the facts to the House. Though I do not deny that I have .said very many bitter things of the the Prime Minister - and the right .honourable gentleman has never been spect backward in repayment- I am sure he .acquit me of any deliberate intention represent him in that particular. For : truth of what I say I do not wish merely to rely upon the fact that I gave the tails to the press, but I desire to say there was in my mind at the time no idea - that there could be drawn from the remarks that I made anything but the facts as are and were; namely; that the Prime - ster, when he had an opportunity-th ter having been brought under his notice by the secretary to the Department-of was . either approving or disapproving of what had been done, elected to allow the action - of his predecessor to remain undisturbed, he did in at least two other cases, one - connection with the appointment of the New thing. - Guinea Judge and the other in connection with the arrangements made for permitting Japanese and Indians to come into this -- country under altered conditions-a very :portant ""alteration in administration. Mr Hughes. that the circumstances, I trust the House will accept the explanation I make, and that it shall not be said that any member of this any House, under any circumstances or under to any provocation, deliberately made a misstatement to this House which he knew at I say the time to be a misstatement.",78
638,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF," Referenc e has been made to me in connection with this The statement which I characterized in this House as "" absolutely incorrect "" is a statement which was made by the out I honourable and learned member for West Sydney in this House on the 20th of September, 1904, and which will be found reported in Hansard for this session, at page 4739The honourable and learned member there reported to have said, referring to continued the the Prime MinisterThe first thing he does after he has the opporis to give instructions for a prosecution Later on in the speech the honourable and world to mislearned gentleman saidThe right honourable gentleman not only gives orders for a prosecution under the ActreAnd again, on the same page, the honortwo able and learned member is reported as He orders a prosecution under the Act. I characterized that statement that the Prime Minister ordered a prosecution under Act as "" absolutely incorrect."" Outside this House I used language with reto that statement which is unparliawill mentary. I think I was justified in the to mislanguage I used here, and I think I was the perfectly justified in the language I used outside, because I can assure honourable memdebers that it was heartfelt. On the next day. that the 21 st September, when the'Prime Minister gave his explanation, and showed that he did not order a prosecution, the honorthey able and learned member had an opporMinitunity of withdrawing his statement. He made no withdrawal, but, on page 4811 e matof Hansard, he said I say, most emphatically, that my statement cleai--the reference was unambiguous. Not content - with reiterating his statement, as he told the House that the Prime Minister in w.as endeavouring to crawl out of scrne",79
639,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,How can the honourable and learned member say that? ,79
640,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and imlearned member ought to have known that In his statement that the Prime Minister had ordered a prosecution was absolutely without foundation. He had the fullest opportunity of withdrawing it.,79
641,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,How can that be said in the face of the statement in the newspaper on the same day?,80
642,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member refused to withdraw the - statement.,80
643,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Mr Speaker,80
644,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member cannot speak at this stage.,80
645,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the honourable and learned member is making a statement which is not true.,80
646,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That remark must be withdrawn. The honourable and learned member knows that he cannot speak during the speech of another honourable member.,80
647,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the honourable learned member is now making a statement which is not in accordance with the fact.,80
648,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That the honourable and learned member may say, but he must withdraw his statement that the honourable and learned member for Wannon was saying that which is not true.",80
649,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable learned member is making a statement which is not in accordance with the fact when he says that I have refused to withdraw a statement. I have not refused to withdraw a statement. I have just now stated,80
650,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order . The honourable and learned member cannot proceed to make a speech.,80
651,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What I said-and I thought that I made myself clear-wa s that on the 20th September the honourable, and learned member charged the Prime Minister with ordering a prosecution, that on the 21 st September he made a personal explanation, and it was in his power then to correct the misstatement, but that he did not do so.",80
652,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say again,80
653,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable and learned member rise to make a personal explanation?,80
654,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , sir. I repeat that I came in on the following day, after having given to the press on the previous night a full statement of the facts, which are not questioned. I believe that the Prime Minister will accept that statement.",80
655,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On e of the worse features of this business is that the honourable and learned member makes two statements on the same night-that he puts in Hansard a statement which is not correct, and corrects it in a newspaper.",80
656,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The whole thing turns on the words ""ordering the prosecution."" After I had had an opportunity of hearing about the right honourable gentleman's, personal explanation, I said, that evening when I came in that I , not he, had ordered the prosecution in the first instance, but that after the matter had been brought under his notice he had elected to go on with the case, ordering the Secretary to let matters go. I submit that, under the circumstances, the language was unambiguous.",80
657,Mr AUSTINCHAPM AN,MOTION OF WANT OF," I wish to make clear my position with regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. If honourable members will make and an inquiry, they will find that there has been a motion in my name on the notice paper for a considerable time. I was quite prepared to withdraw the notice of motion, and give the honourable member for Hume that loyal support which one protectionist should give to another on an important matter of this kind. I have not the faintest and desire to put myself in front of any one. My only wish is to test the opinions of honourable members, and see whether this bonus is to be given or not. I hope that we shall have no more of the humbugging that we have had about this business. I propose, to explain the reasons which, I believe, led up to the Prime Minister giving me leave to go on with the Bill. The right honourable member for Adelaide was responsible for its introduction; it was then taken up by the honourable member for Hume; and when the Watson Government came into powerthey did nothing. The honourable member for Wide Bay seems to have discovered a new-born zeal for protection. Several months went past, and the iron workers of Sydney asked me to introduce a deputation to the head of the Watson Government. When he was pressed to do something for the industry, he was reminded by the deputation that he had spoken against the project in the House, and said that he had to consider the land-holders who were using iron and wire. When I introduced the deputation, I pressed him to do something to prevent the industry from being closed down in New South W'ales, as it had already been in Victoria. I told him, both then and afterwards, that I was prepared 'to. give the honourable member for Hume - every help I could, so that the measure - might' be' pushed along. A few days afterwards an intimation was made that the Government proposed to give the honourable member for Hume, as the Prime Minister now proposes to give me, time to push on with the Bill. Did any loud-mouthed protest come from the honourable member for Kennedy then about the Government giving time to a private member? No he was : quiet on that occasion; he took no objection to the statement of the then Prime Minister. He has reserved his fighting attitude for this occasion. I ask him to be fair, because this measure does not involve any party issues. I am surprised to think that the honourable member for Bland should make a threat against the industry. It might be, however, because he is largely responsible in this House for the delay in passing the Bill. I am surprised at the new-born zeal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, who endorses this threat. What have I ever done that a threat should be held out to me? I ask those two honourable members to submit my speeches, my votes, and my actionsas a protectionist in this country in contrast with their own, to the judgment of any impartial man. I should be quite prepared to abide by his verdict. I desire no credit for pushing along this Bill. I have no personal interest in its passage, and the people in my district are not particularly terested in the establishment of this industry. If any member of the Government, or any 'other member of the House, would take the matter up, I should be only too glad to support him. I would be just as loyal in helping the honourable member for Hume as any one else.",80
658,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then , why does not the honourable member allow the honourable member for Hume to deal with the matter?",81
659,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Boothby should not show so much party spleen. have been reading to-night his declaration against the granting of a bonus, but, apparently, he wishes now to pose as a friend of the proposal. I understood that the honourable member for Hume intimated to the Prime Minister that he would not accept anything from the Government.",81
660,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is not correct, and I told the Minister of Defence so when he spoke to me about the matter. ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I told the protectionists in Sydney what I had heard - that time would be given by the Government for the consideration of the matter; and I suggested that they should ask the honourable member for Hume, with whom I was not then on speaking terms, to take up the matter, and I would withdraw my notice of motion. I was then told by the secretary to the Protectionists' Union that the honourable member for Hume had informed him that, if I could obtain time from the Prime Minister, I ought .to go on with the matter, and he would help me in every way that he could. Consequently, I shall be surprised if the honourable member for Hume takes the same view as the late Prime Minister, ancl the late Minister of Trade and Customs. It seems to me that, as the question is an open one, it does not matter who deals with it. What we desire is something definite on the part of the House in regard to it. The honourable and learned member for Indi jumped to his feet with new-born zeal to point out the horror of the proposal to hand the matter over to me.",81
661,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , I did not.",81
662,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Such statements do not come well from the honourable and learned gentleman. One who aims at being a leader in this House should walk warily, and should show that he is prepared to give in- fair play to others; because those who are on the opposite side of the gangway to-night may be on his side of the gangway tomorrow night. I think that, instead of party feeling being introduced into the consideration of matters of this kind, all such great questions of national importance should be dealt with as open questions, so that each member may vote on them as he pleases, without regard to party ties. Why did not the leader of the Opposition, the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable members for Kennedy and Boothby discover this terrible injustice before, since I for weeks past the newspaper? have been announcing that the Prinze Minister was willing to give me time to go on with this matter ? I wish it to be taken up by some one who has a reasonable chance of success. If the leader of the Opposition and the late Minister of Trade and Customs say that they are in favour of granting bonuses, and that the fact that some one on this side of the House is moving in the matter will prejudice their votes, and prevent the measure being passed, I shall be quite willing to hand it over to some one else. But threats of that kind are contemptible. What have I done to deserve their:? Is it because I had the courage to vote as I thought right ?",81
663,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member has jumped another man's claim.,82
664,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member should be a good judge of that. What have I done that the leader of the Opposition, two or three ex-Ministers, and the honourable and. learned member for Indi, who aspires to be a leader, should jump to their feet, and pitch into me? I defy them. I can put my votes, my speeches and my actions to a comparison with theirs without fearing the result. It is unfortunate for this great question that we should have these veiled threats. I am loth to believe that the honourable member for Hume is a party to what has taken place. I understood that it was his wish that I should go on.with this matter. Thai is the only reason that has made me ask the Prime Minister for time. I hope that in his calmer moments the honourable member for Bland will regret that he made a threat.",82
665,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not.,82
666,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member spoke against my having charge of the measure in the interests of the proposal. What was tKat but a threat ?,82
667,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was a mere statement of fact.,82
668,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am very pleased that the honourable member did not intend it as a threat. I have given the history of the whole matter. I placed a notice of motion on the business-paper, and pressed the Prime Minister at a deputation to do something. He said a few days afterwards that he would give the honourable member for Hume time to have the subject discussed, and I expressed my readiness to help. I was then informed that the honourable member for Hume had said that he would accept nothing from the Government.",82
669,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,He denies that.  ber.,82
670,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then I asked for time, and decided to withdraw my motion so as to proceed with the Bill. The announcement has appeared in the newspapers for some weeks that I would move in the matter, and no exception has been taken to that arrangement until tonight, when the leader of the Opposition jumped to his feet, and said that it was in the interests of the measure. This statea ment was endorsed by three or four other honourable members, including the other leader of the Opposition. 9H",82
671,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,82
672,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Well , the other leader said that he thought it was not right. The honourable member for Richmond put the case fairly and clearly when he pointed to other actions that might well be put on the same plane. I was very glad about the stand which he took. If the honourable and learned member for Indi aspires to lead the House, he had better not show so much zeal in little matters of this kind. I do not desire to tread on any one's corns. My only wish is that the Iron Bonus Bill sUall be in the hands of the man who will do the best for it. .But do not let honourable members, for party purposes, or because they are piqued at, the result of a vote, damage a great industry out of mere spleen. I am glad that what was said was not intended as a threat, but that was the only construction which I could place upon it at the time.",82
673,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF," I should not have risen but for an interjection made by the honourable member for Hume. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro stated that he had been informed that the honourable member for Hume had said that he would not accept anything at the hands of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Hume interjected that that was not correct, and that he had so informed the Minister of ""Defence. It is quite true that the honourable member for Hume did say that that was not correct.",82
674,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I said it in this House. Air. MCCAY - I think that the honourable member said it to me in the course of a friendly conversation. I do not know t how the matter arose, but I said, "" But you said you would not accept anything at the hands of the Prime Minister. You may not have meant it, but I am sure that you said it."" The honourable member for Hume was satisfied that he had not made the statement, and on the other, hand I was quite satisfied that he had-by way of an interjection, made probably on the spur of the moment.",82
675,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I understood the honourable member to say that he would not ask for anything.,82
676,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then is the Prime Minister not to go to the honourable member? That is nice reversal of ithe proper positions.,82
677,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I only wish to say that I confirm the honourable member in his statement that he told me he did not make the remark attributed to him, and that I rightly' or wrongly, persisted in telling him ferred to his hands. that I thought he had said in.",82
678,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF," I was as rather surprised; to hear the somewhat heated remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. No one has made any reflection upon him. He has accused hontrouble orable members upon this side of having been actuated by a partisan spirit,, but objection taken by the leader of the Opporeflection sition, and by other honourable members who shared his views, was to .the introducfelt, tion of a party spirit in connection the measure. As the Bill, had been in the Hume. hands of the honourable member for Hume for some time past, it was felt that a party complexion would be imparted to it i were transferred to the charge of an honhas orable member who happened to be on. the Government side of the Chamber. It was only in that sense that the leader of the. Opposition referred to the matter.",83
679,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Are there two Bills on the notice-paper?,83
680,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , there is a Bill and a motion,; the Bill stands in the name of the Honourable member for Hume.",83
681,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As a matter of fact, stands in the name of the Minister of and Customs.",83
682,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Exactly , and the honourable member for Hume was the Minso.large ister of Trade and Customs when the Bill"" was introduced"", and so far as this Parliaprevent ment is concerned, his name alone has been identified with it. The late Governthis ment were willing that the Bill should allowed to remain in the hands of the orable member, and if he were deprived of the opportunity of proceeding with it, honourable members might suppose that an attempt was being made to serve some party object. That is what, the leader of Opposition meant by saying that the pasleft sing of the measure would not be assisted by any such"" proceeding.",83
683,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,What does the honourable member infer from that?,83
684,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Exactly what was said.,83
685,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Are we justified in presuming that the leader Opposition meant that he would adopt special measures in connection with the Bill?,83
686,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable the proposal. member knows perfectly well that it absurd to suggest that any one would , against the Bill because it had been transOur claim is that the Bill should continue to be regarded a non-party measure, and that that would be the best course to adopt in the interests of the project itself. Honourable members are inclined to put themselvesto some in regard to a measure in which they believe if it is being treated fairly, the but not otherwise. No one intended any upon the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, but some honourable members at the same time,""That no slight should with be put upon the. honourable member for Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I am af raid that the iron tonic which has f it been administered to honourable members had a somewhat unsettling effect, and that it would be advisable for us to adjourn at once, and meet tomorrow, after honourable members have had a good sleep. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) - I almost regret that so much heat has been shown to-night in regard to ' the Manufactures Encouragement Bill ; although I am quite sure that the leader of the Opposition referred to the matter out of conit sideration to myself as one upon whom he Trade conceived that some indignity was intended to be placed. Whatever my own feelings may be, the interests at stake are that I hope I shall never allow any personal and private considerations to me from assisting to pass a mea'sure for which I have fought, not only in Parliament, but for many years in the be State Parliamiant of New South Wales. honWhen I was. Premier in that State, I very nearly brought the proposal to a successful issue, and I think I am safe in saying that no public man has fought over a long political life as I have for the establishthe ment of the iron industry.. When I the State, an agreement had been prepared, and was awaiting signature, with a. powerful company to establish extensive works, and if that had been carried to a conclusion by my former colleagues, the iron industry would now be established in New South Wales. I was not asked to consent to the Bill being placed in the hands of the not honourable member for Eden-Monaro. After of the it had been publicly stated that he was some going to take charge of the measure, the secretary of the Protectionists' Union in Sydney asked me if I intended to combat My reply was that what is ever my feelings might be, I should cervote tainly not do that. I should not allow a consideration of that kind to influence attitude towards the Bill. At the time, I desire it to be understood that assisted the right honourable member for Adelaide, when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, in regard to the Bill, and pel. that when I took charge of his Departofficial ment, I slightly altered the measure, re-introduced it. When the Watson vernment came into power, and announced that they would not deal with the matterI agree with the honourable member for Kennedy that such a measure should taken up by the Government- I asked that an early opportunity should be afforded me to bring it forward. the The Prime Minister gave roe that and had it not been for the vote which displaced the Government, I should, have dealt with the matter the following week. I do to take it up. not say that this is a proper thing for a private member to do. If there is a Governto ment in power in sympathy with the matter, they ought to take up a measure of kind; but I feel that we may resort means a Ministry is prepared to allow, the purpose of obtaining the desired",83
687,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the honourable member prepared to go on with the matter if Government will give him time?,84
688,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is rather too late to a suggestion of that kind.,84
689,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The other day, when I was speaking on this matter, the Minister of Defence interjected what garded as a technical ..remark. The honhis orable gentleman said to me, "" I thought you said you would not take anything from the Government."" I at once replied that would not take such an attitude on a quesapproach tion of this kind. It is,true that I should a request. not like to be under an obligation to the vernment, but in this instance I should piopose to give the Government something - to give them this important measure which is lying dormant at present. Personally, shall do nothing to thwart or prevent measure from being carried. Any feeling I may have in the matter, I shall ""be pared, as I always have been, to disregard. I have been "" there before "" - I have been associated with the right honourable gentlealso man in a State Parliament.",84
690,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF," The honourable for Hume always seems to be under the impression that his political life has consishonorable ted in heaping on me gracious kindnesses, which have been repaid not only by inof difference, but by ingratitude on my part. 9 H2 my My impression is that the honourable memsame ber has used language in regard to myself 1 which makes it impossible for me to have any intercourse with him, except such which the duties of a public position comAs a public man occupying an position, I sink entirely any personal and feeling I may have-it is my duty to do Goso. To show my anxiety not to make any difference between the honourable member for Hume and any other honourable member, in a matter of such importance,, I should like be to make a short statement to the House. The honourable member for Hume has stated that he approached the Prime Minister of late Government, and asked for time in promise, which to deal with this Bill.",84
691,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was when I found that the Government were not going,84
692,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The same courtesy is due the Prime Minister of the present Government. If any honourable member wishes the Government time, he ought to approach to any the head of the present Government, for as the honourable member for Hume result. approached the head of the late Government. What I have to say is, that the I was certainly informed that the honourable member for Hume, whenthis same make matter was discussed some time ago, made a statement from his seat to the effect that he would accept nothing at the hands of the Government. But putting that aside, I reI wish to say that a man must show even bitterest enemy the same courtesy that he shows to his friends, and if an honourable men.ber desires Government time in I which to consider, a measure, he ought to the head of the Government with The honourable member for GoHume, neither directly nor indirectly, approached me with any such request. On the other hand, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who also has a resolution on I the notice-paper dealing with, this subject, this did come to me, as an honourable member ought to. and asked for Government time prein which to consider his proposal.",84
693,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member made the same request on the floor of the House.,84
694,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"To oblige the honourable member member for Hume, I presume!",84
695,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know; I presume members act for themselves unless the contrary is stated. In the absence any request from the honourable member for Hume, I certainly did not feel that I ought to run after that gentleman. Would any one expect me to do so,, especially under recent circumstances? It is not the public duty of a man in my position to approach those who may desire Government time in which to discuss a matter. The honourable member for Hume did not approach me, and, therefore, I hold myself quite free from any appearance of discourtesy. As has been said, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro did on the floor of the House ask me to give him time to consider this measure, and the request was granted, not because he sits on this side of the House-nothin g of the sort- but because the honourable member had been sufficiently connected with. the matter to entitle him in the absence of any request from the honourable member for Hume, to take charge. I hope it will be seen that there has been no attempt on my part to treat the honourable member for Hume discourteously.",84
696,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable when gentleman will admit that a very unusual reflection, course has been taken.",85
697,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not wish to say that it is not a usual course, but the position is that I .was not called upon to approach this the honourable member for Hume. Honthe Act,"" orable members cannot expect me to do the opportunity, so, but if .they do, they will be discution under it. appointed every time. When any orable member of the House has a public prosecution. request to make to me as Prime Minister he must approach me. I wish now to deal member retorted, "" It is true."" with the statement which was made by honourable and learned member for West Sydney. I regret that that honourable learned member has again brought up the matter cf the six potters. He might have terminated the incident long ago by expressing some sort of regret that he had, designedly I have no doubt, done me wrong that, I . have by placing on the permanent records of Pardays afterwards, liament language which no person of ordistatements whichwhen nary intelligence could misunderstand, and damage the public character which he must have known to be false, been uttered by. himself, and of unless he was in a state of mind which is permanent records of the Australian not common to him. But I have a more ment, one would expect some little dawning serious complaint to make. After three or four times saying that I had ""ordered"" a prosecution-and I suppose there is one English language-and after having caused his words to be placed in the tional records, to be sent throughout tralia to my injury, he, within the made to a newspaper reporter the statement, ""Oh, I ordered the prosecution."" That statement, however, would never appear in the pages of Hansard. Three times did the honourable and learned member say that I had ordered the prosecution, and yet within an hour he admitted to the representative of a public journal that it was he who had made the order, but he added that I then became responsible. I admit that in the legal sense- a view which has recently dawned on the honourable and learned member- I am responsible for the acts of my predecessor. That is a general constitutional principle; but it is not customary amongst Ministers and exMinisters in any part of the British Empire to say. that a successor has done what a predecessor has done, and then to add, "" Oh, I did it myself, but you can undo it . "" Such proceedings are rare in connection with British Parliaments.",85
698,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,What was the right honourable gentleman's attitude in the matter?,85
699,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On the following day, there had been plenty of time for I quoted the words of the honourable and learned member as follows: The right honourable gentleman is pledged on question. "" If I have the opportunity,"" he said, "" I will strike this iniquitous section out of and the first thing he does when he has is to give instructions for a prosehonThat is an act with a definite purposeI then said, "" That is not true,"" and the* honourable and learned The the very next day in this House, when I directed his attention to that statement, he and said, "" If is true.""",85
700,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"So it is. unlearned Mr Reid - If the honourable and member will continue to urge nothing more to say. But he recollected that were calculated to a man had put upon the Parliasense of regret. Instead,, at a publicgathering, before a large audience- I refer to only the Eight Hours' celebration, which was held this very month-the honourable and nalearned member again returned to this Ausmatter. He returns to it again and again, hour, and without any expression of regret.",85
701,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,I should think so.,85
702,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He stated to the gathering in questionI made no deliberate misstatement. co essential misstatementI think that there is an essential misstatement involved in the allegation that another man did what one did himself, or else the wrong man might be hanged for murder. The honourable and learned member continuedand that I made any misstatement to deceive any one, was disproved by the fact that there appeared in the same issue of the press which reported the occurrence in the House a full statement made by me to the reporters. I hope that in the public life of .this country we are not going to establish a system of using the stiletto in Parliament, and - then withdrawing it outside, where the wound cannot be healed. That was the worse feature of the matter, in my judgment. If the honourable and learned member had been carried away by excitement-as we all are at times- I could have understood his action. I have myself often made use of expressions which I afterwards regretted. But when the honourable and learned member recollected outside the wrong which he had done me, and then stated to the press, "" I did it, but he could have undone it , "" he might at least have come back into the House, and made his statement at the table. Had he done so, and then added, "" The two things are the same,"" we could have arrived at an appreciation of the mental methods of the honourable and learned member, which would deprive, his statements of any weight in future. I do not say that he acted deliberately. But, if he did it inadvertently, he has not yet expressed the slightest regret for maligning me in the' presence of the House and the country. In conclusion, I hope that so long as I occupy my present position, I will not do any unkind .or ungenerous thing to any honourable member under any circumstances whatever.",86
703,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will the right honourable gentleman allow me to say again,86
704,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order , order! The honourable member has already replied, and it is quite impossible for me to allow any further speech now. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 1.15 a.m. (Friday). I made",86
