1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The following message regarding the death of Major-General Bridges has just been received from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Mediterranean Expeditionary Forces: General Bridges died on passage to Alexandria. Whole force mourns his irreparable loss. Avenged yesterday in brilliant action by his own troops, who inflicted loss of seven sand on enemy at a cost of less than five hundred to themselves - I AN HAMILTON.",4
2,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Prio r to the meeting of the House, after the dinner adjournment last night, I heard from two or three sources the sad news of the death of Major-General Bridges, and, in subsequently referring to the matter in a speech, I waB not aware that the news had not been made public. Now that I know that Major-General Bridges' death had not then been publicly announced by the Government, I fear that my remarks may have caused pain hy the premature disclosure of the facts. I do not think that that is probable, but as my speech may have had that effect, I apologize to the Minister and to the friends of the deceased officer for my premature mention of the occurrence.",4
3,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware of the deplorable and dangerous condition of the men at Broadmeadows, owing to the unsuitability of that locality for a military encampment? Is the honourable gentleman not aware that, in other parte of Victoria far removed from the metropolis, there are places which are admirably suited for an encampment, though not so convenient of access?",4
4,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"-Onl y yesterday I spoke with the Minister of Defence ref arding the dampness of the. Broadmeaows site, and he assured me that drains are being cut and that everything is being; done to make the land as dry as possible. He has also decided to take into consideration the question whether a more suitable site could be obtained, but he has not yet arrived at any decision on the matter.",4
5,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the fact that soldiers at Broadmeadows suffering with chest complaints have to stand in the rain, if it is wet, awaiting the examination of the doctor, will the Defence Department see that a tent is provided toprotect medical patients from the weather, and thus give them a chance to shake off their complaints ? Will the Assistant Minister of Defence also inquire whether it is true, as stated, that No. 9 pill is used' universally to cure all diseases?",4
6,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Department of Defence is doing everything possible at Broadmeadows for the relief of those who are sick, and the Minister is now negothou- tiating with persons owning large buildings in Melbourne to secure those buildings^ and have them fitted up as privatehospitals, where properly-trained women nurses will be installed, and the best medical attention given.",4
7,Dr OAKTY SALMON,Unknown,A great deal of illness could be .prevented by shifting the camp.,4
8,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"We are doing all that we can to insure that the best attention! - shall be given, to those who are ill .",4
9,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Has the Assistant. Minister of Defence read the statement in this morning's newspaper that Lord Kitchener, in forming a new Army, has reduced the height limit to 5 ft. 2 in. t That being so, will the Defence Department here reduce the height for recruitsin Australia, so that men who are now under the regulation height may have an opportunity to enlist 1",4
10,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Any number of recruits of the standard height are offering themselves in Australia, and there is,, therefore, no need, to alter the regulation. Should occasion arise, the Government would consider the matter. THEWAR : INTERVENTI ON OF ITALY. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Minister for the Navy if he has any direct information as to whether the Parliament of Italy yesterday declared war against Austria?",4
11,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I have no information.,5
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,aThe news has come to hand that the Parliament of Italy has - decided hy a large majority to intervene. Italy has not declared war. SHORTAGE OF SUGAR.,5
13,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"Is the Attorney-Genepay ral aware that many retail traders have not 1 lb. of sugar on hand, and can get matter looked into. no definite reply from thÂ© Colonial Sugar Refining Company when applications are made to it for supplies? Is this Parliament able, under the Constitution, to deal with the position that has arisen ?",5
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The information obfence tained on inquiry bears oufc the statethat list covers? ment that the position is as put by the honourable member, particularly in Viction toria. I was informed yesterday that wholesale houses in Melbourne have not 150 bags between them, and that many towns in Victoria have no sugar at all; lication. that grocers are quite unable to supply their customers, and that the wholesale houses are unable to supply the grocers, - stocks being wholly in the hands of Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is not supplying orders as filed. Clearly the powers given to the Parliament Constitution are inadequate to enable us to deal with this position. KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA quest. RAILWAY .  Home Affairs give the House any information as to the discharge of men from the east-west railway works, and the reason for it?",5
15,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Owing to shortage of water, the difficulties arising from having to use bad water in the engines during the severe drought, the failure of contractors in Australia to supply locomotives and engine boilers to contract time, and the absolute necessity for overhauling existing locomotives, it has been necessary to temporarily reduce the rate of plate-laying, which has entailed dispensing with the services of about 150 men. The water difficulty has been gated by rains within the last few days, - and when sufficient locomotive power is available it is proposed to increase the number of men employed. I can assure the honourable member that I shall do my utmost to keep up the number employed, but with severe drought, war, and other circumstances against us, the difficulties have been great.",5
16,Mr YATES,Unknown,"If the men who are discharged go to Adelaide or to Port Augusta, and are compelled to return within a week or two, will the Minister their railway fares?",5
17,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,I shall have the CASUALTY LISTS.,5
18,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"In reference to the publication of the 19th casualty list last night, is the Assistant Minister of Dein a position to state what date",5
19,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I am not in a posito answer the honourable member's' the question. The list contained the latest news received by the Defence Department up to twenty-four hours prior to its pubWIVES OF BRITISH RESERVISTS.,5
20,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Will the Assistant the Minister of Defence bring the matter raised by me last night in regard, to payments to the wives of British reservists by the before the notice of the Minister?",5
21,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I will endeavour to comply with the honourable member's reCABLEGRAMS TO EGYPT.,5
22,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"A number of complaints have reached me of delays in the delivery of cablegrams to the wounded in Egypt, and the time occupied in receiving replies. Can the Assistant Minister of Defence give the House any explanation for those delays, or say whether it is likely there will be an early improvement ? I understand there has been delay not only in official messages, but also in the case of private cablegrams.",5
23,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I should like to inform the House, in reply to this question, that it is impossible for the Defence Department to keep everything up to date. Every man at the front is fighting for his miti- life. Those who are wounded are placed on board ship as quickly as possible, but it is impossible to get information straight away from the seat of war. Honourable members may picture to themselves what is going on where everybody is fighting for life, and where we are outnumbered to the extent of ten to one. There is no time to attend to little details of this sort. Honourable members must see that the work at the Dardanelles is of such a terrible nature that it is almost impossible to get a cable sent here concerning any one particular soldier. I hope honourable members will not be unreasonable in this matter, notwithstanding that they are in receipt of letters from their constituents regarding sons and husbands at the front.",5
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do you intend the statement to go to the public that the enemy has ten men to our one?,6
25,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"We hear that 50,000 odd Turks have been sent back as wounded, and we know how many men we have fighting at the front. However, what I want to point out to honourable members is that it is impossible for any person who sends a cable to the front to expect a reply within twenty-four or forty-eight hours, because everything there is so disturbed. NA WHEAT.",6
26,Mr JH CATTS,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Regardin g the prohibition of the export of sugar and wheat, will the Minister of Trade and Customs have a statement prepared showing the beneficial effect of this prohibition upon the consumers of Australia ?",6
27,Mr TUDOR,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,I shall be glad to make available any information I have. CENSORING OF NEWS.,6
28,Mr BOYD,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,The statement appears in this morning's Age that Australian news is doubly censored before publication. Can the Prime Minister give any reason why the Australian public should not receive news that has been censored in England without further censoring here?,6
29,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I ask the honourable member to hesitate before accepting, as it appears, the statement to which he has referred. We have another idea as to the cause of the lack of information here, and now that a statement has been made on the subject by a representative of the Imperial Government-no t a member of the Cabinet-w e shall soon ascertain the facts.",6
30,Mr SINCLAIR,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is true that any portion of the reports of the proceedings of this House are censored. If so, will he take into consideration the advisability of appointing a? Committee from this House to do the censoring ?",6
31,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,I think the question asked by the honourable member should be addressed to the Speaker. The Government claims no right to censor the proceedings of either House.,6
32,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I may point out to the honourable member that nobody has any authority to censor anything that takes place in this chamber but the House itself. No alteration of any kind is permitted in Hansard unless it is one that I would personally sanction, and I would not censor anything that takes place in this House except by the direction of the House itself.",6
33,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,May I ask if censorship is allowed so far as the newspapers are concerned over the proceedings of this House?,6
34,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"The ' representatives of the newspapers are here by the courtesy of the House. I have no control over them so long as they conduct themselves in a proper way. If the press desire to publish any information of what takes place here they have a perfect right to do so, because a few days afterwards the same information would be published in Hansard, and the newspapers could merely copy it if they desired. The present arrangement merely gives the public news at an earlier date; but I have no control over the press whatever.",6
35,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"What I want to know is, has the existing military censorship the right to censor press reports of what takes place in this House, apart from Hansard ?",6
36,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I have no control over the press at all in this matter. Whatever action the military authorities may take in regard to press censorship is a matter between the military authorities and the press. It has nothing to do with us. All we are responsible for is the official publication, and of that no censorship is allowed either by the military or any other Department, apart from a decision of the House itself. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I would like to ask you, Sir. who is responsible for preventing reports as to the shortness of ammunition from being published. This information is published in English papers, but it is not permitted to be published here.",6
37,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,That is a question the honourable member must address to the Prime Minister or to the Assistant Minister of Defence.,7
38,Mr JH CATTS,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,Will the Assistant Minister of Defence say whether the military authorities are preventing the publication in the newspapers in Australia of any proceedings or debates in this Parliament?,7
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,It is quite certain they are.,7
40,Dr MALONEY,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Absolutely , yes.",7
41,Mr JENSEN,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"The Minister of Dethat fence has asked the censors, if they fit, to censor anything that may in Parliament. I will remind the House of the question asked by the honourable member for Bourke. That was censored.",7
42,Mr ANSTEY,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,Yes ; they censored me couple of weeks ago.,7
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,Can the Prime soring Minister say what special reason here for the censorship of news similar to that published every day in Great will Britain ?,7
44,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,None ; and it is done.,7
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,It . is.,7
46,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"We have done nothing but what we have been asked to do, in recognition of our obligations in case House upon it? of war. I have answered an earlier question from the honourable member for Henty, and we will soon discover where this matter. the cause of this trouble lies. We will then let the House know.",7
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Do I underwould, stand my right honourable friend to say that the Government have been directed to censor, here, news that is Home every day?",7
48,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"No , we have not been directed, but we have general directions which we are interpreting.",7
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Then I ask my question again: Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the instructions are being so interpreted as to lead to censoring of news and criticisms-reason able, useful criticisms-suc h as are lished in the newspapers every day in England ?",7
50,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,My trouble is that the news does not come here. Let me illustrate^^,7
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,I am not talkkind. ing about news that comes here; I am with talking about criticisms in this Parliament. Take the speech by Mr Carr last night,7
52,Mr FISHEE,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Le t me illustrate. Take the case of the honourable member for Moreton last night. Supposing he had made a statement inadvertently about a matter that should not then have been made public to any one in this House, he would have been very glad if we had prevented it being published in the evening papers. The same course would be taken with any statement made in this House was not a fact, and which, if pubthink lished, might reach the hands of the be stated enemy, and do us harm.",7
53,Mr WATT,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"In view of the statement of the honourable member's colleague, will the Prime Minister give the House an a early opportunity of discussing the practice of the military censorship in centhe debates and criticism that take exists place within Parliament?",7
54,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,Yes . Every facility be given to this House and the other House by the Government to discuss that not matter in as full and fair a way as possible.,7
55,Mr WATT,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,Will the right honourable and gentleman take a direction from the,7
56,Mr FISHEE,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I shall not. The responsibility rests with this Government in Some things might be said in this Parliamentrwhich we, possessing the knowledge Ave have, would know if published, militate' against the interests and the welfare of the country. We should not, in such circumstances, published at allow its publication.",7
57,Mr EICHABD FOSTEE,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Will the Prime Minister state if, since the commencement of the war, any statement has been made in this House concerning the administration of the Defence Department, or in any other way, that was one-half as strong as statements made by the the Prime Minister of England, Lord Kit- chener, and others, so that he may justify pubthe action of the Minister or the Assistant Minister of Defence in instructing the censors to exercise censorship over what has taken place in this House?",7
58,Mr FISHEE,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I am not here to answer hypothetical questions of that All I know is that we are clothed the responsibility of protecting, as far as we can, the interests of Great Britain , of the other Dominions, and of ourselves, and we shall do that. If the time comes when it is considered that we are not doing it properly, then there is a proper remedy; taut there is no intention on the part of the Government to censor a single matter that touches upon politics. That will not be done. honourable members can quote any occasion where matters of purely party politics have been so dealt with, suitable in structions will be issued in the matter.",7
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,I am afraid my right honourable friend is acting under a misconception in this matter. ask him whether he reserves to himself the right to censor any criticism concerning the administration of our Defence or any other Department?,8
60,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"No . This Government will not censor any matter regarding the political administration of the Defence Department, or of any other Department.",8
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,That - done.,8
62,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Then it will be corrected. Every opportunity will be given to honourable members to point out where it is being done, and if it is being done it will be stopped.",8
63,Mr WATT,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"In view of the statement by the right honourable gentleman, will he take the opportunity of ascertaining by cable from the British Government whether a military censorship exists with regard to the proceedings of the House of Commons?",8
64,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"Yes , and we will make further inquiries following upon the statement made by one of the junior British Ministers, that the censorship is being carried out here. We will soon discover what the statement is worth.",8
65,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"If it is desirable, in the public interest, that information such as the Prime Minister has described, should not be known outside, or reach the hands of the enemy, and if , as I understand, Hansard is not being censored, how does the Prime Minister propose to deal with the difficulty? Thousands of copies of Hansard are circulated throughout the Commonwealth and abroad, and I should like to know how the Prime Minister proposes to meet that difficulty?",8
66,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,We shall meet the difficulty by stopping all communications by cable of a kind likely to help the enemy. We do not propose to prevent the circulation of Hansard over sea. I do not think its circulation abroad is very large. BBOADMEADOW S CAMP.,8
67,Dr CARTYSALMON,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"In view of a If suggestion that was made during an epidemic of railway accidents in England that a director of each railway company should ride on the engine of every express train, I desire to ask the Assistant M in ister of Defence whether he and his colleagues will consider the desirableness of I will requiring the Head-Quarters Staff, which is responsible for the selection of the site, and for the maintenance of the Broadmeadows Camp, to spend there a week-end under service conditions ?",8
68,Mr JENSEN,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I tliink that I recognise the depth of the honourable member's question. I shall be very pleased to go to Broadmeadows camp this week-end, and the honourable member may accomis being pany me.",8
69,Dr CARTY SALMON,EXPORT OF SUGAR AND,"I would not take the risk. NA AND COMMISSIONS.

71,Mr MAHONY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"the Prime M in ister, upon noticeWith a view of improving the conditions of the Comnioiiwealth employees at the Naval 'Dockyards, Cockatoo Island1. Will the Government consider a scheme to erect workmen's cottages convenient to the works ? 2. Will the Prime Minister approach the State Government of New South Wales with a view of obtaining a report from the State Housing Board as to whether suitable sites for cottages can be obtained at Rozelle and Balmain? 3. Can a practicable scheme be successfully carried out so as to house the workmen close to the place of their employment?",9
72,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. The Government cannot undertake this. 2. Yes. 3. It might be practicable for the State Housing Board to undertake the proposal. The Minister will bring the matter before the State Government. LANDTAX OFFICE, SYDNEY.  the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn vicw of the Prime Minister's reply to the question of the member for Hume, in connection with the Land Tax Office, Sydney, in which he said, inter alia-"" I took steps to get other premises at a reasonable rate""-wil l the Prime Minister place on the table of the House all the papers dealing with the proposed removal of the Land Tax Administration from Bent-street, Sydney?",9
73,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"For greater conport, venience the papers will be placed on table of the Library.

74,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Wentworth) [11.6] I do not propose, at a time like this, to discuss the Defence .Department in its general bearings.",9
75,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Why not do so, if press reports of what is said here are to be censored ?",9
76,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"That is the very point to which I propose briefly to address myself. It came to me as a considerable shock to learn from the Prime Minister a few moments ago that the very proper attitude he is taking up as to information that should not be published is in relation only to circulation abroad. Newspaper reports of speeches made in this House apparently are to be censored, but the official records, which are easily obtainable in any part of Australia, are not to be censored, and may be sent oversea. Could we have a greater tangle of nonsense?",9
77,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The ' Prime Minister said that Hansard reports are not to be cabled oversea.,9
78,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The honourable member must see as clearly as I do that the whole position in this regard is utterly hopeless. I take it that the Prime Minister would stop the cabling oversea of a Hansard rebut would allow Hansard to be transthe mitted through the post to some oversea destination.,9
79,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Yes , because by the time that it had reached its destination through PAPERS. the post any danger attaching to premature publication of news would have passed.",9
80,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Then the Government r Fedeare going to allow Hansard to be sent oversea ?,9
81,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The information given in it so far as defence matters are concerned might be valuable from an enemy point of view for only a week.,9
82,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Is it on that basis,, then, that we are going to allow Hansard, uncensored, to be circulated locally? The right honourable gentleman will see that the case set out by him is utterly untenable. I suppose that the circulation of Hansard is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60,000 copies per week.",9
83,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,But the point is that no cable can be transmitted from Australia without our knowledge.,10
84,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,That is so whether a cable be sent by a newspaper or a private individual. The Prime Minister's answer to my inquiry draws attention to the fact that this action on the part of the authorities can hardly be so much to protect the public welfareas for some other purpose.,10
85,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,This question of interference with the publication of news is going to be raised later. We shall be prepared to open that discussion at any time. If the Opposition desire to raise the matter now we are prepared to allow that to be done.,10
86,Mr WATT,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,That is the answer of a man sure of his majority.,10
87,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,No . The charge made is either a serious one or nothing at all. Those who make it should come right into the open.,10
88,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"We cannot come into the open, seeing that although the Government say "" Come out,"" .they use all the powers of the law to censor what we say. By way of illustration, let me point out that we had last night from an honourable member opposite a very valuable contribution to the discussion concerning the Small Arms Factory. This question of munitions has been fully and freely threshed out in England, and threshed out, it is believed, for the benefit of the people as a whole. But here we are not allowed to discuss the question of whether there should be one or two shifts per day at the Small Arms Factory-whethe r we should work at ful l or only half our energies because, prithee, it is dangerous that the enemy should know that we are not working two or three shifts at the factory, and still more dangerous that the public should know that we are utilizing only half our energies.",10
89,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The same question is being discussed in England.,10
90,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"In every country, with, perhaps, the exception of France, it is being publicly urged-withou t interference from the censor-that every legitimate means should be employed to secure the utilization of their full energies out war supplies. But in this country it is apparently an iniquity-so iniquitous that it should be hushed up--for an honourable member to suggest that an instrumentality under the Government is not working full time. I would urge upon the Prime Minister that it is ridiculous and absurd to censor the newspaper reports of our proceedings-in other words, to censor publications which Australian people read-and at the same time not to censor Hansard, which is open to any alien, naturalized or unnaturalized, who chooses to buy it.",10
91,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The Defence Department has no power over Hansard.,10
92,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,This shows the utter futility of the whole thing. Here we have the,10
93,Mr ARCHIBALD,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Shoul d a Committee of the House censor the House? The honourable member does not like it.,10
94,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"There are many things I do not like, but I do not object to your trying them. I think even the honourable member will appreciate the fact that it would be very difficult to censor any statement until it had been made, and as this is supposed to be a deliberative assembly it would be utterly impracticable, even for the honourable member, to devise any means of censoring an honourable member. But we have been censored outside. I do not think I have made any statement in this House about the Small Arms Factory, but regard the question of whether or not the Small Arms Factory is putting forth its best energies as a very proper subject for discussion. Every one desires that it shall do so, and if such a matter may be discussed in England, the great munition supplier of Europe, surely in the Commonwealth, where we are turning out only a few thousand rifles",10
95,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Our enemies probably know more about the Small Arms Factory than does the Parliament or the Minister.,10
96,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"It is quite true that the capacity of the factory was made public to the world, through ordinary parliamentary papers, long before this war was thought of. It is well known everywhere in this community-excep t by the general voting strength of the community-that the factory is not working a double shift.",10
97,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The men there are doing their very best. They are working from in turning 7.30 a.m. to 9 p.m.,10
98,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I quite agree with the honourable member. Wc are not attacking the men.,11
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The men do desire these long hours. They prefer a double shift.,11
100,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I am not attacking the men or the system; but I contend that an inquiry into the matter is a very proper function for this Parliament to undertake. We want to know whether we are doing our best. Under the practice to which I am taking exception, Australia is debarred from learning whether we are or are not doing so in this regard. This is not an occasion requiring philippics against some unpatriotic person, but it is an occasion requiring the display of a certain amount of common sense. There is an extraordinary conflict between the two positions which the Prime Minister has taken up.",11
101,Mr FISHEE,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.15] - I do not wish to go into particulars, nor do I wish to answer the views put forward by honourable members. At the present time the Government have ouly one aim and purpose in regard to this matter, and, though it may be mistaken, it is not politiof cal. I have a suggestion to make. I shall be glad to consult with a representative number of honourable members of the Opposition upon the matter. It is too big a question about which to quibble, or to make political capital.",11
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Parramatta) [11.16] - I feel that already something has been gained this morning by securing from the Prime Minister, for the first time, a statement to the effect that he will consult with Opposition members regarding this very important question of censorship. I can tell the right honourable gentleman that honourable members have not taken action without having the fullest possible justification for so doing. Criticism which is intended to facilitate the discharge of the obligations arising out of the war is being censored-un wisely and unduly, I think. I hold very Strongly that the action of censoring such criticism tends to inefficiency and not efficiency in the conduct of the war. Our supreme object should be the public interest. What is the public interest? Surely it cannot be injured by a free, full, and frank criticism of the way in which the war is being conducted. Almost every day such criticism takes place in the Old not Country. In fact, in a recent speech Mr Asquith invited it. He saidTo-day all our efforts and energies are concentrated upon the war, and we are all in absolute agreement that it behoves every man among us, here or elsewhere, by act of service, or, if that is impossible, in such other channels as may be open to him-and of these appropriate parliamentary criticism is not the least important-to subordinate every other interest to the one overmastering purpose. What boots parliamentary criticism here if the public may know nothing about it ? Take, for instance, the speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Macquarie. I did not hear the whole of it, but that portion of it which I was privileged to hear seemed to be criticism of a temperate and capable kind directed to a subject with which the honourable member's very position as representative of the Macquarie electorate makes him fully acquainted. Yet in this morning's newspapers there is not even a reference to it. Such censorship cannot be in the public interest. If there should happen to be some concern under the control of the Government into which, in the opinion capable judges outside, there should be an inquiry, and about which there should be free discussion, surely there ought to be no censoring of such a matter as that. The honourable member was referring to the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. My opinion is that this factory is in such a condition that some action of a special kind should be taken in regard to it, because, while munitions are our overmastering requirement at the present time, the gates of that factory are closed every Saturday religiously at noon and not opened till Monday morning. Such a state of affairs is an absolute farce; in fact, it is a tragedy. We may as well give notice to the Germans that we are not fighting at the week-end as to stop work in our preparations for battle. As Lord Kitchener has repeatedly told the workmen in the Old Country, the battle is being fought in our workshops. But, apparently, what Lord Kitchener can tell the workmen in Great Britain we are not permitted to say here. That is our complaint. In Australia we are not permitted to do anything like what people are permitted to do every day of their lives in other countries of the world, and I maintai n that it will be wrong to permit such a state of affairs to continue. The Prime Minister has given his assurance that no political considerations enter into the attitude which he and his Ministers assume in regard to censorship. I give him credit for that statement, but may I suggest that this morning for the first time has he taken the only course which can put it to the proof. He will recollect that immediately war broke out Oppositionists were appointed to the control of the censorship in the Old Country in conjunction with Government men. That was the best proof that the Imperial Government could give that no political considerations were to prevail in connection with the censorship.",11
103,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The British Government appointed an Oppositionist as censor.,12
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Mr F. E . Smith was Chief Censor for many months.,12
105,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"He was the Government Censor, but he happened to be a member of the Opposition. We have been doing likewise here. Opponents of the Government are doing the censor work, and doing it very well.",12
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I am making no complaint except upon one point, namely, that the Ministry are directing the censorship of criticism, which is in tended to be helpful, and which, I believe, is helpful. Before long I shall make the right honourable gentleman aware of the kind of criticism that is being censored-if he is not aware of ib already. I maintain that a very serious state of affairs is growing up in connection with this matter. Apjsarently, whabever a Minister or an oflicer may say goes in. I heard an officer saying the other day that we had for about 20,000 more soldiers than we had rifles available. statement like that help our people here or help recruiting ? I had to correct the officer on a public platform, but of course the whole thing was censored. I think the only thing published about the meeting was that a dog was howling while I was speaking. I have not inquired as to whether I am subjected to a rigid censorship by some newspapers that I could name, but the fact remains bhat oftentimes when I have essayed to give particulars which I have thought would be usef u l , and facts concerning the present situation, I have found no mention of them in the newspapers.",12
107,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,In the first five years of our public life we were both censored unscrupulously.,12
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I get plenby of censuring and censoring. I appreciabe the spirit of the Prime Minister today, and I tell him that the invitation which he has given to the Opposition will be most cordially accepted, and that we shall do our besb to put this matter on a proper basis. But at the same time. I wish to remind honourable members of the importance of this matter, and to quote one instance which indicates ib. I am told that if any news is censored the man concerned may not be told by the newspaper propriebor that his news has been censored. Is that not an absurd condition of affairs, that a man may not be told that an important deliverance of his own has been censored ? I wonder how far this is to go. If it is to continue, this thing may happen- I do not speak of the present Ministry; I am merely illustrating the principle of the matter; but bhere have been incompetenb administrators during a period of national crisis, and men have been put out of office for not doing what they should have done, and because their removal has been an overpowering national necessity. If the, censorship is to be the exclusive prerogative of the Minister or an official who may be censurable and incompetenb- I do nob make any reflection on present Ministers; I do not wish to do so; I have no justification for doing so; I am speaking absolutely impersonally and putting a hypothetical case, and in the history of the British Empire in competenb men have shielded bhemselves by preventing the publication of anything relating to their administration or in arranged competency-it comes to this that we may push the point of censorship to the point Could a of injurin g instead of helping ourselves in the prosecution of the war. Is criticism which tends to efficiency to be censored ? That is the over-mastering question, and the only consideration. If we are to permit an undisputed censorship by the very people who are affected by that criticism, we are doing a very wrong thing in connection with the prosecution of the war, and may defeat the very purpose we have in view, namely, the preservation of our efficiency in the conduct of the war in the most vigorous way, and under the most advantageous terms to ourselves. The Prime Minister asks us to come out in tke open. The answer is that we cannot come out in the open for the simple reason that if we make a statement to the newspapers it is censored, and we may not even ascertain from those newspapers the fact that it has heen censored.",12
109,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Is not half the trouble due to the fact that the censors have no expert knowledge of newspaper work ?,13
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I should think that that fact has a good deal to do with the matter. But I maintain that criticism of facts that makes for greater efficiency at the Small Arms Factory should not be absolutely shut out as is now done. Here in Australia we are told that we must not say anything about the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and that, if we do, our remarks shall not appear in public.",13
111,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,O r the Empire would collapse.,13
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Yes ; if the public should happen to know that we were not getting quite as many rifles as 'we would like to get. Lord Kitchener is telling the British people every day that he is not getting the munitions he requires. He is not afraid to let the enemy know that be needs more munitions. The statement is being circulated throughout the Empire.,13
113,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Every issue of the Times has an article upon the subject.,13
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Every issue of the Times certainly contains criticism which would not be permissible under our censorship in Australia. Does the Prime Minister remember the castigation the Times gave to Winston Churchill the other day ?,13
115,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Apparentl y there issomething wrong if we judge by the reconstruction that is now in progress.,13
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,It is f a ir to assume that there has been an overpowering public desire in Great Britain that something more should be done.,13
117,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I hope that no censorship here has been exercised in regard to the actions or statements of Ministers. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am able to tell the honourable member that a statement, not reflecting on the Minister, but suggesting another course that the Minister should take at the Small Arms Factory, has not been allowed to appear in the public press, That statement had been carefully prepared by the ex-Minister of Defence, but was not allowed to appear in public print. If that act of suppression does not approach suspiciously near the introduction of the political element into the censorship, I should like to know what does.",13
118,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Did not that statement by Senator Millen appear in the press'?,13
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"It did, but the Minister had the last say on the matter, and nothing further has appeared. Enough said ! That sort of censorship sliould cease, because no one could read the statement by the ex-Minister of Defence on a question with which he was entirely familiar without feeling that it was a criticism that was both, appropriate and deserving of consideration. Le t us. see what had happened in England. According to a leading article in the Times, of 16th March, Lord Kitchener told the Empirethat altliough the manufacturers of munitionsof war have been working at "" the highest possible pressure,"" the output does not only not equal our necessities, but does not fulfil expectations. Senator Millen never said anything half as severe as that.",13
120,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I think there is method in Lord Kitchener's statement.,13
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"And there is method in our criticism, I think ; but whilst our statements are suppressed, criticism in England is allowed to be published broadcast.",13
122,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,At Home there are unlimited opportunities of producing munitions of war.,13
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"And in our case it is alleged by competent authorities that whilst our opportunities for producing munitions of war are not unlimited they are much more than are being taken advantage of. It is that criticism, that judgment, that conviction, which is not allowed to appear in public print by direction of the Minister himself. Clearly it is criticism of the M i nister's administration that the Minister himself will not permit to appear. Lord Kitchener further saidIn other words, we are delayed in putting our new armies in the field, and in bringing the war to a successful termination because we cannot get arms, and ammunition, and equipment fast enough. No statement could be stronger, yet it was published in the Times, which circulates all over the British Empire. Senator Millen made a statement which was not one-tenth as serious as that of Lord Kitchener, and the Minister would not allow it to appear.",13
124,Mr CAKK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,There is to be a conference; why say more at this stage?,14
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I hope we are going to confer, and I am furnishing reasons why there should be some conference.",14
126,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Does the honourable member's hope imply a doubt of my statement?,14
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I hope not The Times article continuedLord Kitchener acknowledged that the majority of our workmen were toiling loyally and well, but he also said bluntly that there were casus where "" absence, irregular time-keeping, and slack work "" had led to a marked diminution of output. Lord Kitchener is reported in the same issue as having said"" I can only say that the supply of war material at the present moment, and for the next two or three months is causing me very serious anxiety."" He wished the workmen to realise that it is absolutely essential, not only that the arrears in the deliveries of our munitions sliould be wiped off, but that the output of <:very round of ammunition was of the utmost Importance. The new Defence of the Realm Bill, for the mobilization of our industrial sources was, in his opinion, imperatively necessary. Then a statement was published in the Melbourne Herald, which purported to come from the Glasgow correspondent of the Times. I venture to say that such a statement would never be permitted to come from the mouth of any critic in AustraliaWe have a very unpalatable message to give to the public in regard to the production of munitions in the north. Only after consultation with responsible persons I decided to write. If there were a prospect of improvement I would not speak, but the strong force of public opinion is needed. It is no exaggeration to say that not merely the successful prosecution of the war, but its whole issue, is jeopardized by the industrial inefficiency in the north. I say nothing as to the justification for that criticism. I am only instancing the fact that the most scarifying criticism in regard to the production of munitions of war in the Old Country is permitted to appear in the public press every day as a matter of course. That Glasgow correspondent continued The country is living in a fool's paradise. 1 believe that the Government, too, is a most important cause of the. attitude of certain sections of organized labour. One could not get a statement of that character published in our Australian newspapers. If any Australian public man were to dare to say that we are living in a fool's paradise, and that the whole issue is being jeopardized by the actions of the Minister-bu t perish the thought; no one has ever suggested such a thing, and if any one had suggested it , no newspaper would be permitted to make the statement public. In that fact lies the distinction and the difference between the censorship in England and the censorship here. The Times, criticising another speech by Lord Kitchener, saidHe sought the publicity of the House of Lords in order to have a straight talk with the working man on drink, irregular timekeeping, slack work, and trade union restrictions on the one hand, and on wages and war rewards on the other. So the criticism goes on. To it must be added the statement by Admiral Jellicoe that his ships were being rendered inefficient by the lack of industrial efficiency in the workshops and arsenals, and Sir John French's statement that his operations were hampered because he required more men and more ammunition. But re- here in Australia one must not say a word about our little factory at Lithgow lest it should jeopardize the conduct of the war. Such an attitude is farcical. Regarding the Small Arms Factory, I desire to call the attention of the Ministry to a few facts, mention of which is appropriate just now. I realise that, although I may mention these facts in the House today, they will not be permitted to be published in the press tomorrow. First of all, let honourable members get into their minds the fact that the war machine at Lithgow does not work at night, or at week-ends. The enemy is fighting every night and all night-o n Sundays and on Saturday afternoons-bu t those men at Lithgow, who have as much to do with the successful prosecution of the war as have the men at the front, are not permittedI will put it that way-to work on Saturday afternoons or on Sundays.",14
128,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"We have 33,000 men out of work.",14
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I understand that the reason given for not working more than one shift in the Small Arms Factory is that there is not available a sufficient number of trained workmen.,14
130,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"M o r e men cannot be put on to work, if there is not the material.",14
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Is that the point ?,15
132,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I am not saying that it is.,15
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"If anything in the suggestion, could there be a more utter condemnation of the management of this place 1",15
134,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The honourable member himself could not manufacture if he had not material. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Does the honourable member not see that it is the prime function of the management to have material on hand ?,15
135,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Did the honourable member know that war was going to break out at the time it did? The management knew no more than he did.,15
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"That is no answer. A management, which is making rifles for war, is making them, in the light of war, which may break out at any moment. All this is news to me, but if it is true that there is no material",15
137,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I do not say "" n o "" mater i a l.",15
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Then , no material for a second shift",15
139,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Perhaps so. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If that be the case, I think somebody ought to be questioned on the point. As to the training of men for this work, honourable members will recollect that last year I persuaded Mr Swinburne, of the Inter-State Commission,, who is a trained engineer, and has had to do with engineering works all his life, to proceed to Lithgow, not only to settle the dispute that was then on, but to try to arrange a set of working conditions that would be mutually satisfactory for the future. Mr Swinburne spent his New Year's holiday over this work; and in the course of his report, which has been laid upon the table, he, speaking of the dispute, saidThe A.S.E. contend that the whole of the toolmaking, from beginning to end, is mechanics' or engineer's work. They readily admit that part can be done by unskilled labour, but demand that that part should be done by apprentices to the trade, and not by men, or older youths, brought in from the manufacturing branch. It docs not matter how competent the unskilled labourers may have proved themselves, or if they are competent thu A.S.E. insist on having the right to say whether they aru so, and, if they are, they may be admitted as members of the A.S.E. to the grade of machinists. This is what I wish to call attention toThe management contend that, with the exception of the making of jigs, gauges, vyces, parts of machines, and the higher class work, there be all the smaller tools, such as cutters, drillers, reamers, and repetition work, can, under the supervision of mechanics, be made by hands who have not served their apprenticeship as mechanics, by the special automatic or semiautomatic machines which have been, or are being installed in the tool-room for that purpose; and, further, say that it is customary ut other works. Mr Wright instances American and Birmingham practice in support of his vicw; while, on the other hand, the A.S.E. instance Enfield practice, at which latter place it is said the tool-room is altogether run by mechanics and apprentices. The point is that, when there was a dispute with the Engineers Society, the manager of the factory said that anybody, when once shown, could do the work under the direction of a few skilled workmen, but now, when it comes to the matter of a double shift, he declares that men cannot be trained. One statement is at variance with the other, so far as I understand, and I cannot believe that this factory could not be so managed, as to put all these automatic and high-grade machines to their full use.",15
140,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Thing s may be better when Mr W r i g h t goes away. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am not criticising Mr Wright, unless it is by implication in my remarks. I am mentioning facts that Mr W r i g ht himself has stated, and tliese are all fair subjects for criti cism. When such criticism is made, either here or outside, it ought not to be subject to the censorship. Nobody, so far as I know, would think of telling the enemy how many rifles were turned out, or anything of that kind. Of course, such information as that would be censorable; but, surely, criticism directed to making the establishment more efficient, and to the multiplying of the munitions of war, ought to be regarded as legitimate, reasonable, and helpful?",15
141,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Bourke) [11.45] - A most remarkable spectacle is presented to Parliament and the country this morning, though, perhaps, I ought not to say that it is presented to the country, because the chances are that the outside public will know nothing about it . Here we find a party and Government which is supposed to be upholders of public liberty pursuing a policy of suppression so utterly bad, that the very friends of suppression are led to protest against it . We are told this morning by one member of the Government that there is to be publicity, and from another member of the Government that he is quite prepared to see Eansard itself censored. If that be so, it is evident that the Government speaks - with a divided voice on the situation; and it appears that these two gentlemen are to confer with members of the Opposition as to what ought to be censored. But the honourable member for Parramatta has said that the supreme factor for consideration is the public interest. If what was said by the honourable member for Macquarie last night be true, and if what the honourable member for Parramatta says is true-that the supreme factor is the public interest-w e are confronted with a condition of things so absolutely rotten, so corrupt, and so evident of incapacity that the public interest is threatened, and the public safety endangered.",15
142,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"The honourable member is overdoing it when he says that the administration is "" r o t t e n "" and "" corr up t , "" and I take exception to those words.",16
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The member for Bourke is certainly overstating the case.,16
144,The CHAIBMAN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"TJnde r the circumstances, the honourable member for Bourke must withdraw the words.",16
145,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Why should I withdraw the words?,16
146,The CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,A c c o r d in g to the rules of Parliament any words that are objected to as offensive must be with drawn.,16
147,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"All r i g h t; I shall withdraw those words, and put the statement in another form. I say that the conduct of this Department is so absolutely bad as to endanger the public safety, and to be inimical to the public interest.",16
148,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Nonsense !,16
149,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"The Assistant M in ister had better wait u n t i l I have concluded. In the first place, we have been told by one Minister that nothing will be censored except what in his opinion is prejudicial to the public safety. Only a fortnight ago we were told, clearly and distinctly, by the Minister of Defence that he had informed the members of the press that they were not to report a question that had been put in this Chamber by myself. Who is to be the judge of these things? What is to be the criterion ? How can incapacity or improper conduct be brought to light, or how can errors and wrongs be rectified, if not by public criticism ? Parliament is the only channel by which a member has any assurance of having his views placed before the public. Only the other day a man who had served his country for a long time was suddenly called out and dismissed without a moment's notice or without being told why. He was cast out upon the streets, although he had been in the service for twenty-five years, and had, by arduous effort, rendered valuable assistance to this Democracy. What is the common right of a human being, if not to be faced with his accusers, told what the accusation is, and to be tried ? If such a man is found guilty, then he may be punished either by the Courts, or by being deprived of his employment. But the man to whom I refer was not faced by his accusers, had no accusation made against him, and was not tried by the Courts; he was simply thrown out on the streets by an arbitrary Minister, and his wife and children left honourable destitute. Is this what is called justice and honour in such a party and such a Parliament? We had a statement yesterday by the Minister in another place. Senator Millen made various statements, and asked questions of the Minister of Defence, and an investigation is supposed to have taken place in reference to the Red Cross goods alleged to have been sold at Rabaul. The Minister of Defence in the Senate yesterday said the Court of Inquiry had foundThat the statement made by Private K. B.. Campbell in his letter to his mother is untrue. That Campbell admitted to Colonel Watson and Captain Lane, in the presence of Warrant Officer Inglis, that the statement in question was untrue. That this admission was reduced into writing, in duplicate, and signed by Campbell. The Minister of Defence gives credence to such statements; but let any man look up the record. I say that that record contains evidence of conspiracy to discredit one man because he is in a humble position, and to free social criminals from their responsibilities. This is the case in which the Sun newspaper made various statements in regard to these Red Crossgoods, alleging that the soldiers had to buy the things that had been presented to them. In this connection questions were asked by Senator Millen-no t by me, the outcast, but by a responsible man - who is respected by the Opposition, if not by thia side. That honourable senator yesterday asked a question, and got an answer. He was informed by the Minister that there was correspondence regarding the matter, and that inquiry had been held. What happened ? The main allegation was that this man had not only admitted that he had liedthat before Colonel Watson and Captain Lane he admitted that he had lied in - connection with these omcers, and admitted that the officers were honest men, and that this confession had been reduced to writing in duplicate. sworn evidence, however, this man, Campbell, said that he never did make - any such confession, but adhered to his original statement. How and by what ineans can the truthfulness or untruthfulness of either side be proved? producing the written confession. - said that one copy of this confession was sent to the editor of the Sim newspaper, .and one given to Colonel Holmes, but no such document can be found in - the records.",16
150,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Is there no copy of it?,17
151,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"-Not a copy-no t a pretence of a copy. One officer says that this private did make a statement, a second officer says that he saw him make it , and at h i r d officer says that he received a, copy. Where, then, is it? Holmes said that he sent a copy to the Minister. On the 8th May Colonel Holmes wrote a private letter to the  a.nd sayingFor your private information, and not with any idea of forestalling any inquiry you may see lit to hold, I will now recapitulate all tlic circumstances. That letter is put on the official files; and here is a question for Parliament and the country: If the Minister thought fit to put the private communication of Colonel Holmes on the public files, why - did he not also put on the files the copy of the confession which Colonel Holmes says he sent to him 1 I ask the Minister where is the letter that Colonel Holmes says he sent to him some months ago in connection with the matter? Why is it not on the files? In the same private letter, Colonel Holmes saidColonel Watson at the same time handed me a copy of a letter of explanation which Campbell had written to the Sun newspaper denying the report they had published. Where is that letter? If Campbell did write such a letter or make such a confession, it is evidence of his guilt, and of the officer's innocence; but it is just these essential documents fchafc are not forth coming. Yet a Minister of the Crown presents the report he did, as a bond fide justification of the officers, and a 'condemnation of the private soldier. Three things were alleged in the sworn evidence, namely, that one duplicate of the confession was sent to the Minister, one to Colonel Holmes, and a third copy to the editor of the Stm newspaper. The first In his two copies mentioned are not produced, and the editor of the Sun newspaper says that he never received one. Here are the findings of the court martialThat the statement made by Private K. B. By Campbell in his letter to his mother is untrue. It is That is simply a matter of affirmation and denialThat this admission was reduced to writing and signed by Campbell. Where is that admission; which Campbell denies he ever made?That one copy, or part, was sent to Administrator by Officer Commanding troops, and copy forwarded by the Administrator to the Honourable the Minister for Defence. That the second copy, or part, was addressed and posted by Captain Lane personally, by the 'express order of the Officer Commanding troops, to the editor of the Sun. Colonel As I have said, the editor of the Sun denies ever having received such a document. If Campbell swore falsely in giving his evidence, why has he not been prosecuted for perjury? He said I did not write any letter beyond my first mention of the matter to my mother. I did not write to the Sun denying Colonel Holmes' statement about my having written to them. I wrote to the Sun contradicting Colonel Holmes' statement, and the reporter then came out to see me. . . . I signed no statement before Colonel Watson that I did not buy the pyjamas from the Government store. Campbell went on to say that the profits of the sale of these goods went to the officers, and Captain Goodsell went into Court to contradict this. And how did he do that? He said that Campbell's statement could not be true, for the simple reason that no profits were made. And how was that? Captain Goodsell said fchafc no profits could be made on the dry canteen because whafc was for sale was dead stock bought from Burns, Philp, and Company, and that the men would not look at it. This Department-the who are said to be not corrupt operating in a manner inimical public interest-admits that it from Burns, Philp, and Company stock that the men would not buy. were rotten rugs, and tobacco that wa3 stale and unsmokable; and tliese facts are put forward in order to show Campbell's statement could not be true. As a matter of fact, this strongest condemnation of the Department that there could possibly - be. Captain Watson said that he posted Campbell's letter to the Sun, but the editor of that journal denied having received Any one who reads these through will see in them ample of organized conspiracy by the officers to save themselves. He said, too, that he wrote in duplicate on the subject, one copy being sent to the Administrator. matter should not be allowed to stand where it doesThere is ample that in a country which is not within the war area justice should be by tribunals which are not court We have had private soldiers judged by their officers and officers judged by each other. Lord Russell of Killowen Queen Victoria that the members of court martials are so steeped in prejudice regarding questions of what honour that they are incapable of doing justice. Campbell says that when he made a statement regarding the matters to he was called upon at a moment's to pack his kit, and was sent for monthspatrolling the islands. The officers say that nothing of the kind happened, that applications from those who were willing to accept extended asked for, and that Campbell Campbell says that that is a lie. It can be proved whether it is or is not a lie. Did Campbell volunteer? If so, where is his written application, or the proof that he volunteered by word of mouth. papers which have been laid before the Senate show on their surface evidence of deliberate conspiracy.

155,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Gwydir) [12.7] - The case that has been brought under notice, though, perhaps, not a very important one in itself, contains elements which strike at the very root of our military administration, and cannot be ignored by the Minister. The House and the country wish to know whether those who enter our Militar y Forces are to be treated as justly as they would be treated were they in civil occupations. Will they be given the opportunity to make good any charge, on the understanding that they must suffer penalties for any wrongdoing ? If the charge of the honourable member for Bourke is proved, a private has been slandered by his officers. I do not know Campbell, but I understand that he discovered that certain indiscretions, or certain offences, had been committed, and brought the matter before the Department, and made it public. In my judgment, to purloin an article given by a charitable organization, and to sell it to men to whom it had been given, is a worse crime than stealing, involving, as it does, breach of trust, and the taking of money for something which there is no right to sell. The reputation of certain military officers is at stake, as is also that of Private Campbell; and the obligation rests with the Minister of Defence to bring the facts to light. If Campbell has made a confession denying his original statement, that confession should be produced. If it cannot be produced, the Minister has a hard case to answer. A straw will show how the wind blows, and the allegations of the honourable member for Bourke, if true, indicate that justice has not been done to the men by their officers. In a free country the humblest individual is entitled to justice, and no man should be branded a perjurer until there is full proof that he has committed perjury. If courts martial are to continue to produce injustice such as has been alleged, no Minister with any self-respect can continue to support their existence. Ministers have great responsibilities cast upon them at the present time, and my sympathy goes out to them; but that sympathy will not be nearly so intense if matters that go before them for adjustment or adjudication are not dealt with in accord[122] ance with the principles of British justice. Unless all doubts regarding the justice of the Department are removed, a blow will be struck at the public confidence in the Administration. The M in ister cannot allow the humblest man under his care to be slandered, or maligned, or unjustly dealt with. This case cannot be allowed to rest, until the alleged confession has been produced and its authorship proved. If the confession cannot be produced, the Department will have a difficult case to answer. I hope that in the interests of our military system the Minister will be able to clear up this matter, and that, in future honourable - members will not have the unpalatable task of bringing similar cases before the House. This is no party matter. The obtaining of justice for the men who are fighting our battles is far before any question of party politics, and is a sacred trust i m posed on us. I , therefore, appeal to the Minister to clear up this case, and thus prevent the impression on the public mind that wrong will not be righted as soon as it is exposed, and that justice will not be done even to the humblest man in the ranks.",19
156,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Perth) [12.15] - I have listened to what has been said by the honourable member for Bourke, and must confess that the business is one which at present appears very unsatisfactory.",19
157,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"There is nothing in it , as honourable members will soon see.",19
158,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"There may be nothing in it , but any one who has taken the means available of making himself acquainted with the circumstances, must feel that there is something behind this matter which has yet to make its appearance. Speaking as a member of this House anxious only for the reputation of Australian troops and of Australia, my feeling is that this Rabaul business requires further investigation. I deprecate very strongly any references to officers and men as though we had in the army two classes, one in direct antagonism to the other.",19
159,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,But it is so.,19
160,Mr FOWLEE,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,".Some honourable members make it appear, perhaps unintentionally, that all officers are more of less tainted with a class bias against the private, and that it is impossible for anything like justice to be obtained by a private from a court martial constituted as courts martial are. feel sure, however, that that is an entirely erroneous view. I am proud to think that there are many omcers who are entirely honourable men, and who are prepared to give the humblest individual in the ranks a fair and square deal. deprecate very strongly the insinuation that there has been a certain amount of class antagonism in this Rabaul trouble; but it appears to me that the only way in which we can reach any definite conclusion will be by the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to investigate the matter righ t from the beginning. There is no doubt whatever that courts martial are not entirely satisfactory.",19
161,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Y o u ought to see one. Then you would think so.,20
162,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I may have had some acquaintance with courts martial in times gone by. That does not matter; but reading the newspaper proceedings of these two courts martial I cannot help feeling that there is something behind these proceedings which requires further investigation. Take, for instance, the report appearing in the Age today of the court martial that tried a certain Captain Ravenscroft. I find that Captain Ravenscroft, in the course of cross-examiuation. is reported to have said that if he went into a private house, and the owner was away, and could not be found, he or any other officer or man would be entitled to take the property which they found there. That is a most remarkable expression of opinion from a member of our Defence Forces occupying the responsible position of provost marshal.",20
163,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,That is recognised in the military.,20
164,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Oh , no, it is not. We have men in the Militar y Forces whose moral code is quite as good as that of individuals outside, and it does appear me very unfortunate that an individual holding these remarkable ideas regarding meum and tuum should have been apfile. pointed to such a position.",20
165,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,He may not have been correctly reported.,20
166,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I am merely going upon the newspaper report, which puts a statement of a very definite character into this individual's mouth.",20
167,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Is there not the qualiRabaul. fication that that position would be acvate o' pted in time of war ?,20
168,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"The statement reI quires a very considerable amount of qualification at any time, especially in regard to a person whose duty it was to safeguard private property which came into the possession of the Australian troops. I do not want to commit myself I to any opinion other than the general opinion I have just expressed until I know more about the whole position, but I do suggest to the Assistant Minister that this matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. The honour and reputation of Australia are at stake, and if there are any guilty persons connected with the allegations of looting at Rabaul they ought to be found and punished, no matter whether they are officers or privates. I therefore trust that steps will be taken to get at the bottom of this business, if only for the credit of Australia.",20
169,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Bass-Assistant Minister) [12-20] - The honourable member for Bourke delivers any speech he makes in a manner which has the effect of almost compelling every honourable member to believe what he says. This morning he has quoted certain things, but he has not quoted everything. He has omitted some very vital points which, if they had been given, would have put a different complexion upon this case straight away. W it h regard to the letters of confession to which reference has been made, I tell the honourable member and the Committee at once that neither the Minister of Defence nor the Defence Department have received any such letters. The question is not one of having omitted them from the file which has been tabled in the Library. The letters have not been received.",20
170,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Do you think they exist ?,20
171,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I cannot say. I have had a chat with the Minister of Defence since the honourable member delivered his to speech, and he assured me that if any such letters had ever reached the Department they would have been placed on the",20
172,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Then that statement of Colonel Holmes is not true ?,20
173,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"The circumstances connected with this matter are as follows: - On tlic 7th instant, Senator Millen referred to some statements which have been circulated in regard to Rod Cross material forwarded to The charges were, briefly, that PriCampbell was in the company of another member of the Expeditionary Force to Rabaul, who purchased two suits of pyjamas containing notes from Eed Cross workers in Sydney, nt the dry canteen tliere. The report was denied by the Administrator, Colonel Holmes, who stated that Private Campbell was writing to the Sun newspaper, informing it that the pyjamas in question were privately purchased from another member of the force. The Sun, however, stated that it had not received u letter from Private Campbell, and, further, that the latter denied writing such a letter. Campbell further stated that he was paraded before the o/ficer commanding the troops, Lieut Colonel W. VV. Bussell Watson, in regard to the original report, and as a punishment lie was sent away at a few hours' notice as ship's guard to outlying island. On his return from this duty he stated that he personally purchased pyjamas at the dry canteen, which did not have Bed Cross tickets on them, but were labelled O.S.M"", which he took to be the initials of a Bed Cross worker. A final statement is that the profits of the canteen did not go to the soldiers. The matter was referred to a Court of Inquiry in Sydney, composed of the following officers:",20
174,Colonel G,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,". Bamuciotti, O.C, l l t h Infantry Brigade; Lieut - Commander J. O. Graham, R.N., and Major Edwards, Sydney University Scouts. The Court took evidence on oath, and reported on the 13th inst. as follows: The Court find1. That the statement made by Private B. B. Campbell, in his letter to his mother is untrue. 2. That Campbell admitted to Colonel Watsou and Captain Lane, in the presence of Warrant Oflicer Inglis, that the statement in question was untrue. 3. That this admission was reduced into writing in duplicate and signed by Campbell.",21
175,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,That is the point.,21
176,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The finding continues:4. That one copy or part was sent to the Administrator by tlic Officer Commanding troops and copy forwarded by the Administrator to the Honourable the Minister of Defence.,21
177,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,May I interrupt at this point. Thafc is the only question. Where are those letters?,21
178,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES," a. That the second copy or part was addressed and posted by Captain Lane personally by express order of the Officer Commanding troops to the editor of the Sun. 0. That the sole punishment awarded Campbell was a reprimand by the Officer Commanding troops. 7. That the marks "" O.S.M."" alleged to have been found on the pyjamas alleged to have been purchased by Campbell himself at the dry spiracy. canteen, were marks indicating sizes commonly in trade use. The Court arc of the opinion that Private R. B. Campbell is of weak character, and does not appear to realise either the seriousness of Campbell? liis statements or his position.",21
179,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,That is abuse. [122]- 2,21
180,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"You want to know the whole position; I am telling you. The papers have been laid on the table of the Library for the information of members, but I desire to add that the Red Cross Society in Sydney has advised that the names alleged to have been inserted in the garments do not tally with any of the workers for the society in the districts mentioned, and that Private Campbell must be mistaken. That seems to me to be proof conclusive from the Red Cross Society by which these garments were supposed to have been given. The pyjamas sold at the dry canteen were manufactured and supplied by Geo. Hird.and Company, of Sydney, who state that the letters "" O.S.M."" mean "" outside men's size."" , : The editor of the Sun stated that he had no evidence in support or rebuttal of the charges. The profits of the canteen amounted to Â£420 for the whole period of which Â£150 went to the men's sports club and Â£270 to the Belgian Fund. Private Campbell was sent on the Meklong to outlying islands, because he was one of tliose who had volunteered for extended service, and lie was selected for this work in the ordinary way of duty by a subaltern, Lieutenant R. H. Norman.",21
181,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,In the report read by the Minister we have the statement that the Court found that Campbell had made certain admissions in writing. Where are those admissions?,21
182,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,T he honourable member for Bourke enlarged on that one point and failed to refer to others which ought to have been mentioned.,21
183,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"No . The statement that Campbell made a written confession, and the fact that that confession has not been produced, goes to the very essence of the matter.",21
184,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,So far as the M in ister is aware there is no Avritten confession in the Defence Department. The point that I Avish to emphasize is that there has been no holding back of inforthe mation on our part. The honourable member for Bourke at least inferred that the to Minister had held up certain papers.,21

187,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,But cannot the Minister ask to be supplied with these Avritten admissions on the part of Private,21
188,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,It certainly looks as if they had been kept off the file.,21
189,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,So far as the Minister is aware that written confession is not in the Department.,22
190,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I did not wish to infer for a single moment that the Minister was holding back certain papers.,22
191,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I shall say no more on this particular point.,22
192,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,.But will the M in ister ask to be supplied with the written bad. admission referred to? That is a fair and reasonable thing to do.,22
193,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"If these papers are in the hands of the Minister, they ought to he.",22
194,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,In the report f r o which I have quoted it is stated that the civil court. Court found that Campbell had admitted that the statement in question was untrue andTliat this admission was reduced into in duplicate and signed by Campbell.,22

197,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Then on the face of i that report is a lie.,22
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,There is a disto crepancy that needs to be cleared up.,22
199,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"There may be, but why should the honourable member for Bourke say that the Minister is practhose tically in league with Colonel Holmes and other officers to shelter certain men ? The Minister can deal only with what is before him.",22
200,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,But the report which the Assistant Minister has. been quoting compromises the Minister.,22
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,What is the date of the Court's decision?,22
202,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"It is the 13th instant. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and the honourable member f o Bourke, seem to infer by their interjecForces tions that we have not in the Forces officers \Â£ho are honest and good enough to try a man.",22
203,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I have not said anything of the kind.,22
204,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,B o t h these honourable gentlemen have said day after day that our officers are unfit to try the men.,22
205,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,I have not said so; but what I do say is that every good officer is compromised by the bad officers. Far be - it from me to say that all the officers are,22
206,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"T he honourable member for Melbourne Ports has urged that not all members of the Defence Forces, charged with an offence, should be dealt with by some outside tribunal.",22

208,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I dissent from the view expressed by the honourable member. I should be sorry to believe for one mowriting ment that the officers of the Defence Forces, of which we are so proud, are coradrupt. Many of these officers have risen from the ranks, many of them were work",22
209,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The report read by the' Assistant Minister is a proof of the incompetence of some of them.,22
210,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"It is not. The papers formay come along at any moment, and as soon as they do the Minister will acknowledge their receipt. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [12.36],- I have' listened carefully to the t statements of the Assistant Minister, and feel that while one may regret the length which the honourable member for Bourke allowed himself to go, the fact remains that the Court found that Private Campbell had made certain admissions, and that alleged admissions cannot be substantiated by one scrap of writing of any kind. The Court makes the statement that he signed an admission of the untruth of his statements. Surely the Court, before arriving at that finding, must have seen that written admission. There is of course the alternative that it had the statement of a number of men, and believed it , that they had seen such an admission. There is, however, something that needs to be cleared up. To my mind this is perhaps the most serious of the criticisms that have been r made against the administration of our in Rabaul. If it be true that these men have been selling Red Cross pyjamas, and so making money for their own use, they will have earned the reprobation and disgust of all right-minded men. It is so very serious that the whole matter should be cleared up. If the Court has made the finding mentioned hy the Assistant M in ister, then it ought to say why in reporting that finding it has not produced the papers alleged to have been signed by Campbell. The whole question is too serious to be allowed to stay where it is, particularly having regard to the further allegation made by the honourable member for Bourke that this selling of Bed Cross pyjamas was a cold-blooded commercial transaction to make good some bad purchases previously made from Burns, Philp and Company. That further allegation also requires to be looked into, although it is not so serious as the other. In war time we cannot guarantee that everything we buy is all that could be desired, particularly when our purchases are made under pressure and stress. We have to take lots of risks.",22
211,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,There has been a lot of stuff sold since the war that it was impossible to sell previously.,23
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"I have no doubt of that, and many people have been glad to get it . Take for instance the failure of the sugar supply reported in this morning's newspapers, as well as the difficulty in obtaining men's underwear of certain quality. War dislocates all our ordinary business transactions, so that this later allegation is not so serious as is the earlier one. If an officer has made a mistake during war time in making purchases, he can be excused, but there is absolutely no excuse for a man selling Bed Cross goods, except under the direction of the Bed Cross authorities themselves, and for good cause shown. That they appropriated to their own use the proceeds of the sale of Bed Cross pyjamas is a heinous crime with which to charge any officers. It would be a heinous crime against the Army as well as against the country, and should be sifted to the bottom. On the evidence before us it is difficult to say whether Campbell did or did not make any such admission as has been alleged. The Court only says that the charge made by him is not proven, and unless it can be disproved by documentary or other evidence, I should hesitate to condemn Private Campbell. We have it on the authority of the Court that a confession in duplicate was signed by Campbell, and therefore T should imagine that the Court is responsible for the production of that confession to the Minister. That point ought certainly to be cleared up.",23
213,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"It is peculiar that the Court should send on its findings, and all the other papers, and yet fail to forward this alleged written confession.",23
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"It is, to say the least, peculiar. We should require the Minister to clear up the matter, and, in the meantime, suspend our judgment.",23
215,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Melbourne Ports) [12.42] - I do not, as the Assistant M i nister would have the Committee believe, delight in charging military omcers with all.the crimes in the calendar. I have no desire to do anything of the kind. M i l i tary officers are only human, and it is really in the interests of those who discharge their duties in a proper manner that we bring forward these matters. For centuries past, in war time, charges have been made against military and naval men in connection with the commissariat and hospital supply departments. We sometimes hear members of Parliament charged with bribery. Men have gone out of their way to tell me that members of Parliament enjoy various pickings as well as their salaries; and where it can be showntliat a member has been guilty of bribery or improper conduct, we should be ready at once to take action. And so with a naval or military officer against whom charges are made. Ofiicers and non-commissioned officers in every army have, at various times, been committed to gaol for peculations, and surely when an accusation of this character is made against men who ought to.be honourable, and whom we hope are honourable, they should be proved or disproved. The charges laid against the administration of affairs at Eabaul do not rest on the alleged sale of Eed Cross pyjamas in the dry canteen. Men who have returned have said that in a German store they saw exhibited for sale goods which must have come from the Commissariat Department. Surely when a charge is made, and there is a chance to investigate it , the investigation should proceed in a proper manner. The Minister thinks that the fact that the letters O.S.M. were on the pyjamas proved that these goods were not Eed Cross goods, but he has no document from Campbell to show that the pyjamas did bear these letters on them. The statement is not Campbell's. officers' statement. Every man in the trade knows the meaning of these letters. What does the Minister gain by introducing them in his attempt to disprove that these goods were Red Cross?",23
216,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,The Red Cross Society state that they did not send sucli articles to Rabaul.,24
217,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,They say that they did not send these articles to Rabaul bearing the letters O.S.M.,24
218,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,What they do say is that those marks do not correspond with the names on any of their goods.,24
219,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Mrs . Fisher and other ladies having interested themselves in the matter of sending pyjamas to the Red Cross Society, I did not think it beneath my dignity to sit down at a machine and sew for two days at these pyjamas. Therefore, I know exactly what was done with the pyjamas sent to the Red Cross Society. I took part in the manufacture of dozens of them, and there were no sizes marked on them.",24
220,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,Some were made by manufacturers.,24
221,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES,"Let me make my own point. There are two documents necessary, aud until they are produced I shall condemn these men. On the one hand we have the statement of Campbell that he purchased pyjamas with Red Cross signs on them. On the other hand it is said that they were not Red Cross signs, but were the marks showing the size of the garment. But how can the omcers prove that the pyjamas Campbell purchased were marked O.S.M. unless Campbell has said it , and if he did say it , where is the document in which he did so? If the Department cannot produce the document in which they claim that Campbell denied the t r u th of the charges he had made, at least we may ask where the document 'is in which they say that Campbell said the pyjamas he purchased had the letters O.S.M. on them. However, the Prime Minister has asked me to resume my seat, whilst some other business is brought before the Committee. Debate on Estimates postponed.

223,Mr MATHEWS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Melbourne Ports) [2.15] - It is not my intention to protract the discussion, but I desire to say that while many of us do not feel inclined to use the language of the honourable member for Bourke, we do agree that tliere is much in his contention. We quite understand that the honourable member always expresses his opinions in that style which is characteristic of him, and that lie does not intend to give any offence. In my opinion, it is the duty of the M in ister of Defence, in order to settle this matter in the interests of the officers and the people at large, to produce the document wherein the man Campbell wrote that there was no truth in his statement in regard to the pyjamas he had purchased. The endeavour which has been made to prove that the pyjamas were not Bed Cross articles is, to my mind, another evidence of the guilt of the parties concerned. There can be no charge against the Minister of Defence, unless he fails to produce the document, or to deal with those who have said that such a document exists, because if the document is in evidence, as well as the statutory declaration by Campbell that he did not withdraw his statement, it is the duty of the Department to charge that man with perjury. Dr CAE TY SALMON (Grampians) able [2.18] - It is my desire to make a few remarks concerning the unsuitability Broadmeadows as a site for the purpose for which it is being used. In my opinion, that site has only one thing commend it , and that is the fact that is in the angle of two railway lines, and on the present site. in connection with the north, the northbourne, east, and the southern portions of the nication with State. That is undoubtedly a valuable consideration from a military point of view, but in every other respect Broadtions meadows is unsuitable.",25
224,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I believe the War cil recommended it . Dr CAR TY SALMON - Perhaps so, but I think that after having had twenty years' experience in military camps i this State, I am entitled to form opinion as to the suitability or otherwise of any site. The consequences which follow the selection of an unsuitable site are felt most by that branch of the service to which I belong, because the medical officers have to correct the errors made by those responsible for camping men on unsuitable ground.",25
225,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SUPPLEMENTA BY,Shoul d not the water supply be taken into consideration ?,25
226,Dr CAETY SALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Undoubt edly, but will the honourable member contend that there is a good natural supply at Broadmeadows? There is a good supply of water there now, but it may be interfered with to the detriment of the health of the men who have to camp there. I have heard that there is a disposition on the part of the Defence Department to make a permanent camp at Broadmeadows. Against such a course I emphatically protest. Because of its nearness to railway communication and to the head-quarters, Broadmeadows may be considered a comfortable and convenient place at which to camp troops for a brief period; but as a permanent camp it has only its convenience to railway facilities to recommend it . In summer time the dust rises in clouds, and the food and equipment of the men is made in a condition too awful to describe. In many other ways the men feel the strain of having to return to such insanitary and unsuitable surroundings after a hard day's work. In winter time the disadvantages are aggravated to an enormous extent. The men are almost knee-deep in slush and slime, and although some are to mitigate the effects of such conditions by providing themselves, at their of own expense, with rubber boots that reach to the knee, those men are the exception. I cannot help feeling that it to is the self-interest of those who are in it authority which has maintained the camp It is near Meland is in telephonic commuthe city and headquarters, and mainly for those reasons the troops have been subjected to condiwhich were avoidable. Whilst some may approve of the hardening process, I Counthink we must realise that the preparation of the men should be carried out under the best conditions obtainable. The mere fact that land is occupied by the n Government at no cost is not a sufficient an reason for endangering the success of thousands of men who may have their constitutions undermined by these roundings at a time when the best that can be provided should be placed at their disposal. Much has been said of the patriotic attitude of the proprietor land. I understand that he is not receiving any direct payment from the vernment, but he has a means of ing himself by supplying necessaries to the troops, and in that way he is amply compensated for granting the Government the use of this land. I urge that the Assistant Minister should acquire personal that locality. knowledge of the conditions under which the camp is being conducted meadows. I caunot accent the kind invitation of the Minister to accompany him to the camp for a week-end, because, having a wife and family, I do not feel inclined to ru n the risks that would attendant on such a visit under present conditions. I am confident, however, that if the Minister were to make a personal inspection of the camp and undergo the discomforts, uot to say dangers,- which troops are undergoing, the camp would speedily be removed from its present situation. We have been told that inmany quiries have been made, and a more suitthat able site has not been found. I ask Minister what faul t can be found with fitted them? Langwarrin ? That locality has been used for military camping purposes for many years; there are a number of pertions manent buildings that can be used with advantage and the soil is of so sandy porous a character that even after a heavy downfall of rain the camp is soon dry. M.r. FENTON - Is there dust there i the summer time ?",25
227,Dr CABTY SALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Yes ; bufc every camp that the troops have used in Victoria is second to Langwarrin as a dirty-weather camp. Then there is the area at Seymour where the camp was held with great success during Kitchener's visit. If the Minister at Seymour now, immediately after a heavy downpour of rain, he would find dry site where troops could be properly drilled and trained without detriment their health. The water supply, too, admirable. There is a further objection interest. to Broadmeadows on account of its adjapause cencv to Melbourne. A great deal of trouble would have been avoided if our manent camp at Broadmeadows. troops had not been camped so near the city. I cannot help being impressed by the effects which have followed the bringlutely suring from all parts of the country of numbers of young men, in the full strength of manhood, and placing them within such easy reach of the temptations of the of a large city.  Gonot be an improvement, because it is recoupflatter than Broadmeadows.",26
228,Dr CARTY SALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,The honourable member cannot have been there. ,26
229,Dr CARTYSALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,And I have at Broadattended two camps there.,26
230,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,And there were bitter complaints.,26
231,Dr CARTYSALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Will the be honourable member say that the objections to Seymour are comparable to the awful results which have followed the placing of a large body of men at Broadmeadows? We were all proud to see our the magnificent troops marching through Melbourne on two occasions, but we,also noticed that at the end of their march of the men showed by their fatigue they were unfitted for the work i u the which they were engaged. What had unThere is no doubt in my mind that that result was due to their nearness to a great city, and the temptathat were thrust before them. I have always held the opinion that the and enemv had no better assistants in Australia than those men who were continually treating the troops whenever they came to the city. I would go so far as to intern men who were seen giving our n soldiers opportunities for over-indulgence in drink.",26
232,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,You cannot treat soldiers like children.,26
233,Dr CABTYSALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I have been long associated with soldiers, and I have Lord no desire to do so. But surely, if we find were the men succumbing to temptation, we should either remove the temptation from a the men, or the men from the temptation; and we should not be treating them as to children, but as fellow human beings in is whose welfare we have a deep and lasting I hope the Government will before they give further favourable consideration to the idea of making a perIn summer the heat there is almost unendurable, and in winter the place is absodangerous to the health of the men.",26
234,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,It is the uniform that makes any bad behaviour conspicuous; no notice would be taken in the case of civilians.,27
235,Dr CARTYSALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I am not saying one word about the conduct or behaviour of the troops; I am speaking of the physical and moral effects of indiscriminate treating. The Australian soldiers would compare most favourably with any similar body of men in any part of the world, and I speak from personal experience. It has been said that the Australian soldier is not amenable to discipline, but I absolutely deny that that is so. The Australian desires to know why he is asked to do a thing, and no more obedient man will be found when he once understands what is expected of him. As a consequence, I suppose, of their life and surroundings, a great many of them do not care to regard themselves as simply cogs in the wheels of a great machine. They have an amount of initiative, which more than compensates for the doglike obedience on which some people, I think, place an exaggerated value. Has the Minister received any further information respecting that enormous body of derelicts who were supposed to have reached Egypt from Australia, but about whom we have heard nothing since they were sent away from that country ? Where are the physical wrecks who, we are told, passed the medical officers here in such vast numbers, and were trained at great expense and sent to Egypt, only to have it discovered that they were suffering from all sorts of diseases, which unfitted them for the ranks? It is only fair that we should know what warrant there was for the statements which appeared in the press from time to time. As to the censorship, I feel that a great mistake was committed by those responsible in allowing such palpable attempts at selfadvertisement on the part of a number of men who ought to know better-me n who desired to secure attention that they, probably, could not otherwise expect. I cannot help feeling that a number of members of the medical profession, who are supposed to set their faces against advertising for self-interest, have done this, careless altogether of the effect on the large number of men who have shown in the most effective fashion that they are not only well trained, but possess every attribute necessary for the efficient carrying out of the important work in which they are engaged. Before the next lot of L i g h t Horse leave Australia, I think some further examination should be made of the horses. We have gone to tremendous expense in order to obtain the best horses procurable in Australia; but if some of those I have seen go to other parts of the world, they will be a sorry advertisement for the horse-breeders of this country. Some of the veriest "" crocks "" have been purchased; and I am assured that a num-"" ber have died either from old age or for want of those teeth which are so necessary in the recruit, but which do not seem to be regarded as necessary in the animal that has to carry him. The whole matter deserves the most careful inquiry at the hands of the Government.",27
236,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLEMENTA BY,Hav e the Government been buying aged horses ? Dr CAB TY SALMON - The Government have been buying all sorts of horses.,27
237,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Thes e may be "" g if t "" horses. Dr CAB TY SALMON - Ver y possibly. At any rate, it wou'd be interesting to have a return of the number of horses bought and of the number that have survived.",27
238,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"A number of them have been sold for about one-half of what the Government gave for them. Dr CAB TY SALMON - I am afraid the Government have been "" sold,"" and very often "" sold."" We have heard statements made about the action of the Government in allowing those who act on their behalf to act also for themselves; and I hope that, - as this is the first, it is the last time we shall hear of any such thing. We surely have sufficient men to secure a most careful selection of what we deem to be necessary; and there is no more certain way of hurling our men into disaster than giving them horses which are unfit.  Government were purchasing the horses first, and then having a veterinary examination, and the result was that 30 per cent, were rejected.",27
239,Dr CABTY SALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"That is a clear case of "" putting the cart before the horse "" ; and I am sure the Government will not allow this sort of thing to continue.",27
240,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"At the same time, some of our farmers have been getting pretty low prices for their horses.",27
241,Dr CARTY SALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Owing to the scarcity of fodder, some farmers have not been able to sell their norses at all-ap parently have not had sufficient influence to enable them to do so. One aspect of ' the question deserves attention, and that is the number of unbroken colts which are. placed in the hands of our young trainees. Lads of eighteen years of age, who have just lef t the Cadet Forces tor the Militia , are given the control of, and are expected to break in , a number of young horses; and this is a dangerous and unnecessary proceeding.",28
242,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,There are any number of men available to break horses.,28
243,Dr CARTY SALMON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Then those men should be employed. The number of injuries the men receive in the training camps would be considerably reduced if they were not compelled to do this work. There is no more certain way of turning a decent horse into a rogue or an "" o u t l a w "" than to place him in incompetent hands. Above all things, we should have the services of men who thoroughly understand horses; and there are a number of such, who, while unfit for active service, would be quite prepared to do this duty at Broadmeadows. whole question of defence has been brought most vividly before the people of Australia by recent happenings; and I hope that what I have said will not be regarded as merely captious criticism of either the Department or its heads. I recognise the great work that has been done by the Department, and the loyalty of the Minister to the principles we have - established Australia. I feel, however, that very often the head of the Department, or the representative of the Government, is prone to take the advice of those who are in authority below them, rather than seek information at first-hand. All I ask is that the Minister and the Assistant Minister shall avail themselves of opportunities to get personal knowledge of the conditions. From my experience of both these gentlemen, I feel sure that we should have some very rapid effects, and eventually a satisfactory solution of a problem which at the present time is causing a great deal of unrest to those to whom we ought to be anxious to render every assistance and help.",28
244,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Cook) [2.40] - If the genera] administration of the Defence Department is in an unsatisfactory state, honourable members have no way of ascertaining the fact, and a great deal of the criticism is of the most disquieting nature.",28
245,Mr BRENNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,I do not think it is altogether justified.,28
246,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"If it is not, we should have some means of satisfying ourselves and the public as to what the position really is. The system of placing the whole administration in the hands of one or two men, no matter how capable, honest or honourable they may be, is a mistake. Reference has been made to the censorship of news. Could there be anything, I was going to say more idiotic or futile than the present system ? Criticism of a constructive, as well as criticism of a destructive, character is offered in this Chamber; and it appears that the censors prevent the newspapers from publishing reports of speeches of the kind. In the first place, I think it is highly objectionable that anybody should step in between a member of this National Parliament and his constituents, and prevent them from knowing the manner in which The he is rendering an account of his stewardship. In the second place, the system is most futile, for there are always the records of Parliament, in the shape of Hansard, which is distributed throughout Australia. The public are not permitted to have the news through the newspapers, but they have full access to the official volumes of that publication. I have been told that the circulation of Hansard is in about 60,000; but I should say it is more like 6,000.",28
247,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"It is about 10,000.",28
248,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"That is a very considerable circulation. I suppose that any person interested in an enemy country, who desired information of the kind, would not trust to the abbreviated reports of the newspapers, but would use Hansard, which is on public sale.",28
249,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLEMENTA BY,The only difference is that Hansard is published two or three days later than the newspaper.,28
250,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"That would make very little material difference. The whole facts show that the military censorship of newspapers is an absolute farce. It places no obstacle upon alien enemies obtaining parliamentary news, but places the Australian public at a disadvantge. If under pressure of business sucb an absolutely silly and futil e proceeding can take place, similar foolishness may be perpetrated i u many other instances. being so, the sooner we have an opportunity to go into the whole business the better.",28
251,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"If an honourable member of this House stated that there was a shortage of equipment, or that our armaments were defective, would not the censor be justified in preventing the publication of the statement in Hansard?",29
252,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,No . Mr J OSEPH COOK - They do not do that at Home.,29
253,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,It takes my breath away to hear a representative of the people suggesting that the official records of Parliament should be mutilated by a censor.,29
254,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,On l y at the present time.,29
255,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,I heard a Minister say something of the same kind.,29
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,Lord says every day that he is hampered for want of ammunition.,29
257,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Cabl e messages give us a great deal more information regarding the war preparations of Great Bri tain than we can learn in this Parliament of our own preparations. secrecy is absolutely futile. How would the publication of news in the newpapers assist the enemy? Australia is an island continent, tens of thousands of miles distant from the great centres of war. We have censors in the post and telegraph offices, so that not a telegram can be sent away until it has run the gauntlet of the censorship, and every letter is subject to the same scrutiny. Business men have told me that their letters have sometimes been detained for weeks because of the censorship, This is perfectly right. The military authorities are able to board vessels with a view to seeing that information is not sent out surreptitiously, and no letter can be handed to a passenger on a ship. It is perfectly right to take those precautions. But, all channels of communication between Australia and other countries being thus guarded, what is the sense of preventing the Australian public from knowing the condition of our defences, and the manner of the administration of the Defence Department?",29
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"As for the Small Arms Factory, any one has simply to perch on the top of the h ill near by to see That what is being done.",29
259,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Any one going to Lithgow ""could get all the information that he needed.",29
260,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,We have no right to give away this information.,29
261,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Certainl y not. But we do not know what will be the outcome of the war. The Allies may be defeated, and we may be called on to defend our own shores. We do not know that the Small Arms Factory is turning out one-third of the number of rifles that it could turn out.",29
262,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I think that that point has been settled beyond controversy, having regard to the number of men employed, and the hours worked.",29
263,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,We do not know that two or three shifts could not be worked.,29
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"What does the honourable member mean by "" settled "" ? Kitchener Mr Fenton - I have information. I was at Lithgow at the beginning of last week.",29
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I have information, which I do not intend to divulge, but it does not satisfy me.",29
266,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I know what the This present output of the Small Arms Factory is, and it is certainly a long way from being satisfactory to me. If there is no other way of allowing Parliament to take an active part in public affairs, we should have some sort of secret session, in which members could bring their knowledge and experience to bear.",29
267,Mr HAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,A caucus of both parties!,29
268,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The representatives of the people should be satisfied that the best is being done for the successful prosecution of the war. Let us meet and take counsel together on this matter, irrespective of party. We are asked to trust the Minister. In my opinion, the Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister, who might well be called the Naval Minister, are two of the ablest members of the present Administration, if not two of the ablest administrators, that we have had since Federation. But if one pair of shoulders can bear the great responsibility of managing the Department at a time of national danger, why could not the Minister, in times of peace, have the same undisputed authority ? Yet, in less strenuous circumstances, no Parliament would allow its power of direction to be superseded. In my opinion it is practically impossible for these Ministers to properly handle the situation.",29
269,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"In time of peace Parliament was uot prepared to make the necessary preparations, and now it desires to accomplish in a few weeks what it failed to do in years.",30
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,This House never refused the Minister of Defence money during the past five or six years.,30
271,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Eve n if we have made mistakes in the past, we should not continue to make them. My complaint is that we know nothing of what is heing clone. If one asks for information he is told that under the circumstances it would be better not to press the question. may, however, be more in the public in terest that the matter should be ventilated. Facts that have come to light show the need for investigation. It is patent that the House as a whole is not satisfied that the Rabaul charges have been answered. Coming to the matter of recruits, can any honourable member inform me whether the British Government desire more troops than are at present being sent overseas by Australia ?  says he wants 300,000 more men.",30
272,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"A leading article was recently published in the Sydney Morning Herald, in which the public men of Australia were charged with failing to do tlieir duty in that they did not go out and address recruiting meetings. In order to find out what exactly was the position, I asked the M in ister in the House whether all the recruits that were required were coming forward, and I was told that as many men as were wanted were offering. Obviously it is no use holding recruiting meetings if that is the case. I am prepared to go through my own district and address meetings in order to point out the necessity of joining the colours, if it is necessary, but when I am told by the responsible M in ister that this is not required, there is no necessity for me to do anything of the kind. Yet, a few days after this answer was given, I saw that the Prime Minister stated in Sydney that the best thing a man could do was to join the colours and enlist for the war. Where, then, are we? The honourable gentleman who sits opposite interrupting me assumes that he can tell me how many more men are required, bufc I do not know.",30
273,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,We have no information. We ought to know how many men we have contracted to deliver by way of reinforcements before we can judge.,30
274,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Certainly , and has there is not the slightest doubt that double the number of men who have already enlisted would be prepared to come forward at once if the matter was one of urgency. We ought to know whether it is. A question was asked this morning as to reducing the physical standard of recruits. I quite agree that if there are a sufficient number of men offering of the necessary physical attainIt ments as at present prescribed, there is no need to make any reduction. It would be foolish to take men who have physical defects if we can get men in perfect physical condition.",30
275,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,A small man is as good as a big man.,30
276,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"He may be for certain classes of work, but in the case of work with the bayonet, or work in the trenches, the small man has got no show at all against the big man. Again, we do not know what the position regarding equipment is. It may be that more men can be secured, but that we have not got the equipment for them. We do not know anything about it . We are entirely in the dark. Surely this Parliament has some responsibility in connection with this world war. Our united efforts could direct the organization of munition and equipment services. Yet we are told, in effect, that we have no responsibility at all, and that we must trust the Minister and leave him to do everything.",30
277,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,We should be told all these things in camera.,30
278,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"That is my argument. Even if we have a secret session, we should have some opportunity given of going into these matters. W it h agreement on the utilit y of joint action, a via media could readily be found. At present, even the Government party cannot supervise or control the defence activities as in ordinary times. The Minister has neglected. Why? so much to do that he is probably generous working with insufficient rest. itself means that he is not in a physical condition to initiate matters that might be helpful to our country and Empire this time. It is not possible to get more ability to spend it . than a certain amount of work out of one body.",30
279,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The bulk of the work is being done by one or two; that becoming very noticeable. Mr J"". IT. CATTS - It is. The M ister of Defence and the Assistant M i ister are two capable, painstaking, and efficient Ministers, and I am not casting any reflection upon them in my criticism, but we know that the tendency is to l i m responsibility and power to one or two who may object to any criticism being passed upon their actions. At the same tem of bookkeeping. time Parliament has every right to know what is being clone, and no Minister has any right to regard himself as immune from criticism. Take the question of finance. Is any honourable member of this House satisfied about the financial arrangement, either so far as it concerns the present prosecution of the war or what may be expected afterwards? Who knows what the position is? We do not know what is being spent. We do not know what and we have been committed to. We have to take all we hear on trust. Now is time to arrange our finances and induslanded. trial conditions to meet the economic versity following immediately upon wars. In regard to military contracts, know that information comes to every honourable member here which, in the i terests of the Ministers and in the i terests of the Government, ought to be ventilated. I am very distrustful of m tary officers. As soldiers, I have every confidence in them. That is their proof fession ; but as business men and as satisfied. judges in cases where good conscience and equity should prevail, I have no tained confidence in them whatever as a class. There may be good men among them; there may be bad men among them; but as a class I have no confidence in them at all, and we know, in regard to m i l tary contracts, that cases have been brought forward where the most elethe Empire. mentary business principles have been To place the most construction upon it , because the That in military officers have been engaged in a business for which they have no qualification, or whose only qualification reat garding the handling of money is the This Parliament ought to have an opportunity of going into tliese matters.

We know there has been a great deal of waste. Mr Anderson was appointed as business expert to lay down certain principles upon which it the accounts might be kept, but it would be impossible for Mr Anderson to have done more than go into the general sys",31
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The B r it i sh Government have a number of experts assisting the officers in these important functions. Why should not we do the same ? They have a Shipping Committee, a Finance Committee, and other commit tees outside Parliament.",31
281,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I agree. Both in regard to the immediate financial arrangements in connection with the war, also in the arrangements which will have to be made afterwards, we do not the know where we are or where we may be What provision are we going to admake to meet the financial obligations all that we have undertaken? The present arrangements are only temporary. Some we permanent arrangement will have to be come to, and no honourable member of n - this House can say that he is satisfied n - with what he knows of the arrangements that have so far been made. I feel ceri l i - tain that every honourable member who knows anything about the subject, instead being satisfied, is abundantly disThe right honourable member for Swan thinks satisfaction should be obby action of a party character. It is not long since I heard the right honourable member urge in this House that there should be no attempt to make party capital out of the situation in which we i - find ourselves-that all parties should, unite in doing, the best for Australia and That is the stand I am taking, so that it does not come very well from him to urge me to attack M in isters, and to try to do them some party injury. I believe that a lot more can be done for Australia and the Empire by an alteration of the present system of management. Coming to the question of munitions of war, the output of rifles, and the management of the Small Arms Factory, sufficient has been said by honourable members to show that there is a very general belief that there is room for much improvement. We are told that it is impossible to obtain the additional men required to work a second shift at the Small Arms Factory. I have here, however, a letter from a man who is competent to undertake work in the manufacture of rifles', and munitions, and who has written to ask me if there is any chance of his being employed by the British Government, since he is prepared to go to Great Britain , and is full y qualified to engage in this class of work. again, I saw recently a statement, by either the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence, that he had been inundated witli applications from men who were prepared to go to Great Britain to assist in the manufacture of munitions of war.",31

284,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I was told, by interjecwish tion from the other side, that it was question of material. We have had no official intimation of that kind.",32
285,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"If it is, then ought to know in respect of what masubject? terial any shortage exists. If there is shortage of steel, the sooner we know the better. This Parliament ought to prepared to spend Â£50,000 or Â£100,000 the earliest possible moment in laying down a plant to make all the steel that we require. We should also establish a plant for the seasoning of timber. We have an abundance of ore deposits in Australia: There large deposits in the east, the west, and the soutli, if not in the north, and to that, in a country that has all the raw material necessary for the purpose, we cannot obtain the material required for the manufacture of rifles and ammunition, and that in face of that fact we are doing nothing to avert such a calamitous situation, seems to me to be absolutely indefensible. We are told that we must not go into such matters. We must not mention that tliere is any shortage in respect of the manufacture of these things. The Minister holds up his hands in holy horror and says, "" You are giving information to the enemy,"" if we talk in this strain, and ask that something should be done.",32
286,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,The honourable member is getting on fairly well if it be true that we are not allowed to mention these things.,32
287,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"When I heard the statement made in the House this morning, in answer to questions put to M i nThen, isters, that anything said here that did not please the military authorities would be censored, I came to the conclusion that we should be at liberty, in such circumstances, to go thoroughly into questions of this kind. I come now to the Cockatoo Island where our warships are beWe were told a little while ago of a cruiser which was ready for launching, but which was high and dry, and needed only to be put into the water to be placed in commission within a very short time. There was some question of every the building of a coffer-dam.",32

289,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"That is what I to know. Is the cruiser Brisbane a still, like Mahomet's coffin, suspended between heaven and earth, or is it any nearer the water than it used to be ? we Are we to have any information on this A r e we to take any steps to a facilitate the carrying on of these works? it Is there room for more men to be put on be at Cockatoo Island works? If there is, at they should be employed. All these and others are matters which this Committee should have an opportunity of dealing with. We should insist upon thorough organization and efficiency. iron The CHAIRMAN - The honourable are member's time has expired.  say propose to occupy the time of the Committee at any great length this afternoon, but I must express the pleasure which the remarks just made by the honourable member for Cook have afforded me. 1 do not think that we quite realise our responsibilities to the Empire. The British Government, in my opinion, are prepared to receive as many troops as we can send; and, if the Minister of Defence would advise them that we have another 10,000 or 20,000 troops prepared to go to the front, I am sure that their services would be gladly accepted. We read only two days ago of the statement made in the British Parliament by Lord Kitchener that he is desirous of obtaining another 300,000 troops. In view of that statement, I tliink we in Australia should loyally respond to the Empire's call and fill up the breach. I listened also with great interest to the remarks made last night by the honourable member for Macquarie in reference to the Small Arms Factory. He is naturally anxious that it should succeed, and 1, as the representative of a neighbouring electorate, sympathize with him in that desire.",32
290,Mr CARR,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The honourable member is one of my constituents.  glad to see the honourable member doing his duty in this matter. The original cost of the Small Arms Factory was Â£300,000, and, taking the interest on that outlay at 4 per cent., we find that we are paying practically a rental of Â£12,000 a year for the factory.",33
291,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The honourable member's figures are too high.  a statement made in this House by the ex-Prime Minister. I understand, although I am not quite sure of my figures, that the output of rifles from the Small Arms Factory is about 12,000 a year, so that we are paying, in the way of interest on machinery and plant, Â£ 1 per rifle per annum. If we employed three shifts at the factory, the output would be 36,000 per year, bringing down the interest charges on premises, machinery, anci so forth, to 6s. 8d. per rifle, or one-third of the amount at present being paid. I have heard some unpleasant rumours regarding the factory. There is a movement on foot to remove it to Canberra. I cannot understand why, when one Government has seen fit to expend Â£300,000 in erecting the factory at Lithgow, another Administration should be prepared to uproot this valuable institution and plant it somewhere else.",33

293,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"What constituency is it in?  constituency of the honourable member for Macquarie, where I live. There is every convenience, and there is no reason why the factory should not be carried on at Lithgow. We should make up our minds now to manufacture the ammunition we need. Australia is separated by 12,000 miles of water from the Old Country. Suppose that things had gone against us in the war, and that we had been left to our own resources. Would not every honourable member say that the Australian Parliament should provide at once some means by which ammunition could be manufactured here quickly ?",33
294,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,What class of ammunition-bi g gun ?  tion.,33
295,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"We are manufacturing all the ammunition for the small arms, and supplying parts of the British Dominions. We are doing it very well.  my constituents complain that they are not supplied with rifles and cartridges. Rifle clubs have been formed all over my electorate. The members of two or three clubs were informed that they could not get the rifles, and were, at the same time, told to drill . As a matter of fact, one man suggested that the men should use broom handles. Apart from that, however, let us consider the state of unemployment in this country. Walking out of Collins-street the other day towards a park I noticed a crowd of men standing there. I asked a gentleman who they were, and he said that they were the unemployed. I think that we could do something for the men, and at the same time a great deal for the Empire, by establishing a factory to manufacture ammunition, and also explosives for mines and various callings. It was only the other day that I read a newspaper that Canada had entered into a contract to supply the War Office at Home with ammunition to the value of Â£14,000,000. What Canada can surely Australia can do! I have also noticed that, so far, the UnitedStates of America have supplied the Old Counto try with Â£100,000,000 worth of ammuniArea tion. One of the reasons for the present situation in Australia is, as the honourable member for Hunter pointed out, .that have no testing plant. If any persons go in for the manufacture of ammunition, has to be sent to England and tested there before it can be used here. Many of the miners in the electorate of Hunter are denied employment, while many cantialled, not work for such high remunerative for him to do. wages as otherwise they would be able to do. I would like the Minister to i form the country day by day, or week by week, where the Expeditionary Porces are.",33

Does my honourable friend effect. opposite mean to say that the Turks do not know that the Light Horse regiments are stationed in Egypt? Yesterday, the honourable members for Ballarat and Freevident in mantle complained of the lax way in which promotions are made, and demanded, above all things, that the one consideration should be efficiency. They do, urged that the results of competitive examinations should decide whether men ought to be promoted or not. I happen be on very friendly terms with an Officer, and he has confirmed what they said here. Only a few moments ago I spoke to this gentleman on the telewe phone, and he told me that there is a great deal of truth in the assertions made it in the House last night.",34

304,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Yes . There is an desire on the part of honourable members that they should, as far as practicable, be fortified in their own minds with sufficient information-no t to be published-to enable them to tell the public at large that things are going on all right. I do not know whether there is anything in the Standing Orders or the rules of Parliament to prevent the Senate and the House of Representatives from meeting as one body. I believe that a good heart-to-heart talk in camera among members of both Chambers, with the advantage of the attendance of M in isters and ex-Ministers in the Senate and Ministers and ex-Ministers in this Chamber, would throw a great deal of light upon the movements now afoot, which would be of considerable benefit. I am satisfied that there would be a cessation of much of the criticism which is now being indulged in , and that there would be a better understanding between all parties.",34

Many of us approach a debate of this cliaracter with the knowledge we must restrain ourselves in regard talking about much of the information that we have been able to obtain, but which we might be able to divulge at a meeting in camera with benefit to each other. I believe that a meeting such as I have suggested would do away with considerable amount of heart-burning and misapprehension, and would establish firmer ancl more united feeling in regard to the war than now exists in this Chamright.

320,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Balaclava) [3.31] - Ther is on both sides of the chamber a growing and natural desire for legitimate inforledge. mation as to some of the important phases - of our preparations for home defence and .fighting overseas, and Ministers should cognise it . This is the first great interister, national struggle in which we have been - active participants. It is true that we have not learned the discipline of the - older fighting nations of the world, are content to take their punishment silently, and very often without a knowtion, ledge of the facts. In Australia, we have a very inquisitive and intelligent Demopainted cracy, and on the occasion of our first blood-baptism we seek to know of many things that older nations are content leave to their leaders. In this this feeling is utterly irrespective party. Prom all sides the Assistant Minister and his colleagues are plied with all or Brisbane. sorts of questions about which honourable members have imperfect information, and about which they desire to know somestores, thing, bufc not with the idea of eliciting information the publication of which might prove hurtful to the country. That being so, it is time that the Ministers charge of the Defence Department should take counsel with their leader and leagues in Cabinet, and see whether fchere could not be, afc an informal joint sitting of both Houses, as suggested by the honormany able member for Maribyrnong, or in respective Chambers with strangers ordered out, a heart-to-heart talk, as the honour the able member calls it, about many of the important phases of the war. A debate on the question would not be sufficient, and would be .an improper way of dealing with the matter. I think that the Minisship ters, who would be very fully posted information, should welcome questions in an entirely non-party way. If this, many of the doubts and some of anxieties that honourable members would be set at rest. I hope fchafc the Assistant Minister, who, I bewould lieve is doing his best amid the enormous pressure of the Department to keep himself abreast of the problems and the information that honourable members desire, will at an early date take the gestion to the Prime Minister. Let give an illustration. I give it some degree of diffidence, but with the .knowledge that if it is not deemed wise to give it publicity outside the columns Eansard, the censorship will exclude ree ference to it in the public press. This is a case which came under my own knowI do not know all the facts, but I know some of them. Before Christmas I endeavoured to elicit information at the retime that the thing occurred, but the Minwith the reticence that seems to cover him occasionally, declined to make reference to it. It appeared a very grave scandal to those who knew anything about it. who The Government chartered a ship known as the Kyarra, altered her whole condiand fitted her as a hospital ship, with the Red Cross flag flying above and on her side, and despatched her big with a large hospital equipment to Egypt. She flew the international flag of peace. to Some of the hospital equipment, together House, with doctors, nurses, and stretcherof bearers was embarked either at Sydney The vessel then came to Melbourne, and when the authorities were preparing to put on board the final peace they found, to their astonishment, that there was at least 500 tons of contraband of war stored in the hold. The thought occurred to some of us: If that in contraband material had not been discovered, and that vessel had been held up coland searched by one of the German cruisers which were abroad at that time, what greater advertisement could Gerhave given to the world than that the one of the daughter Dominions of the British Empire was sailing a vessel under flag of peace with contraband of war in her hold ? Surely that incident was a scandal which should have been raked to its foundations. I endeavoured to get information about it, because I saw the loaded in Melbourne; but so far we with have had no information that any input vestigation took place, or that any we do person, military or civilian, was the punished or held ^responsible for the feel mistake. If the incident had been found out by Germany, Australia's name have been covered with ignominy in the eyes of the thoughtful world. There are a number of other things about which, we desire information, and I venture to say that if we could have an assurance sugthat the Department is working efficiently me and thoroughly all honourable members of with the House would co-operate loyally with the Government in carrying out the great task that confronts them. The rifle range of problem is a question of deep concern to many of us. Some of us have .asked questions of Ministers on the subject, but, so far as we can learn, nothing has been done. I attend meetings all over the State to help the recruiting movement, either for service overseas or for defence preparation in Australia, and at every meeting I ask myself what is the good of increasing the membership of rifle clubs if the members cannot obtain rifles and ranges upon which to shoot. I have seen men who live within 100 yards of my residence go Saturday after Saturday to Williamstown or Port Melbourne and return in the evening without having fired a shot, though they had waited on the ranges three or four hours. The rifle ranges adjacent to this capital city are so congested that even the present members of rifle clubs cannot get any practice. The condition may he the same in all the capital cities of Australia.",36
321,Mr WEBSTEK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,They can fill in their time effectively with drill.,37
322,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"They are doing that. One of the most pleasing phases of the movement is the number of officers belonging to the Porces who are giving up their time to assist in drilling the riflemen, .and making them efficient. I do not wish Ministers to think that I am saddling them with the blame, but that there is a grave problem in connection with secondary defence goes without saying. It may be that we have not the rifles for the use of the men who are engaged in this secondary defence movement. If that is so, men can still shoot with borrowed rifles, and drill with or without them; but there should be some chance of them shooting on rifle ranges, and becoming accustomed to the use of firearms, even though a big expenditure of ammunition be involved. It seems to me that there are many ways of overcoming the present difficulty. Without anything like as extensive a knowledge of the area surrounding Melbourne as is possessed by the Defence officers, I could mark half-adozen sites on the railway line, and within reasonable distance of the central railway station, where admirable rifle butts could be erected, and where men could be encouraged to engage in this preparatory work at least once a week. It is time the Department made a move in that respect, if it has not already moved. So far as we can see, the Department is not moving. [123]- 2",37
323,Mr LYNCH,SUPPLEMENTA BY,Would you allow men who aTe medically unfit to practice rifle shooting ?,37
324,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I would place no conditions on the Defence Department in that respect. If the Department says that rifle clubs should consist only of men who are physically fit, I would offer no objection, or if it said that all men who could use a rifle should be given the opportunity of learning to handle a rifle, as was done by the Boers, who put up an excellent fight in the defence of their homes, I would say that those men should be given a chance. I would allow the Defence Department to settle the question, but the Department should move at once in one direction or the other. That is another illustration of the kind of information we are asked for by our constituents, and which we are unable to get from Ministers without endeavouring to publicly probe matters that are regarded as secret. I sympathize with Ministers. Often I have been requested by interested persons to ask questions, which, in my opinion, would have involved the disclosure of information which Ministers consider should not be made public, and I have declined to do so. Often Ministers have asked that questions should not be persisted in , and I think, with reasonable deference on both sides of the House, we have taken the nod from the Minister, and have not persisted. But, after allowing for all the privacy and secrecy which the enormous amount of confidential information in the possession of Ministers demands, there is a limit to such secrecy in a Parliament such as this, and I feel that Ministers would be consulting the best interests of both parties, and of the united Parliament, if , at the earliest possible moment, they took honourable members of both Chambers into their fullest confidence in camera. Those disclosures' might require one or two sittings; if so, the time would be well spent.",37
325,Mr WEST,SUPPLEMENTA BY,A mutual admiration society!,37
326,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Admiratio n is what the honourable member would never have from any honourable member of the House. The honourable member ought to know, if he has enough brains with which to bait a fishhook, which I very much doubt, that I am not proposing a discussion on those lines. I shall conclude with a reference to a matter which is not quite related, but is of some importance, and about wbicb. I have endeavoured to elicit information from the Minister. I refer to the censorship of mails. As the honourable member for Cook observed, the commercial community is subject to a good deal of unnecessary delay and embarrassment. We should all endeavour to relieve the business forces of this country, which mean employment and safe finance, of all unnecessary embarrassment or rigidity in connection with the censorship. have heard of firms who do business with Europe, the Orient, or South A f r i c a , ing their mails to the General Post Office in good time before the advertised hour for closing the mails, but, in some cases, they have sent letters to the railway station, and paid the late fee, and to their astonishment and chagrin, they found that the late-fee letters were passed uncensored, and the other letters which had been lodged at the General Post Office had been detained for one month. I do not mean that the censorship occupied a month, but the delay in censoring the letters resulted in their missing the mail, and they had to wait one month for the next mail. One firm doing a thoroughly reputable business with the East in clothing supplies lost Â£1,200 through the missing of one mail. I had that on the authority of the head of the firm, whose business I am somewhat acquainted with , and whose word I accepted with every assurance.",37
327,Mr YATES,SUPPLEMENTA BY,Was the late letter fee mail censored ?,38
328,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The letter had reference to orders which had been posted an hour before, and when the firm in Japan or China got it , they did not know anything about it , because the order did not go forward until a month later. It is important that we should help our business people to keep their concerns going. When I brought this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General, he replied in perfect good faith yesterday that it was in the hands of the Defence Department, and that representations had been made with ' a view to having it inquired into. The Postal Department should be kept in close touch with the Defence censors, who should know how long it would take to censor a given number of packages. The Department knows what mail matter is carried to t'he East, Japan, Java, and other places, and if the backing out. Department were to say to the business men that the mail closed at 4 o'clock on any Tuesday, but that if they wanted their letters to go through they should be handed in by Saturday, the commercial community would see that this was done.",38
329,Mr SPENCE,SUPPLEMENTA BY,I am getting some information on that aspect of the question at present.,38
330,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"I am glad to know that. But I If the Postmaster-General would consult with the Assistant Minister and the M i nsendister of Defence on this question, I feel confident something could be done to make these restrictions fal l more lightly on the commercial community.",38
331,Mr KING OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Darwin) [3.48] - I have been listening with a great deal of attention to this important debate, and I want to say at once that the question which the Committee is discussing is a very serious one, for it concerns the most important crisis in the history of the British Empire, if not the whole world. When I hear that the Small Arms Factory is only working one shift, and that we have 33,000 men out of work in Australia, I am compelled to assume that there is a serious want of business organization somewhere. It is nonsense to say that the men cannot be trained to do this or that particular work in the Small Arms Factory. I cannot see why men cannot be taken from the factory and put at the head of another shift, whose particular duty it should be to do only certain parts of the work, leaving the completion to the more experienced men. It is all a matter of business organization. I am sorry I was not in the House when the honourable member for Macquarie was speaking, but I do say that if we had a business Committee from both sides of this House, we could have a very useful discussion with the Minister. The trouble is that some men think they know everything, when, as a matter of fact, they know nothing. I found that out when I was Minister. There are brains at the bottom, but often they can never come out on top because there is no conduit. I want to emphasize the fact that the cry in Britain , in Eussia, and in France today is for more ammunition. Here, in the New Toric World of Sunday, 28th March, is the statement, "" Eussia short of munitions.""",38
332,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTA BY,That is why she is,38
333,Mr KING OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The other day our own papers told us that General French was not able to go on, and it is admitted now by the American papers that at Neuve Chapelle he broke through the German lines, but could not gd on because of the want of ammunition.",39
334,Mr HANNAN,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Kitchene r practically contradicted that the other day; and he emphasized the fact that it was not munitions, but men, who were wanted.",39
335,Mr KING OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"Will my friend please allow me to proceed ? I am as well posted in the affairs of the world as any man in Australia, for, while I get a great deal of information from the Age, the Herald, and occasionally from the Argus, I find time to read papers from America, and so keep myself posted up on outside events.",39
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTA BY,I suppose it is all gospel in tbose American papers.,39
337,Mr KING OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"The matter I refer to was written by men wbo are allowed to travel with certain armies, and who, before their articles appeared in print, submitted them to the Generals in charge. If it is not true that Great Britain is short of munitions, why is it that, at the beginning of the war, America owed the Britishers $400,000,0.00, and sent gold over to Canada to meet the obligation? Now, after eight months of war, the position has turned until the balance is nearly $1,000,000,000 against Great Britain. We do not want to ask any further questions than that. Men who understand dealing with "" b o o d l e "" know what that means.",39
338,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"That is the balance of trade, due to supply of munitions of war.",39
339,Mr KING OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"It is because the United States of America is supplying the Allies with war munitions. The United States of America sent over nearly 140,000 horses, as well as 1,500,000 rifles and munitions. The United States, says Professor Muensterberg, "" sacrificed the noble rdle of the non-partisan."" The Germans now hate America because she is furnishing the Allies with such large supplies of war munitions. Gold has been made the international medium of liquidation, and every nation now demands gold. The Bank of England has only Â£92,000,000, so where are we to get our gold to carry on the war? The fact of the matter is that America, according to the World, is now financing the world.",39
340,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTA BY,America financing the world?,39
341,Mr KING OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTA BY,"England had a credit of $100,000,000, and Bussia a credit of $40,000,000.. That is the balance of trade, and Germany says that this is lending money; and this is the cause of the feeling of Germany against America. I bring these facts forward to show that we Australians ought to t u rn night into day in order to get out ammunition to help the Old Country. It is idle to come into this House and say that we cannot get the men, for I guarantee that if I were placed at the head of the Lithgow factory, I should have three shifts going in two weeks. The whole trouble is that we hire a .technical man and put him at the head; hut, while a technical man is good on a section, he is not good at "" run n in g the whole show."" We ought to hire a thorough business man, and then put the technical man in one corner, the general man in another, and the official man in another, and leave the business man to keep all these "" roosters"" working. There is another point that appeals seriously to me. I can remember that from 1873 to. 1875, after the war, 2,000,000 starving men were tramping the United States; and we here ought to organize our financial system so as to be able to meet the conditions which will surely arise when this war is over. The trouble is that England, like America, is a commercial, a thinking, an inventing, and a developing nation which has been sending the peace missionaries of commerce throughout the world ; and all the time that these two countries have been doing that, Germany has been preparing for "" stoush."" In 1886 the capitalists of Germany, England, Belgium, France, and partly America-as America could not get the "" big end of the stick "" she did not join-organize d a great munition trust.
