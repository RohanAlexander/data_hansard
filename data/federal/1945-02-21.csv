SAMUELDENNIS .",15
2,Mr CURTIN,SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY," I regret to inform honourable members of the death of Mr Samuel Dennis, a former member of this House, which occurred in Melbourne on the 28th January. The late gentleman was elected to the House of Representatives for the D i v i sion of Batman at the general elections in 1931, and was defeated at the general elections in 1934. I was not a member of the House during the period that he occupied a seat, consequently I had not personally made his acquaintance; but I know of his work, and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members. It was, however, more particularly in the sphere, of local government that Mr . Dennis gave outstanding service. He was for 36 years a member of the Northeoto Council, and twice during that period occupied the position of mayor. He represented the council on the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works for many years, and acted as vice-chairman of the board. He was also closely associated with church and sporting club organizations, and his loss will be severely felt throughout the district in which he resided. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a valuable record of public service. I move That tin's House records its sincere regret at the death of Mr Samuel Dennis, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Batman, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement.",15
3,Mr MEWZIES,SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY," I second the motion. As the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) has pointed out, the great bulk of a long period of public service rendered by the late gentleman was rendered in municipal politics; though he was in this House for n period of three years. In addition to his work in municipal affuirs, he was a nuiji with-very close and a variety of interests in church work, and in sporting liodies. In n dozen ways he showed himself to be a good citizen. He is, perhaps, ""ne of many proof's which we have had in Australia, that the foundation of a healthy public life is healthy, disinterested, honest local government. He played his part in that respect, and left behind him, particularly in his own city, :i record which Riiy man might envy.",15
4,Mr FADDEN,SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party). - The Australian Country party associates itself with the sentiments that have hci-n expressed, and the motion thflt has been moved and seconded. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA GOVERNOR-GENERAL.",16

10,Mr SCULLY,SUPPLY OF FOODSTUF FS TO UNITED,"On the 17th November, 1944, the honourable member for B a r k e r (Mr A r c h i e C a m e r o n) asked the f o l l o w ing questions, with o u t not i c e : 1. How many war-time foodstuff contracts have been entered into with the United Kingdom Government? 2. ""What was the total supply of each commodity in each contract for which the Commonwealth Government committed itself? 8. By how much did the supplied commodity exceed or fal l short of the contract? T he answer to the honourable member's questions is as f o l l o w s : The supply of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom has in many cases been arranged as purchases of exportable surpluses. Therefore, it may more satisfactorily suit the honourable member's purpose if answers to his question bo set out as follows:Nnaar - At the outbreak of war the British Government arranged to purchase all the No. 7 POOL. exportable surpluses of sugar from the (Per bushel.) Dominions and Colonies, and to allocate it in accordance with the needs of the United Net at Nations. It has been the practice to obtain country an early estimate of the sugar crop prospects stations. for the season, and to give the British Government an intimation of the amount of sugar that can probably be made available. £ Dried Fruits - The quantities of dried fruits contracted for and delivered were: 1040, 40,779 tons; 1941, 33,276 tons; 1942. 44,009 tons; 1943, 42.810 tons; 1944, 44.570 2,572,000 tons. Canned Fruits - The quantities offered to and accepted by the Britis h Government and distributed in accordance with instruction!: from London are: 1940, 982,780 cases; 1941, 644,087 cases; 1942, 58,250 cases; 1943, n i l ; 1944, 300,000 cases, of which 100,000 case? have been shipped as instructed by London, and 200,000 cases are awaiting shipment. Wheat and Flour - Contract s entered into with the United Kingdom Government arc as follows:Date of contract. Quantity. Tons.

The two last contracts are not yet completed, but it is anticipated that the full quantities will be supplied. Ef/gs -'the contract for the season 1939-40 was 900,000 long hundreds (300,000 cases, each 30 dozen eggs), and the quantity shipped was 340,041 cases. For 1940-41 the contract was for 412,000 cases, and 587,831 cases were shipped. Early in 1941 the British Government advised that refrigerated space would not be available for eggs in shell, and the Commonwealth Government then undertook to arrange for the processing of available eggs into dried powder. However, contracts for 200,000 in jjhell and 700 tons of pulp were accepted for the 1941-42 season, and the shipments made totalled 100,904 cases in shell together with the equivalent of 34,000 pulp, 700 tons egg pulp, and 1,415 tons egg powder. During 1942-43, owing to the heavy in service demands in the Pacific area, only ll""> tons egg powder were shipped. For 1943-44 no quantity was contracted beyond any egg power available after providthe ing for greatly increased service needs, and none was shipped. The British Government recently undertook to purchase the whole of the of eggs as powder, or, if circumstances permit, a? eggs in shell, for the seasons 1944-45 1945-46, and a quantity not exceeding 1,000,000 mum eases each 30 dozen eggs or their equivalent egg powder for the season 1946-47. Dairy Products -1939-40 : which covered the period November, 1939 June, 1940, provided for 75,000 tons of butter and 13,000 tons of cheese, against which «0,8S2 tons of butter and 11,063 tons of cheese were shipped. 194041: Despite the difficulties of supplying refrigerated shipping space, the British - vcriunent requested that 100,000 tons of butter and 20,000 tons of cheese be shipped.
