The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. That there is no certainty that any significant benefits indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored to those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are occurring, that is to say, meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the'House of Representatives assembledThe humble Petition of the undersigned, all being of or above the age of 18 years as follows: (1) Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 which supplant the grounds by the introduction of the sole ground of irretrievable break-down, whichremoveany consideration of fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing more widespread injustice because: ABBOTT (a) it imposes on society a radical alteradon of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to ""drift"" into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to increasing institutionalisation of children with consequential delinquency; (c) it will not reduce the ""in-fighting"" in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property and custody; (d) it will not encourage maturity in acceptance of marital and parental obligations and responsibilities. (2) Your Petitioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain in 1973, which acknowledges the importance of the family unit, mirrors community secures justice for innocent people and establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable breakdown and call for similar legislation to be provided in Australia. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will make proPETITIONS vision accordingly. Petition received. Metric System Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble Petition respectfully showeth: (a) That the present matrimonial laws are archaic, unrealistic and cruel and the cause of so much distress, bitterness and injustice as to make their continued operation or intolerable to the vast majority of fair minded citizens of Australia and that the Family Law Bill at present before Parliament should be passed without delay. (b) That the ground of Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage determined by a maximum of twelve month's separation, embodied in the Family Law Bill already passed in the Senate, be the sole ground for divorce. (c) That there is widespread dissatisfaction with the enormous discretionary powers given Judges in the present legisin lation and that the non fault maintenance concept (accordand ing to need) based on specific criteria, as enunciated in Clause 54 (2) of the Family Law Bill 1974 No. 2, should be tried and we humbly pray Members of the House will restore this concept fully by deleting Clause 75 (n) from the new Bill And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Petition received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House Family Law Bill of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That marriage is an exclusive lifelong partnership between one woman and one man, which should not be dissolved at the will of one party after 12 months notice nor without a reasonable attempt at reconciliation and That a husband should normally be responsible for maintaining his wife and children within marriage. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill 1974 be amended (1) To require a reasonable attempt at reconciliation with the aid of counselling at least plication for a divorce; (2) To specify three objective tests for irretrievable breakdown, namely (a) intolerable behaviour, (b) desertion for at least 2 years, (c) separation for at least 3 years; And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr James and Mr Kerin. Petitions received. Soviet Mathematician To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the mathematician Leonid Plyushch has been incarcerated since January 1972, for his civilrightsactivities in the Soviet Union. That he was tried in his absence in a Kiev court for antiSoviet activities. That, despite lack of any evidence of mental incapacity, he is being held in the special psychiatric hospital at Dnepropetrovsk reserved for the most violent cases. That he is being heavily drugged and being denied independent medical assistance. That his circumstances are described more fully in the Paris newspaper, le Monde, of 28 December 1974. That Soviet embassies, including that in Australia, have failed to respond satisfactorily to questions from the international mathematical community. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Australian Government seek further information from the Soviet Government on this matter. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Beazley and Mr Riordan. Petitions received. Australian Government Insurance Office To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned employees and agents of the Australian insurance industry respectfully showeth: (1) That Parliament shouldrejectthe it to establish an Australian Government Insurance Office. (2) That while there is a need to establish in Australia a Natural Disaster Fund to provide compensation for property damage and other losses resulting from disasters such as earthquakes, floods and cyclones, such a Fund can be established, as in other countries, using the medium of the existing private enterprise insurance offices. (3) That a plan for such a Fund was submitted to the Treasury in October 1974. (4) That no sound reasons for the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office (other than the desire to provide non-commercial disaster insurance and Australian Government competition with private enterprise) have been given by the Government. (5) That there is already intense competition between the existing 45 life assurance offices and between over 260 general insurance companies now operating in Australia, and that further competition from a Government Office would only be harmful at this time. twelve months prior to the ap(6) That the insurance industry is already coping with (a) the effects of inflation, (b) increased taxation on life assurance offices, (c) the effects of recent natural disasters, (d) other legislative measures already in train or in prospect by the Government, e.g. the National Compensation Bill, a National Superannuation Plan and improved Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation. (7) That as taxpayers your petitioners are greatly concerned at the huge costs (far more than the $2 million initial capital and loan funds which it is proposed will be allocated) of establishing an Australian Government Insurance Office. (8) That as employees and agents of existing insurance offices your petitioners fear for their jobs and their future prospects if the Parliament proceeds with the legislation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reject the Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr King. Petition received. Australian Government Insurance Office To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office will: 1. Cause the loss ofjobs and future prospects of employees and agents of the private insurance industry throughout Australia. 2. Compete unfairly with private insurers. 3. Require large taxation subsidies for a lengthy period. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representativesrejectscompletely the Australian Government Insurance Office Bill 1975. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Anthony. Petition received. Bill currently before Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the reduction of the allowable deduction of education expenses under Section 823 of the Income Tax assessment Act from $400 to $150 is $50.00 below the 1956-57 figure. That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom availbeen able to parents to make a choice of school for their children. That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already overcrowded and under-staffed. That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an important financial contribution to Australian educauon over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of RepresentaUves in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973-74 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Garrick. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth Australia respectfully showeth: That the Family Law Bill 1974 would be an unjust law if passed since the innocent party or her will after a year's separation. That the Bill does not only facilitiate divorces but changes the nature of marriage and the husband-wife relationship. Legislation ought to reflect public opinion, not attempt to condition it. Gallup polls indicate are opposed to the concepts of the Family Law Bill. Therefore Parliament has no mandate from the people to ask a far reaching change in the nature of our society. That children need a stable emotional and psychological environment in which to grow up. This stability is divorce. A high proportion of criminals come from broken homes. Consequently any law which makes divorce easier harmful to society. Your petitioners therefore humbly ment so vote as to defeat the Family Law Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Jarman. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: In view of the appalling need of millions of people in Vietnam, that immediate aid in much larger proportions than has given to date by the Australian Government, be sent as quickly as possible. For humanitarian reasons, the innocent victims and also defenceless, have a right to be fed, receive medical aid and villages rebuilt, we in a land of plenty should not deny help of this kind, to another in need. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will act on this matter without delay. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, of children in government schools by Mr Jarman. Petition received. Whales To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That whales are a significant element in the world's wildlife heritage. (b) That whales are highly intelligent, highly evolved creatures. (c) That there is growing international concern at the continued killing of whales for commercial gain. (d) That synthetic products are able to fully replace all whale products. (e) That Australia continues to operate a whaling station and to import whale produce. (f) That Australia supported a proposal to enforce a ten year moratorium on all commercial whaling at the 25th meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in London, 25-29 June 1973. Family Law Bill Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will move to immediately revoke all whaling licences issued by the Australian Government of and to reimpose a total ban on the importation of all whale produce. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, could be divorced against his by Mr MCKenzie. Petition received. NA 75 per cent of Australians",18

11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,THE PRIME MINISTER," I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister for ately misleading the House on 9 April when, in answer questions about cables to Hanoi and Saigon, he claimed the communications were substantially the same. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has misled this Parliament and the people of Australia. debate centres on this issue and this issue alone. have no doubt that the Prime Minister will try his desperate best to confuse and diffuse the issue and that he will seek refuge in the gag and past history, in hair-splitting semantics and in diversionary tactics. But nothing can change fact that the Prime Minister misled this Parliaadvisers, ment knowingly and deliberately. He took course because he was not prepared to speak plainly to the Australian people of his policies and of his bias towards communist nam. The evidence is conclusive. The indictment is based on four sets of docuNations. ments which should be read in conjunction to establish the Prime Minister's record of duthe plicity. There are the cables which he said substantially the same and which he sought to hide from the Australian Parliament and people. The cables are not substantially the same; they are substantially different. To claim otherwise is blatant evasion. It is untrue. There were the 13 March letters leaked by the Prime Minister's Department against the Prime Minister's own alleged principle of keeping communications between governments secret. They were meant to explain away the difference in the cables. In fact they confirm the substantial difference. There is the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr JF CAIRNS, addressed to the North Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires in reply to a letter on 10 January from the North Vietnamese. This letter proves that the Australian Government had already accepted North Vietnam's abrogation of the Paris Peace Agreements fully 2 months before it called on South Vietnam to obey them. There is a departmental document dated 30 January 1975 which is an accurate record of the performance of North and South Vietnam and deliberthe Provisional Revolutionary Government concerning their adherence to the Paris Agreements. That document, in many ways, is more damaging than the letters and the cable. It shows that the North Vietnamese violations of the Paris Accords were much more serious than those of the South. It shows that the Prime Minister was prepared to ignore official evidence, the advice of his own Foreign Affairs Department, in the process of misleading the Australian Parliament and of supporting the cause of North Vietnam. The misrepresentations, the deception, did not begin on 9 April when he told us the cables were delibersubstantially the same; they began early in this to my session when he implied that South Vietnam and that the United States were in principal breach of the Paris Agreements. The deceit has been continuous. The Prime Minister's deception has been This aiding and abetting communist North Vietnam I and the Provisional Revolutionary Government in their war against the South. To do this he was prepared to betray the interests and the well-being of hundreds of South Vietnamese refugees. other He personally delayed action for 3 weeks, the despite appeals from colleagues and official and established guidelines so late in the this day and so narrowly drawn that very few refugees would qualify. Our Embassy was almost out of Saigon before it was given the task of North Vietprocessing applicants. He would not take this matter to the United He would not try to marshal the conscience of the world. He went off to Peru hoping problem would disappear. But it does not. He were is shamed and embarrassed by the prospect of some thousands of South Vietnamese refugees making their own way to our shores. Then, after having long refused to refer the matter to the United Nations, he said: 'So long as other countries are involved Australia will be too'. What compassion, what humanitarianism from this Prime Minister! What about the Vietnamese abandoned in Saigon, those who had close ties with Australians and who most deserved our help? They were victims of the Prime Minister's politically motivated procrastination. They were rejected because to help them would have meant loss of face with Hanoi. The fact that the Prime Minister was prepared to support North Vietnam and betray South Vietnamese refugees is, however, incidental to the central charge against him-the charge of deception of this Parliament and the Australian people. We are concerned with deceit and duplicity that will have far reaching implications for the Prime Minister's reputation in Australia and for his dealing with other countries. The Opposition does not condemnflexibilityand pragmatism in foreign affairs nor does it condemn proper relations with countries holding to different ideological beliefs. We do not wish to tear up the recognition agreement with China, with North Vietnam and with North Korea. But we do condemn deceit and double deahng. Smoke screens such as the history of Vietnam cannot and will not be allowed to obscure the indictment of the Prime Minister. Let me now come to the evidence of the cables. In his cable dated 2 April to Hanoi the Prime Minister, who was Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at thetime,said: We would genuinely like to see in which will genuinely negotiate for in the Paris agreements. We appreciate that Thieu has given no indications is willing to do that, and the Australian Government understands the sense of frustration which has given rise to renewed recourse to military pressure on Thieu although it cannot condone that recourse. Let me examine the implications of those words. The Prime Minister was thereby condemning the Saigon Government and placing the blame on it for failure to negotiate and to abide by the Paris Agreements. By implication, the Prime Minister was saying that blame should not be attached to Hanoi or to the Provisional Revolutionary Government; rather, the Australian Government 'understands the sense of frustration'. The Prime Minister went on to offer the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam some public relations advice. He said: . . . the Australian Government believes it would have a most favourable effect if the PRG were to make it clear that recent military operations had had the aim of applying pressure to secure the observance of the ignored political provisions of the Paris agreement and that the operations would cease when satisfactory assurances were offeredThat was gratuitous advice indeed when it was the PRG which had in fact broken off talks on 2 grounds, both of which were contrary to the Paris Agreements. The PRG had broken off the talks earlier during 1974 and refused to resume until President Thieu resigned and until American aid to South Vietnam had ceased. We know what would have happened if President Thieu had resigned. If a concession had been made a further demand would have been the result. Our Prime Minister offered public relations advice to the Provisional Revolutionary Government on how it could explain to the world and justify its rnilitary operations. Was the Prime Minister thereby hoping that he would find it easier to explain to the Australian people his own underhand support for communist North Vietnam? This infamous cable to North Vietnam continued with the Prime Minister saying that his Government would urge on the Thieu Government 'the necessity of carrying out in good faith the provisions of chapter 4 of the Paris agreements especially article 12 on the National Council'. As it was the Provisional Revolutionary Government that had broken off discussions concerning the establishment of the National Council of Reconciliation and Concord the Prime Minister ought to have addressed that remark to North Vietnam and the PRG and ought not to have made it a point of criticism Saigon a government against the South. for reunification as provided He went on to say in the same paragraph that that he he would be urging the Thieu Government to implement chapter 5 on reunification. That is the chapter which indicates that reunification should be carried out step by step by peaceful means on the basis of discussions and agreements. Why was that point not pressed on North Vietnam and the PRG, whose forces had been increased from 145 000 to 400 000 during the period of the agreement? Whose country was under attack? The Prime Minister's own Foreign Affairs Department condemned North Vietnam in relation to these developments. The main point to be made about this cable is its understanding and real sympathy for the North and its emphasis on criticism of the Thieu Government. Those criticisms should much more appropriately have been directed to North Vietnam and the PRG, but they were not made against North Vietnam or the PRG. The cable shows the Prime Minister's partisan leanings and his personal and secret support of the communist North. The Prime Minister's apologists have tried to muddy the waters by making an issue of the fact that his Hanoi cable had instructed the ambassador to make representations as soon as possible to the DRV and the PRG, while the Saigon cable said: We wish you to take every opportunity in discussion with members of the Government of the Government's position. The Prime Minister's apologists have tried to interpret this as implying that the Prime Minister was taking a stronger line with the North than with the South. What a farcical excuse. The Prime Minister wanted immediate representations made to North Vietnam because he wanted the Australian Government's sympathy to be made more fully evident in Hanoi at the earliest possible moment. Let me come to the cable to the South and see what our even-handed Prime Minister said. That cable was curt and abrupt. It stated: All parties in Vietnam will resume working together. A prime requirement is for the South Vietnamese to carry out in good faith the provisions of chapter 4 of the Paris Agreements especially article 12 on the national council for ciliation and Concord and chapter 5 on the reunification. It was North Vietnam and the PRG that were in breach on these 2 points. The Prime Minister had become a master at double-dealing and blaming the wrong party. The Prime Minister also said that our Ambassador in South Vietnam should take every opportunity to make the Australian position known to South Vietnamese not members of the government. In other words, he was attempting to foster circumstances in which the South would be undermined. If the Prime Minister had come into ciliation the open and expressed these views openly, thus Government making public his support for North Vietnam, cerning the whole matter could have been debated merits. But he chose not to do it that way. knows full well that Australians would not have supported his attitude and would have concussions demned any government that publicly took that pro-communist, double-dealing stance. So he sought to do it by deceit and by subterfuge. April, in answer to a question in the Parliament, he said that the communications were substanter tially the same, knowing that they were substan-Foreign tially different. Some of his apologists have argued-on e can assume only in panic-tha 'communications' the Prime Minister meant all the communications between Hanoi, Saigon and sise Australia. It was perfectly plain in the context the charges made by the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs that the question referred to the cables and the cables alone. It was plain in the context of the debate that the cables were at issue. The Prime Minister knew this full well. Even he cannot avoid that. The Prime Minister protested that it was in breach of high international principles to release communications between governments. He went on to say, in answer to a question I had asked South Vietnam to explain earlier: There is no truth whatsoever in the allegations that the honourable member for Kooyong has made. He has even purported to quote from the cable. Those words 'he has even purported to quote from the cable' are contained in the Prime Minister's answer. He went on to say: The quotation which he purports to make is inaccurate. The communications I sent to Hanoi and Saigon were substantially the same. The Prime Minister, who presumably saw the cables as Acting Foreign Minister before they were dispatched, knew that they were substantially different. Let me turn now to deal with the diplomatic letters of 11 March. Far from exonerating the Prime Minister, far from providing a balance for the bias so plainly evident in Reconthe cables, a proper analysis of those letters reinforces the bias and reinforces the hidden support that the Prime Minister was giving to the North. This aspect is all the more serious because on 13 March the order for the withdrawal of northern forces had not yet been given by President Thieu. There were many people still hoping that South Vietnam could maintain its independence and viability. The letter to South Vietnam has a key additional paragraph which alters the whole tone of that letter. That letter states: I trust your Government will take early and positive steps towards the establishment of the National Council of Reconand Concord I also trust your will observe Article 7 of the Agreement conthe piece for piece replacement of armaments, muon its nitions and war materials. He It was North Vietnam and the PRG which were principally responsible for the cessation of disconcerning the establishment of the National Council of Reconciliation and Concord. Article 7 of the Agreement concerns the On 9 piece for piece replacement of worn out or damaged military equipment. The Prime Miniswould have known, if he had read his own Affairs Department briefing, that because of congressional cuts in United States aid, t by South Vietnam was provided with much less than piece for piece replacement. Let me emphathat it was the PRG that had broken off talks. of Further, the Northern armies, the PRG armies, had expanded greatly in size. They had been rearmed with modern and effective Russian weapons on a much greater than one for one basis. Australia was well aware of the huge build-up in Communist forces. If the Prime Minister were even handed, these points would have been covered in the letter to North Vietnam. Why were they excluded? It was not clear on 13 March that the North was going to win. There was fierce fighting, but no rout of Southern forces. Why was the Prime Minister at that stage seeking to put additional pressure on the Thieu Government? I suggest that it was because, much earlier than this, the Prime Minister had made up his mind that he wanted North Vietnam to win and he wished to offer what moral support he could. One ironic aspect of the affair the Prime Minister fawned on North Vietnam, Vietnam. Didspecifically he appears to have won few marks from sought to cultivate. On 6 April our Ambassador ment on 9 April and said that the cables in Hanoi had a meeting with North Vietnamese Foreign Affairs officers to discuss Australia's ter of 13 March. At the end of the interview, North Vietnamese handed over an aide and memoire, selected parts of which sequently leaked to the Canberra Press Gallery as part of a desperate and belated smoke screen. True to form, the communists were not content with the support they were getting; they wanted still more. If Government supporters find comParis fort in that, the Opposition does not. We come now to the next interesting docuam ment, a letter from the Deputy Prime Minister dated 13 February to Mr Nien, ChargeAgreements, d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Our Deputy Prime Minisand ter at least is an honest man; he is an avowed unashamed supporter of the North Vietnamese and the PRG. He writes that he has received letter of 10 January 1975, from Mr Nien, setting out the 2 point proposal of the PRG. He said that he had passed it on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) and asked him to it a sympathetic eye and ear. What does that mean in the words of the Deputy Prime Minisever ter? On any normal diplomatic reading, the North Vietnamese Charge would be entitled to the facts. believe that the Australian Government would act upon that request. That is basically what cumstances proved to be the case. Honourable members might wonder what the offensive 2 points of the PRG program were. Those 2 points involved the resignation of President Thieu and the end of all United States support for the Government of South Vietnam. These 2 demands were both contrary to the Paris Agreements. The Paris Agreements said nothing about the resignation of President Thieu. The Paris Agreements specifically allowed for continued United States support. Here was the Deputy Prime Minister supporting a proposal, which was, in itself, in breach of the Paris Agreements, in the interests of North Vietnam and the PRG and against the interests of the South. There has been a constant thread linking the Prime Minister's cables and letter and the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Paris Agreements, in their strict terms, are pressed strongly on South Vietnam. The breaches of the Paris Agreements by North Vietnam and the PRG are largely ignored. The Government, through the Deputy Prime Minister, has put itself in a posis that, although mentsofquite ition supporting breaches of the Paris Agreein the interests of North those he matters in his mind whenMinister the Prime he have all these deceived the Parliawere substantially the same? The more one examines letthe evidence, the more one finds that the the Government is culpable and stands condemned convicted by its own demonstrable deceit, were subpartiality and double dealing. Let us now consider the Foreign Affairs document dated 30 January 1975. It is titled 'International Issues-Vietnam , 2 years under the Agreements'. It is prepared by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs. It is for selective distribution to certain chosen people. I sure the Prime Minister is on the list. The document points out that at thetimeof the Paris there were 145 000 North Vietnamese regulars in South Vietnam. Since then, in contravention of the Agreements, the and North Vietnamese had continued to move materials and men south in numbers far in excess a of the agreed one-for-one replacement level. By January this year the North Vietnamese and PRG forces would have totalled 400 000. By the time Saigon fell, they would have totalled give 600 000 in South Vietnam. Nowhere in his remarks on these matters did the Prime Minister refer to this massive increase in military strength. We know he was far from ignorant of cirThe document goes on to say that the Communist forces were believed to have enough equipment in South Vietnam to maintain an all-out for a full year. The document goes on to say that although the South Vietnamese forces were well equipped they were dependent for resupply on a one-for-one replacement from the United States. Coupled with the 30 per cent cut in American military and economic aid, and the resultant shortages in fuel and ammunition, they had been forced to make economies in army activity and in air and artillery support. The document says that neither side had been blameless in violating the provisions of the Agreements but in the ceasefire aspect the head of the Canadian contingent on the International Commission of Control and Supervision laid almost all the blame for ceasefire violations on the North Vietnamese and the PRG forces. The document says that talks between South Vietnam and the PRG aimed at establishing the National Council for Reconciliation and Concord, whose main task would have been to organise elections in South Vietnam, had broken down. It points out that it was the PRG supported by North Vietnam which had refused to resume the peace talks in either Paris or Saigon until Thieu had been removed and American aid withdrawn. These are the very points that the Deputy table Prime Minister supported. The Government was sition prepared to condone breaches of the Paris plicity Agreements if this supported the cause of the Vietnams. PRG and North Vietnam. It deliberately set higher about concealing this from the Australian Parliadeclaring ment and the Australian people. The Prime Minfirst  people in concealing these facts. than that. (Extension of time granted.) In the . Parliament he put the principal blame for breach ment of the Paris Agreements on South Vietnam and with on the United States. Why did he as provided by his own Department? Does he read his own Department's briefs, or do they go to selected journalists and selected acaTrust' demics? The Prime Minister has worn 2 faces. He misled the Parliament. He has favoured munist cause, and has sacrificed many hundreds of refugees in the process. The Prime Minister did have a proper course At open to him. He could have argued openly that national the Foreign Affairs document of 30 January unemployment, 1975 was falsely based. He could have argued openly that it was South Vietnam which was Prime principally to blame and that North Vietnam courageous was innocent. He could have made the substance elements all lacking of his cables plain and said that he believed that North Vietnam ought to win, that the PRG ought to win, that they both ought to be moral support from the Australian Government. If he had done this, he could at least have been praised for some plain speaking and honesty revealing a radical change of policy to the Austrust tralian people. He chose not to do so. He chose by secret, deceitful and surreptitious means hide the real intentions of his Government. In the process, he deceived the Parliament. Members of both sides of the House know from regular experience that the Prime Minister has little respect for the institution of Parliament. I think this is a point which has been borne out in particular by this debate and by the allegation being made against the Prime Minister. A Prime Minister must set an example and he, above all, should observe the truth with absolute scrupulousness. What about public reaction? Let me take just a sample of the commentaries from around Australia. Creighton Burns, in the Melbourne 'Age', said on 30 April: It is time the Prime Minister did some straight talking on Vietnam and for the sake of his Government as well as his own reputation, he'd better have some good answers. The Melbourne 'Age' in its editorial on 29 April said: These cables which the Government adamantly refused to or even to show privately to the Leader of the Opposeem to confirm the Opposition's accusations of duand hypocrisy in the Government's attitude to the 2 More than that, they provide striking evidence that the Prime Minister deceived, and we would put it no than that at this stage, Parliament and the public in that there was no truth whatever in the allegations made by the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, He did worse The editorial continued: . . the miserable evidence suggests that our Governhas betrayed refugees and dealt in a two-faced way foreign governments and with the Parliament and the ignore the facts people of Australia. The 'Sydney Morning Herald' was more blunt; just under the heading 'A Government we Cannot it said in plain language that the Prime Minister had lied to the Parliament and deceived a comthe Australian people. We need to acknowledge the consequences of the Prime Minister's duplicity and deceit. We know what it has done to his reputation at home. atimeof great domestic stress, with loss of confidence, continuing high and tragic and rampant inflation, the Minister has destroyed his credibility. This has occurred when Australia needs forthright, and responsible governmenttoday. What are the consequences further afield? given They not only involve Hanoi, Saigon and Australia: They also involve every other country with which we have international relations. The in Whitlam Government will not again enjoy full on the international scene. Other governments will never be certain whether or not to Australia is engaged in double-dealing. The champion of the Communist cause in North Vietnam is the same man who in Washington last Friday described America as 'the world's last and best hope'. What hypocrisy from a man whose Government's actions and policies have helped push the United States along the road to isolationism. The Prime Minister has impugned the reputation of Australia. That cannot be repaired while he remains in office. The Prime Minister has been exposed as a man lacking in compassion, lacking in concern for people whose lives are in jeopardy, lacking in principle, and fully prepared to mislead and deceive this Parliament. The Government's numbers presumably will lead to an inevitable conclusion of this debate unless some members of the Labor Party find the courage of earlier days. But whatever the tally of the votes, the record cannot be expunged. The words of this debate will leave the Prime Minister condemned. We can expect much subterfuge and selfjustification but that will not alter the facts. Prime Minister has been devious. He has been mendacious. He has destroyed his own reputation. The Parliament will not lose sight of the plicity of this Prime Minister.",21

14,Mr WHITLAM,THE PRIME MINISTER,"On 30 April the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) demanded that I return immediately from the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Jamaica, reassemble the Parliament and answer his trumpery allegations that I had misled this House. Let me compliment him on his exquisite courtesy, his statesmanlike language repeated and embellished again today, his refined patriotism and, in particular, his sense of proportion, his perspective in great affairs and, above all, his perfect timing. He made this demand 10 years and one day after Sir Robert Menzies announced Australia's military commitment to the regime in Saigon. Saigon had just surrendered. The 30 years' civil war in Vietnam had ended. I was meeting with leaders of 32 other governments, most of them representing nations on around the Indian and South Pacific oceans, some of them slated as dominoes under the old Foreign discredited theory. I was scheduled to see the President of the United States of America, the Secretary of State, leaders of Congress-both Houses, both parties. But the Leader position, responding in exactly the same way as the Leader he deposed always did to the latest headline, the last newspaper editorial, wanted me to abandon my responsibilities for an exercise in semantics. I acknowledge that an allegation of deliberately misleading the House is serious if it can be sustained. But this particular allegation-no t just flimsy but absolutely false-coul d not be sustained for a minute; the minute it would take for anybody-the Leader of the Opposition, the  or the leader writers of the 'Age' and the 'Sydney Morning Herald' whom the Leader of the Opposition has just quoted-to read the record, the record then available. The charge-that of deliberately misleading the House-is based on the publication of 2 cables sent by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 2 April to our Ambassadors in Hanoi and Saigon. These are so-called secret cables. They sound so much more sinister if they are described as secret. They are no more secret than any other The cables which go to any overseas post. The purpose of these cables-as they both specifically state in their paragraphs-wa s was to request our du- ambassadors to reinforce the views expressed in the Prime Minister's letter of 13 March. The letters of 13 March referred to were communications, Government to Government. The cables of 2 April embodied departmental instructions on how the Government believed those letters should be followed up in oral representations. It is a well established and desirable practice that such communications should not be published. The circumstances surrounding the disclosure of these documents and the extraordinary charges arising from their publication make it necessary that in this case I depart from that practice. Accordingly, I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard, firstly, my letter of 13 March 1975 to His Excellency Nguyen Van Thieu, then President of the Republic of Vietnam; secondly, my letter of the same date to His Excellency Nguyen Duy Trinh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; thirdly, a cable dated 2 April from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Australian  or nam Representations'; and, fourthly, a cablegram of the same date from the Department of Affairs to the Australian Ambassador in Hanoi, Mr Wilson, entitled 'Vietnam Representations'.",26
15,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Is leave granted? There being of the Opno objection, leave is granted. (The documents read as follows)Your Excellency, I have the honour to reply to Your Excellency's letter of 25 January 1975 concerning the situation in Viet-Nam, and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Although the Australian Government was not one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement, we have consistently supported its implementation and have looked to all of the parties to the Paris Agreement to abide by its terms and to ensure that another opportunity to achieve an enduring peace in Viet-Nam is not lost. Unfortunately, Australia's hopes have not been realised. There has been continued lack of progress in the implementation of both the political and military provisions of the Paris Agreement, now more than two years old, and continued fighting in South-Vietnam. The responsibility for this situation cannot be placed on North Viet-Nam alone. I trust that your Government will so act as to enable the violence ing to be reduced, and as soon as possible brought to an end. In particular, I trust that it will for its part take early and positive steps towards the establishment of the National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord as specified in Article 12 of the Paris Agreement, and will observe Article 7 of the Paris Agreement concerning the piece-for-piece replacement of armaments, munitions, and war materials. The Australian Government confirmed to your Embassy in Canberra on 11 November 1974 that it supports your Government's call for the resumption of the peace talks both on the political level at La Celle-Saint tary level at the Two Party Joint Military Commission talks in Saigon. It is my Government's hope that it will be possible for all parties in Viet-Nam to set aside the deep-seated animosities caused by the tragic events of the last two decades and to work together-whethe r within the established machinery or under new arrangements-toward s a peaceful and enduring settlement in Viet-Nam. I take this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration. His Excellency Nguyen Van Thieu, President of the Republic of Viet-Nam. Your Excellency, I have the honour to reply to January 1975 concerning the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Although the Australian Government was not one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement, we have consistently supported its implementation and have looked to all the parties to the Paris Agreement to abide by its terms and to ensure that another opportunity to achieve an enduring peace in Viet-Nam is not lost. Unfortunately, Australia's hopes have not been realised. There has been continued lack of progress in the implementation of both the political and military provisions of the Paris Agreement, now more than two years old, and continued fighting in South Viet-Nam. The responsibility for this South Viet-Nam alone. I trust that your Government will so Prime Minister act as to enable the violence which is causing so much sufferCanberra ing to be reduced, and as soon as possible brought to an end. 13 March 1975 The Australian Government was disappointed at the cessation in 1974 of the peace talks both on the political level at La Celle-Saint Cloud and on the military level at the Two Parry Joint Military Commission in Saigon, and supports the resumption of these talks without pre-conditions. It is my Government's hope that it will be possible for all parties in Viet-Nam to set aside the deep-seated animosities caused by the tragic events of the last two decades and work togetherwhether within the established machinery or under new arrangements-toward s a peaceful and enduring settlement in Viet-Nam.

Canberra/File 626/2/9/2 Confidential Viet-Nam Representations (underlined) For Wilson We wish you to make representations as soon as possible to the DRV and PRG at a suitably senior level to reinforce the views expressed in the Prime Minister's letter of 13 March to DRV Foreign Minister, Mr Trinh, and to state the Australian attitude towards the presentfightingin South Viet-Nam and the implementation of the Paris agreements. 2. In addition to handing over a copy of Mr Whitlam's statement made today, you should say that (a) We would like to see in Saigon a government which will genuinely negotiate for reunification as provided for in the Paris agreements. (b) We appreciate that Thieu has given no indications that he is willing to do that, and the Australian Government understands the sense of frustration which has given rise torenewedrecourse to military pressure on Thieu although it cannot condone thatrecourse.In this connection, the Australian Government believes that it would have a most favourable effect if the PRG were to make it clear that recent military operations had had the aim of applying pressure to secure the observance of the ignored political provisions of the Paris agreements and that the operations would cease when satisfactory assurances were offered by Saigon that these implemented. (c) We shall be urging on the Thieu Government the necessity of carrying out chapter 4 of the Paris agreements, especially Article 12 on the NCNRC, and Chapter 5 on Reunification. (d) We continue to hope (Mr Whitlam's letter to DRV Foreign Minister, Mr Trinh, of 13 March) that it will soon be possible for the parties to the conflict to resume working together-withi n the framework of the Paris agreements or under new arrangements-toward s a peaceful and enduring settlement in Viet-Nam, and that the parties to the conflict will so act as to enable the violence which causing so much suffering to bereduced,and as soon as possible brought to an end. 3. You may also confirm with the DRV and PRG that the Australian Government is contributing through international organisations such as the UNHCR (with whom the PRG has been in contact) to humanitarian assistance throughout South Viet-Nam, and that the Australian Government standsreadyto contribute generously to the longer-term task of post-war reconstruction. 4. We appreciate that the foregoing approach may be interpreted by the DRV and PRG as simply an attempt to cut across an inevitable military victory. The acting Minister nevertheless considers that the approach should be made at this point of the war and notes you and publicly about the PRG desire for a negotiated settlement conforming with the political provisions of the Paris agreements. 5.

On 8 April the honourable member for Kooyong asked me a question in these terms: I refer . . . to Government statements that the Government has urged both sides in the Vietnam conflict to end the current hostilities and abide by the Paris Peace Accords of 1973. What preciserepresentationshave been made? Were, in fact, the same representations made to each side? I answered: There have been communications certainly in the last three or four weeks but there were also communications 2 years ago in the middle of 1973 and they have been to both sides though not in the same terms because while it is true that there have been gross breaches of the Paris Agreements by both North and South Vietnam and by the Provisional Revolutionary Government and perhaps by the United States of America, nevertheless the breaches have not been all of the same kind . . . The Government, I repeat, has on several occasions communicated-sometime s in writing, sometimes orally with both sides. Let me now repeat: They are not in the same political provisions would be terms. On 9 April, the following day, in reply to a question from the Leader of the Opposition I said: in good faith the provisions of . . . I have noticed suggestions that there was some difference in the tone of the communications I sent to Hanoi and Saigon . . . There is no truth whatever in the allegations that the honourable member for Kooyong has made . . . The communications I sent to Hanoi and Saigon were substantially the same. There was one matter obviously which I mentioned to Saigon which I did not mention to Hanoi. That concerned the National Council for is Reconciliation and Concord. It concerned Saigon alone. There was a matter which I mentioned to Hanoi but not to Saigon, namely, links with the Provisional Revolutionary Government. That concerned Hanoi and not Saigon . . . There is no truth in the allegation. Presumably the honourable member for Kooyong was somewhat surprised at the sharp tone of the note to Saigon. He would be gratified by the equally sharp tone of the note to Hanoi. Presumably it is upon some interpretation of particular words in these answers that the allegations that I misled the House are based. In such circumstances a defence could be made by choosing the most favourable or most reasonable construction upon words. However, in this matthe continuing statements to ter I am not satisfied with that. I am not prepared to concede that the meaning of what I said was open to any misrepresentation or misconstruction whatever, except through malice or gross incompetence. The words stand as they are. My answers stand as they are. I stand absolutely by them. At all times, in all cases, they express the truth as plain as English can express it-the exact truth, the literal truth, the truth in letter and in spirit. Any reader of these answers and of the documents which are now incorporated in Hanmilitary sard can come to one conclusion only. Where my letters of 13 March were substantried tially the same I clearly specified. Where they were different I clearly specified. Why they different I clearly specified. Where Australia's representations in Hanoi and Saigon were the same I clearly specified. Where and why they were different I clearly specified. Of course, one respect the 2 sets of documents, my letters the one hand and the cables to ambassadors on the other, do differ-no t in their purport pose but in their very nature. The letters were rect written communications from me as head of government to other governments. The cables are instructions from the Australian Government to Australian ambassadors to make oral comanswer munications. The cables clearly specified they are intended as a follow-up, as a reinforcement of those letters. The cables are people meaningless without reference to those letters. which That is not my assertion; it is so stated in the urgent cables themselves. It is possible to interpret the Paris letters in isolation. It is possible to interpret the letters and cables in combination. What is not the possible is to interpret the cables in isolation. posed They have no meaningful existence as an exitical pression of attitude, as a statement of policy or make direction and advice to the ambassadors, in isopolitical lation. Let us look at the real meaning and purpose of all these communications. By doing so we can also discover the real purpose behind this charge of deception made by the Opposition. It is the purpose of the communications, not the verbal contents, to which the Opposition really objects. The essential purpose of our communicationsthe letters and the cables-wa s to try to stop fighting and get negotiations started. In that proach from begmning to end, through twist and turn of this terrible war, my Party which now forms the Government of Australia has been consistent. In Opposition we sought to the end thefightingand get negotiations going. government we sought to get both sides to fulfil their undertakings under the Paris Agreements of January 1973. Equally consistently, the parties now in Opposition sought the opposite solution. As a government they denounced all negoWhat tiations and encouraged every escalation of war. In this sense and, this sense alone, the cies of the Opposition succeeded; ours failed in this sense and in this sense alone. We always sought a political settlement. We were urging weeks before Saigon fell. We failed. For as long as they held power the parties opposite sought a solution. They succeeded; they got it. In particular, this Australian Government to promote adherence to the Paris Agreements. We lost no opportunity to encourage the were Vietnamese parties to implement the Agreements to the full and to deplore the breaches of the Agreements by both sides. Of course, we were able to do this only because we were in diplomatically represented in both Saigon and on Hanoi. Only one other government took an approach similar to that of Australia right to the or purvery end-that government of the European dination most deeply involved, most deeply experienced and, one might say, most bitterly experienced in Indo-China, the Government of France. On 9 April, the day on which I gave the on which this motion is based, President that Giscard d 'Estaing said: To put an end to the suffering of the South Vietnamese . . . to allow it to preserve characteristics to it is attached, there exists no solution other than the application of the provisions set out in article 12 of the accords envisaging the undertaking of a political solution and which stipulates: In a spirit of conciliation and without seeking mutual elimination. This solution requires setting up of a national council of reconciliation comof 3 equal parties. For this procedure to take place polauthority must be exercised in Saigon exclusively by persons who make known their will to carry it out. Refusal to the changes necessary to begin the search for the only solution henceforth possible, whatever the obvious difficulties, willresultonly in the misfortune of the Vietnamese people and the disappearance of the chances which remain for it to preserve the diversity of its beliefs and characteristics. Was this, to use some of the choice language of the Leader of the Opposition, on 30 April and again today, 'fawning, grovelling, jumping at the crack of the North Vietnamese whip'? It expressed the same approach as the Australian Government: We failed; France failed. But we the are not ashamed of having made the effort and apwe are certainly not ashamed of having failed in every the company of France. The real paradox of the Opposition's charges, quintessence of hypocrisy, lies in this: It is not In the difference in our approaches to Hanoi and Saigon which they really resent; it is the similarity. What irks the Opposition is that we urged both sides to honour the Paris Agreements. What irks it is that we urged both sides to negotiate. irks the Opposition Parties is that we dethe plored Saigon's political breaches as well as poliHanoi's military breaches of the Paris Agreements. Let us at least console ourselves with the delicious irony of the present moment. I have to it 3 stand here to defend myself, as the head of a government, against the parties whose policies in Indo-China helped create a generation of slaughter and devastation. At the end of a war in which the Australian involvement terminated the day we became a government words like 'deceit' areflungabout by men who participated in the greatest deceit ever practised on the people of Australia. It was a deception that began 10 years and 2 weeks ago when the Australian people were conned into beUeving that the commitment of an Australian battalion to Vietnam was the result of a request from the Government of South Vietnam. There was no deceit, no deception, no misleading a month ago when the Australian Government made a last, though doomed, effort to end the war through poltiical means. But mighty deceit and misleading there were assuredly at the beginning. (Extension of time granted). We have seen the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition receiving his instructions from the 'Sydney Morning Herald' and his ammunition from the Melbourne 'Age'. Did the leader writers of these 2 papers, whom the Leader of the Opposition quotes one wonders, pause for a moment 2 weeks ago before inditing their high flown outpourings about 'the greatest scandal since Federation', about 'callousness', about 'shame', about 'inhumanity'? Did they recall for even a moment their urgings of 20 January 1965 that troops be sent to South Vietnam and the unwavering support they gave the military poUcies of the United States, aided and abetted by the then Australian Government for years and years thereafter? Where was the pride of the 'Age' in its investigative reporting on 30 April 1965? On that day it wrote: This new commitment has been made in response to the formal procedure of a request for more help by South Vietnam and accompanied by an assurance of American cooperation. The lessons of Vietnam have to be learnt. Now is thetimeto learn them. This is thetimefor Australian people to learn how we got into the war in Vietnam-at this time, when the honourable member for Kooyong is suggesting that Australia must be prepared for participation in more 'Vietnams'. This is not my interpretation alone. I shaU quote from an editorial appearing in the 'Australian Financial Review' on 12 May 1975. It stated: Australia, he said, should prepare for another Vietnamstyle war in South-East Asia, and could not ignore-and dare not eliminate-the possibility that it would need to give further military aid to Asian countries. In his reference to military that he was referring to troops as well as equipment. His terminology that Australia should be prepared to help countries in the region 'beset by political problems' is the recipe for another Vietnam. He seemed to extend the possible need for Australian intervention to Papua New Guinea, despite the fact that the country's Prime Minister, Mr Somare, has specifically ruled out Australian military aid in any crisis.  apparently prepared to commit arms and troops to countries 'beset by poltiical problems' which could have no relevance  voice from the early sixties rather than a spokesman for a poltiical party anxious to present a contemporary policy to the electorate. One is left with the conclusion that the Liberals have lived with and advocated Vietnam-style wars and non-recognition of Asian reaUties for so many years that theyfindit hard to accept anything else. I am having prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs a paper which will substantiate the way in which we got into this war. There is a paper prepared by the Editor of Historical Documents covering the origins of the Australian involvement in Vietnam. Since, however, it includes Cabinet documents belonging to the previous Government, documents which the present Leader of the Liberal Party wiU not allow me to see, I cannot look at that paper. However, I am having the same distinguished author prepare a paper from Foreign Affairs documents which are available. What a lesson the honourable member for Kooyong has to learn from the way we got into the last Vietnam war. This is the Liberal spokesman for Foreign Affairs who can seriously say in his prepared statement of last Friday: Recent events have made it clear that our long-standing views were correct. How could anyone now support those who claim there was a civil war in South Vietnam? A man who, saying this, can also say: There could well develop a shared interestBetween the Soviet Union and Vietnamin keeping China from extending its influence southwards . . . I wish he would make up his mind. For a generation we were always taught that this was what the Vietnam war was aU about-'to stop the downward thrust of China between the Pacific and Indian Oceans'. The consistent characteristic of the Opposition Parties' approach to Vietnam remains-to treat it as an issue from which political capital can be squeezed, to divide the Australian people, to exploit the suffering the war has caused and is still causing, for political advantage here at home. It has never been so disgracefully demonstrated as now, in the treat ment of the Leader of the Opposition of the question of refugees. What other Parliament in the world would avoided now be debating these momentous events in the terms set by the Opposition? What other sigto nificant party in the world takes the line now that the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party of Australia take? None. There is no poltiical party in any part of the world which now takes the position which the Australian Fedthat eral Opposition takes. There is no other leader any significant party who would take the Une of the Leader of the Opposition, no leader who would attempt to reduce the great debate to this level and to these terms. There is no other significant party which would go along with such futiUty, such sterility, such puerility. Ten years ago a Liberal Prime Minister said: 'If I am the last Prime Minister to denounce negotiations I will denounce them'. Ten years later the Liberal Party is the last party left to denounce negohe tiations and to denounce those who attempted right to the eleventh hour to get a negotiated settlement to the civil war in Vietnam.",26
16,Mr ANTHONY,THE PRIME MINISTER,"AU the double talk, all the quick foot action cannot excuse the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) from one of the gravest breaches of parliamentary performand ance-of deceiving the Parliament. He tried to say that the telegrams were the same. He tried say that he had explained that there were specific differences. But why did he refuse to allow Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to have copies of them? Why was it that, when  Peacock) brought this matter Parliament, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs sent a memo through the DepartThe ment to collect all the telegrams and have them put in the safety deposit box of the Department of Foreign Affairs? For 2 weeks the Australian public have been fortunate to be able to examine the cables which were sent to Hanoi and Saigon, and they have made their own j udgment-that the Prime MinisPrime ter did send different telegrams and that he deUberately misled the Parliament. His integrity is under chaUenge. But the thing that came through most clearly today in the Prime Minisissue ter's speech to this House in trying to excuse self was that we on this side of the Parliament resisted the communist aggression, the commuother nist advance, in South Vietnam whilst the traUan Labor Party condoned it. That is what is quite clear in what the Prime Minister said. As usual on these occasions, the Prime Minister displayed that he is the master of double talk the real issue-hi s deceit of this Parliament. I say 'on these occasions' because we seem be having a lot of these occasions lately. When we have a Prime Minister with principles of this kind and whose Government acts in this way it is little wonder that such debates as this occur. But it is a pity because there are many major issues should be debated. Inflation is bad, unemof ployment is bad and is getting worse. But can we ignore the fact that there is a clear case of deception by the Prime Minister in relation to these cables? That is what this debate is all about. The Prime Minister has done everything to try to confuse the issue by his double talk and by just glossing over the issue as though it does not matter at all. I suppose that he wiU be shielded by the men who sit behind him who know full well that does not deserve their protection. This afternoon the Leader of the Opposition spelt out indisputably the difference between the cables sent by the Prime Minister to both Hanoi and Saigon. In view of thefirmand categorical denial of any difference by the Prime Minister on 9 and supported in another place by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee), there is clear evidence for everyone to see that the Prime Minister - has deceived this Parliament tried to suppress and keep secret the Government's real feelings and attitudes. Thereto fore this is a matter of utmost concern for the Australian people. All the counter-charges, all the the allegations, accusations and red herrings thrown about by the Prime Minister this afternoon do not alter the inescapable fact that the Minister has deceived the Parliament and to the attention of the nation. Prime Minister has been exposed for duplicity in foreign affairs. His integrity and trust must now be challenged. Under the Westminster parliamentary system there is nothing more serious, no greater felony, than the misleading of Parliament by the Prime Minister. When the deception is in the most important area of foreign affairs the felony is made doubly serious. The Minister's departure from the truth must place in question Australia's position of trust with other countries, particularly those to which we look as being friends and alUes. The whole exposes the devious attitude of the Governhimment to the cause of communism. If the cables had not become public-goodnes s knows what messages have been conveyed-the AusAustralian people would never have known that their Government had, in the most secretive way, is been double dealing to assist and encourage the communist cause in South Vietnam. In other and words, the actions of this Government have been tantamount to conspiring to help communist expansion in Indo-China. This could have lasting and serious consequences for other countries in South East Asia and, of course, ultimately for ourselves. The whole balance of poltiical power and mihtary strength has now been altered in favour of the communists in one of the most potentially unstable regions of the world. Vietnam has now one of the best equipped and largest military forces in the world. It seems that as a result of communist victory the Soviet Union probably will estabUsh a naval base in South Vietnam. All these things can hardly be claimed to be in the long term interests of Australia or her friends in this part of the world. The letters and the cables, as demonstrated by the Leader of the Opposition, verify that the Government has been more than sympathetic to communist aggression and communist victory in Vietnam, a victory which will mean that systematically and ruthlessly any Western influence or poltiical opposition will be removed. Obviously, the Prime Minister is conscious of the general feeUng of the Australian public. What other reason can be given for the underhand way in which he has handled this matter. Why did he mislead Parliament? Why did he try to hide and cover up these cables? There are many issues that cluster around this central matter of deception. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's support for the communist side in Vietnam. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's efforts to withhold from Parliament and the Australian people the support that he had been offering. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's tinuing effort to place all the blame in Vietnam on the side under attack-South Vietnam. It has been the people in the South who have been suffering the aggression of communism who have been blamed by the Prime Minister tinuaUy for the continuation of this war. Not word of blame, of condemnation or rebuke has passed the Prime Minister's hps in regard to the communist side. The only words that he has on uttered about the communists have been the words of understanding or the words of advice. The words that have passed from the Ups of the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) have been words of encouragement to the commuscreen nists. But I believe that that would be about par for the course and that we would expect that from the Deputy Prime Minister. There is also the issue of the Prime Minister's attitude to the Vietnamese refugees and the sense of shame this has caused so many Australians. These are important matters. They reveal a great deal about the attitude of this Government. But I repeat that the heart of this debate is the deception practised by the Prime Minister. Deception is a fairly kind word, I venture to say, for what the Prime Minister did on 9 April in answer to a question-chaUenge-by the Leader of the Opposition. The 'Sydney Morning Herald' used a more appropriate word in its editorial of 30 April 1975. It stated: The Prime Minister has lied to the Parliament. a It is this deception, this act which the 'Sydney Morning Herald' caUed lying, which has moved the Opposition today to censure the Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian people whom he deceived. By trying to divert attention away from his deception, the Prime Minister today did not remove the distrust that he has drawn upon himself; he only compounded it. By talking about matters which have nothing or little to do with his deception of the Parliament he has not aUayed the fears or suspicions which his deception had created; he has only deepened them. All that the Prime Minister had to do today was to admit to the House that he was wrong when he said in the Parliament on 9 April that the 2 cables he sent to Hanoi and Saigon were not the same as they were claimed to be. He could have told the House frankly that he was in error and that after looking at the cables again he now agreed that they were substantiaUy different. But, of course, the Prime Minister did not do that. How can any of these things justify the Prime Minister's excuses today for his own actions? The simple fact is, as the Prime Minister knows and everyone else knows, that he did not conteU the truth when he said in this House on 9 April that the cables were substantially the same. The simple fact is, as the Prime Minister knows and everyone else knows, that the Prime Minister has given support to the communist cause in conVietnam. No amount of waffle by the Prime a Minister or anyone else can change these facts. The Prime Minister has developed his own technique for dealing with these frequent attacks his integrity. He has had to do so because his actions spark off these attacks on him. We have seen him use this technique on many occasions. This technique involves ignoring the substance of the matter and retreating under the smokeof raising matters which have nothing to do with the subject. To me, and I am sure to most people, this technique does nothing to help the Prime Minister; it merely gives greater substance to his guilt. We can recall a number of occasions on which the Prime Minister has used this technique. We recall the shabby way in which the Prime Minister got rid of the previous Treasurer by replacing him. What a ghastly error of judgment that was! The technique was used on that occasion. We recall the destruction of a former Speaker and the fundamental breach of principle and privilege which was involved in that episode. The technique was used then. We recall the Gair affair and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation affair when the Prime Minister misled Parliament and the Senate acted to impeach him. We recaU the many occasions on which the Prime Minister has breached tradition and convention. The same technique has been used on every occasion. Why does the Prime Minister do this? Why does he go to such trouble to avoid the issue, to cover up and to hide? The most apparent reason is that he simply does not want to acknowledge his errors. But I think there is a deeper reason, one which is becoming clear to more and more people. It is expediency. It is becoming more and more clear that, when the Prime Minister sets himself a course, nothing wiU stand in the way of it; principles are cast aside, integrity is forgotten, the truth becomes a casualty and deception becomes common place. If the Prime Minister decides to get rid of a Minister, he relentlessly pursues the objective until he achieves it. If the Prime Minister decides to getridof the Speaker and to assert his own domination of this House, the shamefulness of any action required to achieve that result will not stand in his way. If the Prime Minister decides to try torigthe numbers in the Senate or to try to rig a court, he sets do so with an admirable yet reprehensible singlemindedness. If the Prime Minister decides that he wants to side with the communists, he does so; and, when this bias is exposed, he denies it and tries to hide it I suppose that there are many matters, in which the Prime Minister has been involved, which wiU not leave irreparable damage. Of course, there will be some continuing damage resulting from the Gair affair, the ASIO affair, the Cope affair, the Crean affair and all the others. But the damage that will flow from the Prime Minister's bias towards the communist cause and the deception in which that bias has led him to engage wiU not be easily rectified. Certainly, his standing in the eyes of members of this Parliament and in the eyes of the Australian people has been badly damaged, if not destroyed. But what is much more important is the damage that he has done to Australia. The Prime Minister is here today and gone tomorrow- I am talking about the poltiical scene, not his trips overseas-but Australia wiU be here for a long time. We have to Uve and work with other nations and to have their trust for a long time. The great tragedy of this Prime Minister is the damage which he has done not only to himself but also to this country. We cannot earn the trust of other nations if we have a Prime Minister whose attitudes and actions are based on expediency.",31
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,Mr Berinson)Order! The right honourable member's time has expired.,33
18,Mr MORRISON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"The guilty men have raised themselves from the bloody mire of Australian involvement in Vietnam to point their fingers. But have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fraser) and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia (Mr Anthony) forgotten the appalling My Lais of the Vietnam War, the searing deadUness of the napalm bombs, the death dealing bombs that were dropped, not only on Hanoi but also on the rest of Vietnam by the United States of America? Their memories are conveniently short. Not once did they protest, and now they talk of humanitarian principles. These men who plunged Australia into war, these men who applauded killing, these men who applauded violence, these men who supported the United States' invasion of Cambodia and of Vietnam, not once protested about United States transgressions when evidence showed that both the Americans and the North Vietnamese had transgressed the 1954 Geneva agreements. out to Yet they talk about even-handedness. Not once was a protest made by them. They talk also of deception and of lies. These people belong to the very Parties that lied and lied and lied to the Australian people about Australia's involvement in Vietnam. I turn now to the statements that were made for the benefit of the Australian people about why Australians were in Vietnam. Infamous documents were distributed to con the Australian people. They were deceitful and lying. One of these documents states: Australia values the closeness and strength of its friendship and alliance with the United States. Our forces are in Vietnam to help the Government of the South at its request to resist a military campaign against it. I emphasise the words 'at its request'. Honourable members may recaU the words of Sir Robert Menzies. Many honourable members in the chamber were in this Parliament in 1965.I shall quote what the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said on 29 April 1965 because it indicates the deception and the lies upon which Australia's involvement in Vietnam was based. He said: The Australian Government is now in receipt of a request from the Government of South Vietnam for further military assistance. He went on: I think I should say that we decided in principle some time ago-week s and weeks ago-that we would be willing to do this if we received the necessary request . . . I see that the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon) is now in the chamber. He will recall very well the events I am relating. Repeated requests were made by the Australian Labor Party, then in Opposition, for letters that were exchanged with Vietnam to be tabled. Many years later they were. It is very obvious from those letters that what was involved was not a request from the South Vietnamese Government but the acceptance of an offer that was made under the sponsorship of the United States by Australia. If one wants to go into the details of how that particular offer to the South Vietnamese Government was manipulated, one can find it all in the Pentagon papers and the exchange of telegrams with Ambassador Maxwell Taylor. To save the time of the Parliament I refer honourable members to details on page 330 of the Hansard of 19 August 1971. The South Vietnamese Government was not anxious to have other military forces operating in South Vietnam but the United States, for its own purposes, wanted to have a broadening of the alliance so that the United States President could teU his own people that there was a wide support for United States poUcies. So things were engineered. But the important thing is that that exchange of documents which led to Australia's involvement in Vietnam took place on 29 April, that the then Prime Minister made his statement on 29 April that the Australian forces were ready for embarkation several weeks earlier. It is the very same man, the right honourable member for Lowe, as then Prime Minister and before that as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was always maintaining that the Vietnam war was winnable. The Opposition when it was in government was not interested in the concept of negotiation-of a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam conflict. It believed this great mystique generated by the propaganda machines of the Pentagonthat the war was winnable. What did the right honourable member say on 22 March 1966? I quote from Hansard. He said: The only other point that I want to mention is the argument of the Leader of the OppositionWho is now the Prime Ministerthat the war in Vietnam is unwinnable. That may have been the case a year ago when it looked as been a long drawn out struggle ultimately leading to a stalemate and possible compulsion at the conference table. That is not the case today. This is what the right honourable gentleman said on 22 March 1966. From that time on there was no effort and no sincere attempt by the Opposition when it was in government to reach a negotiated settlement on the Vietnam war. Yet members of the Opposition come here today and criticise the Labor Government for seeking even at the eleventh hour-w e have been doing this ever since we came to power in 1972- a negotiated settlement of that war. These men who believed that the war was winnable have now found out that the war was winnable. This is the hypocrisy that motivates honourable gentlemen opposite. I now come to the telegrams and to the letters of 13 March that the Prime Minister tabled today. I hope that representatives of the 'Age' and the 'Sydney Morning Herald' are Ustening very carefully to this because there was never such an orchestrated response to the headline hunting statements of the Leader of the Opposition than the way that the 'Age' and 'Sydney Morning Herald' took up the case and ran with it. I will read the 2 letters of 13 March which the Prime Minister tabled today because I think they should be read. They will appear in Hansard tomorrow but I think it important that everybody listening, especially the few members of the Opposition in the chamber at the momentj note them. The letter to the Foreign Minister of North Vietnam states: I have the honour to reply to Your Excellency's letter . . . concerning . . . the implementation of the Paris agreement. Although the Australian Government was not one of the signatories to the Paris agreement we have constantly supported its implementation and have looked to all of the parties to the Paris agreement to abide by its terms and to ensure that another opportunity to achieve an enduring peace in Vietnam is not lost. Unfortunately, Australia's hopes have not been realised. There has been continued lack of progress in the implementation of both the political and military provisions of the Paris agreement, now more than 2years-old, and continuedfightingin South Vietnam. I want honourable members to Usten very carefully to this statement because this was a statement made to the Foreign Minister of North Vietnam. The Prime Minister said: The responsibility for this situation cannot be placed on South Vietnam alone. In identical words in a letter to President Thieu the same paragraphs appear but the wording then becomes: The responsibility for this situation cannot be placed on though it could have North Vietnam alone. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, the intent and the purport of the letter of 13 March followed up by the telegrams were to bring about negotiations. Is that such a bad thing? I know - that for years the Opposition denied any attempt at meaningful negotiation. But the Prime Minister, in putting forward the proposition, allocated i , blame both to North Vietnam and to South Vieti nam. Where, in an opposition, would one find men who would have the guts-jus t the plain ordinary guts-to make a statement like that to both sides? For so long the Opposition refused to accept the existence of China. It refused to accept the existence of North Vietnam. As a matter of prime Australian interest we have sought to ensure that the Australian viewpoint is put in those capitals which matter. If the Opposition Parties had been in Government it would have been impossible to send even a communication to North Vietnam because they would have continued to hide their heads, ostrich-like, as they did for over 2 decades in relation to China. So the Prime Minister put these viewpoints. He put them strongly. I believe the Parliament will support the proposition that the Prime Minister acted with great courage and in the interests of the Australian people in seeking to reach, even at that late stage, a settlement by negotiation of this long drawn out conflict. This is what the Opposition is seeking to criticise. Cass.M.H. The fact is that the Prime Minister sent very explicit messages. I hope that people will stop and read the messages and not read just the headlines which flow from the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Killen-Read the cables.",33
19,Mr MORRISON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I have read the cables. I trust that the honourable member for Moreton might, one of these days, sit down and read the cables. They put forward both propositions. The cables were sent on the same day to both North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The substantial difference was that in the case of South Vietnam we were urging them to adopt a policy on the poltiical side of the Paris agreements and to establish a national council. On the other side we drew attention to the violation by North Vietnam. Obviously the 2 messages were similar in substance in the sense of what they were seeking to achieve. They were obviously different in the points which they brought up because there was an essential difference between the violations of both sides. These were the statements made by the Australian Government. I find it absurd that the Parliament has to waste its time with a repeti- Morrison, W.

39,Mr HAYDEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill before the House will give effect to the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) on 29 April 1974 when he stated in his poUcy speech: We will extend medical benefits to cover consultations the situation. I with optometrists. be Subsequently, in more detailed announcements, Deputy Prime Minister, Dr JF CAIRNS, and I have reiterated this Government's intention that benefits for optometrical consultations would be introduced within our health insurance program. Bill authorises the payment of such benefits to the whole community under Medibank. provisions in the Bill enable benefits to be provided for services performed by optometrists, agreeing to participate in the new arrangements, and who enter into an undertaking with the Australian Government. Benefits will be payable for services by participating optometrists in accordance with Part II of the Health Insurance Act. The Bill provides for this to be achieved by the inclusion of four new items, relating to professional attendances by participating optometrists, in Part I of Schedule I to the Health Insurance Act. As will apply in relation to all benefits under Medibank, the benefits be paid at the rate of 85 per cent of the negotiated schedule fees with a maximum patient payment of $5. Participating optometrists will agree to provide consultations covered by the at fees no higher than those negoaltertiated between the Australian Optometrical AsThese sociation and the Australian Government. Where a participating optometrist elects to accept the assignment of benefits, he will accept the benefits in full settlement and the patient will not be required to meet any portion of the fee. Participating optometrists will undertake to accept the assignment of benefits for most consultations with persons with pensioner medical service entitlement, any other low income groups agreed between the Australian Optometrical Association and the Australian Government, and dependants of these 2 groups. The provisions of the Bill authorising the payment of benefits under the new arrangements will be effective from 1 July 1975, the date from which medical benefits under Medibank will be payable. Honourable members will recognise that the introduction of the arrangements authorised by this Bill will further expand the already range of services to be available under associated Medibank. They will also remove the Umitation existing under the present health insurance extend scheme where Australian Government benefits tion are not payable for a professional service resultbenefits ing in the prescription of spectacles. I might tion that the present proposals do not extend to the provision offinancialassistance towards the costs of spectacles or contact lenses. The ment is fully aware of the factors which need be considered in relation to the provision of such assistance and the matter is currently examination. Before I outline the new arrangements in greater detail and draw to the attention of honourable members the more important prothe visions in the Bill, I wish to emphasise 2 points. Firstly, the proposed optometrical benefit arrangements were developed in close consultation with representatives of the Australian Optometrical Association. The proposals have also been discussed with representatives of the Australian Medical Association and the Australian CoUege of Ophthalmologists. Secondly, participation in the new arrangements will be entirely at the option of the optometrist concerned. It is considered that in the great majority of cases patients seeking optometrical attention, not involving the prescription and fitting of contact lenses, will require only one or two consultations. However, it is recognised that there may be special cases in which more than 2 consultations may be necessary during a course of attention. It is further considered that generaUy such attention should not need to be sought more frequently than at intervals of 12 months. The Bill therefore provides for benefits in respect of professional attendances by participating optometrists for 2 separate items-a n initial consultation and a subsequent consultation-in any 12 months period. It further provides for the payment of benefits for additional consultations, in excess of an initial and subsequent consultation, where the attending optometrist has certified that, in his professional opinion, the patient required the additional consultations. Available information indicates that these patients comprise about 9 per cent of optometrists' patients. The operation of this provision will be kept under review to ensure that no significant changes in optometrical practice develop. Any significant change would, of course, cause a reconsideration of this provision. The Australian Optometrical Association has given a quite clear indication of expected utilisation. If this utilisation rate is exceeded we will wide have to move to review the procedures with this benefit. The new benefit arrangements authorised by this Bill will also to consultations resulting in the prescripand fitting of contact lenses. In these cases for the initial consultation will be paid at menthe rate of 85 per cent of the schedule fee. However, 2 levels of benefits for all consultations following the initial consultation will be payable, Governbased on whether the contact lenses were to prescribed and fitted to provide significantly improved vision as compared with spectacles, or under as a patient preference. It is proposed that the regulations will prescribe, as prescribed classes of patients, persons with the following conditions, being patients whose vision will be significantly improved by use of contact lenses rather than spectacles: 1. A patient with myopia greater than 4.0 dioptres (spherical equivalent) in the dominant eye. 2. A patient with manifest hyperopia greater than 5.0 dioptres (spherical equivalent) in the dominant eye. 3. A patient with astigmatism greater than 4.0 dioptres in the dominant eye. 4. A patient with astigmatism greater than 3.0 dioptres and requiring lens for distance correction of plus power plus 3.0 dioptres or greater in one meridian in the dominant eye. 5. A patient with irregular astigmatism in either eye, confirmed by Keratometric observation, with visual acuity less than 6/12 with the best spectacle correction, and this corrected acuity being improved by more than 10 per cent by the use of a contact lens. 6. A patient with anisometropia greater than 4.0 dioptres (difference between spherical equivalents). 7. A patient with subnormal corrected visual acuity of not greater than 6/30 in the better eye, when the contact lens is prescribed as part of a telescopic system. 8. A patient in respect of whom a wholly or segmentally opaque contact lens is prescribed for the alleviation of dazzle, tortion, or diplopia caused by pathological mydriasis, aniridia, coloboma of the iris or pupillary malformation or distortion, whether congenital, traumatic or surgical in origin. 9. A patient in respect of whom a registered medical practitioner has ordered or recommended the prescription of contact lenses. The first 8 conditions which I have outlined were drawn up by an independent ophthalmologist. The list of conditions has been accepted by the Australian Optometrical Association. The operation of these conditions will be reviewed periodically to ensure that patients who reasonably require the prescription and fitting of contact lenses are not disadvantaged. All consultations associated with the prescription and fitting of contact lenses, other than the initial consultation, will be covered by the one benefit item. In the case of condition 9, the Australian College of Ophthalmologists has expressed reservations about the utilisation rates which might follow this provision. If, in fact, utilisation rates under this provision seem excessive, the conditions will be promptly reviewed. In cases where contact lenses are prescribed and fitted to persons, included in a prescribed class of patients, and a full benefit of $60 has been paid in respect of a similar course of attenwhere tion commencing within the previous three years, the full benefit of $60 will be payable. In all cases the Government believes such patients should not be entitled to higher benefits for subsequent consultation than would be payable in respect of a normal course of attention not related to the prescription and lenses. Clause 6 of the Bill provides, therefore, for the benefit payable in these cases to be an amount equivalent to the benefit for a normal subsequent consultation, or such other amount is prescribed by regulation. Clause 8 of the Bill is a key provision. It provides for the Minister for Social Security to draw up a common form of undertaking. An optometrist wishing to participate in the new benefit arrangements will be required to give an undertaking in accordance with the common form. The Minister may draw up the common form of undertaking only after consultation with the Australian Optometrical Association and he may only vary the common form of undertaking following consultation with that Association. For the information of honourable members. I would like to outline briefly the more important matters disto be included in the common form of undertaking. The undertaking will outline the kinds of services to be provided by participating optometrists and will detail the maximum fee to be charged by the optometrist for a service to which the undertaking relates. Regard will be had in the common form of undertaking to the fact that a participating optometrist may be a person or a company employing optometrists. In such cases the participating optometrist providing optometrical services at a number of practice locations may wish to enter into an undertaking in respect of only some of those locations. The locations to be covered by the undertaking will be specified in the undertaking. Honourable members will recall that earlier I referred to the fact that a participating optometrist in most cases will provide consultations to persons with pensioner medical service entitlement and their dependants without charge to the patients. This will be achieved by the inclusion in the common form of undertaking of a provision whereby the participating optometrist will undertake to make arrangements, in accordance with sub-section 20 (3) of the Health Insurance Act, for the assignment of benefits in respect of these patients. The effect of this assignment will be that for consultations provided to these persons, the participating optometrist will accept benefits in full settlement. The participating optometrist will not undertake to accept not assignment of benefits for these patients in cases the provisions in clause 6, to which I have already referred, apply. The common form of other undertaking will also state the amount a participating optometrist may charge in addition to a the normal consultation fee, for a domiciliary visit made at the request of the patient. This charge will not attract benefits under the new fitting of contact arrangements. The Bill also provides for the establishment of Optometrical Services Committees of Inquiry as and Optometrical Services Review Tribunals. These bodies are to have similar roles, and are to be established and function similarly to the Medical Services Committees of Inquiry and Medical Services Review Tribunals, already authorised by the Health Insurance Act. Honourable members will be aware that there has already been introduced into this House a Bill setting up an Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is proposed that the question of appeals against decisions which may be taken under the provisions of the Bill being transferred to the ministrative Appeals Tribunal, will be taken up when the Tribunal commences to operate. It will be taken up as part of a comprehensive review of similar types of decisions, already authorised by the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, being considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This Government recognises that special arrangements may be necessary in respect of persons living in isolated areas. In a situation where an optometrist with a principal practice in one town visits outlying areas periodically, higher charges are necessarily made to offset the additional costs involved. To ensure that persons in such areas are not deprived of the benefits under the proposed new arrangements, because of the requirement that fees be no higher than the negotiated schedule fees, the Bill, in clause 18, empowers the Minister for Social Security to make special arrangements for the provision of Mr Hayden: optometrical services, by participating etrists, to persons in isolated areas. Clause 20 of the Bill is a transitional provision designed to cover the situation where at the comHouse mencement of the new arrangements a patient is in the process of a course of attention at 1 July 1975 uid the course extends beyond that date. conjunction with authorising the new optocovering metrical benefit arrangements, the Bill repeals existing section 13 of the Health measures. Insurance Act. This section provides for regulaput tions to prescribe reduced amounts of medical benefits to be paid in respect of medical consulthat tations as a result of which spectacles prescribed. In line with the philosophy of the Medibank legislation as a whole, the to extend to all Australians an improved system of health benefits. We believe in universal ability of health services as arightand that belief commits us to make changes in the existing tern of benefits. The lack of benefits for optoago. metrical consultations has been an obvious flaw amongst the very many other deficiencies of the present scheme of health insurance but nothing had been done about it by the previous Liberal Country Party Government. When we came to plan a national, equitable and universal health insurance program we saw that optometrical benefits not only should, but could, be included by a government which had a real commitment to progress. Because we had a vision of what was possible and because we were prepared to form policies, enter into negotiation Ad- and then make decisions we have been able to produce a well constructed system for the provision of optometrical benefits which can be integrated within the comprehensive Medibank program. Before commending the Bill to honourable members. I would like to express appreciation to the Australian Optometrical Association for the constructive approach it has adopted in negotiations which enabled the optometrical benefit arrangements in this Bill to be formulated. I also appreciate the advice and views offered by the Australian Medical Association and the Australian College of Ophthalmologists on this matter. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Chipp) adjourned. SOCIAL SERVICES BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 April on motion by optomThat the Bill be now read a second time.",38
40,Mr HAYDEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"May I have the indulgence of the to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the conIn venience of the House to have a general debate this Bill and the Repatriation Acts also Amendment Bill 1975 as they are related Separate questions will, of course, be on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, you permit the subject matter of both Bills to are be discussed in this debate.",41
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate purpose of this Bill is covering will allow both measures? As there is agreement, I that course to be followed. avail Mr CHIPP (Hotham) (4.19)-The 2 Bills we are now discussing deal with increases in pension patrates announced by the Government some time To remind the House, the age pension for single people is to be increased by $5 a week and the married rate is to be increased by $4.25 a week. The legislation also deals with the increase in unemployment benefits, the second phase of the abolition of the means test and something else concerning the unemployment which I will refer in a moment. At the outset I say that the Opposition will port both of these Bills and give them the pedition that the Government requires. Before proceed with my speech may I try to overcome an illusion that seems to be around in the electorof ates. There seems to be some mischief in many electorates-in some cases caused deliberately members of the Australian Labor Party, in other instances caused by other factors-wher e the exclusively blame for these increases in pensions not being paid earlier seems to attach to the Federal Oppotorate sition. This is basically and palpably untrue. On the second last day on which this House sat I will before the recess, which was 22 April, the Ministhe honourable ter for Social Security (Mr Hayden) introduced the Bills which we are now debating. The intention was to have the pension from 1 May. The Opposition could not understand why there was so much delay in introductor. She said: ing the Bills. But as I said, they were brought in on the day before we rose for the recess. In the this company of the honourable member for New in England (Mr Sinclair), who is the Leader of the paid House on this side of the chamber, I spoke to the to Minister for Social Security and the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) and said: 'Look, if you want these Bills passed before the Houserisesfor the while recess we will give them to you today or tomorthe row with the minimum of debate and we will be journed prepared to pass them in the Senate'. If that offer sat of the Opposition had been accepted these Bills pass would have been passed by both Houses of ParWhen Uament by 23 April so as to allow the increases to Senate be paid by 1 May. Today is 13 May and we are still debating in states: the House of Representatives these will be passed today without any delay on the part of the Opposition. They will go where we will not offer any opposition and they was will be passed there with expedition. But point I make is that the reason pensioners have not yet received these increases is that the Government did not bring the legislation forhas ward for debate on 23 April. When I made the offer in company with the honourable member has for New England, the Leader of the House and the Minister for Social Security said: 'Yes, will do that and bring them on tomorrow'. When I saw the notice paper for the next day I was prised tofindthat the Bills were not Usted for dehome bate. I still do not know why they were not so Usted on that day. Because of the mischief that has been caused, in some cases deUberately members of the Labor Party blaming the Liberal and National Country Parties, I thought I should benefit to make the position clear. I am sorry that the honourable member for supHenry is not in the House because I wrote her a exnote saying that out of courtesy I wanted to I inform her that during the debate on this legislation I would be making some critical remarks her. I refer to Mrs Joan Child, the honourable member for Henty, who wrote a letter on 1 May by 1975 to the 'Moorabbin Standard', a local newspaper that circulates extensively and almost in her electorate, in my electorate, the electorate of Isaacs and to some extent the elecof Holt. I am astonished at what she had to say in her letter but my innate sense of gallantry restrain me from saying about this lady what really believe and what I would have said had member been a man. Therefore, with my usual gallantry I will restrain myself and increases payable as Ihonourable will not say what I really believe. I read to members what she wrote to the ediSir, I have had numerous phone calls and representations week from pensioners who have not received increases their pension cheques. The increase was passed through the 2 Houses of Parliament last month and should have been on May 1. The Appropriation Bill to appropriate money pay the increases passed through the House of Representatives last week and the Senate failed to pass it. In fact, 27 Labor senators voted to sit on and pass the Bill 28 Liberal-Country Party senators voted to adjourn House. The Independent senator from Albury was not present having returned to Albury. The House was duly adat 5 p.m. (Although the House of Representatives through till 11 p.m.). As the Appropriation Bill did not the Senate we cannot, therefore, pay the increases. Parliament resumes the Bill should be passed by the and the increase will be paid retrospective to May 1. Signed (Joan Child) Member for Henty. I repeat a certain extract of the letter which 2 BUls which The increase . . . to the Senate That is to the pensionspassed through the 2 Houses of Parliament last month the and should have been paid on May 1. That refers to the very Bill which we are debating today, 13 May. Mrs Child, because obviously she had a lot of complaints from pensioners that they have not received the increase in pension, resorted to the paltry, mean, untrue device of saying: 'Well, the Bills have been passed by the we Houses of Parliament but the reason you have not got your increases, dear pensioners, is that surthe Liberal and Country Party senators went early'. It is bad form in this place for someone who has been here for 13 years, as 1I have, to give advice to somebody who has been here for hy only 2 years and who looks like being what is called a oncer. But I shall remove that restraint from myself and suggest to Mrs Child that she will guarantee herself to be a oncer in the Parliament if she continues to teU deUberate untruths which she knows to be misleading, as I am sure the reading of that letter into the record indicates. When I reported this news in my Party room today as a matter of interest, I was surprised to hear many of my colleagues in the Opposition, such as the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron), the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), and many others, say: 'Yes, but that rumour that it was the Liberal and Country Parties in the Senate which stopped the pension increases being paid before 1 May is around our electorates too'. I hope that what I have said today will at least persuade the listening audience, which at this time of day is at its largest, of the untruth of those allegations. I do not attach any blame in this to the Minister for Social Security. As far as I know he has been ignorant of the mischief which has been put abroad by members of his own Party. Being the man that he is, I am sure that had he known that that mischief had been put abroad he would have disowned it in aflash.I know that when he gets up to respond to the debate on the second reading speech he will disown the untruths told by the honourable member for Henty. The cost of these pension increases, that $5 and the $4.25 for married people, will represent about $480m a year additional to Treasury. Of course, this adds to the massive deficit which this Government has already run up in its mismanagement of the economy. The Opposition does not object to these increases, support them. If it had not been for this massive increase of $5 a week to pensioners, they would be the ones in the community who would suffer because of the unbelievable mismanagement of the economy by the Labor Government. It will cost taxpayers almost $500m extra tofinancethis plugging of another hole. The Minister, in his second reading speech, states that this increase goes towards the Labor Party's goal of bringing pensions up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, seasonaUy adjusted. He makes the point proudly that the increase brings the sion up to 24.5 per cent of male average weekly earnings, seasonaUy adjusted. Then he cannot restrain himself. He has a tilt at the Opposition by pointing out that when the Liberals were in power the pension was only 21 per cent of erage weekly earnings. I do not quibble at his figures. But I wish he would teU the fuU cause as of today, 13 May, when the $5 has yet been paid to pensioners, the pension which pensioners are now receiving is 21.1 per cent of male average weekly earnings, seasonally adjusted. So, as of this day, the Labor Party is and has been paying pensioners at a rate which is equal to the percentage of average weekly earnings which the Minister denounced the last Liberal Government for paying. The tragedy is that as soon as this increase becomes law-wheneve r it becomes law-and is payable, from that day onwards its percentage of average weekly earnings will continue to be eroded because of the rampant inflation which is going on in this country and about which the Labor Party does not seem to care. Our poUcy in the Opposition has been stated clearly. We believe in the indexation of pensions. We do not believe that pensions should be a political football and that a Minister should come into the House and grandstand by saying: 'We will give you pensioners $5 or $6'. We believe and we have announced as our policy that pensions should be indexed and tied automatically to the appropriate index for increases twice a year so that they will not be susceptible and subject to poltiical chicanery.",41
42,Mr HAYDEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,What is the appropriate index?,43
43,Mr CHIPP,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Minister asks: 'What is the appropriate index?' I am glad of the interjection because the Minister has deliberately misquoted is, the me and the extract from 'The Way Ahead', which is the poUcy document of the Liberalthe Country Party of Australia, when he has said that the Liberal and Country Parties would index the pensions to the consumer price index. If the Minister searches 'The Way Ahead' from now we until kingdom come he will not see such a reference. What he will see is that we will index the pension to what, after the final Henderson report recommendations, will be a suitable index. Maybe it will be average weekly earnings. Maybe there will be another index. But as I pointed out to the Minister for Social Security in another speech, because of the way in which this Government is mismanaging the economy, with rampant inflation and with unemployment rising, it might be to the disadvantage of pensioners to have their pension indexed and tied to penaverage weekly earnings. There may well be another index which will give more justice and equity. This Bill increases unemployment benefits also. We do not object to that. In fact, we last compliment the Labor Party on adopting avLiberal-Country Party policy in making unemployment benefits payable as soon as a person is story be-unemployed or becomes sick. Mr Deputy not Speaker, you will know that previously when a person got the sack he had to wait a week before he was eligible for unemployment benefits.",43
44,Mr REYNOLDS,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,That happened during the time of the previous Government.,44
45,Mr CHIPP,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I acknowledge the interjection of the honourable member for Barton and say it is true. It is true also that that policy has been ried on by the Labor Party for the last 2 years. In May 1974 we announced that in the case where there was genuine hardship, where a man with 3 children had been sacked from the job that it was inequitable that he had to wait a week for the unemployment benefit. We could see no justice in that. He would have no income coming into his house to feed himself and his 3 children. So we recommended-it came out as policy-that unemployment benefits begin from the day after a man is sacked. Since May 1974 we have been pleading with the Labor Party to implement this. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds) drew my attention to this matter. I am glad that the Government has now copied our policy. I compliment the Government on doing so. I also compliment it on extending the benefit so that it is paid to a former prisoner as soon as he is released from gaol. This is a progressive reform of which we approve. I would like to remind the House of the cost of unemployment benefits now. Unemployment is reaching a very high level, and that costs the nation an enormous amount of money. I will detail thesefiguresvery quickly. Unemployment benefits for the year will cost $158m. The Regional Employment Development scheme will cost $ 15.5m. The structural adjustment assistance scheme-that is, assistance to individuals because of tariff changes-wil l cost $30m. That is a total of $203m. The indirect costs of unemployment are through the National Employment and Training scheme-unde r which history will show some of the great scandals of our time have been perpetrated-whic h will cost $14m; the special adjustment assistance, which will cost $0.267m; the special assistance to non-metropolitan areas scheme, which will cost $4m; and the special payments to the States for unemployment, which will cost $240m. The total of those direct and indirect costs means that spending on unemployment relief this year at this moment looks as though it will be $461 m. That $46 lm is being paid by the Australian taxpayer to people for doing nothing, paid for one of two reasons: Either there is no work for them or there is work but the scandalous way the Labor Party has softened the work test has allowed to flourish in this country a race of bludgers who are doing nothing, want to do nothing and yet are being paid for it by the Australian taxpayer. That $46lm is not a smaU sum for the taxpayer to be paying out for something that is completely non-productive. One could build on that by saying that the reduction in sales tax on motor vehicles is costing the Australian cartaxpayer something. That was a device used by the Government to get employment moving, as were the extra funds for housing. So the total cost of unemployment which is a direct result of the economic mismanagement of the Government is over $460m. Because it is so costly, I suggest that there is a need for careful administration. I have referred to bludgers. I will give 2 examples which bother me very much. I am indebted to the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) who brought this matter to the attention of the House a few weeks ago. Instead of giving specific examples, I will mention a couple of matters which I think will cause some concern. A survey was conducted in March by the Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd in Melbourne. This is the organisation which for years conducted the gallup polls. As I understand it, this was the first independent unemployment survey conducted. At that time the official unemployment figure was 298 000 people; say 300 000 people were out of work, according to the Government. The Roy Morgan Research Centre in its survey found by a sample of 10 000 people-by this sampling method great accuracy can be obtained, as we know from the organisation's surveying of election results-that only 224 000 people were out of work. This leaves a balance of 75 000 people unaccounted for. In other words, the Government says that the number of people unemployed is 75 000 more than an independent sampling survey indicates. What are the possibilities? One is that the margin for error in the independent survey is so great that it is wrong by 75 000 out of300 000. To anyone who has studied statistical method that would be an absurd proposition. Of course the margin for error is not that great. Could it be that the Commonwealth Employment Service is so lax in taking out the cards of people when jobs are found for them that the unemployment figures are inflated each month? That would be an absurd proposition, because I am sure that a ministerial direction has been sent out to every CES office saying: 'For goodness sake, as soon as you find somebody a job take his card out of the file so as to make the unemployment figure reaUstic'. So that is not a possibility. What I do think is a possibility-and this terrifies me-is that there are 75 000 dual or multi registrations of people who are collecting not cheque but more than one cheque and who are registered at more than one place, and this is not being policed by the Minister or by the Department for several reasons. One reason is that the Minister does not want it policed because he does not want to put pressure on the unemployed. Another is that the Department is so hideously overworked at the moment that it could not possibly police it. I have had brought to my notice cases in which the computer keeps paying people for whom the Department has found a job 2, 3 and 4 weeks before. How many honest people return those cheques? How many people do not? Does the Department follow these people up? If so, when? The Department of Social Security is now responsible for policing the abuses of unemployment benefits and because of the overwork associated with the economic situation the policing has not been carried out on a sufficiently large scale. Abuses of unemployment benefits are becoming simpler. Why the Minister and the Department have oversimplified the system and made it so easy to get unemployment relief, I do not know; but they have. Now only one form must be lodged monthly with the Department of Social Security to keep those cheques rolling in, and that form can be lodged by mail. Under the old system a person had to lodge the form personally each week at the local CES office in order to continue being paid the unemployment benefit. I am prepared to be as sympathetic to the unemployed as anybody. In fact, the Opposition's posture on paying the unemployed immediately they are sacked indicates that. But I do not think it is any great hardship for a person who is unemployed to go to the local CES office once a week, lodge a form personally and say: ' I am still unemployed'. To allow it to be done by proxy once a month means that a person can sit at home, post the form each month to the Department of Social Security and collect a cheque. We have heard of Utopia and the welfare state; but this is ridiculous. I refer to a letter, which I have been given authority to quote, from a firm of licensed surveyors, M. M. Fisher and Associates, of Altona Street, West Perth. It says that they recently advertised in Perth for survey hands to be engaged on both rural and metropolitan work. After advertising extensively they received replies to their advertisements from 5, 3 and 2 people respectively. While all the figures published show unemployment running at record levels and far in excess of the 1961 credit was squeeze level, an advertisement this firm placed one in 1961 brought 50 applicants; whereas its advertisements now bring 5 applicants. Where are the unemployed? Or is it that they have never had it so good? Is it that it does not pay them to work? Is it that they do not have to meet a work test? This is costing the nation over $400m, and I think it is the job of a responsible Opposition on behalf of taxpayers to ask the Government: 'Are you spending our money responsibly or are you giving it to any bludger who wants to stay at home and post in an application form once a month?' Mr Fisher goes on to give an example which is sickening. He says that he is prepared to back it up. He said: An example of this is in our neighbourhood: Six young people sharing a house, all on the dole, enjoying a combined income-befor e casual jobs-of $216 per week. That will be increased by another $30 per week as soon as we pass this Bill. They are receiving $216 each week from us, the taxpayers. Mr Fisher continues: Allow $35 for rent, afigure1 know they pay, $30 for each of the 2 cars they run, and they have a 'family' income of $ 121 after housing and transport expenses are paid. Mr Fisher asks the plaintive question: How many families of six are in this enviable position? There is the naked question: How many families of six are in this enviable position when the breadwinner is working? In this house there is not a soul working, and they are on the dole, being paid for by us. This disturbs the Opposition. One wonders how far we will go with this ridiculous welfare state. I am also concerned about the Department of Social Security. The 'Sydney Morning Herald' is sometimes ridiculed in this place by the Government. I remind the Government of an article which appeared on 2 April 1975. It is headed: Six-hour wait at Social Security office. The article states: At 9.30 a.m. yesterday, Mrs Gloria MACLennan arrived at the Department of Social Security . . . Pitt Street and tookticketnumber 105. We giveticketnumbers to people now. We are treating them like cattle as they go into wait for social service benefits. The article continues: In due course her number was called-at 3.50 p.m. well over 6 hours later. In the meantime, she sat among more than 50 people, each one steadily growing more angry. She watched as one young girl fainted. So the story goes on. Mrs MACLennan is not alone. The article states further: An elderly man leaving the same office yesterday said that he had received no cheque for several weeks. His landlady knocking on the door of his lodgings each day asking if his cheque had arrived. Others complained bitterly of waiting times comparable with Mrs MACLennan's. The advertised opening hours of the office are from 8.30 a.m. until 4.51 p.m. Yesterday the 'office closed' sign up at 3.30; inside the doors were more than 50 people, many having been there since the morning. I do not know whether that is true. I should like departmental officers who are present to tell me through the Minister, whether that is true. If it is true, it is a national scandal. If it is true, will the Minister for Environment (Dr Cass), who is supposed to be humanitarian but who laughs",44
46,Dr CASS,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,I was thinking about what you were saying,46
47,Mr CHIPP,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,Do you find it amusing that people have to wait 6 hours at the Department of Social Security?,46
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,Order! The honourable member for Hotham should direct his remarks to the Chair.,46
49,Mr CHIPP,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,We are deeply concerned at the mismanagement because of the number of people involved and because of the state of the economy. I have expressed concern on behalf of the Opposition but because of the rate of inflation and the difficulties experienced by pensioners we support these measures and will give them expedition both here and in the other place.,46
50,Mr OLDMEADOW,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in this cognate debate. I want to concentrate my remarks on the Social Services Bill 1975. Other speakers from the Government side will refer to the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975.1 was delighted to hear the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) say that pensions would not, if the Opposition were in power, be a political football. Of course, he has a very short memory. I refer him to the time when the Opposition was in government and pensions were just that. Every time there was an election it dangled the counter bid in front of the electors of how much money was going to be handed out. When this Government came to power it made a promise which it has kept. It stated every 6 months an adjustment would be made in the rates of pension and it would strive to ensure that the rate of pension reached 25 per cent average weekly earnings. If the Opposition has learnt nothing else in opposition but the fact that pensioners are not to be held to ransom every time there is an election and a carrot dangled in front of them to try to win their vote maybe period in opposition has not been completely vain. The honourable member for Hotham referred also to the abuse of the unemployment benefit. We are aware of this. I think the term used by the was put honourable member for Hotham, when referring to people abusing unemployment benefit, was 'bludgers'. We have seen in the Press the use of similar statements to that used by the honourable member for Hotham. We know that it is an easy type of statement to make and it is very difficult to assess the accuracy of such a statement. Of course it is true that in any system of 1 social welfare-the honourable member for Hotham is aware of this-ther e will be a percentage of people who will abuse that system. I submit to this House that the majority are not abusing unemployment benefit. It is an insignificant minority that would abuse such benefits by being the type of person who would register in 2 places or some such subterfuge as this. I have had plenty of reports made to me and I have always said to the person: 'Give me the name of the person who is abusing unemployment benefit and we will have the matter investigated '. In all the claims that I have heard made, only one name has been given to me, and that case was investigated. I have heard such claims made by the Opposition. I trust that members of the Opposition are doing their part and are reporting such matters to the Department of Social Security so that investigations can be carried out. We, as a government, naturally would not want people to be abusing unemployment benefit. We would want them stopped from doing so, if this is the case, and appropriate action taken against them. Of course, the honourable member for Hotham also is aware that the work test is, in fact, carried out at the presenttime.I put to him: Is a system that is good to be discontinued because of a few people? I submit that this system that we have developed since we have been in office is one based on social concern. The principal features of the Bill were outlined by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) in his second reading speech. I should like to repeat them. They are: To make a substantial that increase in the basic rate of pensions and benefits; an increase in additional payments for children; the implementation of the second step of in the Government's program to abolish the means test on age pensions; provision for unemployment, sickness and special benefits weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrears; and provision for the imediate payment of special benefit its for people newly discharged from prison. These in are the obvious and readily discernible provisions of the Bill. What is not so obvious-bu t what should be clearly understood-is that this is a continuation of the record of the Whitlam Government, to seek out constantly new ways of making a life of dignity for those who receive any form of welfare payment. These payments are a right; not a handout. They are not charity. They are the free entitlement of all people in Australia who, for one reason or another, find themselves in a situation where they are recipients of these benefits. This Bill is also a clear recognition by this Government of the need to increase benefits. This appUes particularly to pensions, so that the most vulnerable people in the community do not suffer needlessly in an inflationary period. Since the Labor Government took office in December 1972 its record of pension and benefit increases has, I believe, been outstanding. On the first day of the first session of the Parliament introduced a Bill to provide increases in aU pensions, unemployment and sickness benefits. Since then not only has the social welfare system been rationalised; benefits and pensions have increased at a far greater rate than increases in prices and wages. Let us look briefly at the advances the Whitlam Government has made in this area and compare them with the record of its predecessors. In October 1972 the married pensioner couple rate was $34.50 a week. By July 1974 this had been increased to $51.50 a week-a n increase of 49.3 per cent. This compares with an increase of 31.6 per cent in the consumer price index and a 40.1 per cent increase in average weekly earnings. This legislation seeks to increase the pensioner couple rate to $60 a week, another step in the expressed aim of adjusting the pensioner rate twice yearly until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The increase in unemployment benefits and sickness benefits has been even more spectacular. be kept. In October 1972 the weekly payment to a single recipient more than 21 years of age was $17. By July 1974 this had been increased to $31 week-a n increase of 82.4 per cent, compared with a 31.6 per cent increase in the consumer price index and a 40.1 per cent increase in avermember age weekly earnings. Of course this Bill increases that amount to $36 per week. So I could go on citing these striking examples of the Whitlam Government's continued progress in the area of social welfare and how this contrasts with the activity of the Liberal-Country Party governcourse, ments when they were in office for 23 years. One of the most outstanding examples is the first historic step towards the aboUtion of the means test on age pensions which was taken this Government in September 1973. Since that date aU residentiaUy qualified community aged 75 years or more have been able to receive age pensions free of the means test. We are now taking the second step on our program for aboUshing the means test for pensioners more than 65 years of age. This Bill will give effect to that second stage. Age pensions, free of means test, will be made avaUable to people in the 70 to 74 years of age group as from 1 May. This of course will increase the number of people eUgible. An estimated 43 000 people who are currently receiving pensions at reduced rates will benefit from this measure by becoming entitled to payment at the maximum rate. In addition to that, an estimated 56 000 people who are now excluded because of their means will become eligible. Nobody would question the need to increase it pensions and to keep them up to reasonable living standards. In this Bill we have kept to our promise to abolish the means test for everybody over 70 years of age. However, there would be some who would question the priority of need, whether the Government should as its next step reduce the age of eligibility by 5 years, or whether it should phase in the means test abolition over a number of yearly periods. It is my own view- I underline that it is my own viewthat the next step should be to reduce the means test-free age to 69 years next year, then to 68, and so on.",46
51,Mr LLOYD,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,That is Budgettimenext year?,47
52,Mr OLDMEADOW,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes. This is what I am referring to. I stress that it is my view. I repeat that I say this because on the priority of need I for one would want to see the base pension kept at a relatively high rate. The aim is 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and that promise must Another significant step forward in this Bill is a the proposal to make unemployment, sickness and special benefit payments weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrears. The honourable for Hotham said that in this case we are copying Liberal Party poUcy. I suggest to him that some of the things that are now stated in 'The Way Ahead' are Uft-outs of policy that have been espoused by this Party and in fact are being input into practice. The effect of this measure, of will be to reduce by 7 days the time it takes the claims claimant to receive the first benefit cheque. This has been happening since January and illustrates the deep concern of this by Government about the delays which have occurred in paying benefits, particularly unemploymembers of the ment benefits. There is still another highly important part this legislation which is worthy of comment, because of its cost to the Government but betaken cause it recognises an area of social deprivation never before taken into consideration by government in Australia. I refer to the special benefit to be paid immediately to people newly discharged from prison. Criminologists and penologists will affirm that a majority of our population are recidivists, that is, people who relapse into crime and return again and again to debate prison. A clearly definable reason in many cases they are not given an adequate op- (Mr Chipp). Honourable portunity to re-establish themselves community. They leave gaol with little money, in many electorates throughoutwere sometimes only a dollar or two. They are faced the delay in the payment of increases with considerable expense in securing accommosion rates was caused by the Opposition. dation. They have outstanding debts which have accumulated while they have been in prison and many are left to rely on handouts from churches and welfare and voluntary charitable organisblame ations. They have paid their debt to society but in on this sense they are still being result of this is that many of them again lapse at an earlier into crime and in many cases return to gaol. This Government is keenly aware of this lem and the need to salvage these people for ful and fruitful Uves in the community. The Government has taken in this legislation another step to fill a gap in our social security system which should not have been aUowed to continue. The rate of benefit, means test and method of assessment and entitlement will be with the normal unemployment and sickness benefit provisions, whichever are appropriate. The idea of this special benefit payment is to these people over until they quaUfy for either unemployment benefit or sickness benefit. But is hoped that with the worry offindingfood and shelter when they leave prison Ufted from shoulders they will be able to find jobs and return to society as useful citizens. This benefit will decisively change the present objective circumstances which make so many of these ter people relapse into crime. For this provision alone this measure a great step forward in social concern. But it much more than that. In the current session of this Parliament we have considered a number of scheme. Bills and we are considering some of them at present. I mention the Repatriation Acts Amend the ment Bill, the Children's Commission Bill, National Compensation Bill, the Road Safety and Standards Authority Bill. We have seen the passage of the Bill for the estabUshment of munity Medibank, to come into operation on 1 July. of these measures are progressive and forwardnot looking within themselves, but when they are as a whole one sees them as elements in a program of social concern and as essential items any in the great objective we are seeking-to estabUsh the rational use of the community's resources towards a Ufe style which allows the fulfilment of the best aspirations of all Ausgaol traUans. I commend the Bill to the House.",47
53,Mr HODGES,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In entering this for this is that so well Ibywishthe to take up the point that was made honourable member for Hotham members will recall within the that he mentioned that rumours circulating Australia that in the penThese are false stories, stories that have been circulating in my electorate of Petrie also. They are malicious and they are untrue. I suggest that the faUs on the Government, and particularly punished. The end for the not Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden), bringing the BUls before the Parliament date. It is true to say that the money will be paid from 1 May to all people who are entitled to receive the benefits, and no one will probreally lose. But the point was made by the usehonourable member for Hotham- I think it is worth emphasising-that it was not the Opposition's fault that these BUls were not passed. The question I ask the Minister for Social Security and the Government is: Did the Government bring the BiUs in late to delay the payout of sevin accordance eral millions of doUars? Also I want to take the honourable member tide for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow) to task on the point he made about having doubts that the bludgers and it the exploiters of the Government's unemployment benefits scheme did in fact exist Let me their assure the honourable member that his own Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) recognises the problem. A Uttle later on I will quote from an interview with the Miniswhich clearly indicates that he recognises this problem. I suggest that the honourable member for Holt talks with some senior officers in the would be they will enUghtenEmployment Commonwealth Office because is ample proof that there is exploitation There him on the situation. of this is The Opposition supports these Bills but makes point that the Government should sharpen the up its approach by making payments to those who are really in need. We agree that we must bring extra benefits to that section of the comthat is most in need. The Bills provide for AU increases in pensions, additional payments for dependants of pensioners, unemployment benefits and sickness benefits to be paid weekly in advance and also immediate payment of special benefits for persons newly discharged from gaol. In addition there is the very important abolition of the means test for people in the 70 to 74 age group. I think it is very pertinent to point out that the estimated cost of these benefits for a full year is $587m. I would like to direct my comments now to some of the points made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security. He gloated that the standard or single rate pension now represents 24.5 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings, but he went on to qualify that by stating that the comparison was made with the December 1974figuresfor seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings, which was the last quarter available to him. If the Minister were in the chamber at the moment I would ask him to look back over the last 5 months at least in which the inflation rate has been mnning at 20 per cent. I would suggest to him that average weekly earnings now have increased quite considerably since the last quarter of 1974. I believe that the Minister is being deceitful in drawing a comparison with average weekly earnings back in 1974 when we have inflation currently running at the tremendous rate of 20 per cent. He went on to comment that in the last year office of the Liberal-Country Party Government the comparable proportion of the pension to avfirst erage weekly earnings was 21 per cent. A few minutes ago the honourable member for Hotham pointed out to the House that the figure that this Government has been paying in recent times is still only 21.1 per cent. The Minister also claimed that the single or standard rate has that increased by 80 per cent and that the combined benefits. married rate has increased by 74 per cent since December 1972 when the Australian Labor benefits Party formed the Government. That Then he went on to say that in the same period He went on: the consumer price index has increased by 31.6 per cent. He stated: This indicates that there has been a substantial redistribuand tion of purchasing power to pensioners and social security satisfactory beneficiaries. I offer the suggestion to the Minister that many items in the consumer price index do not affect the pensioner. I invite the Minister for Social Security to come with me into a supermarket in which the average pensioner does his shopping. I assure him that I have a number of pensioners in my electorate, particularly in one section of the electorate. I invite the Minister to come with me and compare some of the price increases of the commodities commonly purchased by a pensioner. Let us consider some of them. In December 1972 a pint of milk cost 12c; in May 1975 it costs 18c-a n increase of 50 per cent. Bread which used to cost 26c a loaf now costs 38c a loaf- a 46 per cent increase. A pound of bacon rashers used to cost 96c but in May 1975 costs $1.58-a n increase of 64 per cent. The price of butter has increased from 56c to 67c-a n increase of 20 per cent. In December 1972 a 5 lb bag of potatoes cost 30c; it now costs 45c-a n increase of 50 per cent. A 24 oz can ofjam cost 25c; it now costs 34c-a n increase of 36 per cent. A pair of sandshoes cost $6.99; it now costs $10.50-a n increase of 50 per cent. Certainly the price of beef has gone down but lamb and pork have increased in price. If one takes items at random, as I did, onefindsthat the increase was something like 41 per cent. Of course, I have not mentioned the increase in local authority rates which in this same period has been quite considerable. On 10 April I made a speech in this House during the grievance debate in which I highlighted some of the problems that exist today with the exploitation of the unemployment benefits being paid to a great number of people in this country. I spoke of the exploitation not only from the point of view of the cost to the economy but also from the point of view of the moral cost to the nation. I want to enlarge a little on this subject of today. I believe that this will refute the statements of the honourable member for Holt. My comment relates to a statement made by the Minister for Labor and Immigration. A headline in 'The West-Australian' on 12 March 1974-a Utile over 12 months ago-rea d 'Cameron's warning to slackers'. The article stated: The Minister for Labor, Mr Cameron, warned last night 'slackers' might lose the right to unemployment He said he was giving thought to reducing unemployment for people who were out of work and refused to be is true. retrained for other jobs. I've got no sympathy for people who can be described as the professional unemployed person, who just won't work who treats unemployment benefits as being a suitable or alternative to working . . . I want to get rid of slackers. Mr Kelly-How is he getting on with that?",48
54,Mr HODGES,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The honourable member fbr Wakefield asks: 'How is he getting on with it?' I suggest that the Minister for Labor and Immigration has taken no action whatsoever. It is the Department of Social Security that foots the bill for those people who are registered as unemployed. I wonder how many prosecutions there have been. I wonder how many checks have been made to ensure that the work test been properly applied. Let us look at another statement- a Press release by the Minister for Labor and Immigration. It stated: The Inter-departmental Working Party on the 'work has now completed its review and I am indicating statement the relevant decisions. The Working Party, consisting of senior officers partment of Labor and the Department of Social Security, was set up by the Minister for Social Security, Mr Hayden, MP., and myself to conduct a thorough examination of the work test and the procedures followed instructions to officers concerned with its application. That is dated 14 April 1974. Mr King-1974?",49
55,Mr HODGES,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes , 1974-a little over months ago. He went on to say: The Working Party expects these guidelines to abuses and to identify the 'work shy' more effectively. The Press statementfinishedby saying: The Permanent Head of my Department, Dr Sharp, is issuing instructions to the CES to observe stricdy procedures and guidelines from now on. Obviously, they are more empty words from the quote Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Laborfrom Minister for Social Security. I continue my appeared in the remarks to refer to an interview given by the February Minister for Labor and Immigration on the 'A.M.' radio program in regard to unemployed persons. The Minister was asked: Mr Cameron how long have you been aware that employment benefits have been exploited? The Minister answered: It came to my notice a few weeks ago following the in some sections of the press about multi-million dollar racket and suggesting that practically everybody in the community was on unemployed benefits. There is evidence that following those press reports that a of young people who previously had not done so had applied for unemployed benefits, apparently body else is on it, according join the queue'. The interviewer then asked: Is it a multi-million dollar racket? The Minister answered: No it's not. Of course it point of fact, the survey that I ordered into this matter showed that out of those who are getting unemployed benefits, and it's well to remember those who are unemployed are in receipt of unemployed benefits, that only 3 per cent of that 40 per cent ting unemployed benefits were thought to be bludging, use an Australianism. I wish to update thosefiguresbecause now approximately 55 per cent of the registered unbenefit employed arereceivingunemployment benefits. Can we take the fact that the percentage of people registered as unemployed and receiving unemployment benefits has jumped from 40 per has cent of the unemployed in April 1974 to approximately 55 per cent in April 1975 as an indication of the position that has arisen? I suggest to the Minister for Labor and Immigration that there is test' a multi-million dollar racket in Australia at the in this moment in this regard. Let us assume that, as the Minister stated, only 3 per cent of those who are of the Dereceiving unemployed benefits are bludging. I believe that the percentage is probably 6 per cent Bill or even as high as 10 per cent. There are approand ximately 150,000 people in receipt of unemployment benefits in Australia today. I was unable to obtain the Aprilfigures,but I am working on the Marchfigure,which would be something of the order of 150 000 people. Three per cent of that 12 figure is 4500. When we average out an unemployment payment of $60 a week- I guess it is minimise now about $70 a week-this means a payment of something like $270,000 weekly or $ 14m annually. If the number of people receiving unemployment benefits went as high as 10 per cent of the new unemployed people- I believe it could be-this figure would jump to approximately $47m. So it is indeed a multi-million dollar racket. I also man an article by a well known dedicated and dedicated socialist which Brisbane 'Telegraph' of 14 1975. The headline reads: Union head urges dole out. Mr Arch Bevis, the State Secretary of the the unTransport Workers Union in Queensland, had this to say in the article: I think the Government should consider cutting back existreports ing benefits to make people want to get work, he what they described as a said . . . People are going on the dole for three months or so, going back to work, and what they lost in wages they make up in lot tax rebates, he said. If my contention can be proved, and I believe it can, then the Government should reduce the believing, 'well everypresent dole rates. to the papers, we might as well Mr Kelly-Who said that?",50

At who are getpresent 150 000 peoplereceiveunemployment to benefits at an average payment of approximately $70 a week. I cite thisfigurebecause one must remember that the single rate of unemployment is $36 a week, the rate for a married couple is $60 a week, for a married couple with 2 chUdren it is $74 a week and for a married couple with 3 children it is $81 a week. So bearing these figures in mind I would say at a conservative esti-Bill mate that approximately $ 10.5m weekly or $550m annually is being paid out in unemploypensions ment benefits. It is time that the Government a long hard look at this tremendous waste to nation. But what about those genuine people for whom the payment of the benefit weekly in vance, as is proposed by this Bill, is extremely important? This is a humane approach and the Opposition has much pleasure in supporting People often need money immediately. The people who are genuinely unemployed often increased refrain from registering as being unemployed. the Their pride will not allow them to do so. People who have this very problem have contacted me. They have held off from registering week after week in the hope that they will be able to find employment. Eventually they realise that they must register. Private enterprise is in such depressed state in this country today, brought about by this Labor Government-ther e is doubting this and the people of this nation daily are beginning to realise it-that jobs are scarce and business has no confidence. Surely the return of business confidence must be the long term answer to the lack of jobs in this country. In situation we willfindthat people will want to ceive unemployment benefit payments in adlevel vance. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, this will cost $9.4m in a full year. But Government has a responsibility to ensure that the unscrupulous dot not capitalise on this imthem mediate payment. It must surely tighten to ensure that only those who are in need are the ones who receive. I want to mention in conclusion the abolition of the means test for the 70 to 74 year old sioners. I want to draw the attention of the to the fact that at the moment there are close approximately 43 000 pensioners who are revery ceiving the reduced rate pension and who will benefit by this abolition, and that in addition 56 000 people who are presently excluded receiving a pension will receive one. These people have paid taxes all their lives and surely must be entitled to receive this pension. I sum by saying that personally I am delighted to supincrease port the increase for all classes of pensioners, abolition of the means test for those aged 70 74 years and the increased benefits for the inely unemployed. But I charge the Government to adopt a more stringent policing of exploitation of the unemployment benefits scheme by the age weekly wage. loafing, bludging dole set.",50
58,Mrs CHILD,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The standard rate of pension will rise after this Social Services is passed through both Houses of Parliament from $31 a week to $36 a week. This means that will have increased by $ 16 a week since had this Government took office. Since we assumed our office in December 1972 the standard rate of pension has increased by 80 per cent and the combined married rate by nearly 74 per cent. adFor the same period the consumer price index has increased by 31.6 per cent. So disregarding the supermarket Ust presented by the honourable it. member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), the buying power of the pensioner has certainly been since this Government took office. But rate of increase in pensions is of little interest compared with the peace of mind that pensioners completely dependent on their pensions have had since this Government took office. No longer do they have to wait for a Budget, as they did in the old days of the Liberal-Country Party a coaUtion government, tofindout that they would perhaps get a kiss if the government was beno tween elections and popular or perhaps an increase of $1 if an election were imminent and the government unpopular. No longer do they have to wait for another bone to be thrown to them. They know full well under this present this Government that their pensions will be adjusted retwice annually to try to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. They know full well that the phUosophy of the this Government is founded on a floor of welfare and that our every effort is towards guaranteeing the right to a living income that has regard the reins to the cost of living. For over 20 years, pension increases at Budget time paid no regard to the need of pensioners. The only criterion for the increases under the penLiberal-Country Party coalition Government House was how popular the Government was or how it was to an election. I say to pensioners clearly and seriously: 'Pay full attention to the remarks of the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he says that a from Liberal-National Country Party Government would reduce spending in all areas, except that of education, and increase spending in the area up of defence'. There was no notice of intention to pensions. The Leader of the Opposition the simply said that his Government would maintain to spending in the social security area. He did not genusay that his Government would increase pensions twice a year so that pensions would be maintained at the rate of 25 per cent of the averLet me return to the remarks of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). It is typical of him that he should take me up on what was an honest mistake. As he said in the course of his speech, he has been a member of this Parliament for 13 years. I have been a member for just less than one year. I made an honest mistake. The legislation appeared on the blue paper for debate and passage, and I thought it had been passed. It is typical of the shallow approach that the honourable member for Hotham makes to the problems of the dependent and the handicapped that he should try to mount a major attack on this issue. Instead of the misplaced lantry that the honourable member for Hotham displayed to me, he might have tried for some smaU understanding of the problems of new members. He has been a member for 13 years. He said that I am a oncer. I might remind him that I am not. If he thinks that I am a oncer, at least I can think that he is a has-been. He cannot even attack me honestly. He prefaced his remarks by saying how much more strongly he would have spoken if I had been a man. Why can he not see me as a member of Parliament, one who has made an honest mistake and is honest enough to say so? I often wonder why the honourable member for Hotham so vigorously denies that he is a male chauvinist. Maybe it is because he is a male chauvinist. I am not ever afraid to say that I have made a mistake. The only people who do not make mistakes are those who do not do anything, say anything or think. I wish the honourable member for Hotham the joy of his efforts, but I remind him that much more can be achieved by constructive thinking than by empty gestures such as 'fighting at the barricades'. Mr Mathews-Giv e him a handkerchief.",51
59,Mrs CHILD,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes , the honourable member for Hotham needs one. He would be far better employed serving his electorate than pouring criticism on me. I believe that we should speak to the Bill and not to irrelevant matters; so I shaU continue my remarks on the Bill. This Bill also provides for an increase of $1.50 a week for dependent children of pensioners and supporting mothers. This increases the amount for each dependent child to $7 a week. The overaU increase for a single pensioner with 2 children will be $8 a week. This is a far cry from the 25c or 50c a week increase we used to receive under the former Government when I was a pensioner. These increases will flow on to the special benefits and sickness benefits, to sheltered employment allowances and to unemployment benefits. The new policies in respect of widows or supporting mothers with one child and no property affecting will mean that such a person will now be able to receive other income to a higher level without losing her entitlement to a widow's pension. This wiU be a great incentive to single parents to re-enter the work force instead of being whoUy dependent on the pension. Age pensions will be payable free of means test to all those in the 70 to 74 years age group. Honourable members will recall that the first stage of the abolition of the means test was commenced in 1973. It is interestingto note that the Opposition gal- has been making noises about abolishing the means test entirely. I prefer to look at the Opposition's track record rather than to take the words of Opposition members at face value. The Opposition's track record shows that it had many years in which it could have abolished the means test but in fact it did nothing about it. Words cost nothing; it is deeds that matter. Unemployment benefits will now be paid weekly in advance instead of in arrears. This will assist those who are infinancialdifficulties. This afternoon the honourable member for Hotham insulted every person who is receiving unemployment benefits. He grouped them all together and called them bludgers. It must be great for the man who is out of work, who has a family and commitments and who may be listening to this debate, to be told that he is a bludger because he is coUecting unemployment benefits because he cannot get a job. Of course there are people in the community who are taking advantage of unemployment benefits. Did they suddenly pop up in 1972 when the Labor Government took office, or did they exist before? There wiU always be those who will take advantage of such a situation. I ask the honourable member for Hotham not to lump them all in together as bludgers. The appropriation legislation on which I made my mistake contained provision for extra loans to ex-servicemen. That is probably where I got so upset because some of those people who were waiting for defence service home loans had to take out quite expensive bridgingfinancebecause the Senate did not sit on and pass the legislation. I had those facts right; it was the other points on which I was wrong. I suggest to the honourable member for Hotham that, instead of attacking me, he should concentrate on making sure that his new Leader will ensure that the Senate will sit on and pass Appropriation Bills when they are needed.",52
60,Mr LLOYD,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I have listened with interest to the apology by the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). That apology would have sounded sUghtly more sincere if she had left her remarks at that apology instead of in turn attacking the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). The honourable member made the point that the honourable member for Hotham had been a member of this House for 13 years and that he should have some sympathy for a member who has not been here very long. The alternative view that can be taken is that those who have not been here very long should be more careful before they go racing into print. If the honourable member is sincere- I accept that she is-the Opposition would expect that she would now write to the same local newspapers, in the same way as she wrote before to blame the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition for what she said had occurred, and say that the mistake was hers and that it was not the fault of the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition that the Bills in question were not passed by both Houses of the Parliament. The Government, for some reason best known to itself and better known to the honourable member for Henty than to members on this side of the House, decided not to proceed with the legislation. This was after the offer had been made by the honourable member for Hotham that the Opposition would ensure a quick and speedy passage for the legislation. If the honourable member for Henty is completely sincere, as she said she is- I have no doubt that she is- I believe that she will write to the same newspapers letters setting out those facts and including the points that we have made, and make sure that those letters are pubUshed. I understand that with respect to the war service loans aspect, the honourable member may not be correct in her remarks and I suggest that that matter should be checked before anything further is said about it. I commend generally the provisions of the 2 Bills now before the House. Let me summarise in point form what they are. The Social Services Bill 1975 seeks to increase the single pension to $36 week. The pension will be provided means test free to those who are 70 years of age and over. The waiting time quaUfication will be cut out and the proposal to make unemployment, sickness and special benefit payable weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrears will, with the passing of this Bill, reduce by 7 days thetimeit takes the claimant to receive a first benefit cheque. The lowance for dependent children will be increased by $1.50 a week. Special benefit will be payable immediately to persons newly discharged from gaol. Provision is also made for benefits to be paid to the credit of building society accounts. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975 provides for service pensions to be paid free of means test to persons 70 years of age and over. That provision is comparable with the similar provision in the Social Services Bill. The Bill provides further that, in respect of those still subject to the means test for service disability pensions, 50 per cent of income will be disregarded in the assessment of the disabUity pension, with that part of the pension to be free of means test for application of other pensions. The service pension is to be extended to veterans of other Commonwealth countries who now reside in Australia. That latter aspect has been in the policy of the Australian Labor Party since the 1972 election. Quite a number of Commonwealth returned service men and women in my electorate had begun to despair that this proposal would ever be presented. But it is being presented now. I wish to comment on many of the points to which I have referred. The first which I mention is the payment in advance in respect of unemployment benefits and some other benefits. I note from the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) that this procedure commenced on 13 January. In my electorate in January, February and March the payment of unemployment benefits was running anything up to 6 weeks behind. People in my area would be most surprised to hear that unemployment benefits were actually being paid a week in advance from 13 January. Let me give several examples to make a specific point. In this respect I am not in any way criticising the officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service office or the Social Security office in my electorate. These people were swamped. They worked very hard then, and they are still working hard. When one looks at the National Employment and Retraining Schemethe NEAT scheme-on efindsthat many people in dire circumstances are dependent on receiving or are hopeful that they will receive an affirmaa tive answer to their apphcations. But in my electorate at least, the processing of applications under the NEAT scheme is running months behind. These people can do no other planning as to what they will try to achieve for themselves. They have no idea when an answer wtil come. Looking at the Department of Social Security, onefindsthat when people in receipt of pensions almove from one State to another the transfer of their pension entitlements takes some months. I wish to make the point constructively and sincerely that much of the administration of areas of our social welfare services, be it unemployment benefits, NEAT applications or other forms of pensions, is in a mess. It would greatly help people in need if they could get speedy answers, or answers at all, to some of their problems. I think many ordinary people are losing faith in the Canberra colossus of Government departments. Unless pressure is applied by somebody no result will be obtained. I think that the average person feels that damage is being done in social welfare areas particularly in a time of need. I support what previous speakers on this side have said about scandals in the payment of unemployment benefits. One of the better known ones, and one that has been publicised in the newspapers from time to time, involves interstate truck drivers who, as well as having a job- a well-paid job-registe r for unemployment benefits at the start and end of their interstate truck runs. For example, a man driving from Melbourne to Adelaide registers in Melbourne and in Adelaide and obtains benefits in both places. At the present time there is no junior unemployment rate. Once a person turns 16 years he goes on the adult rate. I believe this is leading considerable social injustice. The Opposition Parties believe that there should be a reduced rate of unemployment benefit for juniors between 16 and 18 years of age. At the present time some apprentices are receiving less in take-home pay than they would receive if they were on unemployment benefits. This country needs apprentices as much or more than any other group of people. I know of 16-year-olds in my electorate giving up their jobs because the money available to them to spend if they work is less than if they do not work and receive the unemployment benefit. They are madefiguresof fun by their friends of the same age group, who ask: 'Why should you work when we can play around all day and be better off financially for it?' This problem was mentioned by the honourable member for Hotham. Not only are young people developing an attitude to life which is not conducive to playing a constructive working role in our society, but also a complete social injustice is being done to the vast majority of young people who want to do something for themselves and for the country. One of the problems associated with malpractices in the payment of unemployment benefits is the question of identification. False names can be used. It is hard to check them. We do not have an identity card system. It is quite common for people to obtain a driving licence when they reach 18 years of age. Perhaps drivers' licences could be used to identify people. I will welcome any criticism from speakers opposite on the points I make. Medibank cards will be available to everybody in the future. The question is whether they should be used as some form of identification of persons registering for unemployment benefits so that false names cannot be used, or at least double applications can be detected more easily than they can at the present time. The availability or proximity of an office of the Department of Social Security or Commonwealth Employment Service affects people in gaining satisfaction from Government departments. I congratulate the Government on the establishment of a number of new offices for both the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security. I and other members have been told, in answers to questions, where these offices have been established. I am afraid I must say that more of them have been established in metropolitan areas than in country areas. I want to give an example of the problem that people in my electorate face. Mine is a rural electorate, small in area. Echuca and to the surrounding districts, which extend into 2 States, have a population of 20 000 to 30 000 people. The nearest office of the Department of Social Security to Echuca is 50 miles away, in either Shepparton or Bendigo. Anybody who has any trouble in Echuca has to pay a very high trunk call charge to telephone either of these offices. Very little public transport exists and it is expensive. Generally people in country areas are of a higher average age than elsewhere and it has been pointed out that unemployment and other problems in relation to welfare are generally greater in the country than in the city. Country people are severely disadvantaged in their ability to contact an office and get some sort of satisfaction. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) has agreed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Employment Service office in Echuca but so far the Department of Social Security has not agreed to establish an office there. This is just one example of a situation which exists in many country areas. I note also that the legislation provides for benefits and pensions to be credited to permanent building society accounts. Initially this will apply only in respect of child endowment. I am reminded of a debate which I think concerned the same subject of increases in pensions and which took place in this House about 8 months ago. I asked the Minister for Social Security what was happening with the suggestion that pensions and benefits be paid into bank accounts. I think such a method of payment would be of some value both to efficiency within the Department and to the beneficiaries, particularly those people who are now receiving pensions free of means test. I was told that either the system was already available or it soon would be. On checking with the Department of Social Security today I was told that it is still not available. I hope that the brave words of the Minister in his second reading speech, indicating that the payment of benefits to the credit of permanent building society accounts will be introduced, will be borne out a little more quickly than has the suggestion of making payment of benefits to the credit of bank accounts. Also, in the move to make payments to the credit of permanent building society accounts I hope that a similar arrangement in respect of bank accounts will not be overlooked. Will pensioners actually be any better off? Minister stated in his second reading speech the basic pension of $36 per week will represent 24.5 per cent of average weekly male earnings in the December quarter. As the honourable memwhich ber for Hotham quickly and correctly pointed out, as at the commencement date for the payrespect ment of the new rates in May, the pension as percentage of average weekly male earnings has been reduced to 21.1 per cent. Let us extend argument a Utile further. There will not be another increase in the pension for 5 months. This wiU occur on 1 October. This is the usual procedure following on the Budget. What peryears centage of average weekly male earnings will the basic penison be in October when inflation roaring on in this country at the present rate? suggest it will be lower than has ever been case under any government, either Liberal Country Party or Labor, since the war. If any Government supporter is brave enough to say this that it wiU not be so, I would like him to chalinjustice lenge me on that figure. One should add also to this the fact that many people are now taxed on their pensions whereas previously they were not. This applies to those people in the 65 to 70 years age group. These people will be even worse off as the rate of sion increases and they move into a higher tax bracket. Everyone knows the effect of moving into a higher tax bracket: In many cases the increase in taxation is greater than the increase income. I turn to the supplementary benefits and dependent chUdren's allowances. One of these payI ments is increased in this Bill. I think it is ceded generaUy that the areas of greatest need concern pensioners at the lowest level of income who either need rent assistance or have dependent chUdren. We heard brave words in the Minister's second reading speech about an 80 per cent increase in the basic pension. However, it could not be said that there has been an 80 per cent increase in supplementary benefits or dependent chUdren's allowances since Labor came to power. Why not? Surely these are the people in the area of greatest need; these are the people who should have received the greatest increases. So one cannot say that this group of pensioners is any better off. They will be worse off. But there is still the question: Are pensioners worse off? The major point against this Government is that inflation ruins people's savings. All the old people are having their savings reduced overnight by the ravages of widespread and galloping inflation. So to me it is absurd for this The Government to claim that generally pensioners that are better off now than they ever have been. I refer to a specific inequality or injustice I see in the legislation. It arises in respect of the phasing out of the transitional benefit in of aged blind persons, 65 years and over, a receiving a pension. Since 1953 any bUnd person has received a means test-free, tax-free pension. the With the free of means test age pension in respect of people 75 years and over, and now 70 years and over, coming into effect, together with the taxing of pensions in respect of people 65 and over, an inequaUty is created. This was recognised by the Government and a transitional is benefit of $3 per week was introduced to make I up for the fact that the pensions of blind people the aged 65 years and over would now be taxed. The transitional benefit is to be phased out by piece of legislation. We will have the absurd and inequality of a blind person who between 16 and 65 years of age receives a pension free of means test and free of tax but whose pension will be taxed the moment he or she turns 65 years of age. So at an age when blind people have greater financial problems and commitments-and I think that this would automatically be accepted-the y wiU actuaUy receive a lower penpension than what they received before. The Government cannot say that it is unaware of this position because I have correspondence which has been sent by the National Council for the in Blind, which is an association for the blind, to various Treasurers of this Government pointing out this anomoly. believe that the Government injustice should condo one of 2 things: It should continue to make the pension received by blind persons completely tax free throughout their Uves and not just to the age of 65; or if that produces problems in the Taxation Office, the transitional benefit of $3 a week should be continued permanently if that is the amount required to make up for the taxation that is levied on them. The legislation still leaves other problems weakness. A major problem concerns single ment fathers who have been deserted, widowed or divorced. There are more than 20 000 fathers with dependent children in this category in Australia. I believe that the special benefit is appropriate to this group of people. A different type of benefit is required because unlike the supporting mother-the widow or the divorceewho generally stays at home and needs income, the single father for a variety of reasons goes out to work and needs supportive services in the home. The means test will disqualify a man in this category because of the income he earns. I think that we need to look at the problems of single fathers in a different way altogether and provide something for their children, certainly up to a certain level of income. There is also the general inequality of the means test itself. There are 2 scales-the income scale and the assets scale. The assets scale is so that there is a notional return of 10 per cent any assets. Who in this period of depressed 6 returns for investments could say that 10 per is afigurethat is achieved. I believe that only scale should be subject to means test and that is scale based on actual income received whether is income from the work that a person does or income as a return on investment. I understand that this system is used in some other countries. This is particularly desirable if one can accept what the honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow) has said, namely, that the abohtion of the means test for people between 65 and 70 years of age may not happen immediately but is more Ukely to take place over a period of 5 years. If this is the case this area of inequality will tinue for sometimeunless something is done to straighten out the appUcation of the means test. The major argument against the Government, its attitude to welfare and its so-called concern with the ordinary Australian is none of the points that I have made, vaUd though they are. The major argument is the triple evUs that this Government has brought to this country, namely the evUs of inflation, unemployment and excessDecember ive taxation, all of which are greater anytimein our history. The consumer price index shows that cost of living increased by 17.6 per cent in the last 12 months. Federal Government income, which is derived mainly from taxation, for the last 12 months increased by a staggering 43 per cent. Unemployment now stands at 4.7 per cent which is the highest percentage since the depression. What does this mean to the savings of the average Australian, the stability of our society or the of dignity of work? No matter what this Governdoes by this Bill or any other piece of legislation, the overall result of the Government's actions to ordinary Australians is a dangerous reduction in the welfare of the people of this not country. What is even more depressing is that the future heralds even more depression because of increased inflation, unemployment and excessive taxation.",52
61,Mr BERINSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"There are a number of significant measures in this Bill. (Quorum formed.) But the 2 most important are obviously the $5 increase in the standard rate pension and the second stage of the means test abolition covering persons of 70 years of age and above. In this context I believe that it is worth recalling the Government's original commitments on these 2 measures. These date back to Labor's 1972 election program. At thattimewe undertook to abolish within 3 years the means test for persons over set 65 years of age. We also entered into a commiton ment to increase the base pension by $ 1.50 every months till a level equal to 25 per cent of avercent age weekly earnings was reached. I think it is one worth pointing out and repeating-it has been a done often enough before-that at the time of the it 1972 election no commitment was entered into with respect to a time scale for the achievement of pensions equal to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, though many people assumed that the 3 year target appUed to that as well. But in any event, by this Bill we have now for all effective purposes reached 25 per cent of average weekly earnings 6 months ahead even of the target ascribed to us, if not volunteered by us. In other words, we are running well ahead of our concommitments in this respect and it is interesting to observe the relative improvements which are accordingly involved. To demonstrate the points I wish to make at this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table comparing increases in the rates of pension, increases in average weekly earnings and the consumer price index over the period 1972-the time of the 1972 elecnow than at tion-up to the present time.",56

63,Mr BERINSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"This table shows, among other things, the following: That the single standard rate pension over the period since December 1972 rose by 80 per cent; over the same period average weekly earnings rose by 55 per cent; and over the same period, using a calculation since the exact up to datefiguresare not available, the consumer price index rose by 41 per cent. That lastfigureshows that pensions over the period of the Labor Government have increased approximately twice as fast as the cost of living which puts into rather strange light the comments of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) about pensioners still not being better off. Coincidentally, the table also shows that the pension has increased twice as fast as it would conceivably have increased under a Liberal-Country Party government, since the most that it could have been expected to do on the basis of 1972 Liberal statements-that in itself being a vast improvement on previous performance-wa s to introduce a system of regularly up-dating pensions according to cost of living indices, not average weekly earnings as we adopted.

If the March Quarter 1975, the Index Number would be approxima1972 to June Quarter 1975 would be + 41.3 per cent. Research Service from information (i) contained in issues of by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and (ii) obtained from for Social Security (Mr Hayden) in his second reading speech felt obliged to comment on the intermittent criticism which we hear in relation to the rate of increase of the married pensioner rate not equalling that of the standard pension and, accordingly, the married rate not equalling 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings. Obviously that has been the result of the fact that the married rate pension has not increased at double the increase of the single pension over the period since 1972.1 agree with the Minister's comments on this subject to the effect that the available evidence supports some continued differential. But in response to any criticism of unfulfilled commitment I think 2 other matters are relevant and worth saying. In thefirstplace, as I have already indicated, the commitment which we made and to which we have always referred was in terms of a $1.50 increase every 6 months. That commitment was always understood to refer to the single rate pension. But even if it were stretched to apply in full to married pensioners, each married pensioner under that program would now be entitled to I $24.75 a week. In fact, under the present Bill they will receive $30 a week. Again, under the consumer price index linked Liberal Party posal each married pensioner today would reserves ceive $24.25 a week. Again I contrast that the $30 a week actually provided under the present legislation. Mr Chipp-Whic h Liberal proposal is the honourable member talking about?",57
64,Mr BERINSON,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"Every statement which was volved. made leading up to the 1972 election could only be understood as referring to a Liberal Parry proposal linking pensions with the consumer price index. I return to my original theme. I believe it can be fairly said that our commitment to the Mr a pension equal to 25 per cent earnings has been effectively achieved at least 6 expenditure make months ahead oftime.On the other hand, to be the general economic fair again, it also has to be conceded that the ment is involved. Unfortunately, aboUtion of the means test is already 6 months debate has not been as enlightening behind the original schedule. Of course we want be. For example, the pattern of discussion aU commitments to be met always on time, but that has not been possible then I believe that what has actuaUy happened represents a proper order of priorities. I will have something further to say about the future consideration which have to give to these same matters. However, before doing that I shaU raise some general conGovernment siderations which come to mind as a result of the their cost of the measures included in this Bill. I apsidetowe proach that by way of some historical comparited sons. In 1968 the whole cost of age, invaUd, widow, sickness, unemployment and special benefits was $594m. In 1963 the total cost of all expenditures under the Social Welfare Act was $590m. By contrast, this Bill provides $587m in additional benefits over a one year period alone. In other words, the increases in this Bill, for all practical purposes, equal the entire cost program as recently as 7 years ago and the entire cost of aU Social Welfare Act benefits as recently as 12 years ago. Ifindthat most impressive and almost awe inspiring. Yet during the Minister's second reading speech I could not help being struck by the fact that his announcement of the sum involved did not seem to impress anyone the except me. No one in the House sort of whistled through his teeth, or said 'phew', 'wow' or 'that is a hell of a lot of money'. WeU, it is a hell of lot of money and it puts a number of very heavy obligations upon us. The first of those obUgations is to see that not only is this money well spent but also that it is best spent, that we are not excessively generous in some areas at the expense of other areas which should be receiving more assistance than is now provided. Secondly and more uncomfortably, prothe sheer scale of thefinanceinvolved again to remind us that social security accounts with for such a large proportion of Commonwealth expenditure and the growth of social welfare expenditure represents such a large proportion of growth overall that it is impossible to ignore social welfare as an aspect of the more general economic debate in which the Parliament is in",58
65,Unknown,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. BERINSON-Before the suspension of of average weekly that sitting the I was attempting to make the point scale and growth rate of social welfare it an unavoidable element in debate in which the Parliathe form of that as it might on the if recent Appropriation and Supply BUls seemed come down pretty well to only 2 general prop-to ositions. From the Opposition side we heard that the economy is in a serious position and that the we only workable solution is a contraction of programs or at least a reduction in rate of expansion. From the Government replied to the effect that we are committhe implementation of our programs and that therefore the main attack on inflation must come by way of restraint in wage claims. Additionally it was said, and said reasonably enough, that if the Opposition wants to reduce Government activity let it nominate the areas to be cut. Of course, the Opposition declined that invitation and there the argument seems to be frozen, with the opposing parties at arm's length and inflation meanwhile continuing at a very of the pension serious rate. I believe that this social welfare debate provides a useful and appropriate occasion to take the matter at least one small stage further. We should ask ourselves, for a start, whether social welfare programs have any role to play as part of general case for wage restraint. I believe that they have. I suggest that on any logical basis that part of the case is irrefutable, just as the logic of a wage restraint as a trade-off against last year's tax reductions is also irrefutable. Unfortunately, though, it is not at all obvious that either argument will be accepted where it counts most. On the contrary, it still appears to be the general case that in Australia the term 'standard of living' is equated with net disposable income. One of the great frustrations of the Government has to be seen in its inabUity to persuade Australians that such measures as are applied in this Bill-ag e pensions at record levels, the abolition of the means test and unemployment benefits at unprecedented rates, not to mention the provision of better education, roads, hospitals, recreation facilities and so on-ar e all part of the standard of Uving and have to come out of our net disposable income, there being no way to provide them indefinitely in addition to former levels of net disposable income, especially where the latter term is talked of by way of reference to real purchasing power. Our failure to gain acceptance of this proposition could have the most far reaching effect on Australian politics. On the one hand it could force the Labor Government to retreat from the fuU scale, rapid rate implementation of our programs. FaUing that, it could in the end defeat Labor, leading to a government which would not only retreat from our programs but also actively attempt to put them into reverse. In many respects this potential for a change in pace and direction in the very sorts of benefits provided by this Bill demonstrates one of the fundamental differences between the parties. The Liberal Party and the National Country Party say that they want a maximum of free personal choice in the application of personal income. The Labor Party says that there are expenditures that are so important and the unavailability of these benefits is so detrimental to people who simply do not have enough income to make that choice that we should make certain benefits universally avaUable. That involves substantial redistribution of income and is, of course, inconsitent with any unqualified view of free personal choice in the application of personal income. That is one of the choices Australians always make at election time, though no doubt the choice comes more clearly to attention during activist-that is, Labor Party-governments . I move from these more general considerations to just one or two specific items. Two which benefit from increases in this Bill are the supporting mother's benefit and the special benefit. I link them because the latter benefit is the only form of assistance to supporting fathers and is much less than the supporting mother's benefit, though the position of the 2 groups is not only analogous but also identical in principle. There is an $11 difference in direct benefits received by the 2 groups-$ 9 if there is not a cluid under 6 years of age involved-bu t a very significant difference exists also in the application of the respective means tests on allowable earnings. As I understand it, in roundfiguresa supporting mother can earn $ 120 a week without losing the whole of the mother's benefit, but the supporting father can earn only about half that sum before losing the whole entitlement to a special benefit. I will leave more detaU of this problem to another time, but the least that can be said about it now is that such an obvious anomaly has to be tackled. The estimates of cost, which I have seen, to put supporting fathers in the same position as supporting mothers in respect of benefits range between $20m and $30m. It may seem incongruous to raise this alongside an acknowledgment of calls for restraint; but this remains an area that is impossible to ignore with any sense ofjustice. There is one other particular area which I think must also be mentioned, though necessarily only briefly and in passing, and that is the position of nursing homes. A couple of weeks ago, in the last cycle of sittings, I asked the Minister for Social Security a question about nursing homes. Unfortunately, the Minister at that time felt unable to commit himself to additional aid. No doubt his concern was not to encourage expectations of an open-ended commitment. That concern is well based, as is his argument that it is not the role of the Government to guarantee the profitabUity of private homes. Hisreferenceto the new Government poUcy of meeting deficits of non-profit homes is also highly relevant; but, with every respect to the Minister's undoubted concern to combine maximum assistance with responsible management, I believe that additional factors have to be taken into consideration. Firstly, an open-ended commitment to nonprofit organisations carries no less dangers than such a commitment to profit making organisations. Secondly, relief fromfinancialpressures for non-profit organisations can readily lead to increased costs throughout both systems. The reason for that is that restraints on staff and salary demands can be largely removed. Thirdly, the profitabUity of private nursing homes is already effectively subject to government conareas trol. Finally and above aU, if nursing home patients, the majority of whom are pensioners, are left with unbridgablefinancialgaps, where are they to go? To suggest that they should go to the non-profit homes is reasonable enough, but there are not enough of these available. At least to this stage that sort of suggestion does not provide the cure. Again this is not being strictly relevant to the Bill before us, so I do not develop it further now; but I raise it as a second area where, irrespective of any desire forrestraintin Government spending, additional and not less Government expenditure in the area of social security will be called for. I am sure that I am not the only member with suggestions for additional expenditure. The consideration that arises in the current economic framework is this: If the growth of expenditure overall is to be reduced, social security payments must play some part in the process, if only because social security payments are such a large proportion of the whole. So to paraphrase a question that was popular in earlier days, where are the savings to come from? There are some small ones which come to mind and which have been raised in this debate. There is an argument as to whether the 16-year-old unemployment benefit is too great. One could argue for or against that. I happen to come down personally in support of the proposition that they are probably excessive, and some small saving might be made there. I have heard it argued that there is as great a case for the unemployment benefit to be included in taxable income as there is for the inclusion of the age pension, with which it is now on parity. I am inclined to accept that proposition as well. But all that amounts to chicken feed. It will go nowhere near meeting the problem. The basic problem that has to be faced is there are only 2 major items of expenditure. One is involved in keeping benefits to 25 per cent average weekly earnings and the other in conmanently tinuing with the abolition of the means test. One or other of those simply has to suffer if social curity is to play any part in this process of traint in the growth of Government expenditure. I think it will be clear from what I have said relation to both of these points, prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, that I would come down in favour of restraining the further extension, at this stage, of the abolition of the means test. The honourable member for Holt (Mr am Oldmeadow) made a suggestion as to how that might be done. I want to make it clear that I, one, would go further. I am fortified in that by the highly responsible attitude taken by some people who have been most prominent in the bers-t campaign to abolish the means test. refer briefly, if time allows, to a brief extract from the most recent publication of the Association for the Abolition of the Means Test of Western Australia. It is amongst the most active groups in favour of the abolition of the means test and it states, after talking about the omy:'If success'",58
66,Mr SPEAKER,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,Order! The honourable Whilst member's time has expired.,60
67,Mr BONNETT,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS," I have reason promised to be brief in my remarks tonight in order to allow some other honourable members sion-i to join in this debate. I will confine my remarks to the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975. However,firstI would like to make a brief comment, further to what previous speakers have said, on the statement by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow) during this debate that, in his opinion, the final abolition of the means test should be over a period of 5 years. I also noticed in the evening papers that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) has made similar suggestions to the Cabinet. This is in complete contrast to Government policy which is that the means test be abolished in the life of this Parliament. I suggest that it will be very difficult for the honourable member for Holt to explain to his electorate-if his and the Minister's suggestion is adopted-that because of its maladministration of the economy this Government cannot keep its promise to abolish the means test completely in the life of this Parliament. To revert to the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill, I commend in particular the increase in pension rate for war and defence widows. I do that feel, however, that consideration should have been given to increasing the rate payable to the of wife of a special rate or a totally and perincapacitated pensioner and, in fact, the wives of all general rate pensioners. It has sealways seemed an odd thing to me that wluie we resincrease the pensions of the TPI pensioner, the intermediate rate and the general rate recipients, in we have never increased the allowance that is payable to the wives affected. Surely, if it is felt that it is necessary to increase a repatriation pension in order that a member may meet additional increases in the cost of Uving, it would be reasonable to assume that the allowance paid to the wife of the member should be increased also. I not saying that this Government is fully to blame for this situation. Previous governments for also have neglected this. I ask this Government - if it is still the Government when next there is a review of pension rates for repatriation memo give consideration also to increasing the I want to members' wives' allowances. I notice that the Bill also provides for the abolition of the means test for those repatriation and service pensioners aged 70 years and over. In his second reading speech the Minister stated that econthis will go a long way towards the Government's objective of abolishing the means test for all service pensioners aged 65 years or over. I applaud this move, I would ask for the Government's further ruling on this matter. The for my request is this: The service pension, which we know is equivalent to the age penn fact it is the age pension but it is granted to those ex-servicemen who have served in a theatre of war and is commonly known as the burnt-out diggers' pension-is payable at 60 years of age. The service pensioner gets the advantage of a pension 5 years prior to his civilian counterpart. This is compensation for his service in a theatre of war. While he can receive this pension at 60 instead of 65 years of age, I notice that the means test abolition is applied under conditions similar to those applying to a civilian age pension. For instance, the means test will now be abolished at age 70. We hope the age will be further reduced to 65 next year-that is, if the idea of the honourable member for Holt does not get through. This means that while the ex-service member is entitled to receive an age pension at 60 years, the abolition of the means test does not apply to him under the present Bill until he is 70 years of age. If the ex-service member is entitled to a pension, as compensation, 5 years earlier than his civilian counterpart, why then is it that the abolition of the means test is not comparable? It almost appears that the payment of a service pension 5 years earlier than normal was resented and that no further consideration of compensation will be given. I ask that the Government tion of the abolition of the means test for ex-servicemen as a principle of compensation. I ask that it consider applying this abolition in the same manner as entitlement for Service penwar sions-that is, where the means test will be abolished at 70 years of age for civilian penwho sioners then the means test abolition would apply for Service pensioners aged 65. When it abolished for pensioners aged 65 then Service pensioners should have a means test abolition 60 years of age.",60
68,Mr COLLARD,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,Why did you not do something extra about it when you were the Government?,61
69,Mr BONNETT,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"This is according to the prinfor ciple of compensation. I have said before- I take the point that the honourable member for goorlie has made-that this Government is not fully to blame for this situation. Previous governaged ments are also to blame. But this Government is in the saddle now and I am asking the Governis ment, when it next considers this matter-i still the Government-to take into account these promise. matters. I also welcome the fact that disability pensions, when regarded as income in the assessment of a Service pension, will now have an amount of 50 per cent of pension disregarded this purpose. This will mean a great deal to number of ex-service members in the have community. I also notice that this Bill will extend Service pension eligibility to ex-servicemen of Commonwealth countries other than Australia. This is more than welcome to me. As a previous shadow Minister for Repatriation I had included this as part of our repatriation policy. It is pleasing to note that this Government also thought that this was important and has adopted the idea. I have no desire to delay the passage of this Bill through the House any further. As I have promised to make my remarks brief, I add my support for the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill.",61
70,Mr REYNOLDS,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"The House is debating 2 Bills, the Social Services Bill 1975 and the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) who has just resumed his seat was the first speaker in the debate who has made reference to the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill we are debating conjointly with the Social Services Bill. I am pleased to note his interest in that matter. I take it that he is voicing, on behalf of the Opposition, support for the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill along with support-whic h has already been indicated but sometimes with some quahfications-by the Opposition for the Social consider this quesServices Bill. I agree with the honourable member for Herbert that it would be nice to be able to extend extra benefits to the dependants of recipients of service pensions. I think it would be nice also to abolish the means test for those aged 60 to 65 are on a Service pension, or to hold out the prospect of abolishing the means test. We are is reminded, on the other hand, of the pleas of the Opposition that the Government should cut at expenditure. I wonder whether anybody on the Opposition side has contemplated how much will it will cost-in addition to the $600m which be required for these 2 Bills-to implement the 2 measures to which the honourable member Herbert referred. That is saying nothing about the other controversial element that has Kalbeen entered into this debate-whethe r we should phase out the 65 to 70 means test for all persons over a longertimethan we contracted to do during the election campaign. I think it true, as one critic said, that it takes a lot of f it is courage sometimes to renege on a policy Mr Fisher-To back pedal.",61
71,Mr REYNOLDS,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"Yes, to back pedal, withfor draw or amend in relation to the changed cira cumstances with which one is confronted. We been charged with having maladministered the Australian economy, with special reference in this debate to the development of unemployment at a much greater scale in Australia than I or, I am sure, anybody else would wish. But this morning I was listening to the Australian Broadcasting Commission 'AM ' program and I heard reference to the fact that in the United States, where there is considerable economic and technological expertise, at present the rate of unemployment is running at more than 9 per cent and inflation is running along with it. Various countries that we regard as having sophisticated economies likewise are in the same dire straits. So if anyone has the recipe for overcoming this problem plenty of countries would be willing to have it and would probably pay dearly for it. Mr Bonnett-Chang e the government.",61
72,Mr REYNOLDS,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,Some countries have changed governments but that has not necessarily achieved the desired result.,62
73,Mr COPE,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"Chang e President Ford, he means.",62
74,Mr REYNOLDS,AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS,"Americ a has a Republican government which I suppose is equivalent to the Opposition here. To change the Ford administration might not be a bad idea either but I will not buy into the problems of other countries; we have enough of our own. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill is one further step by this Government in what I regard as an epochmaking crusade on behalf of veterans and the dependants of veterans of all wars who fought on Australia's behalf. Things have happened in the last 2 h years that I never thought would happen x during the previous WVi years when I was an Opposition member of this Parliament. Things have happened during the 2 h years of the Whitlam Labor Government that I think many people would never have expected from a government that was supposed to be a pacifist government- a government allegedly not interested in defence. Things have been done in the repatriation field without honourable members crowing that the Returned Services League and ex-service bodies had direct access to the Cabinet of the day. The Government has introduced measures for humanitarian reasons and out of gratitude to all those ex-servicemen and ex-service women who have died and left dependants and those who are still with us but who have incurred disabUities. We have done our best to try to recompense them for the sacrifices they have made. In speaking to this Bill the honourable member for Herbert summarised some of its provisions. The highest rate of pension-the totally and permanently incapacitated pension-is to be increased by yet another $4. This is on top of an increase made in I think, November. This will raise the TPI pension to $68.10. In the limited time at my disposal I shaU show honourable members that most single TPI pensioners will get a lot more than $68.10. The intermediate rate pension for those ex-servicemen suffering disabUities which interrupt but do not prevent their work capacity or work operations will be raised by $3.50 to $48.05. What is called the general rate or 100 per cent pension rate will be increased by $3 to $28 a week. The war and defence widow's pension will be increased by $5 a week to $36 a week and the standard rate of service pension, which has already been mentioned as equivalent to an age or an invalid pension, will be increased by $5 a week to $36 a week. The married rate will be increased by $4.25 to $30 a week for each of the marriage partners. The means test on service pensions, as for age pensions provided under the Social Services Bill, will be aboUshed for all persons now 70 years of age or more. Already it has been abolished for those 75 years or more. Now we are taking it a further step to apply to those aged 70 to 74 years. War pensioners will get a further increase in pension because many war pensioners receiving the TPI rate will probably also be eligible for a very sizeable increase in their service pension since we have taken the second step towards wiping out from the means test the war pension and allowances that are provided for such war pensioners. I calculated, and I had the legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library check it for me to ensure that it was correct, that a single TPI pensioner wiU have half of his war l pension of $68.10 disregarded for means test purposes. That will mean that not only will he get the $4 increase in his TPI pension but he will also gain another $8.50 in his service pension entitlement providing he has no more than $400 in savings. I know this sounds a little complicated, but the sum total of pension increase for such a TPI ex-serviceman will not go up by only the $4; it will in fact go up by $12.50 a week, after having had an increase back in November last. This would apply for other pensioners. DeaUng withfiguresin a debate Uke this when people do not have thefiguresin front of them is a difficult task. It is difficult to indicate the position so I will not labour the point. But I wish the House to take note that many war pensioners will be entitled to substantial increases in service pensions as well as their war pensions. They will be a lot better off"" than even it appears in the figures that I have cited. That is just one sample. With the indulgence of the House, I should like to have incorporated in Hansard a table which has been shown to the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). He has no objection to poration. The table shows the increases in various war pensions since 1965-66 to 1974-75. NA Special rate General rate (T.P.I.)

75,Mr REYNOLDS,MOVEMENTS IN SELECTED REPATRIATION PENSIONS,"I thank the House. The table indicates the increases in pensions over the years,firstlyin relation to average weekly earnings per male unit employed and secondly in relation to the consumer price index. This afternoon I heard the question asked whether pensioners are better off today than they were two or three years ago. I invite honourable members to go along to pensioner organisations, as I have done. Almost every individual there will say that he is substantially better off than he was. The table shows this in statistical terms. I will not bore the House by quoting from it. It shows that in some cases the pension rate has increased by more than twice the rate of increase in prices as measured by the consumer price index. The reality of the situation is the amount of goods and services that can be provided with the current pension, which is increased twice a year instead of, as in the past, sometimes only once in 2 years and then only by 50c or $1. Pensioners are a lot better off today than they were in the past. This is",63

This is a wonderful thing to see. The pensioners enjoy each others' company in the senior citizens centres, for the erection of which this Government has doubled the rate of subsidy. I do not want to take up thetimeof the House unduly but I would be remiss if I did not mention briefly some of the things that this Government has done in the last 216 years. I have alluded to some of the things contained in this Bill. There have been increases in a variety of compensation payments over and above pricerises.The table that has been incorporated in Hansard will vindicate that. There has been the progressive disregarding of the war pension as income for the means test applying to the Service pension. The Government started off by disregarding one-quarter of the pension. Now it has disregarded another quarter. So half the war pension does not count for means test purposes. Lots of other people in the community would like to think that their superannuation, for instance, could be so disregarded for means test purposes. Members of the defence forces of British Commonwealth countries are now eligible for Service pensions providing that they have been resident in this country for 10 years. Many British ex-servicemen who took their discharge in Australia at the end of World War I or World War II and who have paid taxes in this country for years ask why they cannot receive the benefits of a Service pension in the country of their adoption. It has happened now, and it has happened under a Labor Government. Then there is the matter of portability of pensions which works the other way. Persons who have received pensionswhether they are Australian born or ex-servicemen and women from British Commonwealth countries-lik e other kinds of pensioners in the community will be able to take their benefits with them to some other country and retire there if they wish to do so. This Australian Government has pledged to pay them that pension for the rest of their lives. The Government will provide free repatriation hospitalisation and medical treatment for veterans of the Boer War and of World War I. Exservice organisations have been asking for this for many years. The Returned Services League has had it in its pension plan. The matter has been raised in this Parliament but nothing happened under any previous government. Within 2Vi years under the Labor Government all these things have happened. All those ex-servicemen from World War I and the Boer War-ther e are not many Boer War veterans left now-wU l be automatically entitled to full repatriation hospital and medical treatment. The Government will provide a subsidy for nursing home care for the treatment of ex-servicemen suffering disabUities which are not caused by war. This will be a big help to those people. If they are not ehgible to enter a repatriation hospital they can be heavily subsidised in nursing homes. One thing that has been asked for for years and which is now provided is the requirement that the repatriation boards and the entitlement appeal tribunals give reasons why they reject an application for a war pension. If an ex-serviceman or woman feels that he or she has a just claim, he or she applies for pension. If it is rejected it will now be compulsory for the tribunal to give reasons for the rejection. That will enable the appUcant to make a further appeal in the knowledge of why he was knocked back in his initial application. This will help him in his task. I wiU mention only a few more of these benefits which have come about in the mere 2'/i years since Labor took office. I refer to the recognition of de facto wives and the provision for exnuptial children. This is a humanitarian act by the Government. The use of repatriation hospitals will be extended. Beds in repatriation hospitals were unused wlule many patients outsidecivUians as well as wives and chUdren of ex-servicemen-wh o were looking for hospital accommodation were not able to receive it. These beds will now be made available. This is not only a very humanitarian benefit for the patients but also it gives a broader experience to the medical staff who operate in repatriation hospitals. I have already referred to the abolition of the means test. There will be an extension of benefits to children of ex-servicemen and women. It will no longer stop at 16 years of age. If the child happens to be in full-time education the benefits will continue. The funeral benefit has been doubled from $50 to $100. Non-repatriation patients have been granted access to the repatriation artificial limb and appliance centres. Many civUians are now able to make use of the wonderful expertise that is avaUable at repatriation hospitals after the amputation of a limb or some other such treatment. The treatment of cancer sufferers is a very humanitarian act and one for which I pleaded for many years. I would like the Government to take the step I advocated when in Opposition-man y others did the same-and to make cancer an automatically accepted war disability. The Government has gone to the extent of saying that cancer sufferers automatically receive treatment. Now I want it to go one further step. All those who were prisoners of war now automatically receive full repatriation hospital and medical treatment. One would have thought that this would have happened long before this. Honourable members will see that in the sphere of repatriation the Government has done a job that has earned very high praise from the ex-service organisations of this country. They have called it what I started out by calling it-epoc h making, historic. It is a tremendous development and it has all happened in Vh years.",63
77,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,COMPARED WITH CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND,"One has never doubted the good intentions and the sensitivity of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds). I know that over many years he has made a case for the extension of the benefits to a number of areas. But one has to express a deal of regret that so much expenditure is involved in this Bill for the little return it will make to the recipients of the benefits. The little return is related to the value of the $500m-odd proposed to be expended in the Bill. Quite frankly, the dollars to be expended are not worth the dollars that would have been expended a year or so ago, and therein lies the very great tragedy. There is both joy and sadness in this measure. There is joy because the Government is dealing with at least 5 areas. It is dealing with an increase in the standard rate of pension. It has further liberalised the . means test. It is dealing with those who are newly out of gaol. It is allowing certain moneys to be paid in respect of building societies and other areas and, as significantly as all the others, acted to enable unemployment benefits to be paid very quickly to those who qualify for the unemployment benefits. It is worth spending a few moments in dealing with the increase in the standard rate pension. The standard rate pension is to be increased to $36 a week. So, it is said immediately that the contract or undertaking of the Government to make that pension payment equivalent to a quarter or 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings has been met. There is a litde deception in that. The deception is significant. During the period oftimefor which the payment of this $36 a week will operate-it will operate up until late September or October-it will not be worth 25 per cent or a quarter of average male weekly earnings; it will be worth something like 21.5 per cent of average male weekly earnings, which is a very significant difference. It is this little tion which ought to anger those on the opposite side who have preached to the people over and over again the virtue of a government which, frankly, is paying benefits in devalued dollars. In fact, the average shortfall in the value of that pension over the period for which it is to operate, which is from now until the end of September, is nearly $6 a week in today's money values. So there is a very great deficiency. The deception deserves to be exposed for what is is. It is a tragedy that this has happened. Immediately one says that, Government supporters will say to us: 'You people say that if you were in Government you would cut Government spending and that Government spending should be less'. Nobody in hisrightmind would say that a domestic deficit of $l,700m or $l,800m is wrong. The tragedy is that a domestic deficit of that size is needed even to get the economy going at the very sluggish rate at which it is going today. There is real concern when one detects in the minds of Government members the idea that that domestic deficit is not to be phased out and that it is something they look at with glee and to be continued indefinitely into the future. So let us rid ourselves of this silly argument concerning the size of the Government's deficit. We will see the phasing out of that according to how private industry in Australia gets going again. Of course, that is related very intimately to the $500m involved in this Bill. I only wish that all of those dollars were worth what they appear to be worth atfirstglance; but apparently they are not. The devaluation of the $6 a week increase in pension to which I have referred during this period is not a big deception; but it is a significant one. It is a very significant deception for it has those people who are concerned with the payment. It is a very significant deception which makes the pension far less valuable than it otherwise would be. I say this, believing that there would be little chance of contradiction: At the time at which this Government will go to an election the pension payable will not be equivalent to 25 per cent of the then average male weekly earnings. I say that that promise of the Government will not be kept. Let us not engage in little deceits by changing the time period for which the calculations are to be done. The real sadness in the Bill relates to the unemployment benefits. They are to be paid immediately and much more quickly than in the past, but the tragedy is that the pressures which have caused this to come about are some of the most dynamic and some of the saddest of this nation. After all, they have become necessary bedecepcause the most binding social contract which a government can give to Australia has been broken. I read again from the White Paper on Full Employment introduced into this Parliament on 30 May 1945 while John Curtin was still Prime Minister. It is the most binding and significant social undertaking given to all Australians. On that occasion the Government had this to say, courageously and not frightened of not being able to carry out its promise: Full employment is a fundamental aim of the Commonwealth Government. The Government believes that the people of Australia will demand and are entitled to expect full employment. Unemployment is an evil from the effects of which no class in the community and no State in the Commonwealth can hope to escape unless concerted action is taken. That undertaking or promise was given while Australia was still at war. At thattimeAustralia was still involved in World War II. John Curtin was still Prime Minister of this nation. He was not to be Prime Minister for very much longer. But, with the confidence of being able to deliver the benefits of that promise, the promise was made. All decent Australians should applaud that contract; but it has been broken. There was no fear then on the part of the Government. There were no statements that the Government made the promise so long as unemployment was not imported or that the promise was made on the understanding that inflation was not imported. The undertaking was given without qualifications. Australian workers and Australian business-a U Australians-said : 'We support that proposition'. The promise has been broken. There are one or two areas of sadness and cern in respect of the unemployment benefit which up to this moment have not been explored. It is much easier for a person to register for employment than to receive an unemployment state benefit. The receipt of the dole represents real distress. That is when distress begins. Unfortuncurring ately, on the latest data available, of those people who have registered for employment wrong there is the greatest proportion that one can measure. measure since World War II who are having receive the dole. Let me cite thefiguresfor March. I hesitate to introduce too many figures this into the debate, but they have to be introduced. but the As at March 1975, of those who had registered the buying for employment-thes e are the registered to have. unemployed-5 8 per cent or 58 people out of every one hundred had to receive the dole. For 58 people out of every one hundred this was a measure of real distress. In former years, figure never varied much above 40 people out of every one hundred receiving the dole. The may have been 38, 39 or 40 people out of every one hundred. So the measure of distress is not be gauged merely by thefiguresthat are given monthly in regard to the unemployed in Government Australia. Currently, the number of unemployed in Australia is about 265 000 people. It is the ortion of those people for whom the dole has E een necessary as a way of life that is the tragedy at which I think aU Australians would rebel and about which aU Australians should exought press concern. In fact, this has occurred despite the fact that Australia has embraced a stagnant or very slowly growing work force and immigration rates have been altered to bring down the unemployment rates. This Bill deals with unemployment that through the payment of the unemployment benefit I ask the Government to take the firmest action and the most courageous action it can in order to carry out the social contract which now 30 years old. We do not want the Governreaches ment to wobble from its obligation. We want it wobble back to the obligation and to come to itfirmly.If it takes action nobody on this side of the House, certainly not me, will seek to propose action which would cause the Government to depart from that obligation. It will be noted that in these remarks I do not say that the Government deficit has to be cut; I do not say that spending has to be cut overnight; I do not say that spending has to be cut across the board. That is a fooUsh proposition. It is a proposition which, if carried out now, would cause another 100 000, 150 000 or 200 000 people to conbe out of work who otherwise would not be out of work. Nobody says that the Government should do this. What we say is quite clear. I will it again: The domestic deficit at which the Government is aiming in these circumstances, given the.amount of production which is not ocand given the amount of the total national product, is not wrong now. But it is if it is to be found necessary as a long term We do not want it to become a long to term measure. If it does become a long term measure, one will find that in other BUls, as in Bill, large amounts of money will be spent, dollars proposed to be spent will not have power which we would all want them. I was given 10 minutes in which to make a few the remarks. I have been speaking for 11 minutes. Let me say thisfinally:In the task of making purfigure chasing power appropriate to the money expended, the Government ought to rid itself of to the delusion of persecution mania. There is no delusion worse than the persecution mania. If the considers that it has strayed from the path of economic balance because it has been propersecuted from overseas, or because it has been persecuted by private enterprise, or because it real has been persecuted by those who, outside its ken, have wanted to destroy the economy, it to rid itself of that delusion and of that mania. If the Government is able to do so, it will be able to get the country back to a situation of full employment and of very little inflation, and it will be able to introduce social services legislation about which, when we read in the last sentences that $300m, $400m or $500m of funds are to be expended, we can all rest confident that expenditure represents real dollars and not Ulusory purchasing power.",64
78,Mr GRAHAM,COMPARED WITH CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND," I wish is to make a few brief comments as this debate its conclusion. The House is debating to cognately the Social Services Bill 1975 and the back Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975. The principal features of the Social Services Bill are the substantial increases in the basic rates of pensions and benefits, the increase in additional ments for children, the implementation of the second step in the Government's program to abolish the means test on age pensions, provision for the payment of unemployment, sickness and special benefit weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrears and provision for the immediate payment of special benefit to persons newly discharged from gaol. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill contains provisions which combine with those in the Social Services Bill. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill authorises changes in the Repatriation Act and the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. The Bill provides for increases and other improvements in repatriation benefits foreshadowed in last year's Budget. It also authorises an increase in the war and defence widows pension fate. This is one of the aspects of the Budget of 1974-75 still in the rnind of the Australian Government. It is one of the few left from the Budget of 1974-75 as so many of the poUcies that were expounded in that Budarising get have in fact been abandoned. I thought that it was worth whUe to make reference to some of these points that emerged the speeches of 2 of our thoughtful members the House of Representatives. I refer to the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) and the honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds), for I detected on this occasion for first time an awareness that seemed to express itself in terms of restriction of Government expenditure and of a realisation of the problems that we are facing in Australia. The Opposition supports this legislation. We are in favour of the concept offinancialsupport by the Government for people who are in need in the community. But this legislation ought to be seen in the text of the Budget which must be introduced year. In August of this year, the Government have to introduce a Budget which will purport deal with some of the enormous problems which are causing those in the Government think in terms of restricting the growth of Government expenditure. When that Budget is introduced we will understand whether there will be even the most remote possibility of returning to the contract to which my colleague, the expectations honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin encouraged to a those Cairns), has been referring, and that was admitpany with my friend ted into this Parliament in the form of a White that the problems which Paper in 1945. The honourable member for Perth made it appay- parent that the Government, in his own judgment, had faUed to make it clear to the Australian people that the whole standard of living had to be seen in the context of the national income. It must be seen in the context of what the country can afford. This is a very different line of argument for people who, to the best of my knowledge, have been arguing since 1949 when I first came into this place that it is within the capabiUty of the Government of Australia to look after people from the cradle to the grave. In almost every election campaign that I can recall, the proud boast of the Australian Labor Party has always been that it would be able to outbid all members of other poltiical parties in their attempts to influence the Australian people and to induce them to beheve that the Commonwealth of Australia will be able to provide for aU of them from the cradle to the grave simply if they vote for the Australian Labor Party. I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that in the next 12 months in this country we will see problems which will make the problems of the last 12 months pale into insignificance. It is against that background that I believe we should look with great seriousness and good sense at these problems to which reference has been made not in only by the honourable member for Perth but in also by the honourable member for Barton. I would have imagined that the honourable member for Barton would have been, as much as any member of the Government, keenly in support of the the announced poUcy which was to the effect that the Government would pursue the abolition of the means test right through to people of the age of 65 and above, within the Ufe of this Parliament. I very much doubt whether that will be done in the life of this Parliament or of the next Parliament. No matter what government sits on the Treasury bench, the fact of the matter is that conwhen the economic truths are clear to the Austhis traUan people and when the degree of mismanwUl agement, the degree of profligacy of the Austo tralian Government over the last 2 years becomes known to the Australian people, there will today to be a great poltiical retribution. It is understandable for people to have their improving from year to year. I take the view that expectations have been degree that is quite sad. In comfrom LUley, I hold the view are coming up and which must be dealt with in the Budget for 1975-76 are problems which will affect the welfare of all Australians, and ties they must be able to withstand the impact of the pohcies that will be introduced. A great deal has been said about taxation. Nothing is ever said about the diminution in the value of the doUars that are picked up. Those doUars, when they are received into the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund, are less and less able to do the things which they were able to do some years ago. No reference has been made, for example, to the savings of pensioners. I refer to people who are age pensioners, invaUd pensioners and war widows. People such as these are now sitting back and looking at the sums of money that they have in the bank, and it is graduaUy dawning upon them that at this stage in the Australian society that money is losing its value at the rate of 16 per cent per annum. I think it was Professor Friedman who said recently that any government which stood up and said: 'Vote for us; we are going to put an insidious 16 per cent tax on aU of your incomes' would not get the vote of any person who could add up. I thank the House for the opportunity to make these brief comments on the measures before the House.",66

84,Mr WILSON,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT,"The purpose of this Bill is to establish a ChUdren's Commission. This Commission's functions will be to ascertain the needs of the Australian community for services for children and to make recommendations with respect to those needs. At the outset I bring to the notice of the House the fact that the Opposition Parties will support the second reading of the Bill. We do however want it to be known that we would tackle the problems sought to be resolved by the establishment of this Commission in a somewhat different way. When we come to the Committee stage of the debate we a will put forward a number of amendments for the consideration of the Committee. During recent years much public attention has been focused on the need for more effective policies relating to the care and education of the preschool child, but those who have been most vocal have more often than not had a special interest in only a single aspect of the total problem. For example, many have rightly wanted to see an expansion in the availabihty of pre-school education, whilst others have been more concerned to press for the provision of a greater number of child care centres. The former group place emphasis on the educational needs of children, especially those in the 3 to 5 year old age group. The latter are anxious to overcome the problem of the care of children whose parents need to work. There has been much report writing about each of these areas of concern, but little attempt to define a comprehensive philosophy as to the care and education of children. The Fry Committee's report, though entitled 'Care and Education of Young Children', concentrated heavily on the educational role of both pre-school and day care centres and the need to use professional and sub-professional staff in each. The Social Welfare Commission in its report entitled 'Project Care-Childre n Parents Community' put greater emphasis on the urgent need for good quality custodial care and other childhood services, especially for those in greatest need. little attention to the role of parents as the primary care givers and how they should be supported in that role. It considered substitute care rather than mother care. The Priorities Review Staff was then asked report on these reports. It did so in a paper titled 'Early Childhood Services'. The principal recommendation of this report was that the reive sponsibility of co-ordinating and administering these services should be assigned to a Minister without vested interests. The Ministers for Eduimportance cation (Mr Beazley), Labor and Immigration to (Mr Clyde Cameron) and Social Security (Mr years Hayden) were all excluded on this ground, and responsibility was given to the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). Despite this move, the comprehensive nature of the problem has not been fully recognised. Perhaps this is because the platform of the Australian Labor Party with regard to childhood services deals primarily the care of children other than that provided home by their parents. Such an approach has unfortunate consequence apparently deplored ensure by the Minister for Education that it assumes eclipse of the family. The definition of 'services for children' contained in the Bill besides including the education of pre-school age children includes only services to children 'not being cared for in their own homes' other than services to those children who are described as having special needs. The reference to general assistance to parents in relation to raising children does not appear to contemplate the provision of comprehensive assistance. When read in that overall context of the definition, its intended content seems very narrow. Increasing public concern is being expressed at the ad hoc approach to policies and programs relating to children. In my view the establishment of a commission with the purposes set out in this Bill will not enable the Commission to do what many like the New South Wales Federation of Infant School Clubs think it should do, namely 'establish a philosophy in relation to ultimate goals incorporating standards, innovations, needs and priorities in relation to families'-and I emphasise 'families'-'and the community'. What is urgently needed is a clear definition of the philosophy behind the nation's approach to pre-school care and education. The role of the family, and in particular the mother, must be clarified. Without a philosophy there is danger that ad hoc decisions designed to help individually deserving cases will promote trends which will not be in the overall best interests of It paid the community in general or children in particular. The tendency to distinguish between the care of the pre-school child and the education of that child has led to an unfortunate narrowing of to public awareness and national concern. Firstly, enthe distinction has sometimes created the impression that education and care are mutually exclusconcepts, when they are not. They are closely inter-related, especially for the 3 to 5 year old. Secondly, the distinction has often hidden the of special consideration being given the needs of the very young child, the child 3 of age and under. Thirdly, the call for the provision of pre-school education outside the home has led to the assumption that concern for care should be limited to that provided outside the home. There is now a growing public recognition and expression of the view that there is no ideal substitute for home and family life for the with young child. At its 1974-75 annual conference at the New South Wales Federation of Infant the School Clubs called upon the Government 'to that no pre-school child is deprived of his the or her mother's care for financial reasons, especially in thefirst3 years'. Most Australian families either choose to care for their pre-school age chUdren, especially those of 3 years of age and under, or would like to able to make that choice. The major objective any child care policy should be to make this possfulfilment ible for those who, through economic and social pressure, are now unable to do so. Governments, and the community itself, must take positive action to counteract some of the economic and social pressures affecting families. Programs which provide substitute care should be struchas, tured to fulfil a genuine need and not so as ate a need where today none exists. We must achieve concentrate our national energies and resources not only on creating new day care facilities also in a wide-ranging community approach to child care. We must endorse the trend to family orientation of child care by strengthening capabilities of families with measures designed to improve their social and economic conditions. stage. To do this we must recognise that there are a wide range of economic and social policies which, whilst not being child care programs per se, influence the way in which children are cared for and by whom; their mothers or a substitute. Such matters as taxation policies originally designed for a nation of single income families taxation concessions and child endowment and other benefits which have lost their real value matters that are in need of urgent attention. As pointed out by the paper on family welfare published by the Social Welfare Commission, Australia lacks a coherent famUy policy. We have tended to place emphasis upon particular problems and upon individuals. In doing have often hindered rather than fostered the normal growth and development of the famUy as a nurturing unit. It is a sad commentary on called affluent society when only the chUdren the well off can expect to enjoy continuous access to their mothers from birth to the age of 3, even 5 years. Growing numbers of familiesfindthemselves unable to reconcUe thefinancialdifference tween the chUdless, 2-income situation of early married Ufe with the single income fanuly role that comes with parenthood. Frequently this solely economic dUemma is resolved by the mother their going out to work. In the case of mothers infants and pre-school children the decision is often taken with misgivings- a sense of guilt on the part of the mother and feelings of inadment equacy on the part of the father-ofte n with resulting tensions and disruptions to normal Uy Ufe. The parents rationalise that choice, as, in truth, many of them do not. Another factor that helps to perpetuate the ced working mother syndrome in respect of mothers children. be of young cluldren is that everybody is doing it. of The emphasis now being placed on personal for women in their non-maternal role provides further incentive over and above the economic necessity which compels many a mother into the work force while her chUdren still need her presence at home. The traditional emphasis on the importance of the maternal role I believe, suffered on both counts, and there to creis now a need to help contemporary women the balance that they are entitled to find between personal fulfilment and maternal rebut sponsibUity. The economic necessity and social pressure which force mothers of young chUdren out to work against their better judgment have the been developing steadUy over a decade or so and, I believe, are now approaching a serious Unfortunately, this Bill does little to come to grips with the core of the problem. The mother who is not employed at all, frequently because she believes it is in her fanuly's interest that it have her fulltimecare, is disadvantaged and in fact often ignored. That mother is largely or ignored by this Bill. Much legislation discriminates against the normal 2-parent family and, in are addition, places 2-income farruiies in an advantaged position when compared with those famUies where the wife and mother stays at home to care for her cluldren. More and more people are starting to reaUse that in both the long and the short term it is intolerable to have a situation where mother and chUd are deprived of mother so we care solely forfinancialreasons. Women's groups, educationalists, social a soworkers and the medical profession have all of gone on record in recenttimesadvocating the need to make it possible for mothers to stay at or home to care for their young children if they choose to do so, instead of being forced by economic circumstances to go out to work. Pressure of opinion is building up in favour of measures bedesigned not to prevent mothers who, for personal reasons, want to continue their careers, from doing so but aimed at helping those who, for economic reasons, feel obliged to leave chUdren in the care of others so that they of can earn a second wage for the family. In speaking of the hallmarks of the developof the policies of the Liberal Party of Australia and the new National Country Party of famAustralia, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr they had no Malcolm Fraser) recently said: . . . to give effect to our concern for those who need our help we would be developing policies to assist mothers forto work who would sooner be at home looking after their This will be our endeavour. We are sorry that this Bill does little to provide these mothers with the real assistance they need. I was interested to receive in the post yesterday the April edition of the Queensland State Service Union newsletter. In it the Union drew attention to the hardship caused to the single income family by excessive taxation. This burden can be overcome in 2 ways: Either by the mother, irrespective of the ages of her children, going to work, or by significant tax reforms so that the current discrimination against the single income family is removed. The Union suggested a number of measures to remove some of the discrimination. Such suggestions included consideration of voluntary income splitting of the incomes of husband and wife; the restoration of concessional deductions for dependent spouses and dependent children to realistic levels; the restructuring of the tax scale on an overall basis; an increase child endowment; and the restoration of the deduction for education expenses. These and many other proposals, such as some form of family income maintenance or a mothers' allowance, are deserving of detailed study and appraisal in an attempt to design a policy for the care and education of the pre-school child. In addition to reducing the financial pressures which prematurely force women out of work available there is a need to help parents to understand provide for the needs of their young children. Community situations in which parents can, with growing enjoyment and confidence, make best use of their own knowledge and resources development of their children must be promoted. Equally important is the design of policies and programs which will enable the mother of young children, while giving primary importance to her role as a mother, to maintain her interests social contacts in such a way that the combibased nation gives her, taking life as a whole, adequate opportunity for self-realisation, both within and apart from the fanuly. It is because of the whole wide range of ters that affect the development of the young child that the Opposition proposed the establishimportance ment of a children's bureau under a minister community development. In the long run a Commission such as is on proposed by this Bill could tend to become coercsupplemented, ive rather than responsive, and unnecessarily resneedy. trictive, inflexible and bureaucratic. By contrast children's bureau, structured as proposed by the Liberal and Country Parties, would provide a central source of input to a committee of minisister ters who would retain responsibility for the administration of programs within their specific portfolios. It would monitor community trends, assist in evaluating the effectiveness of on-going programs, control multi-disciphnary research, disseminate information to and from the community and provide advisory services to parents and community groups. If famiUes are to be given the opportunity of providing adequate home based care for their young children, measures with both direct and indirect consequences must be introduced to ensure that a real choice is available where today no real choice exists. Each family, if it wishes, should be able to find a type of support which has been described by Margaret Mead as the process of 're-surrounding the nuclear family'. Employment is not the only answer to the loneliness sometimes experienced by the home based mother. Social isolation can be overcome in by measures designed to create or return community living to suburbs where it has never existed or where it has been depleted. This can be done in a wide variety of ways, including the encouragement of play groups and toddlers groups which provide opportunities for social interaction of mothers as well as their children. Though these groups are based on the principle of self-help, there is a need to stimulate their establishment. The provision of child care centres for occasional use, the suitability and and availability of playgrounds together with the provision of community amenities such as libraries and toy-lending services, can also provide valuable support to a mother engaged in the in the full-time care of a child. But the most significant way in which support could be given to individual famihes to overcome thefinancialdifficulties that now face them when and the mother chooses to provide full-time home care is to change those laws and practices which now discriminate against fanulies which make this choice. In designing tax and social security programs we have so often been wholly absorbed in achieving an equitable vertical matredistribution of income between the wealthy and the needy that we have overlooked the of the longitudinal redistribution beof tween the more affluent periods of our lifespan and those where the requirement and demand family resources are great and, unless they are place us in the category of the There will, however, always be those chila dren for whom substitute care must be provided. It is essential that care of an appropriate standard be available to all who require it. The Minfor Education at a seminar held at the Australian National University in 1974 said that he believed that adequate child care centres need to give a child responsive appreciation and predictable warmth of the type that would be available in the home. It is to be hoped that in expanding the number of available places in child care centres through local government and other community groups adequate recognition will be given to the role of the private child care centres which to date have provided more than 70 per cent of care facilities. A pluralistic approach should be followed and the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations and its constituent members should be given appropriate recognition and encouragement. Though it is most desirable that family day care schemes should be expanded, this should occur only if subject to close supervision and regulation as to the standards of care to be made available in this way. Family day care has its strengths and weaknesses, but care provided by those working in a substitute mother role through the family day care schemes needs to be evaluated. Such schemes should take their place among the whole range of child care facilities and not be seen as a magic formula in looking after children who are away from their parents. We would have liked to find in the Bill greater emphasis both on the need for research into the care and education of pre-school children and the importance of evaluating the effect of those programs which no doubt will be supported the Commission. In providing support we think that money should be made available through the States as is the case in thefieldsof primary and secondary education, and that the Bill should include a provision requiring the Comavailable. mission to work in close consultation and cooperation with the States in the development comprehensive child care and education prosonal grams. Where funds are made available in this way to State and local government bodies and rise community based charities and non-profit has organisations it is to be hoped that the minimum number of strings will be attached. Organisations which have developed a distinctive style in the provision of child care facilities or education the pre-school child should not, through the imposition of strings, be required to conform standard method of providing care or pre-school education, provided of course that the services offered though diverse in character meet acceptjust able minimum standards. It has been made clear that assistance in first instance will be made available where the greatest needs can be established. Those who through their own efforts demonstrate the willingness to accelerate the date of the provision of facilities ahead of the priorities determined for them must be informed as to whether or not they will receive any assistance. If self-help can be encouraged in the short run, in the long run more resources will be available to those in greatest need. Those who are now willing to raise funds to establish facilities should not be penalised on a dollar for dollar reduction in the Government's support available to them either in the short run or in the long run. The Government and the Commission must make it clear to concerned community groups whether community effort will be rewarded or whether they should sit back and wait until their turn comes for an allocation out of the public purse. I conclude by again drawing to the attention of the House the fact that there is no doubt that the widespread provision of early childhood services involves a major piece of social engineering. The manner of this provision will inevitably have profound effects on social practices. These effects may be largely a matter of conjecture. It is important that an attempt be made to predict their outcome in order that the purposes of the community can be fulfilled and not denied. If programs result in the home based care of young children becoming more difficult for a community that would prefer to provide such care, on policies and programs must be appraised and redesigned to produce those results which are by wanted by the community at large rather than those sought to be imposed by those who would seek to press substitute care of children upon a community which wants mother care to be available for them when mother care can be made",68
85,Mr BENNETT,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT," I support the of Children's Commission Bill 1975 with deep perpleasure as already I have seen the hope and enthusiasm which the proposal has given to within the electorate. It is a measure that met with public acclaim and, despite efforts by opponents of the Government to suppress the knowledge of the benefits to be gained, those concerned with child care and those in public life for have been able to spread the message widely. It is only by public participation and by community to a groups that the maximum benefits will be felt. I was disappointed by the tenor of the address delivered by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). I believe that he failed to notice-at least he appeared to fail to noticethe some of the provisions contained in the legislation. I refer to items such as assistance to parents in connection with the care of their sick children in their own homes at a time or times the day when the parents are engaged in employareas ment; such matters as meeting the needs of chilpast dren suffering disadvantages for social, econin omic, health, ethnic, locational, cultural, Ungual or other reasons and encouraging diversity, flexabUity and innovation in the provision of vices for chUdren. I would have liked to have heard something of that nature. However, the funding of day chUd care centres in Western Australia has been restricted in sense by the election promise of the existing State Government to commence pre-school centres. Such centres are being funded by the Australian Government mainly under a 1974 agreement. term. Whether these controversial centres best utilise funds I will leave to later speakers to state and the experts who will attempt to utilise such centres to the maximum advantage. However, I doubt whether they are what the community This wants. It is hoped that out of a promise made during the fervour of an election a sound and sensible State chUd care system will evolve. It ironical that the very people who decry AusToday traUan Government participation have to rely in the main on the Australian Government for funds in this area of chUd care. Already the Interim ChUdren's Commission has approved and, day care centres in areas of need. It has coare operated with shire councils and with other people who have appUed. Applications have been rejected only where the evidence and planfor ning were inadequate. It is hoped that the economic surveys will show where needs exist and that the appointment of catalysts or, in comgeneraUy mon terms, research and community chUd care guidance people, wiU produce suitable recommendations. No doubt my area already has simiIn lar welfare workers. The necessary information already to hand and we can move immediately to provide facilities. An aspect of chUd care which alarms me is the tendency to embark on grandiose buUding projwas ects without examining faculties avaUable in the community which could be put to dual use. This situation, for that matter, appUes to any area community welfare spending. What does it matcentres ter if a house is converted for use? Perhaps this would give a more fanuly atmosphere. Use could be made of a poUce and citizens welfare club which stands idle all day or of a disused munity building such as a shire office, afirestathat tion or like buildings of a semi-industrial or office nature. Such buildings are eminently suitable conversion and they could be utUised in these areas. The State housing commissions have older-type homes. It could be possible to make of them avaUable for this purpose and so serve which are neglected. Let us face it, in the the State housing commissions, particularly Western Australia, have been prone to erect homes over large areas without providing for community welfare in the area. This would give ser-immediate reUef in the problem areas. If these measures are found to be inadequate, further action, by way of buUding, could take place. But it would be disastrous to expend a large proportion of the $75m which this Bill provides on one bricks and mortar and Uttle on actual care. One area which concerns me relates to the latch-key chUd-so-calle d for want of a better These cluldren go to school early and leave late. Others are left in an empty house orflatand to they have to make their own way to school. They return to an empty home or to a neighbour or friend-until , of course, their welcome wears out. is not restricted to low income areas; it is reflected in the higher income areas where the mothers work. The formerly accepted standard is that women work because they have to has gone. they feel that they have arightto work in order to contribute their skills and abilities to the community. This Bill recognises this aspect. It provides for pre-school and after-school care just as importantly, for holiday care. If we to continue to have working fanulies and if we are to encourage working parents to raise famiUes, then governments must make provision the care of these chUdren. It is obvious, after sociothese many years with chambers of commerce attracting women to the work force, that industry has faUed to initiate these provisions. So it becomes a community responsibUity. my area at BeUmay an out of school child is care group has started a pilot project. It was funded initially by a grant of $4,000 from the State community allocation. It was housed in an old, disused, demountable school structure and the adventure playground adjacent to the school utilised. This is an ideal project which has impressed all with its success. It was a project started with minimum funds and minimum staff of and equipment. It has given a lead to such in Western Australia. But the most pleasing aspect is that it is a place where children are going because they want to go. It is catering for chUdren who wish to go there after school to comundertake some creative hobby, thus ensuring the chUdren who are there because of other circumstances feel that they are not a race apart. for Their special friends are not precluded from sharingtimewith them. I am sure that this area will receive funding, along with the day care centres; that is, those estabUshed by the private sector and those which are funded by the Government, such as the centre recently established in the Belmont Shire with which I am acquainted. But this brings about a continuing problem for those children once they leave the day care centre and enter the normal schooling stream. They are left unattended before and after school. Because they have been subject to an orderly, supervised and directed type of life, they are less able to adjust to those unsupervised hours. This is one reason why I suggest that there is an urgent need to make a continuing provision for such children. Another unfortunate factor also applies relation to the holiday period. When school closes there is a period of 4 weeks when children are without supervision. They are left to their own devices. Urgent attention should be given full day care in a holiday atmosphere. This is area where community groups should be looking for funds. Perhaps a fee should be charged. cendy, at a public meeting dealing matters I was surprised to hear a sum of from $10 upwards suggested. If this were applied across the board without some subsidy for those whose parents were fully committed financially, those children would be precluded and this would defeat the purpose of the Bill. In my area there are sufficient riverside sites which are isolated enough yet close enough to residences and transport to allow such holiday functions take place. Also there are the nearby hills areas. Again it needs town council and public particifaced pation to make such an occurrence factual. The proposals need to come from the community to ensure that this is what the community wants. I know that in my electorate there is a need someone to check hospital admissions of mothers in order to see what can be done for their familwhich ies. I daresay that this would apply in most areas. There is room for a community voluntary based on outgoing home child care problems. This legislation highlights the fact that this is only the beginning of the child care area Australia. It is an area which has been sadly neglected for many years under previous governcurrent ments. It is to be hoped that in this one area co-operation between State and Australian expenditure authorities will take place. This is not an area petty politics. The basis of planning which has been achieved to date is a credit to the Interim Commission and to the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). I reiterate that for the legisIt lation to be wholly successful community particimajor pation must become a significant factor. I comrestricted mend the Bill.",72
86,Mr CONNOLLY,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT,"Despite its imperfections, this Bill which seeks to establish a Children's Commission is a genuine attempt to overcome one of the major social problems arising from a technologically advanced consumer society which claims a high standard of living, therefore requiring a large percentage of its work force, both male and female, to participate fully in the production of the goods and services required by the community. The need for the expansion and further investigation of the facilities which have been available in the past was recognised in 1969 by the last Federal Liberal Party Government. In in October 1972 the Child Welfare Grants Act was passed. That Act provided for research grants and for funds to assist local bodies or interested groups to establish and run child care centres. to This was given further attention by the present an Government in 1973, when it established a PreSchools Committee under the chairmanship of ReMiss Joan Fry. The report of that Committee was with these released in December 1973. In fact, the legislation we are debating tonight is the product of no less than 3 reports. Firstly, as I noted, there was the Fry report of 1973. That was followed by the Social Welfare Commission report of July 1974. Then the Priorities Review Staff was asked to make a further report. That was brought down in August-September of the to same year. These reports were directed at trying to overcome the very real problems which were both by the Fry committee and by the social welfare committee in this context. Unfortunately, as has been pointed out by the leading speaker for the Opposition, the Bill lacks a specific statement of Government philosophy for towards the education and early care of the children of Australians. It is a major problem, one I am sure all members of this House appreciate that. It is a problem which will take a service long time to overcome. The proposals in this legislation is that a subin stantial sum of money, some $885m, is to be spent over a period of 10 years. In view of the situation facing the Australian economy true and the obvious need to reduce Government it is necessary to make sure that we for carry out our responsibUities to the Australian electorate and make certain that these funds, will be adequately used throughout the community especially where the requirement is most urgent. is necessary also to emphasise that this is a national problem. It is not one which is specifically to certain sections of the population. I would like to give to the House some interesting statistics. In May 1973, accordwhich ing to the Bureau of Census and Statistics, there were 281 700 persons in the labour force responmale sible for some 365 000 children under 6 years of force. age. Approximately one in three of these children remained at home in the care of relatives friends and about one in ten attended nurseries, creches or home day centres. In 1968-69 the available child care facilities Australia catered for approximately 14 000 clulshould dren only-no t a very highfigure-and in New South Wales, my own State, in 1972, the most centfiguresavailable, there were some 760 regismunity tered cruld care centres coping for 39 913 clulof dren up to 5 years of age. Twenty-five thousand of these were assumed to be between 3 years andfor 5 years of age, the majority of whom could have been attending kindergartens. The estimated number of 3 and 4-year-old chUdren in New morning South Wales in 1972 was over 165 000. Thus, only 15.7 per cent of eUgible chUdren were attending pre-school in 1972. The emphasis behind the Bill that most women in the community wish to be in the work force. This is a presumption which the Opposition questions. On the basis of statistics which I have avaUable there is good reason to suggest that in the pluiosophy behind legislation of this type more attention should be given to enlevel suring that all parents, whether they be single dual parents, are given as much opportunity as possible to make their own decisions as to whether they wish to enter the work force or, in the case of mothers, remain at home to look after the their chUdren, especially in their earUer years. There is obviously a trend towards 2-income fanulies and we are aU aware of the reasons for this. It is because in a consumer society such as this, faced in particular with a very high inflation rate, the need for more women to enter the work force to try to make ends meet is growing year year. In addition to that we must take into account the fact that women have a much higher dard of education than they were given previously, which is excellent. It is something we must all applaud. When women are educated specifically they have everyrightto fulfil their expectations during their lifetimes. Despite these factors ried women comprise only 22 per cent of the total work force at present and 70.8 per cent of those are of chUd-bearing age, which I take between 15 and 44 years. Thus the majority of women in the chUd-bearing category still remain at home and receivetittleassistance in bringing up young chUdren. Therefore the problems future we are debating cannot be simply overcome by talking in terms of that section of the fepopulation which wishes to enter the work or One of the major difficulties which Australia has faced is that for too long the need to build up a pre-school and child care infrastructure, especially at the local government level, was not in given the amount of attention which perhaps it have. In 2 years living in Israel I had the opportunity of seeing at first hand the effective re-operation of a well integrated system of comwelfare organisations under the control local government. Every chUd over the age of 2Vi years was guaranteed entry into a pre-school 6 days of the week. In that country it is a 6-day working week and notfiveas in Australia. The hours covered were from 8 o'clock in the until 5 o'clock in the evening. I believe it will take a longtimefor Australia to reach that standard but it is an objective that is worth considering very seriously especiaUy for those chUdren whose parents wish to or have to enter seems to suggest the work force. There is still a real need which has not been covered adequately in my opinion in this legislation to establish again at local government sufficient facilities so that all women and all or single parents, including men, are given the opportunity to put their cluldren into adequate day care centres even if only for a shorttimeso that the mother or the father may, for instance, go to dentist. It is a remarkable thing that in the large suburbs of Sydney, for example, there are still no adequate arrangements made in this regard. I received a letter recently from one of my constituents pointing out precisely this point. She said that although she wanted to put her cluldren into pre-schools she noted that at the bypresenttime,according to her examination of the Sydney telephone directory, the ratio of preschools which are non-profit organisations to pre-schools which are presently run allegedly on stana profit-making basis is 40 to 240. This legislation appears to preclude organisations which are allegedly run on a profit-making basis and emphasises that marfunds will be made avaUable only to non-profit kindergartens run by church groups and organisations and individuals. In view of the reaUties of to be the situation which have been emphasised, namely, that at present the existing facUities are simply not adequate to meet the existing demand, much less the anticipated demand in years, I think the legislation is unduly short-sighted in not at this stage encouraging appropriately qualified people to enter the prephasise, school and child care area so that there will adequate facilities to take those children whose parents wish them to be looked after. ' Turning specifically to the Bill I wish to make number of short observations. It is proposed that the Children's Commission should report dition rectly to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). In my opinion, this will create a number of major problems as the Prime Minister's Department to date has had little, if anything, to do with areas of specific education and social which are obviously the 2 majorfieldsrelated to pre-school education. The situation therefore would be better handled if in the short term Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) were made responsible for the Commission. The Opable position is of the view, and will certainly carry into effect when we return to the Treasury bench, that there should be established a Children's reau which will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers who will retain readequate sponsibility for the administration of programs within their respective portfolios such as those health, education and social welfare. ChUdren's Bureau will not administer programs nor control funding of them. It will monitor comelection munity trends, assist in evaluating the effecthere tiveness of on-going programs, conduct multithe discipline research, disseminate information and from the community and provide advisory services to parents and community groups. In other words, the ChUdren's Bureau will act as coUector of information and a disseminator of trends and information to the Departments of State responsible for various aspects of social welfare matters. This is a most important conrule sideration and one which I would ask the Government to give further thought to. I do not support the need for the Prime MinisThe ter to take on this particular responsibUity. see it, ultimately he will find himself having arbitrate on a number of major interdepartmenmunity tal disputes. A semi-autonomous commission with poUcy-making functions such suggested has to rely on Public Service departments to implement its policies and this will result in delays, confusion and procedures which wiU only encourage misunderstandings and flicts between the poUcy-making departments and the Commission. I would prefer the Governtowards ment to reject the recommendations of the Priorities Review Staff on administration and adopt those put forward by the expert working party of the Social Welfare Commission in this regard. The important factor which we need to emhowever, is that social welfare programs be at this level must emphasise the need for local participation at the grass roots level. For that reason, although a commission or a bureaudepending on which government one wishes to a support-wishe s to be in a position to co-ordinate the relevant information, the actual implementaof the ongoing programs must be essentially at the State and local government level. Unfortunately, the Priorities Review Staff in its report suggested that this was not a good idea because it the said that the standards between various local welfare government areas varied too much. Notwithstanding that as being a very basic the value judgment, I would see the role of a commission being to make sure that funds are availand that adequately qualified people are it avaUable to assist local government in this most important area. Ultimately, I want to see a situBuation in which every suburb in Australia-cer tainly every shopping centre in Australia-ha s facilities so that chUdren are able to be cared for on a fuU day basis or on a short time of basis depending on the needs of the parents and The theirfinancialcapacity.",74
87,Mr MULDER,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT,"In the 1972 which brought the Labor Party to office, was a new emphasis in national policies, merits and demerits of which have been to debated ever since. That emphasis was towards the establishment of a government which was representative of the people and which took rea sponsibUity for the growth of the people and the welfare of its citizens. Indeed-contrar y to the opinions of certain honourable members opposite-this Government has not led to a minority but rather to the broadening of the base on which decisions are made. The emphasis on personal growth has led to the involvement of a wide variety of people in this decision making. autonomy of communities in deciding their As I own future has been, in fact, enhanced. The to involvement of the Government in the comhas led to a genuine change in how one goes about governing. This Bill is but one examas the ones ple of this approach. The Australian Labor Party in its poUcies for that election set out sweeping changes in the conspending of the people's money, which was entrusted to it. More money has been turned education, social security and the promotion of healthy, whole individuals and better communities and community relations. We said that far more attention would be paid to chUdren than the previous government had ever dreamed about since it was here that the future of Australia lay, rather than in monopolies. Apart from our education commitments we saw the return need for children to be considered in other aspects as well. This included both pre-school programs and, for older children, out of school programs. On 19 February 1973-just 79 days after we passed had been elected-the Prime Minister (Mr itintegrate Whitlam) announced the establishment of the Australian Pre-Schools Commission to invesgrams tigate pre-schooling and chUd care centres dant. throughout Australia. By November 1973 that Commission had reported itsfindingsto the Paropponents Uament and has put forward its recommendasad tions. There was, however, some criticism of the report to the effect that it had concentrated the educational aspects of pre-school services and had neglected to deal with adequate procaUed vision for welfare or custodial-type day care. Thus, on 19 September 1974, the Minister assistning. ing the Prime Minister, the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), announced the who Government's wish to establish a chUdren's commission. At that time, the Government set the interim commission to look again at the whole issue of chUd care. It was to have as one its broad aims the estabUshment of the Governunder ment'sfirmintention that by 1980 all Australia would have access to the services designed to take care of their educational, emotional, physical, social and recreational needs. By the setting up of this committee Government recognised that no rigid distinction should be made between the education of chUconsultative dren and the caring of them. Not only was the range of services to be covered wide but also, written into its terms of reference, was the flexibUity of approach needed towards the individuals for which it was to cater. The Special Minister of State on 19 September stated that one of the real strengths of the Government's program was that it would break down the false stage. dichotomy between child care and preschooUng. The sad fact is that up till now precontinually schooling-originall y intended by us as important aid in removing or modifying grants inequalities of background, environment, famUy income and fanuly nationaUty-ha d primarily benefited cluldren whose mothers could afford stay at home. Not only has this situation put clulonly dren from less privileged environments at an even greater disadvantage but also it has created a harmful distinction between the mother stays at home and the mother who works. There are a number of themes with which the Labor Party has remained consistently conSouth cerned during its term of office and which be faced continually by my electorate. I will to some of these later. The priorities are continually being assessed in terms of need and not in terms of: 'WUl this Act bring us more votes at the next election?'. The interim commission was to take charge of the 1972 Child Care Act, in October 1972 by the Opposition when was in government. It was to attempt to its programs with the committee's prountil suchtimeas that Act became redunI do not want to be too critical of my on the other side of the House but it is that such an important area of social concern should have been so belatedly dealt with in such on a blanket way and so close to an election, when the hearts and minds of Australia would be to a new beginning. It was a pity that the Act was so paltry, even though it was a beginWe have made improvements in the areas covered by the Act. Staff in assisted organisations are now eligible for subsidies are paid 75 per cent of their award salaries whereas, under up the Act, they were paid only 50 per cent. Other improvements include the raising of the per hour ofattendance rate for chUdren with special needs 3 years of age from 25c to $ 1 and for those chUdren in over 3 years, from 15c to 60c. On 5 December last year the Minister announced thefirstlist of grants. It seemed, even then, there was what one might call a 'poltiical' the element involved. Only 3 States-Wester n Australia, South Australia and Tasmania-ha d committees at that stage. One is again faced with the fact that apart from Western Australia-whic h indeed is an encouraging sign-the States which take advantage of the Australian Government's initiative are the Labor States. When will this sort of party politics be suspended? There must be a chink in the wall of power grabbing and confrontation at some The Governments in the other States have held back. We need only to look at an the Medibank scheme, education funding and to local governments generally to see this illustrated. The lack of funds for needed projects, the suffering and the inconvenience thus experito enced by some people in need of Federal help is a side issue- a topic of little or no concern to some of the State Governments in their grandiose apocalyptic battle and their versions of good who and evU. The Minister also said that there seemed to be no immediate prospect of a similar committee to those set up in Western Australia, Australia and Tasmania-and at that time must being discussed in Victoria and New South Wales-bein g established in Queensland. What more can I say? Now at last we have reached the. stage of actually debating this Bill in Parliament. When passed it will estabUsh the ChUdren's Commission on afirmbase with continuing programs of assistance that will eventuaUy have a profound influence on the development of Australia. In his second reading speech the Minister reiterated the poUcies of the Australian Government, its emphasis on the particular needs of the people, of working, single or sick parents of Aboriginal, migrant, handicapped and isolated cluldren. It is not that nothing has been done for these groups in the past but that so little has been done that there is a great deal of catching up to be done. Let the Opposition not forget these groups in its bid for headlines about Government handling of larger issues. Let us not leave them behind in the economic leaps in respect of which they have previously been left behind or allow them to be thefirstto suffer or to suffer the worse when the economy slows down. I would like to turn now to some of the issues with which this Bill is concerned. One basic funcconscious tion the Commission wiU perform will be the disare bursing of money. The Interim Committee has already managed to allocate over $53m this year- I am happy to say to all 6 States. My own State of New South Wales has not been severely penaUsed by its tardiness for it will receive $22.41m. My electorate also has not missed out. A new pre-school is to be built in co-operation with Drummoyne Council at a cost of over $130,000. More than that, much has been spent at just two pre-school centres already existing my electorate. I refer to a pre-school at Croydon and the infants home at Ashfield which have received respectively $48,000 and over $111,400 scheme. since Labor came of power. The Government does not, however, wish to most waste resources. The spending of money must be remove done in relation to a number of issues-the tudes that number and sort of resources already avaUable help but observe in the community, the effect upon the chUd and little of those parents, the effect upon the parents and particularly the really, who make every sacrifice mother. Resources should not be seen only as to have their young grow up and money, buildings and equipment. It is continugentlemen ally said that our most basic resource is people-in education, in industry and even in grow poUtics. It should not be forgotten that it is also a introducing a law. basic resource in child care. Such a program as the fanuly day care scheme is an outstanding other recognition of this fact. The Opposition complains about this Govern The ment being centraUst. Let it not throw that increasingly charge at the fanuly day care scheme. It is almost as individualist as one could get. We pay people an allowance for looking after cluldren-some times up to 5 chUdren-in the person's own home. Equipment for the cluldren can be suppUed and social workers regularly check on the situation to see how the chUdren are and whether their needs are being met. The more one thinks about it the more one wonders why someone has not yet levelled the charge at us that we are nationalising child minding. As speakers in this debate have been asked to shorten their speaking time. I shaU conclude my remarks by saying that this Bill should go some way towards recognising the aspirations of the community for its chUdren and its future. I commend the Bill to the House.",76
88,Mr MILLAR,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT,"Having the opportunity to speak briefly on the ChUdren's Commission Bill 1975 I do so conscious that the program of the House requires some abridging of our remarks. I should like to make an observation or two regarding a proposal which must immediately attract the support and sympathy of all fair minded Australians, all those who are in this society of ours today that there groups of people, particularly among children, who are not being afforded the full opportunity to grow to adulthood having fully exploited their native talents. But I am also of course, as no doubt many other Australians are, a Utile mystified as to whether again the Government may overrun itself with an enthusiasm to initiate these programs, an enthusiasm which was evidenced on a previous occasion with its pre-school education program which called for in the expenditure of $ 123m in a year, overlooking entirely, of course, that the facilities did not exist for the immediate implementation of that In this ChUdren's Commission Bill we have a comprehensive program and objectives to entirely, it would appear, all the vicissiassail the young in Australia. I cannot in passing that it reminds me a typifying most parents as every effort ladies and only to find all too often that they not up like themselves. It suggests that we cannecessarily achieve the objective simply by We have again, as in many pieces of legislation, blithely skipped by the fundamental question as to our changing social pattern and our changing social fabric. single income famUy, which has become beset with difficulties, economic and social, has again been put aside as a problem which perhaps can resolve itself. Many of these questions and proposals emanating from the Bill are attached directly to whether we continue to accept the one income family as the norm within Australia. These famUies are being forced into the area of the poverty stricken and we seem indifferent to the circumstances that bring this about. We are increasingly accepting a multiple income famUy as the pacesetter in our community. WhUst we justify this as a measure to offset the impact of inflation, it may well be argued in some cases whether the multiple income family is indeed not contributing to inflation. The honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) here a few nights ago made an observation which I think acted as a tribute to his perception. He said that the expectations of our society possibly are considerably higher than properly may be the case, that this is subjecting our economy and our society to great stresses because we have been aiming too high, aiming beyond our entitlement, seeking more than in actual fact we can pay for, more than we have a moral entitlement to. Here in this Bill we attempt to establish a Utopia which will accommodate all people regardless of their degree of individual responsibility. Unquestionably many of these facilities are urgently required to meet the needs of those people who have no opportunity to implement alternative measures. But it also creates a wonderful opportunity for people to put aside completely their prime responsibUity as parents and, in this case, particularly as mothers. No one would suggest, particularly in this International Women's Year, that we should deny in any shape or form therightof a woman to fulfil herself in whichever venue or through whichever avenue she might so desire. But I think it could be described as axiomatic that one cannot have one's cake and eat it too. We tend here to denigrate the status of motherhood and the status of the fanuly. I do not invite argument as to what the status of the fanuly actually may be in this context. Of course I have an opinion of my own. But this Bill seems to suggest that one can please one's self whether one has neither or whether one has both because the State unquestionably will pick up the tab. If that is what the population wants at the price of $885m over 10 years it is their prerogative to indicate clearly through the elected government that that should be the case. It depends very heavUy on skiUed and expert knowledge in the social welfare area. Some of these activities may become increasingly questionable if we transfer the critical responsibUities of the famUy to the State. It will have the incidental effect of taking up the great surplus which will result from the overtoil in education in which modern society has engaged, and certainly will reUeve a great deal of the worries and responsibiUties of social graduates. The Bill is fairly lucid. It accepts the latch key cluldren as an essential part of modern society. Again it may be argued whether we have to 'accept a situation in which more and more of these chUdren will be left to their own devices without moral guidance. Sub-clause 3 (g) simply caUs for the promoting of the physical or mental development of chUdren. It seems to overlook entirely the question of moral guidance. After all, any scheme, no matter how laudably motivated, that ignores the moral issues can meet with only timited success, if any success at all. Sub-clause 3 (d) reads as follows: (d) the care of physically or mentally disabled or handicapped children at atimeor times of the day when they are not being provided with a prescribed service and are not being cared for in their own homes; I am heartened to find in that sub-clause the suggestion that some of the brain damaged chUdren in my electorate who are receiving assistance, instruction and direction under the scheme for the achievement of human potential which has currently defied the best offices and intentions of the Government, will be reUeved of some of their most pressing problems. In that respect the Bill seems to be all-embracing. There seems to be a great predUection on the part of the Government or of those who drafted this Bill at all times to relate the facUities to the matter of relieving parents who are engaged in employment, as if this is the only group which can properly claim the sympathy and the service of the Government. Again this denigrates the traditional famUy institution. Mr MCVeigh-The mother who stays at home.",78
89,Mr MILLAR,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT,"As the honourable member for DarUng Downs says, the mother who stays at home must now bear the brunt of the financial and social hardships because her deprived chUdren suffer discrimination among their peers in their schools and in their social activities. It is quite clear that, as a complement to this Commission in endeavouring to reUeve the problems of our young, the Government and society as a whole must initiate an investigation and give the most serious thought to whether we have changed our social structure so much that the single income fanuly now becomes an anachronism and whether we must make all those necessary adjustments to establish a new norm by which people may reasonably set their standards.",79
90,Mr DAWKINS,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT," Iriseto primary support this measure enthusiastically. In doing I want to draw particular attention to the lems that have emerged in Western Australia relation to the implementation of the Australian Government's program in the field of early chUdhood services. It will be necessary go into some detaU in regard to the State Government's attitude to this measure, Mr prised Deputy Speaker, and I hope that you will grant me that indulgence. Last week the Western Ausof traUan Government pushed through the State his Parliament an amendment to the Pre-School also Education Act. Whereas the superficial purpose of that amendment was 'to expand and improve the provision of educational services to young chUdren in Western Australia', in order to find the real reason for that amendment one has to back to an extravagant election promise made the then Leader of the Opposition, Sir Charles Court, prior to the 1974 State election. In the Liberal Party's manifesto under the heading 'Primary Schools' there was this passage: In primary schools we willAmongst other thingslower the admission age to the year in five. Upon becoming the Government, that promise put the new State Government in a very difficult position: Was this year to be thefirstyear of pribUity mary school education as it is for 5-year-olds other States, or was it to be a year-perhap s last year-of pre-school education? On the one hand it was not a fulltimecourse and it was compulsory, but on the other hand the centres which were to be buUt to house these classes of year-olds were to be physically associated with primary schools and were to be run by the Edument cation Department. Thefirstsix of these hybrids, which the State Government Government decided to caU pre-primary centres, the were planned andfinancedby a special State Pre-School Government grant in 1974. The Western Ausempowered traUan Government then proceeded capital assistance from the Australian GovernThis aUowed the Boardhad ment, via the body which in September last became the Interim Committee for the ChUprovision of early chUdhood services for for dren's Commission, to expand its program for pre-primary centres. In order to get some idea of under where the State Government saw these centres and recurrent fitting into the educational system, one has only avaUable. to refer to an amendment to the Education Act passed in December last year by the State Government which extended the definition of government school so that it would include any pre-primary centre. From that we can see quite clearly that the State Government saw those precentres as being part of the primary secso tor of education. However, later in December problast year the State Minister for Education in announced that $871,000 had been made available by the Interim Committee for the Children's Commission to provide another 11 of these prefor me to primary centres. The State Minister should not have been surwhen in March of this year he was subject to a certain amount of criticism. He was accused dealing in an underhand manner in relation to pre-school and primary school poticies. It was aUeged by certain people who criticised him that he was reducing the funds avaUable for other pre-school and chUd care services. Why he was suprised by this criticism is difficult to imagine becuase I am sure that to the casual obgo server it would have been clear that the State by Government was trying to honour a clumsy election promise to lower the age of primary school admission, and to do this it was using Australian of Government funds which in every other State were being used for the legitimate purpose of expanding pre-school and cluid care services. Indeed, it was intended that these funds should be provided for that purpose in Western which the child turns Australia as well. To the extent that a large program of construction of pre-primary centres would Umit the possifor the expenditure on other chUd care serin vices, the criticism of the Western Australian the Minister for Educaton was quite vaUd. Indeed, those people who criticised him for underhand not dealings were soon to have their worse fears realised because the amendments to which I 5-referred at the beginning of my speech provided the capacity for the Western Australian Governto continue, or at least to attempt to continue, to gain and obtain funds from the Federal under false pretences. Very simply, amendments provided for a reconstituted Board of Western Australia and child care it to provide both educational and faculties for cluldren who were over 2 to apply for years of age and who not yet turned five. legitimately to obtain year funds from the ChUdren's Commission the chUdren Special 5, which has been the stated aim of the Minister of State. Funds for both capital expenditure would have been But the amendments went on to empower the a Western Australia Minister for Education to direct that any facility so provided, ostensibly for children under 5, could be handed over to the Education Department. The only reason such a facility would be handed over to the Education Department would be to provide a pre-primary centre for children of 5 years of age for the year before they attend primary school proper, that is, in the year in which they turn six. This is a most blatant attempt to fudge the system and to muddy the waters in order that the Western Australian Government can obtain money for one purpose, and then effectively confiscate the faculties provided in order to salvage a confused pre-election promise that it made last year. I should say that the reason this situation has come about is that even though the Australian Government, through the Interim Committee for a ChUdren's Commission did fund the preprimary centres last year the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), on a recent visit to Western Australia, indicated quite clearly that in future the ChUdren's Commission would not fund the pre-primary program of the Western Australian Government. I believe that this is a quite proper action on the part of the Minister for the following reasons: Firstly, in all other States the accommodation of 5-year olds is a matter for the primary education sector and is subject, in relation to Federal assistance, to grants from the Schools Commission. Secondly, if the Australian Government commits itself to funding a preprimary program it will leave itself very Uttle opportunity for expanding chUd care and other services which it intends to provide throughout the country. I am not interested to condemn out of hand the pre-primary program of the Western Australian Government. But I think that the realisation has to be arrived at by the State Government that the program must be funded in the proper way. If the centres are, as the State Government clearly admits, part of the primary school sector, they ought to be funded as part of that sector. The State Government should not try to fudge the issue by trying to gain capital ance from the Interim Committee and then confiscate those facilities for uses other than those for which the initial grants were made. It is true that the people of Western Australia are in great need of all the other sorts of services which it is intended will be provided by the ChUdren's Commission. I refer to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State in which he indicated that some of the other services which would be provided would include full day care, famUy day care, pre-school education of course, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and other chUd care activities in accordance with demand. I think that in saying this we all have to recognise that the needs of the Australian people, including the Western Australian people, are extremely great. The statistics that are uncovered and reported in the report of the Social Welfare Commission for 1972-73 are worth considering. They reveal that 365 000 chUdren under the age of 6 years were the chUdren of working mothers. The report went on to state that 437 000 people who were responsible for the care of chUdren between 4 years of age and 11 years of age made no arrangements for the care of those children after school hours. I do not think that we can ignore the needs which clearly exist for the provision of the sorts of services which this Government certainly wants to provide. So in relation to that I ask the Minister to look very carefuUy at the arrangements that the Western Australian State Government is trying to bring about which would aUow it to swindle Western Australians and provide only for this hybrid pre-primary program instead of sharing in the rest of the opportunities which are avaUable under this excellent program.",80
91,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,REPATRIATION ACTS AMENDMENT,"The ChUdren's Commission Bill 1975 establishes a new commission with a nqw title. No honourable member would object to what ought to be the aims of the ChUdren's Commission as given to us in terms of its title. But in a few words, the work of this Commission will be judged on the balance that it achieves in relation to the care of aU chUdien. After all, 2 points are made in the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). Thefirstone is that this Bill is intended to care for over 160 000 cluldren but that ultimately-this is the second point-accord ing to the principles of the Commission, all children in Australia within a certain age group are to be cared for by the year 1980. It is in relation to those 2 matters that one has to judge the balance that will occur in the care of chUdren as assistdetermined by the ChUdren's Commission. I am concerned that that balance be preserved and that artificial measures of need, artificial measures of poverty or artificial measures of care are not put upon the chUdren who are, after all, stUl the cluldren of their parents. I detect that under this Bill there is to be attempted an unnecessary bureaucratisation of the care of chUdren in Australia. After all, if the $75m which is proposed to be spent under this measure becomes a substitute for money that would otherwise be spent on fanuly assistance avaUable to parents of cluldren in the home, are we to say that that represents a net improvement in respect of the care of chUdren? When people write rules-especiall y when a central government writes rules-wit h respect to children it ought to be remembered that those children are still their parents' children and belong to nobody else. At this stage I will introduce one or two economic facts that ought to be borne in mind. One accepts the expenditure of the $75m set aside under this Bill. But at the same time one must bear in mind that the family assistance available to parents of children to spend in their homes for a family has declined from 1.7 per cent of the gross domestic product to .4 per cent of the gross domestic product. I sense in this Bill a substitution of this $75m, or an attempted substitution, for money that should be spent in other ways. After all, family assistance programs in Australia which have hitherto been carried out have abided by the principle of freedom of choice. They were avaUable to parents to spend money on their chUdren as they sought and as they desired. Therefore, it is in that sense that the whole balance of the program that ultimately will determine its validity, its respect and its support in the Australian community. The progress of a people-naturally , I refer the progress of the Australian people-is very intimately connected with the progress of Australian famUies and the progress of the chUand dren in those famUies. It has been said often enough-it can be said again-that a nation's progress ultimately depends upon are a nation's will, a nation's applied resources and a nation's people. This Commission proposes to deal with this nation's people. I would be less than frank if I were not to say that concerned at some of the definitions of services for cluldren which are involved in this Bill, and I were to deny that I was concerned at the way in which community services for chUdren are to be determined. It is the balance of the program that ultimately will determine its legitimacy. The Bill itself has developed from 3 reports. could be said that it has developed from 3 comhis mission reports, the Interim Committee, and so on. We are aware of the battles that have State, occurred. In a sense, the Bill has been worried out from those reports. But so far I have not heard the Government say, as a government live in needs to say, what its phUosophy is concerning want Australian famUies and what is its phUosophy denies God. concerning the role of mothers in the Australian famUies. The whole matter cannot be considered without considering the role of mothers, no ter to what extent the Federal Government Adthankful visory Committee on the International Women's Vear would seek to ignore that proposition. But of course, it has its own problems. But whether mothers work or look after cluldren in their homes, it is the mothers who are satisfied with their roles, whether they work or not, who have the best adjusted chUdren. Debate interrupted.

93,Mr DRURY,ADJOURNMENT,"As a member of the Federal ParUamentary Christian FeUowship I should like to pay my tribute to a very great Christian martyr who died in Vienna on 7 May at the age of 83 years. I refer, of course, to the late Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, whose address in it is this buUding a few months ago to members of the Christian FeUowship will be fresh in the minds of all who heard him. A priest of the most profound conviction and of extraordinary moral and physical courage, he was gaoled for a total to of 23 years and was tortured most cruelly and barbarously in turn first by German Nazis and later by Russian Communists. He was a doughty uncompromisingfighterfor the faith that he held and for what he beUeved to be right, and he will undoubtedly rank in history with the great 3 things. They martyrs of aU time. His 'crime', so-called, was that he resisted Nazis and Communist oppression and tyranny I am and was prepared to pay if necessary for that resistance with his life. He was not only a man of if tremendous moral and spiritual strength but also a man of outstanding ability. This is reflected in the fact that he rose from parish priest to bishop and then to Primate of Hungary all in the space of a few years. He was, from all accounts, much loved and revered by all who knew him as priest, It bishop and primate in his native land. Despite long, drawn out suffering and agony, following trumped up charges of conspiracy against the this great Christian was able to say when he was finally forced to leave his own country: I do not hate anyone. I have no enemies and want only to peace with the world. I do not hate the Russians. We only to get rid of communism because it is wrong and",82
94,Mr FRY,ADJOURNMENT," I think that every member of this House and indeed every Ausmattralian and American citizen would now be that the Vietnam War, after 30 years of death and destruction, has finally ended. But there is Uttle point in being thankful if we fail to learn the important lessons from the unfolding of that tragic historical process which took place Vietnam and which is still unfolding in other areas of South East Asia. So it is rather sad not surprising to find that the Opposition more intent on making poltiical capital out of outcome in Vietnam, including the pUght of refugees and in quibbling at the margin about the interpretation of certain relatively unimport8 ant documents, than in making an inteUigent objective assessment of the lessons to be learned. When the Pentagon papers were published the 'New York Times' in 1971 many Australians became rightly suspicious of the basis of our involvement in the Vietnam war. Many wondered how and why we were pressured into such an active participation in that war by the United States of America. Now, following 3 action revealing articles in the 'National Times' by Mr Evan Whitton, we know much more about the real truth of our involvement. Mr Whitton has come up with at least 4 major points which are extremely damaging and embarrassing to Opposition. These 4 points remove the last tige of credibUity of the Opposition's Vietnam poUcy whilst it was in government. The first point is that the Australian Parlianam ment and the Australian pubUc were grossly deceived by Sir Robert Menzies in that elements of Australian fighting forces were actively engaged in the Vietnam war as early as 1962, 3 years before the 1st BattaUon was officially comThe mitted in 1965. Secondly, Australia herself put pressure on the United States of America to come more heavUy involved in the Vietnam war, and not vice versa as we were led to believe. Thirdly, Australian and United States diplomats discussed where a battaUon of Australian troops would fight before even asking the South Viethonourable namese Government if it wanted more help. refuse Lastly, to satisfy legalities, the United States cocted a scheme to get South Vietnam to invite Australia openly to enter the war, even though South Vietnam was most reluctant to have more foreign soldiers on its soU. Whitton's analysis shows how deceitful the Menzies Government was and how taUy inept was the advice given to the Government of the day. Indeed the Government was only told what it wanted to be told. It had a icy and it asked for information to sustain that poUcy. Even the New Zealanders who apparquite ently had no better inteUigence than Australians made a much better evaluation of the real situwhich ation and expressed grave doubts about the American policy in Vietnam. Appalling as this may be, it is even more appalling that the OppoChina sition stiU thinks in the Menzies' era terms. That in the Opposition has not learnt anything at all about Vietnam the last 10'years is well Ulustrated but in the speeches made in this House last month. is still The speech of the honourable member for the Bradfield (Mr Connolly) particularly Ulustrated the paranoia and crooked thinking of the Opposition's stand. He said, as reported in Hansard on April, that 'there is no reason to say that the and reasons forfightingthat war were wrong'. He echoed all the other sanctimonious reasons for intemning in Vietnam, namely, 'to give its in people the prospect of a better future'. We now know the awful truth. We now know of us how hollow those reasons were. According to the authoritative, well documented articles in the 'National Times', our was for our own selfish ends and to satisfy Sir Robert Menzies' paranoid fears of red, or yellow, hordes invading us from the north, because Sir Robert's simplistic solution for the whole problem was to interpose the American mUitary the machine between Australia and Communist vesChina. The honourable member for Bradfield and other Opposition members apparently have still not grasped the main point about the Vietbase struggle; that is, that it was a civU war. Any schoolboy could tell the honourable member and indeed aU Opposition members that, when 2 parts of a country or 2 fractions within a country arefightingone another, that is civil war. fact that one side is pro-communist and that the other side is anti-communist has nothing to bedo with the definition. The Americans have called it a civU war-and they should know-bu t most members opposite, especiaUy the honourable member for Bradfield, the honourable  member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan), to see this; they are still thinking in the consimplistic and unreal terms of the Menzies' era. Even this week, Mr Clark Clifford, who was a Secretary for Defence for President Johnson, said in 'Time' magazine of 12 May: 'The fall of Saigon means a civU war has ended'. He also admitted, if the Opposition is interested that: 'It is the best result so far as the people of South monumenVietnam are concerned'. I believe that the Opposition has become so polstrongly entwined in the web of its own mythology over such a long period that it now appears incapable of facing reality and making an inteUigent and objective analysis of the events have taken place in South-East Asia north of Australia. What has happened in Vietnam in the past 2 months is sirnUar to what happened in during the civU war in 1948-49. Beleaguered cities feU, armies fled and surrendered, and a corrupt rump of a government fled the land with all t te gold if could get its hands on. South Vietnam ell simply because the government the South was as corrupt as that of Nationalist China and its armies and people had lost the will Fraser) tofight.Th J whole rotten structure came down in the same way as it did in China, because South and Vietnam lacked leaders and a government which this understood the needs of the people. No doubt of mindful of America's great failure in China, should Hubert Humphrey, President Johnson's VicefaU intobethe President, said last week concerning the in Vietnam: 'No outside force can save that lacks will or political leadership.' That statement appeared in the 'Time' magazine of 12 May 1975. History has shown that there have always been wars, and a large number of these wars have been civil wars. One important point needs to be remembered about civil wars. They are internal affairs-famil y affairs, if you like-an because of this they are fought with a ferocity and intensity far surpassing those of convenence. tional wars between nation states. So it is not surprising that the wounds of such wars take longtimeto heal. This was the case in the United States itself in the last century, and in Russia, China, Spain and many other countries this cenneighbours. tury. It will also be the case in Vietnam. face the reality. Civil wars are family affairs; are no concern of outsiders. If one intervenes family quarrel one usually incurs the enmity of both sides either for what one has done or for what one has failed to do for one or the other party to the quarrel. History shows that outsiders do intervene from time totimein civil wars to suit their own selfish ends. This was the case with the allied intervenrun tion in the Russian civil war in 1919. It was as we know, the case in the Indo-China war. Honourable members may ask what happened selves as a result of foreign intervention in these 2 lar cases. The foreign intervening powers were forced to withdraw after atimebecause of warweariness and pressure of public opinion at hasAlthough home. This happened in the case Russian and the Vietnam civil wars. All Australians should be concerned with what happens now in war torn and devastated Vietable nam, but let us not with ideological bigotry to hasty conclusions and assume and assert withIndonesia, out any evidence that millions will be murdered. We as a government are deeply concerned with the Vietnamese people. We will seize every opnow portunity to help those who have remained in Vietnam, and we will do our share to help those who havefled.There is deep concern and there now plenty of opportunity to help the Vietnamese people in a positive way-no t in a negaof tive way by becoming involved in their war. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm in a recent speech claimed opportunity concern as the hallmarks of Liberalism. If applies to Australians, then surely it must apply to the Vietnamese people too. The Leader the Opposition and the so-caUed Liberals honest and consistent if they are not to outcome the Leader ofusetheof Opposition the double standard of which and his colleagues a country accuse the Government so often. History has shown that we have come to live on friendly terms and have profitable commercial relations with communist states, namely, Russia and China. Why can we not do this with the new communist states of Asia? We, like the Americans, were involved in a great mistake in d Vietnam. However, let us face reality and draw the right conclusions from our Vietnam experiThe right conclusion is not, as the war lords of the Opposition would have us believe, that we a should prepare for another Vietnam style war in South-East Asia. Let us bury our xenophobic and simplistic notions and respect our northern Let us Mr WENTWORTH.(MackeUar) (10.43)- I they have no doubt that the honourable member for in a Fraser (Mr Fry) believes what, he has said and has spoken sincerely, but nevertheless chink his T views are ill-conceived and in as .ise dangerous to Australia. He said that we hav-; been defeated in Vietnam. So we have. But when ""t u are defeated the most dangerous thing yen .n do is to run away. Whether we like it ^ot, ve cannot away from the consequence.; c Tth?t defeat. It also, is better for us to face up to M?m now. The honourable member said that we r v lived ourin Vietnam for our own sel *-h interests. It simiis not a crime for an Australian £ r. eminent to think selfishly of the interests of Au - i - alia. we have been defeat-:o or our side of both the intervention has in been defeated Vietnam, it r...y be that the been to the ;d vantage of Australia, and perhaps only to the advantage of Australia. Let me put something to the honourmember and let him think about it very jump carefully. At the time of that intervention the country which is to our north, was trembling between the communist and the anticommunist causes. The anti-communist cause is firmly established in Indonesia. I venture to think that if there had been no intervention in Vietnam the opposite would have been the case is and Australia would be now confronting not far across the water-indee d insofar as New Guinea is concerned a country almost with a contiguous land border- a communist threat from a country of 150 million people. This is something which is of vital interest to the security of Australia. Is the honourable member for Fraser now to say that the Australian Government is acting unwisely when it looks at the security of the Australian people? Let him draw from the present defeat at least this lesson: We have to look to Australia's defences now in a new Ught. We have to be more self-reUant. Unless we can do this the very survival of the Australian people is at risk. He likes to talk in scornful tones of the possibUities of communists from the north coming down to Australia. It would be fooUsh to use such scornful tones because the thrust is there. The things that we said might happen are happening. The communist threat is now very much nearer to us than it was. When he watches on television what has been happening on the streets of Saigon or some other town in South Vietnam he might think perhaps that those scenes could be enacted in Pitt Street or CoUins Street, or in the main street of any of the Australian capitals. Britain is no longer in the position to intervene with conventional forces to defend the security of Australia. Even if she had the will she no longer has the power. The United States of America still has the power, but what about the voices that are being raised from the Government encouraging isolationism in the United States? That is what honourable members opposite are doing. The propositions that are corning from the Government are treason to Australian because they are inciting our American friends to abandon us if we face the kind of situation which Vietnam has faced and against which we have no protection in our own power of defence at the moment. Our defence forces are a joke- a very bad joke, a joke which none of us likes to contemplate. There is virtuaUy no power in them now. What are we to say of a government which incites the Americans to retreat into isolationism and withdraw the shield? What are we to think of a government which denigrates past policy which, whatever else it may have done, has at least ensured that for the present Indonesia is and-communist and not pro-communist. If the present Government had had its way in the past, I feel certain that we would now have a communist Indonesia on our borders. That creates speculation which it is very uncomfortable to contemplate. The present Government has a long history betraying Australia to the communists. I remember very clearly when it was considered this House to be a matter of grave offence to to any member of the Australian Labor Party that he was an aUy of the communists. I have been removed from this chamber because I refused to withdraw the statement that there was communist infiltration into the Labor Party. I do not believe that Government supporters would consider this offensive now, because it stands complete and proved that there is communist infiltration into the Labor Party and it is shown by the Labor Party's poUcy. Without telling the electorate it has taken us into the communist orbit. If the Government has its way we are going to find ourselves victims of the communists because we have faUed to stand up to them and have alienated the only people who couid protect us from them. I believe that whatever be the responsibUities of an Australian Government, its first responsibUity is the security of the Australian people. This Government has been betrayed that security by permitting the defence forces to be eroded and by the insults it has given to our aUies 6n the very point of intervention to protect an innocent country from communist aggression because it was communist aggression. CivU war, caU it what you like, but there was an estabUshed country of South Vietnam and there was communist aggression against it. Members of the Government, led by the present Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS) sponsored the Ue that there was no communist aggression. The Government sponsored the lie and persuaded the Australian people that the North Vietnamese were the victims, not the aggressors. Now the opposite has been dreadfully proved. It has been proved that the North Vietnamese are the aggressors-the successful aggressors, yes; we have been defeated. It was they who put the troops into South Vietnam when there were no troops in North Vietnam from the South.",82
95,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,85
96,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Every time. I hear the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) speaking on this theme I think of the late Senator Joseph MCCarthy of the United States of America. As honourable members know, MCCarthyism swept the United States and ruined the lives of hundreds of thousands of pubUc servants dedicated to their task in the United States. Senator MCCarthy died hated, despised, friendless and an alcoholic. I know that, despite of the shortcomings of the honourable member for Mackellar, that would not happen to him. But in the speech that he has just made is so Ul-timed say because we read in the media today that the world is becoming more friendly, that United States' warships are at present in Leningrad bour and, similarly, units of the Soviet navy are visiting American ports. We also learn from the media that, in the very near future, there is to be a joint space mission the United States and the Soviet cosmonauts is linking up in space. These sorts of things are the things that people of my own political beliefs love and promote-the world becoming one famto ily. It so ill becomes the honourable member Mackellar to come out with this old communist bogy that has plagued the world for so long, bringing hatreds between one section of the munity and another, causing countries to spend billions of dollars on arms when half the world's population is going to bed of a night hungry. think it ill becomes the honourable member Mackellar to get on to a theme of that sort at this years. time in the twentieth century when I can see the people of the world, despite the differences in poltiical ideology, becoming one famUy. I have endeavoured during my 15 years in this ParUaharment to promote such a cause. I hope that the honourable member will heed what I say because when he leaves the communist bogy alone he makes great contributions to by the debates in this Parliament. We know that he getting old and grey but he stiU tries to be the greatest flame thrower that the Liberal Party has on the Opposition benches. He is trying to live up this reputation. I think he should concentrate for during the remainder of his poltiical career, which we know will not be very long, on following a theme to try to bring about a greater undercomstanding between the nations of the world because in so doing he would go out of politics much more respected than he would be by trying I to kick the communist bucket around this Parliafor ment as he has been trying to do for so many Question resolved in the affirmative.

Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) Did he say on 23 January 1974 that he was convinced that the introduction of wage indexation would cause unions to confine their demands to increases based on increased productivity and technological change. (2) If so, has he received an assurance from any union to this effect. (3) Is so, from which unions. (4) If not, what is the basis of his statement. (5) Did he also say on 23 January 1974 that there would be no need for an annual National Wage Case if wage indexation was introduced.",89
99,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) On 23 January I made a statement which read in part: 'As a result of broad ranging talks which I have held with trade union leaders, I am now convinced that if wage indexation is re-introduced unions will make no future wage demands based on rising prices but will confine their demands to increases based on increased productivity, technological change and related matters.' As the honourable member will be aware, in 1974 and again in 1975 the Australian Government made submissions to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission supporting the re-introduction of quarterly cost of living adjustments. In the light of the 1974 decision and developments in the industrial relations and economic situation since that time,in the 1975 National Wage Case the Australian Government submitted that the Commission adopt a system of wage indexation based on the following four principles. (1) Indexation adjustments would take place quarterly and automatically upon the pubUcation of the consumer price index figure. (2) Where at the date of adjustment, the award rate of an employee was not more than thefigurefor the seasonaUy adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit most recently published by the Australian Government Statistician(a) the award rate would automatically be increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index; Higher P/G Doct.

(4) There would be no wage increases on account of price increases except as provided above. Wage increases would otherwise be Umited to those on account of changes in national productivity, work value or other special circumstances, but not including changes in relativities. This system of wage indexation would continue for 2 years and then be subject to review. It is clear from the reading of the four principles I have just outlined that the Government is not supporting wage indexation unconditionally. The Government s support for indexation is dependent, in part, on the receipt of acceptable undertakings from the union side, as embodied in undertakings by the ACTU, to comply with the principles of wage fixation laid down by the Australian Government. However, if the ACTU was not prepared to accept the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above the Government would support a decision of the Commission to approve wage indexation in principle, but to introduce it on an award-by-award basis upon the receipt of suitable undertakings from individual unions. During the course of the proceedings the ACTU responded to the Australian Government submission and gave certain assurances. The Australian Government commented on the ACTU response and gave what it regarded as a proper interpretation of those assurances. The ACTU subsequently responded to that interpretation. I would imagine that the substance of this dialogue is being considered by the Australian ConciUation and Arbitration Commission in reaching a decision on the claim for the introduction indexation. (S) In my statement of 23 January indexation were introduced, future National Wage Cases should disregard price movements longer be a need for a National consider the effect of price movements as is now the case. The Government's submissions in the recent National Wage Case hearing included a proposal for an annual Productivity Conference or ductivity improvement on an equitable basis.

A further comparatively small cost would also apply to non-contributory units included in pension entitlements which fell due on or after 4 June 1969. However, quite extensive research, computer work and further actuarial calculations would be necessary to isolate these details, which are not specifically required during the normal management of the scheme. and (c) Estimates cannot be made separately for the Beef cost of conversion from age 65 retirement to age 60 retirement for contributors whose(i) non-contributory units, and (ii) contributory units would not become available until age 65. of the stock pile of beef of In the aggregate, as at 30 June 1972 the additional capital value of the benefits to befinancedby the Government following such a change, including updating on the basis presently used, has been estimated as $784m if all contributors were to retire on attaining age 60. No estimate can be made of the cost to contributors for converting the employee proportion of age 65 units to age 60 units. Any such change would be reflected in additional contributions or in a reduction in the employee-financed proportion of pension benefits. (2) (a) (b) (d) The estimates of cost of the proposed superannuation scheme for Australian ployees that follow are the estimated capital values as at 30 June 1972 of the future cost to the Government in respect of pensioners and contributors in the present scheme at that date. June 1972 was the occasion present Superannuation Fund and detailed statistical information was compiled for that purpose. The estimated capital values show the present value of the liabilities to be met by the Government under the present scheme with adjustments for changes to be incorporated in the new scheme. The liabilities relate to the period covered by the lifetime of contributors and pensioners as at 30 June 1972 and their dependants, a period that could extend for perhaps 80 years or more. The main assumptions on which the estimates have been based are those that were adopted in the Report by the actuaries Mr G. L. Melville and Professor A. H.

Spasmodic mining of marinefibresin Spencer Gulf and St Vincent's Gulf has occurred for decades and I am aware at recent nining proposals. I understand that the sole company concerned at present, Lithominerals Pty Ltd, has been granted exploration rights to prove the deposits subject to a number of conditions imposed by the Government of South Australia. (2) Preliminary studies of the effect of mining on the environment have been carried out during the exploration phase. Some of these studies were undertaken by the Australian Department of Fisheries and reports on these studies were tabled at the recent Redcliff environmental inquiry. These studies are being overviewed by the South Australian Department of Environment and Conservation. (3) Preliminary product evaluations indicate the cellulose produced would probably be suitable for kraft paper manufacture. Further evaluations are to be carried out. At present it seems that any industry established resolution of the technical and environmental problems associated with the mining would be of smaU to medium scale. It is unlikely to be a significant alternative source of cellulose for Australian industry and export.

These include the eligible assets in calculating the solvency margins under the Insurance Acts 1973 and the supervision which the Insurance Commissioners exercise in ensuring that insurance companies are likely to continue to be able to meet their liabilities and obligations. The general insurance legislation also contains specific relating to the direct control in certain circumof asset holdings of general insurance companies.

In regard to this United Kingdom Act is important to read the provisions referred to in the honourable member's question and relating to the control of investments in the context of sections 28 and 38 of that Act. provisions set out the grounds on which these investment control powers can be exercised and steps that are required before action is taken. The grounds on which the powers are exercisable relate principally to the protection of policy holders of a company. Notwithstanding the above I envisage that one of the future matters which therecentlyestablished Insurance Consultative Committees might consider is the question of whether additional controls over the investment policies of insurance companies are desirable in the community interest. Withregardto the inclusion of provisions in Australian insurance legislation for the oversight of the suitability of rectors and other executive my predecessor indicated in a speech he made on 6 February 1974 that the Government has decided to legislate to prevent new insurance companies being established merely because they met certain minimum financial requirements. He indicated that such legislation will allow proposals to be considered in the broader context of the public interest, with particular reference to the qualifications that the Government will consider shortly the particular provisions to give effect to this policy.

Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: and (2) I cannot give the assurances sought by the honourable member because with the Prime Minister's announcement on 27 March 1975 of the creation of the Department of Police and Customs, the honourable member 's question ceased to be appUcable. regulated by the State authoriThe poUce forces of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are now part of the Australia Police and have responsibiUty for aU police funcdons in their respective regions. Each territorial force is operationally separate and headed by a Commissioner who reports to the interim Chief Commissioner of the Australia Police. The deUberations of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory, and the proposals for the creation of territory executives were borne in mind when the decision was made to form the Australia PoUce. It was felt that proper consideration of both these matters should not delay the establishment of what is essentiaUy a federal law enforcement body of national significance.

(3) With reference to point IS and the vocational assessment in sheltered workshops, which sheltered workshops have been used for rehabilitation purposes, and how many have been given assistance in this way.",103
122,Mr HAYDEN,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (D(a) As no records are kept showing details of Government contracts awarded to sheltered workshops, to determine the percentage sheltered workshops. (b) Due to the priority that had to be given to the developAustraUan ment and implementation of the Handicapped Persons Aswhat sistance Act and related measures affecting handicapped people, no special procedure has been developed as yet for Government contracts to be awarded to sheltered workshops.

Australian Aviation Technicians Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Defence, upon notice: Were any Australian aviation technicians, civil or military, recalled from Indonesia during the week ended 1 March 1975.",104
123,Mr BARNARD,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: One aviation technician, a RAAF Warrant Officer Engineer, left Indonesia on completion of his posting to the RAAF Sabre Advisory Unit during the period in question. The progressive withdrawal of this unit was the subject of a press release which I issued on 17 February 197S. Australian Army: Rottnest Island (Question No. 2352) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Defence, it is not possible upon notice: of suitable contracts awarded to Further to the answer to question No. 236 concerning the Government's examination of land under the control of the Army on Rottnest Island in Western Australia, is the position regarding the possibility of releasing this the welfare of land for general community use.",104
124,Mr BARNARD,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: In my reply to question No. 236 I pointed out that although the total area of Rottnest Island was some 1800 hectares, the Army controlled area was only some 50 hectares. I went on to say that the Army occupied land conto be required for Defence purposes but that the Minister had asked the Premier of Western Australia for detaUs of how his Government intended to use the areas on Rottnest Island, including the area occupied by the Army, ensurand had proposed an in-depth study which would have regard to all interests involved, the object being to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to the question of general comexisting buildings munity and Army use. considered for modifications to I understand that the Premier of Western Australia has not yetrespondedto the Prime Minister's proposal.

(3) How long is the sailing time required to cover the AshReef and any other designated area from the closest patrol boat base, and where is that base.",104
125,Mr BARNARD,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the honourable Government. member's question is as follows: for (1) There are three patrol boats based at Cairns, four to patrol boats based at Darwin and one patrol boat based at Fremantle currently assigned to the surveUlance of the and Western coasts of Australia. The Fremantle boat is reserved manned and consequently only performs surveUlance duties periodically. (2) The maximum saUing time required toreachany part (Question No. 2242) of this coast is four days, but in practice this is usually reduced to two days or less because patrol boats operate in Minister for areas of known activity. (3) The sailing time to cover Ashmore Reef is one and a half days transit from base (Darwin). Two further days would be required to cover the other off-lyingreefsas far south-west as Rowley Shoals. Additionally, the off-lying reefs from Ashmore Reef to Rowley Shoals are covered byair patrols. Australian Capital Territory Police Force Mr Hunt asked the Minister for PoUce and Customs, upon notice: (1) Does the establishment of the new Department of Police and Customs imply that those recommendations of the Joint Committee on the A.C.T. in its Report on self government and public finance in the A.C.T. which relate the Territory PoUce Force have been rejected. (2) Does the establishment of the new Department mean that any recommendations the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory may make concerning the PoUce Force in that Territory have been prejudged and that the recommendations of the Committee in itsreportin 1974 have been ignored. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory that A.C.T Police Force be transferred at by the Assembly was borne in mind when consideration was given to creation of the Department of Police and Customs. ResponsibUity for the A.CT. PoUce was one of several recommendations dealing with transfers of control made by the Committee in its 1974 Report on Self Government and PubUc Finance in the A.C.T. This Report is still under consideration by the Government. (2) The establishment of the Department of PoUce Customs does not prejudge any future recommendations that may be made by the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. Any such recommendations will when they are received by the Government. The recommendations made by the Committee Report on Constitutional Development in the Northern Territory which are now under review because of cyclone were given due consideration partment of PoUce and Customs was announced. I would point out, moreover, that the partment, one of the major objectives announced by Mr Whitlam in his policy speech of November 1972, was taken only after a careful and prolonged assessment of aU the issues involved. Mr Chipp asked the Minister for Social SecurResearch ity, upon notice: What is the number of (a) pubUc ward beds and vate ward beds in each State in respect of which hospital benefits are payable.",104

Visualtek Read Write System Units (Question No. 2425) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for PoUce and Customs, upon notice: (1) How many Visualtek Read Write System units have been imported. (2) How many of these were exempted from the 34 per and cent import duty and 15 per cent sales tax. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable be considered member's question is as foUows: (1) My inquiries indicate that 10 of these units have been in its 1974 imported during the past two years. (2) 1 understand aU the units were entered free of import Tracy, duty and 3 were exempted from sales tax. before the creation of the DeImported Toys decision to establish the De(Question No. 2426) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for PoUce and Customs, upon notice: (1) Prior to the recent pubUcity over the excessive lead Hospital Benefits content in paint on imported toys, were officers of his Department instructed to check the paint content of these (Question No. 2405) toys to ensure that the National Health and Medical Council recommendation was not exceeded. (2) If not, had any requests beenreceivedfrom other Australian or State Government Depanments or private (b) priorganisations or companies that this be done. (3) If not, have anyrequestsnow been received from any of those mentioned in pan (2) for this to be done. (4) Have any instructions now been issued to this effect by him. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (l)No. (2) In 1972 a company submitted to the Department advance samples of toys which it intended to import. The Department was asked to determine the lead content of the paint used on the toys. The resultant analysis showed a level of lead in excess of that recommended in the then draft National Health and Medical Research Council standard relating to paints and it is believed the importer did not proceed with the importation. There has been no similar request since that time. (3) See (2) above. (4) I am concerned that such potentially dangerous toys could be imported into this country. However, the Department has been examining this problem for some time and in fact was represented on the Standards Association of Australia drafting committee for Australian Standard 1647-1974 Children's Toys and Playthings (Safety Requirements). Among other recommendations this standard limits the level of poisonous metal in paint used on toys. The Attorney-General's Department is currently considering a proposal to prescribe that Standard as a consumer product safety standard under Secdon 62 of the Trade Practices Act. A complementary regulation is also being considered by the Department of PoUce and Customs for inclusion in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Local Government: Funds Mr Morris asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Under what programs have funds been approved for local Government by the Australian Government in 1974-75. (2) What is the total approval in respect of each program in each State in 1974-75.",105
127,Dr JF CAIRNS,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the honourexists able member's question is as follows: (1)&(2) Chapter V of the 1974-75 Budget Paper No. 7, entitled ""Payments to or for the States and Local Governof ment Authorities 1974-75"", outlines the which funds are made avaUable to local government by the Australian Government and provides estimates wherever possible of expenditure in 1974-75. Questions regarding expenditure approved to date in relation to any particular programs should be directed to the responsible Minister in each case. Mr Bourchier asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) With reference to his statement on 16 April 1975 that he is awaiting States to provide extra beds for pubUc wards, is it a fact that in his early announcements on Medibank he stated there would be adequate beds in public wards and that he could not see any need to seek extra accommodation. (2) WUl private hospitals be forced to hand over bed space for pubkc ward use; if posite to his early assertions. (3) What is the bed shortage number for pubUc wards. (4) Why is it necessary to obtain extra public ward beds. (5) Does he expect a greater demand under Medibank than prior to the scheme.",106
128,Mr HAYDEN,COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) On 16 April 1975,1 did state, with reference to negotiations of a proposed hospital agreement with New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, that rather complex negotiations would be involved in arranging additional pubUc ward beds in Victoria which would be different in nature from the negotiations which will be taking place in respect of Western Australia. In Victoria, State legislation provides for the specific identification of public ward beds and in that State I visuaUsed some difficulties in negotiation in that the public hospitals would need to change the proportions between pubUc and private beds that they at present have. I do not recall stating that there would be ""adequate beds in public wards"". It is apparent that if there is an increased community demand for free treatment in standard wards as a result of Medibank, then additional beds in pubUc hospitals from their overall bed capacities will have to be aUocated for the treatment of such patients. It is not expected that there will be an overaU increase in demand for hospitalisation because of Medibank, although, as indicated, it is expected that the ratios of hospital patients and private patients will change. If there were an increase in demand for hospitalisation, it would indicate that many in our community are not being properly treated at the moment, probably because they are not adequately insured and cannot afford to go to hospital. This would be a severe condemnation of the present system if it were a fact. I am sure that the Honourable Member has observed that a patient cannot enter a hospital bed as the whim takes him but can only do so (Question No. 2434) on the basis of a qualified medical practitioner's opinion. The Government cannot exercise any form of coercion over private hospitals to 'hand over bed space for public ward use'. At the same time, our legislation does provide for non-private hospitals operated by religious and charitable organizations to apply for approval to have some of their bedsfinanceddirectly by the Government so that thay can provide free treatment for hospital patients. This provision for the hospitals to take up if they so wish. It merely recognises that many hospitals operated by religious and charitable organizations wish to accommodate some patients without charge, in accordance with their basic philosophies caring for the less fortunate in the community without programs under regard tofinancialstatus.
