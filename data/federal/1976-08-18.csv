The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned about the future of the Australian Assistance Plan. We your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government support the Australian Assistance Plan: We believe the Australian Assistance Plan should continue because we believe the Australian Assistance Plan helps to make people self reliant and more aware of what they can do to help themselves. In this it is anti-bureaucratic and contrary to the idea of the welfare state which encourages dependence on Government. We believe die Australian Assistance Plan should continue in such a way as to give all citizens the opportunity to participate through a Regional Council for Social Development in their region. We believe the idea encompassed in the Australian Assistance Plan is an effective way for citizens to work cooperatively with all levels of Government.

On that day two men professing to be Channel 7 newsmen attempted to solicit support in discrediting the Aboriginal tent embassy at King George Square. The men asked a particular group of students if they would like to go on television.

They were then to protest against the 'favouritism' shown to Aboriginal parents by the Government Education Allowance.

That the removal of such grants will cause unnecessary hardship to those citizens of Australia resident there. 3. That the removal of such grants will cause unnecessary unemployment in the area. 4. That the decision to remove such grants is a ruthless political one taken without due consideration for the lives and welfare of those citizens dependent upon the care provided at such centres.

That stabUity is at present in jeopardy, as a new ship order is required within the next few weeks if serious unemployment and hardship is to be avoided. That the previous Government's plan for the buUding of a graving dock in Newcastle should be continued as proper ship repair facUities are a vital factor in the maintenance of a viable shipbuUding industry.

Petition received. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I direct a question to the Treasurer. The question is to clarify 2 ments about employment in the statements attached to his Budget Speech. The first is in Statement No. 2 at page 25 in which he states that the labour force is projected to grow by 2 cent at most over the course of 1976-77. The other is in Statement No. 4 at page 117 in which he says that there is an estimated increase in 1976-77 of lVi per cent in the average level employment. I ask: What is the estimated perthe centage or number of persons who will be unemas ployed at the end of June next?",19

However, perfectly clear that a Minister must be free to answer a question in the way he thinks fit. intend to ask Ministers to make their repUes to questions relevant. I cannot ehminate the political to and fro-ing and I do not think that the Parliament would expect me to do so. I call the Treasurer.",28
10,Mr LYNCH,EMPLOYMENT,"In response to what the honourable gendeman has asked, I direct his attention to page 25 of Statement No. 2 which, in fact, is the real point of the question. Incidentally, this question was asked of me last night on television by Mr Hawke who made the same fundamental error in assumption which the honourable gentleman now makes in this House. But, of statecourse, economics has never been his forte. Mr Innes-He did not say that last night.",28
11,Mr LYNCH,EMPLOYMENT,"That is exactly what I said last night. The honourable gentleman might well per have listened to the interview. Budget Statement No. 2 indicates- I have it before me and I am quite happy to read it to the honourable gentleman, to send it to him with a compliments slip or of to sign the document, whichever he likes-that average level of employment during 1976-77 a whole is expected to be 1.2 per cent greater than the average level of employment for should have thought that the honourable gentleman, in relation to understanding the assumptions on whichMrE.

14,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT,I am afraid that without the document in front of me the point made by the Leader of the Opposition is lost on me. I call upon the Treasurer to answer the question.,28
15,Mr LYNCH,EMPLOYMENT,"Without wanting to be tedious, the point is not lost on me in response to what the honourable gentleman questions because what I saying- I repeat it and I hope the honourable gentleman will listen to it with the advice of questhe former Treasurer, who is now the shadow Minister for Defence-wa s that the average level of employment during 1976-77 as a whole is expected to be one per cent to 2 per cent greater than the average level of employment for it is 1975-76. But the number of people employed will be more than 2 per cent greater in June 1977 I than in June 1976. During the same period, that is to say, between June 1976 and June next year, it is projected that the labour Force will grow by about 2 per cent. In brief, if I may put it on the record of this House, the particulars on page 25 of Treasury Statement No. 2 bear out the fact that employment will grow by more than 2 per cent over the financial year whereas the labour force will not grow by more than 2 per cent over the same period. This therefore means, as I made perfectly clear in what I was saying in the House last night, that there will be a gradual reduction in unemployment, although Uttle of this reduction wiU be experienced during the course of this calendar year. As I mentioned in my speech last night, what we are looking for will be an upturn and a pick-up in the early part of next year. NA",28
16,Mr FIFE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, concerns the plight of unemployed women and men who are suffering hardship as a result of 3 years of economic mismanagement by the former Labor Government. I ask: Will the Minister inform the House whether he has brought to the attention of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other trade union officials the fact that there is a nexus between wage costs and job opportunities? If so, did he receive a favourable response? If not, will the Minister continue to press this matter in the interests of the unemployed who are seeking jobs and who have been badly let down by the Labor movement?",29
17,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Before going to the main body of the honourable member's question I think it is worth reviewing the employment situation both when the Labor Government came to power and when it went out of office. When it came to power in December 1972 the number of unemployed in Australia in actual terms was about 136 000. When it was tossed out of office last December the number of unemployed was about 328 000. So let there be no mistake about what caused Australia's high unemployment and what is the basic cause of the unemployment rate that we have now. As the honourable member has correctly identified, it was 3 years of disastrous economic mismanagement by the Labor Government. Coming now to the main part of the honourable member's question, yes, I have stressed to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and indeed to other union leaders-othe r Ministers have joined me in those expressions of concern-the nexus between wage costs and job opportunities. At the talks that we held in June it was recognised by the union movement that there was a nexus between excessive wage rises, inflation and unemployment. Unfortunately, that recognition has not been carried forward into the practical policies which are pursued by the leaders of the Labor movement. As a result of their poUcies we now have 3 categories of workers in Australia. First, we have those in safe employment. In the second category we have those in vulnerable employment, and I put in this category those in import competing industries who have their jobs threatened by the excessively high rate of wages in Australia at present, and those in expon competing industries which have to rely on world market prices for their products. Of course, in the third category are the unemployed. The Labor movement's wages policy would inevitably reduce the number of those in safe employment, increasing the number in vulnerable employment and push more and more of those presently in vulnerable employment into the ranks of the unemployed. In fact, it would mean more and more wages certainly, but for fewer and fewer people. It shows a total lack of concern for the unemployed and would have the effect of adding to their numbers. There are members of this community who do not have powerful industrial muscle. These people have been deserted by leaders in the Labor movement and their political representatives. They are the unemployed, the selfemployed and the tens of thousands of primary producers who are battling the combined effects of drought, disastrously high increases in their costs and disastrously low prices for their products. We will not desert these people even if the Opposition does. We have been representing their interests before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitrauon Commission, and it is just as well that we have, because they have been callously disregarded by the leaders of the Labor movement. NA",29
18,Mr UREN,INFLATION,Is the Prime Minister aware that in Statement No. 2 attached to the Budget Speech it is estimated that the Ukely change in the consumer price index for the year 1976-77 is of the order of 12 per cent? Does this indicate that the Government's Budget will bring inflation only marginally under control in 1976-77? Does it suggest that the sacrifices by a very wide section of the Australian people will be in vain?,29
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,The Treasurer will answer the question.,29
20,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION,"It suggests nothing of the sort, and I am surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would seek to take poltiical points i with a question of this type. In fact, he is running the same risk as the Leader of the Opposition ran in making comparison between particular years. The fact is that average prices for the next financial year, when compared with average prices for 1975-76, are expected to increase at around the rate of increase of average weekly earnings-in other words, around 12 per cent. This is perfectly clear, and the Budget documents bear it out. There is no dispute on this side of the chamber. The honourable gentleman would understand that they are comparisons of average prices for thisfinancialyear with the previous year. The Budget documents indicate what I said in a clear sense last night-that at the end of this financial year the rate of inflation will be down to a single digit level. If the honourable member has some preoccupation with this matter I suggest that he read page 26 which is the prices section of the same document. I will quote to him from this section, because it is a matter of very great substance: Price changes of these magnitudes for the year as imply a markedly better performanceHonourable gentlemen would understand this Treasury document wellover the course of 1976-77 1973-76. Looked at on a June quarter to June quarter basis, price increases some 4 to 5 percentage points increases recorded between the June quarters of 1976 are expected for broadly based denaters. If the honourable gentleman wants to know what broadly based denaters are we will send him a letter to help him. Page 26 of Statement No. 2 also states: This picture would be consistent with annual rates change in the single-digit area by the end of 1976-77. Putting all the techmcal jargon to one side, I do not beheve that there is any disbelief in the munity that inflation will fall this year as a quence of what we are doing. FORECASTS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH forecast",29
21,Mr DOBIE,INFLATION,I ask the Treasurer a question following his most admirable and excellent forecasts. presentation of a very fine Budget last night following the absence of questions from the 3 former Treasurers sitting opposite. Will he give detaUs to the House of the Budget forecasts for economic growth this year?,30
22,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION,"I thank the honourable gendewhich man for the kindness of his comment which enperiod ables me to find the appropriate paper. This year's Budget is designed to achieve a level real economic growth in the Australian economy of 4 per cent. This will budd on the resumption real economic growth that has taken place during the latter part of the previousfinancialyear. These developments must, of course, be placed in context. Because of the incompetence of our opponents in this House, gross non-farm product in the December quarter oflast year, seasonally adjusted and at constant prices, was still almost 5 per cent below its peak level recorded 2 years earUer. Dr Richardson-Shame .",30
23,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION,"Of course there is a sense of shame. That sense of shame will be even more compelling when I remind the Leader of the Opposition that his Party promised in 1972 that it would achieve a growth rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent in each year of office. The appalling record of our predecessors can be further illustrated by the fact that the gross domestic product increased at an annual average rate of 5.2 per cent between 1962 and 1972. Last night's Budget will put the economy back on to the growth a whole path it was on before the Labor Party caused a recession in this country. It is a Budget which stands for economic growth; it is a Budget which stands for greater prosperity for aU Australians. than occurred over the course of NA lower than the Mr HURFORD-My question is supplemen197S and tary to questions from the honourable member for Cook and the Leader of the Opposition. If it is a fact, as the Treasurer stated to the Leader of the Opposition, that the Budget optimistically assumes a 2 per cent growth in employment by June next year, although the Budget papers do not set this out, will this not be more than offset of by a growth in the work force of at least 2 per cent, thus producing unemployment levels at least as great as if not greater than they are at compresent-worsee than 8 months ago when this conseGovernment took over? What are the Treasury's actual forecasts of the unemployment levels at the end of the next 4 months? This is the sort of looked for by the honourable member for Cook; I understand the Treasury makes these What is the explanation for the cut of and $33m or 5.7 per cent in the aUocation for unemany of ployment and sickness benefits?",30
24,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is a matter of great irony that the Australian Labor Party has a fixation with a problem which it effectively caused and for it found no answer during the whole it was in government. Even if my answer be interpreted by some as being a poltiical of response, I want to say, consonant with what my colleague the Minister for Employment and in Industrial Relations has said, that no one in this country ought to forget the tragedy of this Government's inheritance after 3 years of Labor government. The honourable member for Adelaide and his colleagues created more unemployment than any other government, certainly any other government that I can recall-and that goes back a long period. If the honourable member had heard, I responded earlier to questions about the 2 per cent. If he would like me to repeat what I said, I will be happy to do so, but I remind him that the details of the 2 per cent, the 1 per cent to 2 per cent, the averaging year by year and so forth are clearly set out on page 25 of Budget Paper No. 2 and are clearly set out in the speech I made. If the Opposiuon wants me to repeat them, I will be happy to do that. The number of people employed will be more than 2 per cent greater in June 1977 than in June 1976. In brief, between June 1976 and next June the labour force is projected to grow by around 2 per cent. Employment will grow by more than 2 per cent over thefinancialyear, whereas the labour force will not grow by more than 2 per cent over the same period. I say to this House, and I say it deliberately, that it may be one thing to seek to ascertain what the projections are, but surely as a matter of fidence in the country and as a matter of a reit sponsible atdtude, the Opposition ought to be promoting in this Parliament whatever it beyear, lieves ought to be done in relation to the econmoney omy. All we have got in the opening stages of question time have been nit-picking exercises about assumptions which are built tions which I have already answered. If honourable gendemen opposite want to play a responsible part in economic recovery, let them come up with some genuine alternatives. They cannot. NA",30
25,Mr HYDE,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"Has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs seen a Press report stating that, as a result of the reductions in money to be appropriated for Aboriginal affairs, over 1000 Aborigines wiU be unemployed? Can the Minister provide some information on this matter?",31
26,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"I thank the honourable gentleavailable man for asking the question which allows me explode the statement made in a particular newspaper. It is quite incorrect that one thousand or anywhere near that number of Aborigines be unemployed as a result of the decisions announced by the Treasurer. In fact the Governsubjected ment has made arrangements during the Supply period to provide funds to enable employment be continued at the same levels. As the Treasurer said last night, reviews are being undertaken fundamental areas of Aboriginal affairs programs-notabl y housing and enterprisesand these are 2 areas where there is large employment particularly in remoter communities. The Government recognises its obUgation to Aboriginals and to the community at large to see that where money is spent in areas Uke this it is spent wisely, effectively and efficiently. That is why the Government has undertaken these fundamental reviews. As the Treasurer has said, when those reviews are completed, additional funds wiU be provided, because we recognise that in these areas of housing and employment the Aboriginal people are disadvantaged. There is a high level of unemployment already amongst them-to o high a level. What we want to do is to introduce programs which are soundly based, soundly administered and wiU provide real benefit to the Aboriginal people. NA",31
27,Mr HAYDEN,MONEY SUPPLY,"I ask the Treasurer: Is it a fact that the increase in the money supply-M3 sought for thisfiscalyear is about 12 per cent? Is it a fact that the Budget domestic deficit increases M3 by less than 6 per cent? Is it a fact that comconment in Statement 2 of the Budget Papers makes clear that there will be no surplus, and probably a deficit, on the balance of payments this excluding this as a source for increasing supply? If these questions are correct in this fact, from what source, in what way and with what timing will the additional increase in in and quesmoney supply be provided?",31
28,Mr LYNCH,MONEY SUPPLY,"The fact is that the Government is thinking aU the time, which is more than I can say for the Opposition. In relation to M3, I can understand the honourable gentleman's particular interest because for the firsttimethat I can recaU we have put down a specific parameter for the growth of the money supply, broadly defined on the M3 basis. As I recall from last night- I do not have the particular section in front of me-it is between the levels of 10 per cent and 12 per cent. Thatfigurewas put down on the basis of a Government decision, following the best advice to it from the Federal Treasury, followto ing also my close and constant monitoring with the Reserve Bank and after Government consultation with people in the free enterprise sector. will Given the assumptions which surround it and given the qualifications to which that figure is in the Budget Speech and in the associated documents, the Government is conto fident that that broad range of growth in the money supply on the M3 basis will not be accomin modating to inflation but at the same time will allow a capacity to underwrite economic recovery. I can understand the Opposition's attitude in relation to this matter. Although the honourable member for Adelaide, who is the shadow Treasurer, has in recent days been quite quiet about our achievements in the money supply area, he will recall that in my statement of 20 May I put down a parameter of 11 per cent to 13 per cent. What did Opposition members say then? They said 'credit squeeze' and they repeated it but their cries became weaker and weaker as time went on.",31
29,Mr HAYDEN,MONEY SUPPLY,I take a point of order.,32
30,Mr LYNCH,MONEY SUPPLY,I think it is to the Government's credit that there was no credit squeeze.,32
31,Mr SPEAKER,MONEY SUPPLY,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat.,32
32,Mr HAYDEN,MONEY SUPPLY,"Mr Speaker, it is extremely regrettable but, probably understandably, the Treasurer has not understood the question.",32
33,Mr SPEAKER,MONEY SUPPLY,Order! There is no substance in the point of order.,32
34,Mr HAYDEN,MONEY SUPPLY,I wonder whether he could answer the question which I asked. I ask for leave to ask the question again so that the Treasurer might be able to answer it.,32
35,Mr SPEAKER,MONEY SUPPLY,Order! The honourable member for Oxley will resume his seat. NA,32
36,Mr MILLAR,REPATRIATION PATIENTS,"Is the Minister representing member. the Minister for Repatriation aware that the policy announced on 20 May 1976rancerningthe admission of repatriation patients to nonrepatriation hospitals, particularly in country areas, has caused considerable problems in its application and has created widespread concern among veterans and veterans' organisations? Will the Minister explain to the House the cumstances relating to the policy?",32
37,Mr NEWMAN,REPATRIATION PATIENTS,"I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay for the question. I am aware that there has been some concern. In fact was in Maryborough when a group from the turned Services League from Bundaberg and Maryborough were discussing this very should like therefore to take the opportunity on behalf of my colleague in the other place to assure everybody that no repatriation beneficiary will be disadvantaged by this pohcy. Let me explain the situation again as I think I have done once before in this place. If a repatriation beneficiary has to go into hospital and if his local medical officer or the specialist after him cannot follow him because of procedures relating to public hospitals in the State concerned, he may be admitted as a private patient in a shared room so that his local medical officer or his specialist may attend to him. NA",32
38,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer to the accelerated write-off provisions allowed for mining expenditure on capital equipment. As the Treasurer did his best last night, with a play on words, to conceal the fact that the Industries Assistance Commission",32
39,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,I ask the honourable member for Blaxland to commence his question as distinct from his preface.,32
40,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"Acceptin g the fact that the Government does not have to accept an IAC decision, will the Treasurer explain to the House why the Government set aside an IAC recommendation for a 15-year write-off? Why has the Government discriminated in favour of the healthier section of Australian corporate enterprise when manufacturing industry has a write-off average of 12 years? Does the Treasurer realise that the accelerated write-off, coupled with the 40 per cent investment allowance, constitutes an industry handout of unparalleled magnitude?",32
41,Mr LYNCH,MINING INDUSTRY,I do not regard the provision as an industry handout of unparalleled-whateve r the phrase was that was used by the honourable,32
42,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,Magnitude .,32
43,Mr LYNCH,MINING INDUSTRY,It does not matter what word the honourable member used or what he said about the matter. The fact is that the honourable gentleman stands indicted for what he said about the mining industry in Western Australia recircendy and he knows it. He was quite rightiy repudiated by his Western Australian colleagues.,32
44,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,Mr SPEAKER ,32
45,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,Order! I ask the Treasurer to I resume his seat. I cannot hear the point of order Rebeing taken by the honourable member for Blaxland while the honourable member for point. I Chifley is shouting so loudly.,32
46,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"Mr Speaker, I have asked a legitimate question as to why the Government rejected an IAC recommendation. I want a specific answer.",32
47,Mr LYNCH,MINING INDUSTRY,"Mr Speaker, I thought I was taking a proper point, if you wish to rule upon it. looking I was simply seeking to say",32
48,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,The Treasurer is entitled to answer the question as he sees fit providing his answer is relevant.,33
49,Mr LYNCH,MINING INDUSTRY,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was saying, with your leave and through you to the honourable gendeman on the other side of the House, that in a recent statement he made in Perth, and which was rejected by his own Party in that State he did more to destroy confidence in the industry than has any statement that anyone has made since he was the lackey of the fellow who now sits on his right hand side.",33
50,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw that statement.,33
51,Mr LYNCH,MINING INDUSTRY,"I do withdraw. I think he is an uncritical admirer or something hke that, but I withdraw the word 'lackey'. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, we can all see that the Treasurer is rattled as he is called out ofhis foxhole.",33
52,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,"Order! If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to take a point of order, he shall take it without preface. I call upon him to take his point of order Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, you ruled that the Treasurer had to withdraw the reference to the honourable member for Blaxland being the lackey of another honourable member. The Treasurer withdrew his remark and then interpolated another reference. The reference was not relevant to the question. You, sir, have twice today said that answers should be relevant to the questions, that a Minister can answer as he wishes as long as the answers are relevant. The original reference was offensive and irrelevant. The amended reference was still irrelevant. Mr Speaker, I submit that you should require the Treasurer to withdraw the irrelevant reference unequivocally.",33
53,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,I called upon the Treasurer to withdraw that part which I believed was likely to cause offence to a member of this House and therefore produce disorder in the House. The Treasurer withdrew it. I did not require its withdrawal from the point of view of relevance.,33
54,Mr LYNCH,MINING INDUSTRY,"In relation to the question asked, the Government has taken some very significant decisions for the mining industry. The honourable member is entitled from his side of the House to object to those decisions. It just so happens-it is not a matter of coincidence-that this is a government that believes in the mining sector and in getting this country off the ground once again. The changes which are proposed are very significant. The Government obviously has the capacity to look at the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations and to take its own decisions based on those recommendations. Some of the 4 recommendations utterly endorse what the IAC put forward. Others are amendments thereof. The Government beUeves that the right decisions were taken. If honourable members look at what the niining industry is saying today about its sense of confidence in now moving they will see that those decisions are justified. NA NA",33
55,Dr EDWARDS,ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the stock valuation adjustment proposal for companies as announced last night by the Treasurer. WUl he explain to the House in what ways the proposal differs from the recommendations of the Mathews Committee on this subject?,33
56,Mr LYNCH,ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL,"There are in fact 2 important differences from the trading stock valuation adjustment scheme that I outlined in the Budget Speech last night and the proposal recommended by the Mathews Committee. It is a matter of substance and I take the opportunity to respond in a little detail to the House. First, the Government has decided to use the goods component of the consumer price index for adjustment purposes rather than the more complex provisions which were proposed and recommended by the Mathews report. The Government's proposal will have the distinct advantage of simplicity and will therefore avoid the complexities and additional costs that the Mathews formula would have meant for businesses, particularly smaU enterprises, which find difficulty in understanding the dialogue about stock adjustment, clawback and what have you. Our approach will also overcome certain technical difficulties. For example, the original Mathews proposals would have been difficult to implement in cases where there was a change in the quality of stocks or where obsolescence of stocks was a factor, for example, where fashion goods were involved. The second major difference lies in the Government's decision that the trading stock valuation adjustment should take the form of a permanent reduction of taxation rather than deferment in the clawback concept as proposed by the Mathews Committee. In deciding against the deferral the Government had in mind several serious disadvantages which would have arisen. For example, this method would have increased company tax collections intimesof trade depression and the Government could have been placed in a position of having to liquidate businesses in order to recapture the tax which would have been owing in those circumstances. As well, there are formidable techmcal difficulties associated with the design of an efficient means of recapturing tax revenue under the concept of a deferral system. The Government beUeves that its proposals are certainly soundly based. I should emphasise that they were brought down in this House only on the basis of the most detailed consultations with industry groups involved and the House wiU be very much aware that the Government took the opportunity to seek the return of Professor Mathews from the Umted Kingdom for direct discussions in relation to the implementation of this scheme.",33
57,Mr CONNOR,ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL,"I refer the Treasurer to the Budget Papers in which the Government's estimate of income from pay-as-you-earn taxation, after deductions by way of rebate, for the coming year wiU be of the order of $8,750m, an increase over the 1975-76figureof almost $l,750m and an increase in percentage terms of more than 25 per cent. How does he equate this 25 per cent impost on the trade unionists of Austraha with the generaUy accepted innation component of 12 per cent in the present Budget?",34
58,Mr LYNCH,ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL,"I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has done his sums. I am subject to correction until I have had the opportunity of checking thefiguresfollowing question time. The honourable gentleman used the figure of 25 per cent. My recollection is that thefigureis 23 per cent. Who is talking about taxation reform in those areas that are the subject of inference in the honourable gentleman's question? Of course the country is going ahead. Of course more people are coming back into the work force. Of course there will be greater personal income tax collections during the period. What honourable gentlemen opposite always conveniently seek to overlook and forget, of course, is that this Government, after being in office for less than 6 months, brought down the greatest single tax reform in Australia's history. I refer specificaUy to the implementation of full personal tax indexation. We said we would do it in 3 years; we did it in less than 6 months.",34
59,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL,How come it has gone up 23 per cent with indexation?,34
60,Mr LYNCH,ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL,The honourable gentleman commitments. represents a government which implemented the greatest taxrip-offsin this country since Herod was a boy; and that goes back a long period. NA,34
61,Mr BRADFIELD,INDIRECT TAXATION,The Treasurer will be aware of the general favourable response to the Government's decision not to increase indirect taxes this year. Can he give the House a comparison of the effects of the Government's decision in respect of indirect taxes in this Budget with those of other recent Budgets?,34
62,Mr LYNCH,INDIRECT TAXATION,"I thank the honourable gentleman for the unforeseen nature of his question which was obviously prompted by the previous question asked from the Opposition side. All Australians can take great comfort from the fact that this year, for the first time in 3 years, there will be no increases in the major indirect taxes.",34
63,Mr KEATING,INDIRECT TAXATION,"I rise on a point of order. This is supposed to be the time when questions without TAXATION notice are asked. It is obvious that the Treasurer cannot answer any of the questions that are genuinely asked without notice, and that he has to read the answer to every other question.",34
64,Mr SPEAKER,INDIRECT TAXATION,There is no point of order. I caU the Treasurer.,34
65,Mr LYNCH,INDIRECT TAXATION,"It is in major contrast to the poUcies of our predecessors over the past 3 years when we saw an increase in the annual level of taxation in this area of more than $ 1,000m.",34
66,Mr SCHOLES,INDIRECT TAXATION,"I rise on a point of order. I am concerned that the Minister is deliberately misleading the House. He has stated that there will be no increase in indirect taxation. He apparently does not consider that payments to Medibank, etc., are taxation.",34
67,Mr SPEAKER,INDIRECT TAXATION,Order! The honourable member for Corio will withdraw the statement that the Treasurer is deliberately misleading the House.,34
68,Mr SCHOLES,INDIRECT TAXATION,I withdraw the statement that he dehberately misled the House.,34
69,Mr SPEAKER,INDIRECT TAXATION,"The honourable gentleman may make his point of order now, if he wishes to do so.",34
70,Mr SCHOLES,INDIRECT TAXATION,I have made my point of order.,34
71,Mr SPEAKER,INDIRECT TAXATION,I caU the Treasurer.,34
72,Mr LYNCH,INDIRECT TAXATION,"I remind the House of what the former Prime Minister, now the Leader of the Opposition, said by way of a promise. He made this comment: I see no reason why taxes, direct or indirect, need to be increased in order to pay for any of our continuing Having given the Australian pubUc that assurance the Leader of the Opposition, as Prime Minister, presided over a Budget last year which increased the duty on beer, which increased the duty on spirits, which put up the price of cigarettes by around, as I recall, 6c a packet, and put addidonal taxation on petroleum. Last year's Budget raised $602m in additional levies, even excluding the coal export levy. The fact is that the man in the street has not been hit by this Budget; he was virtually destroyed by the former one. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-Without notice, I ask a question of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. What does he expect to the increase in the percentage and/or the numbers of persons available for including those unable to secure employment, between the end oflast June and the end of next June?",34
73,Mr STREET,RELATIONS,Thefiguresavailable to me are trade consistent with those the Treasurer has already given to the House. NA,35
74,Mr FALCONER,MEDIBANK,"Has the Prime Minister seen reports that the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, has taken out health cover with Medibank Private, rather than through the private health fund with which he was previously insured? Was this option open to him under the Labor Government's achieve Medibank arrangements? Can the Prime Ministration ter explain why he himself has taken out health cover through Medibank Private?",35
75,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MEDIBANK,"The option was would not available to Mr Hawke under the previous scheme introduced by the former AdministraAdministration tion. I am delighted that the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions and Presireasons dent of the Australian Labor Party, and maybe one day a member of this House, has taken advantage of the opportunity provided by the Government to demonstrate to all Australians that Medibank is alive and well, ready to business with Mr Hawke and many other people, and ready to compete with the private funds to help keep the cost ofhealth insurance down. that is what is happening. We all owe Mr Hawke our thanks. A number of other people have joined Medibank Private insurance, I think for similar reasons. As the honourable gentleman drew attention to it, I have joined Medibank Prireport vate and I think some of my colleagues either have or intend to do so as well. The Government is providing an interesting field of competition between Medibank insurance and private funds which I believe will advantage many people in Austraha. I regret that the previous Administration did not provide the equivalent opportunities under its regimented program. NA",35
76,Mr YOUNG,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,"I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the policy of his Party, as printed, which states: 'We regard industry, particularly shipbuilding, as the fourth arm of defence'. I ask the Prime Minister: Does the Department of Defence agree with his decision to close the shipyards of Australia? Does he agree that Austraha is better defended by losing the be capability to build and repair ships or by having 10 000 additional people, skilled and unskilled, employment, on the unemployed list?",35
77,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,"The honourable gentleman should be aware that ships built for defence purposes and ships built for normal purposes have very different characteristics and have generally been built in separate specialised yards. On many occasions- I did this and I know the present Minister for Defence has looked at the question-ther e have been attempts to get some arrangement which would enable normal commercial yards to build defence ships. That would have enabled increased work to have been provided from time to time for Australian yards. Because of the specialised nature of defence ships, it has so far been found difficult to this. I believe that the previous Adminismust also have found that was so, otherwise the light destroyers that were ordered in the time of the previous Administration presumably have been ordered for construction in Australian yards. I note that the previous did not take the opportunity to do just that. I think probably, and regretfully, the for not being able to do it were justified. The Government is concerned about the situation in Whyalla and at Newcastle, but I think the honourable gentleman does not do his own previous Administration justice. Would he have do said the same thing if he had understood as clearly as he should that all we have done in this instance is to continue the policy of the previous And Administration? We have announced that the previous Government's policy continues. But because the circumstances and times have altered we have also referred the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission for fairly immediate to see whether it wants to stick to its past recommendations or whether it wishes to change those recommendations. Opportunities will be provided for people to give evidence in relation health to those particular matters. I have just been discussing the matter with the Minister concerned. The Commission also will be asked to report on the impact of either a continuation of the present position or of any other recommendations it might wish to make in relation to Whyalla and Newcastle. That, again, will provide an opportunity for people to give evidence. It will provide an opportunity fbr the honourable gendeman's own State Government to say in plain and firm terms what the State Government might be prepared to do to assist in a very difficult situation. There have been reports that Mr Dunstan is prepared to offer some rehef from payroll tax but I have not seen that offer made on hard and fast terms, as though it would be a real offer. I should like to know if it was a real offer. I think that this is a very difficult situation. IAC has been asked to look at it. All this Government has done is to continue the poUcies that were formulated by the previous Adrninistration. But not being happy with that, it referred the question to the Industries Assistance Commission. I also note that during the time the previous Administration was in office a significant number of ships were ordered overseas, including 4 large bulk carriers. If it had not been for the eagerness of the previous Minister for Transport to get these ships at a very early date it would have been possible for those orders also to have been placed in Australian yards and then there would have been an opportunity for the previous Administration to put its money where its voice is on this occasion. It did not take that opportunity just as it did not take the opportunity to have ships built for defence purposes in Australia. I hope that the honourable member wdl take the constructive opportunity that is provided to him and suggest that Mr Dunstan also do it in relation to the forthcoming IAC inquiry. SHORTAGE OF REFRIGERATED CARGO sure",35
78,Mr OKEEFE,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,Is the Minister for Transport aware that there has been a shortage of refrigerated cargo space avaUable for the carthough riage of meat to Japan? Does the Minister realise that this shortage is causing the delay in the filling of important contracts on the Japanese market? Can the Minister give the House any information as to the reasons for the shortage? What is being done to overcome the situation?,36
79,Mr NIXON,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,"I have to confirm that there is a follows: shortage of refrigerated cargo space for the carriage of meat to Japan. The estimate given by the Australian Meat Board some days ago was that Date there was a shortage of about 4000 tonnes. happy to inform the House that about 1000 tonnes of that has been picked up by a nonconference line. Other tonnage has been picked up as well. The shortage is estimated to be about 1300 tonnes for carcass mutton and about SOO tonnes for carton meats. The reason for the shortage, of course, has been the continued industrial disputes that have taken place, affecting the waterfront and the loading of ships. It is interesting to note that since 1 May there have been 83 days lost in Melbourne, 11 days lost in Brisbane and 30 days lost in Sydney, due to industrial disputes. What the trade union leaders who lead these strikes do not seem to understand is that they are threatening the jobs of many of their fellow workers throughout the community. It really is a disgrace that so many The stoppages have occurred and have affected the carriage of meat at a time when the meat industry is going through a difficult period. Our faUure to be able to fulfil contracts for such an important market as Japan-it prejudices our total opportunities to maintain a stable market in that country-is beyond words as far as I am concerned. I could use words outside this House to express my feelings but, Mr Speaker, ydu would not appreciate it if I tried to use those words in this House to describe the current situation. For the information of honourable members. I think it is important-I should like to include in Hansard, if I may, a hst of the series of strikes that have taken place in the various ports which have affected the loading of meat. I seek leave to incorporate that list in Hansard.",36

130,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that during the recess the Principal ParUamentary Reporter, Mr W. J. retired after giving nearly 41 years of service to Hansard- more than half the period since Federation. Mr Bridgman is in the House, I welcome him on behalf of the House. Mr Bridgman is the elder son of Mr J. S. Bridgman served on the Western Australian Hansard the same length oftime-a very remarkable fanuly record. He was educated at Perth Modern and the University of Western Australia. For the first 7 years of his working life he was a journalist in Perth and joined the Federal Hansard staff in 1935. At the time, Mr J. A. Lyons was Prime Minister and Mr John Curtin Leader the Opposition. There have been 13 Prime and 8 Leaders of the Opposition since Mr Bridgman was closely associated with the reporting and printing changes required for the introduction of daily Hansard in 1955. He introduced in 1970 tape recording on a large to produce transcripts of the evidence taken parUamentary committees and the proceedings of ministerial conferences. He holds the diploma in journalism awarded by the University of Western Australia. He is a member of the council of the Commercial Education Society of and Australia and a Fellow of the Incorporated ApPhonographic Society, London. He edited the 3rd edition of Commonwealth Hansard: Its Establishment and Development, which contains, in addition to the history of the staff since 1901, the authorities and rules for the production of the He made Federal Hansard history by appointing women as reporters in what had been for 70 years an exclusively male preserve. An ambitious scheme for training young reporters commenced under his direction is flourishing. He was Principal Parliamentary Reporter for more than 8 years- a period during which reporting department developed at a greater than at any other time in its 75 years existence. He is regarded as a spokesman for other Hanwithout sard staffs in Australia on matters of common interest. He knew 2 members of the original speeches. Hansard staff appointed in 1901 and so has been a bridge between the very old and the very new. In awarding birthday honours in June, Her Majesty the Queen conferred on him the OBE. Party. He will continue to live in Canberra. He has no intention of writing a book. He says he will never seek again to know for whom the bells in Parhathe ment House toll because they will not be tolling to summon him to this chamber. He always made us read better than we sounded. I know provideheed. similar tributes are being paid to Mr Bridgman in the Senate, but on behalf of this chamber I wish him to know that we hope he will have a long and enjoyable retirement, and we hope that cause of the comradeship we have built with we will often see him here. Consequent upon Mr Bridgman's retirement, Mr K. R. Ingram, who is not scheduled to be the chamber at the moment but who will be known to all honourable members, has been appointed Acting Principal Parliamentary Reporter. Mr Ingram is Acting Principal Parhareporters mentary Reporter at his own request for an tion. interim period. I hope that he will find himself physically fit to undertake the permanent appointment as Principal Parliamentary Bridgman Reporter.",41
131,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"For the Government, I would like say how much all honourable members appreciyears, ate the work of Bill Bridgman and the devotion tb duty he has shown over a very long period of years. I think all honourable members greatly indebted to Bill Bridgman and to those House. who work with him. As we know, he has only recently retired. You, Mr Speaker, drew attention to how Hansard reporters have the unique ability to turn a mediocre speech into a memorable one. How many of us have often retired from the chamber less than happy with the delivery speech and then marvelled at what we have seen when we have read it in Hansardl I can it remember an incident that perhaps can serve as a warning to honourable members in case they believe they are better than Hansard. On one occasion an honourable member from South Australia complained that he wanted to be reported exacdy as he spoke and he did not want Hansard changing his language, grammar or the meaning of his words. As I understand it, on the next occasion that honourable member spoke, he the had his speech reported exactly as he had rate delivered it. His 20 minute speech was in one sentence, without any punctuation and even a full stop at the end. After that, so the story goes, he allowed Hansard to change his",42
132,Mr YOUNG,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,It would not have been a South Austrahan. It was a member of the Country,42
133,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"He came from honourable gentleman's Party before the honourable gentleman's time. That is a warning which some honourable members may like to I suppose Hansard would be deUghted to them with the same service if they wanted to try it. I think we will all recall that Bill Bridgman has left a great tradition behind him. He was an innovative Principal Parliamentary beReporter. Especially during the last 10 to 15 him years the workload of Hansard reporters has been much greater than ever before with the work of parliamentary committees and with the in increased work of the Houses of Parliament. Two notable innovations were the introduction of the tape recording service for parliamentary committees, and the employment of female to which you, Mr Speaker, drew attenThe latter must have broken down one of the last male bastions in employed positions. Probably the chamber is much better for it. All honourable members would want to wish Bill the very best in his retirement. He will always have a warm welcome in this place. I supwe could expect that, having heard so many to long debates and having been here for so many he might find it hard to leave the place and therefore would want to be a very frequent visitor to the House. I am sure he can be assured of a are warm welcome when he comes to visit the Bill Bridgman has the capacity to teach many poUticians a lesson in courtesy. He is always a most courteous person. Very often, at different times all of us might have put requests to of our Hansard to which Hansard was not able to accede, but when the answer was in the negative was always given in a way that was so pleasant that it was impossible to quarrel with it. Maybe this is something honourable members could take to heart when we are debating matters and disputing with each other across the table. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-Member s of Hansard, like Presiding Officers, have to attend in the chamber more often than any other persons entitled to sit in it. Even more than Presiding Officers, they are precluded from speaking on their own behalf. I must compliment you, Mr Speaker, on the eloquence and the humanity with which you have spoken on this occasion. I assure you that members of the Australian Labor Party support and enjoyed everything you said, not only in the references you made but also the wishes you extended to Mr Bill Bridgman and Mr Ken Ingram. For myself, I hope I will be forgiven for making 2 nostalgic references to gentlemen I have known for very many decades. Indeed, I have long envied Mr Bridgman because he married the most vivacious of the girl students at Telopea Park High School shortly after we both left it. Mr Ken Ingram and I sat together and learnt from the same people at Telopea. I hope we have both improved since then. He certainly has. Since the House is in such a very good mood, I might say that he and I certainly derived what skill in or preciation we may have of the English language from members of a family whose father was a member of this House at the dme and one of whom is married to a former Clerk of the House. Mr Speaker, there is only one other thing I would like to add. Due to the vagaries of the remuneration system applying to those who can sit but not speak in this chamber, it was only on the eve of his retirement that Mr Bridgman was able to approach the income that Mr Ingram had been receiving as his deputy. I believe both were entided to receive proper remuneration because they both served this House superbly. We are all singularly indebted to them. We wish Mr Bridgman and his wife many years of good health and we wish Mr Ingram the good health which will enable him to take up permanently the appointment for which he is so well qualified in succession to Mr Bridgman.",42
134,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER," Mr Speaker, briefly I would like to associate the members of the National Country Party of Australia with your own good wishes to Bill Bridgman. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has just stated, there is no real requirement for those of us who are members to be in this chamber other than for those minimal periods when we are involved in legislation or when we have an involvement at question time. But for those who are officers of the Parhament there is a continuing requirement to be present. I think all of us admire the patience and perseverance which they demonstrate in sitting through long hours of what can often be extraordinarily tedious and repetitious speeches. In so many ways Bill Bridgman has personified the qualities of one who as a servant of the House we can respect. He has contributed so much to making those rather inept and inadequate utterances of ours reasonably word perfect. There is no doubt that in the manner of the implementation of his reforms he has made our sitting in the Parliament more enjoyable because he has introduce d female members to the parliamentary Hansard staff. Bill Bridgman himself is a man of considerable humility and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has explained, his constant courtesy could well be emulated by those who as parliamentarians place such strains upon the Hansard staff. Hansard plays an extraordinarily important role in the British parliamentary system. We have immense privileges as members of Parliament, as those who make utterances within ap- this place are not accountable elsewhere for anything they might say. That means that Hansard in its recording of those statements provides a continuing record, not just of the interplay between personalities but also of the whole of the interplay of policies and programs of successive governments. Hansard is therefore, in a very real form, a continuing historical record. Those who are responsible for preserving that historical record need to be looked at not just with a personal respect but also with a respect which accords with the tradition which they follow. Mr Speaker, on behalf of the members of my Party I would like also to extend to Mr Ken Ingram our hope that he will assume the mantle of Principal Parliamentary Reporter if his health so permits. In particular I would Uke to wish Mr Bill Bridgman good health and many years of happiness in his retirement. Albeit without the same measure of writing, I trust that we will still see him from time to time in this place. If so, I know that he will always be most welcome.",43
135,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"On behalf of the back bench I would Uke to join in the very deserved tributes that have been paid to Bill Bridgman. I think that only the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) and I have been here since 1949. Of course, I have had little to say and have not been putting much burden on Hansard but I know that in my years of retirement when I look through the volumes of Hansard I will be asking: 'Well, was I ever able to say that?' My words wdl have been so much improved by the inimitable art of Mr Bridgman. I have been associated with him particularly in the introduction of the daily Hansard and I recall with pleasure what he did in that regard. I do not think that without his encouragement and help we would ever have achieved that particular reform. I think that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is waiting to say something in this regard. He and I, as perhaps the longest serving members in this chamber at the present moment, would certainly wish to be associated in a tribute to what has been done for us.",43
136,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER," Mr Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure able to associate myself with your remarks and those of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the Acting Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) in respect of Mr Bridgman. As the honourable member for Mackellar has pointed out, he and I are the longest serving members in the chamber this afternoon. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Is this the South Auscause tralian member to whom the Prime Minister referred?",44
137,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"No, it is not, but I am going to say something about your remarks. This is the second time that I have heard the Leader of the Opposition confess that somebody else has cut his lunch, the secondtimethat said he had turned his eyes towards some vivacious girl with whom he attended school but whose attentions and affections drifted towards an officer of the Parliament instead of to himself. In this regard he shares something in common with the Prime Minister who, according to the National Times the week before last, was also twice rejected by a member of the fairer sex. brings me to the most important achievement which I think Mr Bridgman can lay claim-th introduction of women into the parhamentary reporting staff. I tried very hard to persuade Campbell, who was the Principal Parliamentary Reporter when the honourable member for Mackellar and I first came to the Parliament, do exactly that but he said that he just could do it; it was not the place for women. As well, women. there were difficulties about ladies' toilets which apparently presented some enormous problem that made it impossible to employ women in job. Women have introduced into this Parhament an element of refinement which we needed sence badly. They are an adornment to the place. It seems that we have not got into the habit of allowing women to be elected to the Parliament as members but it is very nice indeed that we do have women taking the shorthand. If I may say so, from my own experience, the records of what I say in the Parliament are usually fairly faithfully recorded in Hansard. There does not seem to be much alteration to them, or alteration does not appear to be as necessary in my case as the Prime Minister has found in his own. I have compared the reporting of the lady reporters with the reporting of men- I have made a note of this because it has been my aim in life to overcome the discrimination against women which has been to be characteristic of the human race down through the centuries-and I am bound to say that the women reporters in this House are on the whole better than the men. I was one who at a very early age recognised the value of women. I was not even able to sit up, speak or see. I have never ceased to recognise their great value. Mr E. G. Whitlam-He was able to stand.",44
138,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"The honourable member ought to refrain from interjecting be there Ls something written on the bottom of my notes about you to which I might have to refer. I was the first Minister to appoint women to the Federal judiciary; the first Minister to appoint a woman as an arbitration commissioner- I appointed two of them-and thefirstto insist upon the appointment of a female first ashe has sistant secretary. If I may refer again to the National Times of the past weekend, I think it is nonsense to suggest that Sir Arthur Tange could tell the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when he was the Minister for Defence, that the Minister could not talk to his officers or that they could not talk to him. This The Minister, of course, is in charge of his to Department, as I made certain to emphasise e when the appointment of first assistant secretaries came up in the Department of Labor and Mr Immigration. I was the first Minister to insist upon the appointment of a woman to the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industo trial Research Organisation. So I have something not in common with Mr Bridgman in my love for Mr Bridgman has always been courteous and this absolutely correct in his behaviour towards members. He has never attempted to show favouritism to one side or the other or to one member or another. He was, I think, in very esa perfect public servant and a perfect servant of the Parliament. I think, Mr Speaker, his example is one which you could very well emulate. I conclude my few remarks by offering my good wishes to Mr Bridgman. I wish him a long and very happy retirement. I am sorry that he is not writing his memoirs because he could have perhaps swapped them with mine to see how they compared. It is a pity that men like Mr Bridgman, who know so much of the unwritten history of the nation, do not write it. They ought to, and I still hope that he will yet change his mind.",44
139,Mr SCHOLES,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"I should hke to add some remarks to those already made. I had the opportunity of working with Mr Bridgman in a manner which is different from the experience of most members. I think I can say that he always presented himself and sought to do what was necessary in a manner which was so courteous and so responsive that it was almost an embarrassment to the person to whom he reported. He displayed enthusiasm for his job and did it with competence. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said quite a deal. He indicated that Mr Bridgman should write his memoirs so that they could compare notes. There are 2 books-on e allegedly and one certainlyabout a former Victorian, Mr John Wren, which are now being serialised. Those 2 books would most likely have as much in common as the 2 tomes referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh should they be written. Bill Bridgman has given service to this Parhament and far greater service to members than many of them really realise.",45
140,Mr HODGES,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER," Mr Speaker, I think is appropriate that a member of more recent tage and certainly one with a less chequered reer than yourself and the 6 previous speakers should make a few comments on this occasion. Very pleasant duties such as this do not present themselves very frequently in this House. Today is one such occasion. I , as a back the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Publications, should like to add a few remarks on this occasion when we are honouring the departure of Mr Bridgman after long service. I first met Bridgman when I came to this House a couple of places. years ago. Briefings were being carried on for new members and apart from the Chief Lithe brarian, Mr Bridgman, as the Principal Parhamentary Reporter, was present. As was stated by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), I found him to be very courteous, knowledgeable, pleasant and helpful in every way. He was a very industrious worker. After listenof ing to the lengthy Ust of all those recent strikes throughout this country given by the Minister Transport (Mr Nixon), I wondered whether Mr Bridgman had ever been on strike in his long term of office. I wonder whether he ever had a 'sickie' as distinct from a genuine Ulness. My guess is that probably the answer is no. In his 41 years of service here no doubt there would have been some very interesting incidents.

I have spoken to him about this and I hope that he will reconsider the matter.

I wish him a lengthy retirement. I hope that he will come to Queensland and enjoy some of the sun and beautiful climate that we have to offer.

NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",45
142,Mr SPEAKER,MEDIBANK,"I have received 2 letters, one it from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. vin- - Whitlam) and the other from the honourable camember for Hotham (Mr Chipp), proposing that definite matters of pubUc importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107,1I have selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the Leader bencher and as of the Opposition, namely: The Government's failure to maintain Medibank. I therefore call upon those members who apMr prove of the proposed discussion to rise in their (More than the number of members required by Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces) Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (4.13)-The Opposition moved motions of urgency on Medibank on 19 February and 18 May. Since then, the Government has surpassed even its own high standards ineptitude and deception. The past 3 months have seen all the false promises repeated, all the for muddle and inefficiency increased and extended, and all the people's hopes for a just and fair sysMedibank tem of universal health insurance recede still 'Medibank*. further. The argument on Medibank comes down to this: A sensible and popular reform is being troyed in defiance of the Government's promsuggested-exactl ises. A scheme which benefited the whole comhe munity is being sacrificed to benefit a few. scheme which was clear, simple, and straightforment ward is being replaced by a scheme that is community plex, confusing and uncertain. A scheme which was working well is being replaced by a scheme that is untried, untested and unnecessary. A scheme which the people wanted is being tors replaced by one which the doctors and the health funds want. A scheme which saved the taxtransferred payers' money is being replaced with a scheme which will take more from their pockets. From next October the Fraser Government will be taktrative ing hundreds of dollars a year from every taxvate payer in Australia. And why? Why is all this being done? It is being done for no other reason than to appease the medical profession, to bolcriticised ster doctors' incomes and to preserve the moriproportion bund private health bureaucracies. A working, efficient and popular institution is being sacrificed to Liberal dogma about private enterprise. There was not a word in the Liberal poUcy speech last November about this outlandish cumbersome health scheme. There was not a word about ceUings or levies or options or any the weird innovations since inflicted on the payer. There was not a word about the Governcharges. ment's stated intention of driving SO per cent 60 per cent of the Australian people out Medibank and into the private funds. Even after the basic Medibank Bills were passed at the joint sittings 2 years ago, the Liberals persisted in wanton, reckless obstruction. They still blocked the levy. They are now imposing a higher themselves. During the election only the right honourable member for Bruce- Mr Speakerfatuous was honest in declaring the Fraser Government's intentions. On 8 December he said: Medibank is an area of massive expenditure which have to be curtailed. People who use Medibank will make some contribution to it. Mr Speaker was immediately repudiated by the caretaker Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in these direct terms: I have said repeatedly that essential programs education and urban development will be maintained. Medibank will be maintained. On 3 February the Prime Minister stUl expUcidycause was saying-this timeto the Australian Financiallenged Review: You've got to look at it against a commitment to maintain and that's not just a verbal use of the term I think the concept of Medibank was endorsed. So much for promises. We now know that the moment the election was over the Prime Minister desset about doing exactly what Mr Speaker had y what the Prime Minister said would not do. The Government justifies its A vandahsm and deception by the spurious arguthat health costs are beyond what the comcan afford. We have this phoney line that Medibank is a monster eating up taxpayers' money. The fact is that Medibank wdl cost much less to operate than the system sought by the docand the private insurance industry. Administrative costs wiil not diminish; they will simply be from Medibank to the private funds. Rather than one set of administrative costs there will be a whole series of overlapping adminiscosts met by both Medibank and the priorganisations. It costs more to run 100 funds than it does to run one. In 1969 the Nimmo committee-establishe d by a Liberal governmentthe private funds for 'the unduly high of contributions absorbed in operating expenses'. This proportion averaged 14 per cent compared with administrative costs for Medibank of 4 per cent Under the new arrangements the expenses of the funds are likely to be higher, not less. The records of the funds are scanty and incomplete. Contributors moving and from Medibank or between one fund and another will increase the costs of record keeping of and administrative supervision. Staff group detaxductions will require additional commission The overwhelming simplicity and or efficiency of a universal health scheme, backed of by computerised records and streamlined accounting procedures, will give way to appalling administrative complications after 1 October. It is not only administrative costs that are levy bound to rise. The Government scheme will place no restraint on health costs generally. It is and dishonest for the Government to blame Medibank for the rising cost of health care. All over the world these costs are increaswill ing, whatever health insurance system is used. have toThe Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) speaks of waste and 'over-utilisation'. He has given no evidence to support his claim. The few abuses by doctors of medical insurance procedures could never have been detected before Medibank was in health, established; they can be detected under Medibank and they will again be undetectable if Medibank is destroyed or curtailed. The chief of high medical costs remains unchalby this Government-the system of feefor-service and the unrestricted right of doctors to charge what they like. The increasing costs of health care will not be reduced by getting rid of Medibank. All that Medibank can do is apportion those costs as fairly as possible throughout the community and ehminate unnecessary expense in insurance procedures. The only way to reduce the cost of health care is to reduce the availability of health care and the standard of health care for the majority of Austrahans, and that is precisely what the Fraser proposals entail. People will simply pay more for less. That is what the attack on Medibank boils down to. For the vast majority of Australians costs will riseand rise sharply. The levy of 2.5 per cent is artificially high so that people will be driven out. Most Australians will pay more than they need to pay and many wiU pay more than they can afford. The wage earner on $ 100 a week will pay 90c a week more under the Government's scheme than he would if the levy were 1.6 per cent and the whole community were paying. The man earning $ 150 a week will pay an extra $ 1.34 and the man on $200 a week an extra $1.80. All told the fanuly man on $9,000 a year will have to find $4.32 a week or $225 a year after 1 October. Not only that, but doctors who bulk bUl will be able to charge an additional amount above the 85 per cent of the scheduled fee. Under Medibank, doctors who bulk bUled had to accept the 85 per cent as full payment. The Fraser Government will let them coUect the rest. In other words, it is sanctioning a back-door increase in doctors' fees. If doctors who bulk biU take advantage of the Government's offer the community will pay another $30m for medical care. That is how the Fraser Government cuts the cost of health biUs and eliminates waste and extravagance. As usual, the poorer sections of the community will pay more than the better off. That is a uniMedibank versal principle of Fraser Government policies. The levy of 2.5 per cent will put a much heavier burden on low income groups. They wiU pay 2.5 per cent of their income but those who opt outeven those who are forced out-wU l pay a lower rates proportion. The lower income earners left in committed Medibank will pay more to maintain the scheme. Private health fund contributors will be exempt. Everyone in the community uses and benefits from emergency health services and the teaching facUities of the large public hospitals. The lower paid Medibank contributors will be subsidising the provision of these sources for the rest of community. The Government's muddling and deception have continued right throughout the recent spate of last-minute compromises and innovations. In June the Government met understandable protest about the injustice of the levy by announcing that Medibank would be aUowed to compete with the private funds in insuring against intermediate and private ward costs. It was obvious that famUies above $ 10,000 a year that wanted this extra insurance would be driven out of Medibank by the size of the levy. They would have had no choice at all. The Government responded to this injustice by devising an alternative Medibank private insurance scheme. It was a typical Liberal confidence trick. On 8 June the Prime Minister promised that Medibank (Private Insurance) would compete on 'equal terms' with the private funds. I will quote his exact words: Medibank will be able to compete on equal terms with private funds . . . The Government has decided to give authority to Medibank so that it can operate as a private insurer in fair competition with other registered organisations . . . The Government is determined to ensure that Medibankremainsavailable to every Australian. This will enable full and open competition between Medibank and Uie private funds. On top of all the falsehood and trickery that had gone before here was yet another deception. We soon discovered what the Prime Minister meant by 'fair competition'. He meant Medibank would be priced out of business. When he said there would be 'equal terms' he meant that some terms would be more equal than others. When he spoke of 'open competition' he meant that Medibank rates would be announced first and the funds could follow later with their cut price rates. In the event, every private health fund was able to announce charges for private and intermediate cover which were significandy lower than Medibank and were made possible by the $250m in reserves which the funds have accumulated from their contributors. Some funds announced rates of $1.40 less than rates. The smallest difference is 30c. As early as 15 July my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) stated: Newspaper reports confirm that the private funds are waiting to hear the official Medibank (Private Insurance) before setting their rates. If the Minister were really to the principle of full and open competition the premium rates for Medibank (Private Insurance) and the funds would be published simultaneously. People are still confused about what fund to join and what their protection will be. They have no clear idea of their rights and prospects under the Fraser Government's health scheme. The the Government spent half a mUUon doUars in May on a pamphlet to explain its changes, then tore up the pamphlet. It is now spending another half a million dollars to explain its mistakes. All that people know for certain is that they are paying more than necessary and as time goes on they will be paying more than they are this year. The Minister for Health said at the weekend that the levy would be reviewed next year. Of course it will; it will go up. That is the only tainty in this whole sorry affair. The Government has ensured that under a multiplicity of private schemes the cost of medical insurance-privat e or otherwise-wil l escalate in the same wasteful fashion as those of all other forms of compulsory insurance; and those costs will be passed on and they will go up every year. The mounting annual burdens of third party and workers compensation insurance-tw o other forms of compulsory insurance-wil l be a permanent feature ofhealth insurance, this new form of compulsory insurance. That will be so whether doctors cooperate or not. The only way out of the present mess is to scrap the Government's proposals and to revert to Medibank as the Labor Government introduced it, as the people endorsed it, and as the Prime Minister repeatedly promised to maintain it, both before the elections and after. The alternative is inequity, inefficiency, mounting costs and diminishing standards. The Government knows that. It is the victim of its own obsessions, its own record of mindless obstruction, its obUgations-state d and impUed-to these ramshackle health funds and professional pressure groups. If it has any concern for the welfare of the Australian people, it will admit its mistakes and think again. There is still time to save Medibank from destruction and the Government from its ultimate humiUation. There is still time to put the health of the people first. I ask the Prime Minister to show a litde of the honesty, the candour and the responsibUity he likes to claim for himself and his pathetic Administration. I ask him to face the facts. If he does not, Medibank, the great legacy of the Labor Government, wiU be the nemesis of this Government.",45
143,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,"The Opposition sees Medibank as the cure-all and the cover-up for its weakness and impotence in defeat. It is amazing how many sections of the community and how many people have tried to rip off Medibank. As is clearly shown by todays debate and by comments made in recent days, the Opposition seeks to gain the maximum poltiical advantage in surrounding Medibank with a cloud of emotionalism and anxiety. Notwitlistanding the fact that the President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and I have in recent days joined Medibank Private, we face here today a matter of pubUc importance introduced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in these terms: The Government's failure to maintain Medibank. The Opposition cares nothing for 50 per cent of cer- the population, including millions of pensioners and low and medium wage and salary earners who will remain with Medibank standard. It is doing its best either deUberately or by default to undermine confidence in Medibank, especiaUy in Medibank Private insurance. If one listened to the statements from the Opposition over recent days one would think that it wanted people to join the private health funds rather than Medibank Private. Late last week the Leader of the Opposition belatedly reaUsed that his Party's attacks on Medibank Private had gone too far. ReaUsing the foohshness ofhis act, he added to a long and critical motion before the Labor Party's Federal Executive a statement of support for Medibank Private. It did not receive the prominence given to the rest of the distorted nonsense about Medibank which we have been hearing from the Opposition. Let me defend Medibank Private. (Quorum formed) It is rather incredible that the Opposition has to get a quorum in order to support its own discussion of a matter of pubUc importance on Medibank. As I said earUer, late last week the Leader of the Opposition belatedly reaUsed that his Party's attacks on Medibank had gone too far and he issued a long statement supporting Medibank Private. It has been these irresponsible statements that lead me to try to defend Medibank Private in the market. The rates for Medibank Private were calculated on the best actuarial advice by Medibank itself. The only action taken by the Government was tb give a subsidy estimated to cost $ 15m to keep the cost of premiums for shared room intermediate ward hospital accommodation within the reach of low and medium income famUies. That subsidy is avaUable to all private health insurance funds. We took that action because 70 per cent of the Australian people had already taken out extra insurance above standard Medibank. Many famUies did that because they wanted to be treated by their own doctor in hospital. The Government had a genuine concern to ensure that people were not denied that choice. The Opposition's suggestion that Medibank Private will deliberately run dead is a direct reflection on the dedicated and enthusiastic people of the Medibank organisation-peopl e who cannot defend themselves from poltiical attack. I wonder why on earth the Australian Labor Party continues to attack Medibank and continues to create doubt in peoples minds as to whether they should or should not support it. The Opposition is concentrating its pubhcity on the private health fund rates for private room and private hospital insurance. It must know that only 20 per cent of the Austrahan people-mostl y those on the higher incomes-see k that form of insurance; 80 per cent of the people covered by private funds are insured at intermediate ward level of hospital cover. That is the level of cover that most people want. In that area both Medibank Private and the private health funds have very similar rates. Medibank is very competitive, and will continue to be very competitive, in the efficiency of its service and the speed with which it can process its claims. We make no apology for having announced at the time we did the actuarially estimated premiums, which were worked out with the Health Insurance Commission and our actuaries, to try to allay some of the pubhc concern that was being expressed about how much it would cost. Instead of attempting to confuse and to frighten people for its own political motives, the Opposition should get wholeheartedly behind Medibank and ensure that Medibank's new fund has a fair chance and a fair go. The real cause of the Opposition's complaint is its usual narrow-mined hatred of any kind of competition or any kind of choice. By their own admission some private funds will have to dip into their reserves. No one can deny that that is good news for the public. That certainly is a direct result of Medibanks entry into the private health insurance business. It is high time that the Opposition stopped trying to turn back the clock and accepted the fact that the Government has made its final decisions and that the new health insurance arrangements will take affect from 1 October. There will be 3 choices. The first, of course, will be standard Medibank as it is now, and the second will be standard Medibank plus basic hospital-only private insurance which is available to people to day. The .third choice will be complete medical and hospital private insurance cover. The people who choose this cover will pay the premium but they will not pay the levy. Those 3 basic choices are quite straightforward. They are similar, as I said earlier, to the choices that are available today. The 2 principal changes are that everybody except those on the lowest incomes, most sioners and certain defence personnel and rerejected patriation beneficiaries and those who privately insure, will be paying 2Vi per cent of their taxable incomes towards meeting the cost of some of their health care. They will pay according to their means, up to a ceiling of $300 a year for a family and $ ISO for an individual. The second change is that people will be able to take out both medical and hospital insurance cover from Medibank Private or any other registered private health fund. They will pay the insurance premiums but not the 2 Vi per cent levy. The Government announced its fiscal policy decisions on 20 May, including the full indexation of personal income tax, the generous farnily allowances and the modifications that we are talking about today. During that low key debate the Opposition congratulated the Government on numerous occasions. Medibank Mark 1 certainly achieved universal health insurance but it did so at the expense of largely ignoring the need for economy and efficiency in overall health care. The changes we have made will save Medibank from destroying itself by the uncontrolled explosion of costs. The promise by the Leader of the Opposition to restore Medibank Mark 1 is nothing more than a recipe for Medibank's self destruction. The lesson of defeat has taught him nothing. If he is not attacking His Excellency the Governor General or the Chief Justice of the High Court, he is attacking Medibank. The Government's decisions on Medibank were taken as a result of the reports and recommendations of the Medibank Review Committee. That Committee was established in January against a background of allegations of abuses and rip-offs, allegations of over-use of medical and health services, and against a background of exploding health care costs in Australia. The cost argument cannot be ignored by any responsible government. In this financial year alone total health care costs are estimated to explode to $5,400m or $ 1,000m more than last year's total export returns from iron ore, coal, wool, wheat and meat. The rise in health care costs is far in excess of the general high rise in inflation. Doctor's incomes haverisenby record amounts under Medibank. What is the argument all about? The Australian Labor Party argues that there should be a special levy to help fund universal health cover. Although the Opposition opposed the levy during the last session, the Leader of the Opposition now supports a straight levy of 1.8 per cent on all incomesh is interesting to note that in 1972 in the policy speech that he gave there was no menpention whatsoever of a levy. The Government a straight levy because it would have done nothing but perpetuate a system of runaway costs. Under the straight levy, the government of the day would have been forced continually to increase the percentage level in a fruitless chase after costs. If I was reported as saying, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that the Government will increase the 2Vi per cent levy, that is quite incorrect. The Government will not increase or change the 2V4 per cent levy, but from time to time it will adjust the ceiling amounts that will be payable. The evidence for this is provided by the experience of the Opposition itself in regard to the levy. When the Opposition first proposed Medibank the levy was to be a straight 1.25 per cent. Then it became 1.35 per cent. Tbis year the proposal was up to 1.6 per cent. Now the Leader of the Opposition has raised the proposed figure to 1.8 per cent. Under the straight levy system there would be no way in the world that a government could maintain the levy at a percentage level because as costs exploded underneath that levy the percentage levy would have to increase. We have adopted the optional system for 4 very good reasons. Firstly, we recognise that 70 per cent of the Austrahan people are already privately insured. Secondly, we recognise that competition will be encouraged between the public and the private insurance systems. Thirdly, we sought to preserve private practice and the desired relationship between the patient and the doctor. Lastly, we sought to reduce the burden of costs on Consolidated Revenue by $800m in a full year, and separate the costs in a more equitable manner to the people. Of course, the biggest subsidy will go to those on low and medium incomes and those who suffer from chronic Dlness. The lower the income, the higher the subsidy. Tbis is clearly shown by the fact that under the Medibank levy the average person staying with Medibank will contribute only 18 per cent towards his health costs. Those taking out full private cover will contribute about 70 per cent towards those costs. So I think it is absolutely incredible for us to be discussing this subject as a matter of public importance. The fact of the matter is that Medibank has the been maintained. The Government has maintained 3 basic principles to which it committed trative itself. Firstly, Medibank has been maintained and broadened. Universal health insurance and payabout remains. Everyone will remain covered autoindividual and family matically for full medical care and standard ward treatment in hospital. Pensioners depenopt dent on pensions and those on the lowest trative incomes will pay no levy. Every Austrahan incurred resident is entitled to those benefits unless he voluntarily chooses to take out private cover with a health fund.",48
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEDIBANK,Mr Lucock)Order. The Minister'stimehas expired.,50
145,Dr CASS,MEDIBANK,"The main rationale for the Liberal Government's so-called improvements to the Labor Government's Medibank was to constrain the mounting costs of Medibank. With this simplistic view, which the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) has repeated today, of the cause of mounting health costs, namely the cost of Medibank, the simpleton solutions were obvious for a Liberal Government with its ideological blinkers on-jus t drive people out of Medibank and at the same time impose a tax on those who stay in it; but do not call it a tax, call it a levy. So the Government does not have to find money out of tax revenue to pay for those who are forced out of Medibank; and for those who stay in, the poorer section of the community, they pay for it themselves through the high levy imposed on them. Hey presto! The cost of Medibank, against the usual taxation revenue, that is, has been dramatically reduced and so the cost of a program which was going to bankrupt the country has been curtailed. Who do supporters of the Liberal Government think they are fooling other than themselves? Quite contrary to their claims, the basic cost of health services to the community will be unchanged in that the cost of doctor and hospital charges will be the same. Added to this basic cost is the cost of the administrative system devised to collect the money from the community and to pay it to the providers of the health services. Under the Labor Government's Medibank system the administration was relatively simple. Everyone pays tax, so the collection of funds from the community for all medical refunds under Medibank and to pay the cost of standard ward care in public hospitals required no, or a negligible, additional administrative cost. If additional money was required, all that had to be done was to increase the rate of tax, still with no additional administrative cost. Under the Liberal Government's proposal a separate levy has to be assessed and collected by Taxation Office from those who stay in Medibank. That will require additional adminiscosts. Because there is a ceiling to the levy, choices,people have to make decisions, and hence whether they opt out of the levy the ceiling, depending on their incomes, and whether they for intermediate or private cover with Medibank. This all represents added adminiscosts to them and Medibank, costs not under Labor's Medibank. Under Labor's Medibank those wishing to take out additional insurance for intermediate or private ward accommodauon could do so by simply joining a private fund of their choice. There was no Umitation of that freedom of choice. This represented no addidonal administradve cost for Medibank, which automaticaUy provided the same cover for medical services as wiU now be provided under the new system, and also provided automatic cover for standard ward care. Most of those wanting intermediate or private ward cover, as the Minister has mentioned, were already in private benefit funds. Therefore no additional cost was incurred with the introduction of Medibank, as far as adnunistrative costs to the funds are concerned. Now, with the new Liberal proposals we will have to decide between Medibank and more than 100 private funds. When people choose a private fund they will opt out of Medibank. That means that Medibank will be involved in additional costs in updating its membership Usts. At the same time, the Taxation Office has to be informed of movements from Medibank to private funds and vice versa. This will require additional administrative effort and, hence, additional costs. Initially, the Liberal Government proposed that the funds would have to advise the Taxation Office. The funds complained early and now, as I understand it, the burden is to be imposed on Medibank and the Taxation Office. This increased cost-a n unnecessary administrative cost-wU l make Medibank look less efficient in relation to the funds whereas under our Medibank plan the government service was clearly much more efficient than that offered by private funds. The administrative costs of Medibank were less than 4 per cent. The administrative costs of the private funds were about IS per cent.",50
146,Mr BAILLIEU,MEDIBANK,That is not correct.,51
147,Dr CASS,MEDIBANK,"Some administrative costs were much higher. That is true. I suggest to the honourable member that he read the Nimmo report and the reports presented by the Governsoared ment on the wholefinancingof the private sector. He will see that the administrative costs are per cent. The honourable member should not to himself. None of this takes into account the additional waste of money with the enormous it advertising campaigns now being waged by the proposed now. funds and Medibank Private, aU of which add to the contributors' costs. That means all of us. For Medibank alone, we had the first abortive pamphlet which cost more than $150,000. It had to be withdrawn because it was misleading. Now more than $500,000 is being spent by the have Government in an attempt to explain all changes-withou t pointing out the increased costs, I might add. StiU more government money is being spent in advising people to leave Medibank and join private funds. At the same time Medibank Private spends more pubUc money wooing customers back. To all this must be added the contributors' money being spent by the funds themselves in their advertising endeavours to coax people to join a particular fund. None of this takes into account the loss to the community in the destroyed potential for Medibank to provide the Government with real statistics for thefirsttimeon the state of health services for the whole community. It was the potential for the Medibank computer to provide truly comprehensivefiguresfor the whole of the Australian community which was such a valuable spin-off, as it were, without significant additional administrative costs. It is this information which is vital if any government is to do anything inteUigent about the planning of our future health service needs. AU that is destroyed by the Liberal Government changes to the Labor Medibank scheme. So much for the administrative skUls, wisdom and foresight of the businessman's government-the Liberal Government. FinaUy, I should Uke to deal with the one remaining advantage claimed for the changes to Medibank by the Liberals. The Government claims that the freedom of choice will improve the health services for the community. From what I have said it is clear that there wiU certainly be no improvement but rather the reverse, as far as administrative costs are concerned. How about the basic costs-the cost of doctors' bUls and hospital charges? The changes wiU tend to increase these costs for a number of reasons. Firstly, the potential statistical surveUlance to be provided by the Medibank computer has now been destroyed. Tbis means that in those areas where there were abuses, the abusing doctors or patients will go undetected. I have been told that the incomes of some unscrupulous doctors have to well over $100,000 a year. Such incomes in a profession dependent on personal 15 exertion are impossible without fraud. When the Ue Government destroys the computer it will not detect such abuses. Such abuse was going on and wiU increase, even with the modifications being A possible restraint proffered by the Liberal Government is the fact that if doctors raise thenfees the private funds, which will be carrying the cost of medical refunds-whic h they did not have to carry under the Labor Medibank scheme-wU l to raise their contribution rates. This may the make private insurance too expensive and people will be forced back into Medibank standard. Tbis will mean that doctors will lose their private hospital patients. That is the theory. The argument so put by the Liberals is dishonest, as we have the assurance by the Government that the Medibank levy will be reviewed.",51
148,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,Not the levy.,52
149,Dr CASS,MEDIBANK,The disciplinary effect on the doctors would work only if the Medibank levy remained static. I take it that the Minister for Health did not say that but I am afraid that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) argued that the levy would be reviewed.,52
150,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,He was talking about the ceilings.,52
151,Dr CASS,MEDIBANK,"That is not the way I read his report. The increase in costs would be borne either by the patients themselves having to pay increasing gaps between rebates and bills or the Medibank refund would have to be increased. If the Medibank refund increases that will increase the cost to the general taxation revenue unless the Medibank levy is increased. This the Liberals have promised already to review- a euphemism for 'raise'. Thus patients will not be financially encouraged to return to Medibank. To stop the complaints of people finding that they have ever widening gaps between bills and rebates, the funds and Medibank will simply increase contribution rates. It has no restraining effect on doctors' fees, the real and basic cost of health services. Quite apart from all that, which I think is superficial to the basic argument as far as the Australian community is concerned-the quahty ofhealth care and none of this has anything to do with the quahty of health care-it is only an argument about how the bills are paid. The so-called competition between the various funds has nothing to do with the quality ofhealth care. It is a competition between one fund and another and Medibank and Medibank Private over who will handle the money. That in no way controls the distribution of medical services or their quality.",52
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEDIBANK, than Order! The honourable member's time has there expired.,52
153,Mr CHIPP,MEDIBANK,"I am pleased to support the Government most strongly in this bate and to speak against the comments made by years. the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). I cannot really say with truth that I am speaking from the highest point of objectivity when I support the Government on this measure because the new Medibank scheme is almost identical, if not identical, to the health scheme . which I wrote for the Liberal and National Country parties in May 1974. Therefore, I am obliged to say that it is a fantastic scheme. I say at the outset, picking up a couple of the comments, that this is essentially why I rise today-to identify myself with whatever support I have, from the pubhc and to support the Government very strenuously. I compliment the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). In the face of unbelievable difficulties when he took over this job, he has made a splendid effort in producing a first class scheme. I should also like to place on record the fact that I will not be a trendy or what is now known as fashionable by joining Medibank. It is all very well for people Uke Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and others on a simUar level of salary to be opting for the dearest fund. Being an impoverished backbencher, I will have to shop around and join the fund which is most economic for me and my famUy. As it appears at the moment, that will not be the Medibank private fund but it will in fact be one of the private health funds. One of the quaintest parts of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition- I think it was unbelievable-wa s his berating the private health funds for undercutting Medibank. For the years the private health funds have in fact been the target of the Labor Party. The Labor Party has an obsession about the private health funds. It is a manic obsession. Members of the Labor Party pour out hymns of hatred against the private health funds in the same way and in the same breath as they pour out hatred against the multi-national corporations. The Labor Party does not bother to remind people that the private only health funds are not huge profit making multinational corporations. They are, in fact, cooperatives of millions of ordinary people. If it is a matter of judgment, without going into figures, I am a Uberal because I have this passionate belief that private enterprise can perform functions, generally speaking, cheaper and more efficiently pubUc enterprise. Therefore, I believe that is a place in health insurance-w e are not talking about health care but we are talking about Medibank-for the private sector to use dethe expertise which it has acquired over the The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) I believe-and I do not want to be too rude-wa s blatantly dishonest when he said, speaking about the levy, that the Fraser Government would be taking hundreds of dollars from each taxpayer each year to pay doctors and private hospitals. Of course we will do that, but what in the name of fortune was the Medibank concept under Labor doing? Labor was doing precisely the same thing in the form of taxes. I think it is a very poor poltiical debating pomt for the Leader of the Opposition to try to hoodwink the Austrahan people by saying: 'Now you have to pay for it. Under the Labor Administration you did not have to pay for Medibank'. I believe that the good sense of the Australian people will regard that as a most absurd proposition and will reject it immediately. Quite often I am not terribly proud to be a poUtician because of the way some poUticians behave. I sat here today a bit sickened to hear 2 Labor speakers criticising the Liberal and Country Party Government at the moment for spending half a million dollars on advertising Medibank. Mr King-Who said that?",52
154,Mr CHIPP,MEDIBANK,"The honourable member can name them if he wishes. I do not propose to so. The 2 men who said that, were members of Ministry which spent almost $2m of taxpayers' money in pubUcising their own discredited health scheme. If they wanted to do that, that was fair enough. But after their having it makes me a Utde sick to hear them criticising for doing the same thing at a quarter of the They complained about the changes that have taken place to Medibank. I compUment the Government for not being intractable on this. The Government brought out a scheme amendment to Medibank and then there were strong representations from Mr Hawke and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to change The Government did change it. Is the Governam ment going to be criticised for consultation the trade union movement? That was the reason why the original brochures, whatever they cost, had to be reprinted. If governments continue to consult people hke the ACTU I think that is progressive move and not one to be criticised the Labor Party. In passing I make this point not only Medibank. I am continually pressing that this Parliament be given Green Papers and White Papers to debate rather than having faits its accomplis presented to us, as happened with Medibank. If ever there was a classic case for Green Paper to be presented on a matter and joint select parUamentary committee to invesprogressive tigate it, it was Medibank. I express my disapyears pointment that this was not done. I believe in scheme. I believe it will result in economies health insurance and in health care. I can see nothing wrong with competition. In fact I have been an advocate for competition ever since I have been in the Parhament. The health scheme that I introduced on behalf of the Liberal and Country Party in mid-1974 had in it the proposition that there should be competition between the private health funds and a government health fund. This has worked extraordinarily well in the airline field. Is there anybody here who will deny that Trans-Australia Airlines functions more efficiently and more economically because it has competition from Ansett Airlines of Australia, or vice versa? Not a person in this place would deny that proposition. There might have been a few reactionaries way back. Who would deny that the ANZ Bank and the Bank of New South Wales perform more efficiently and economicaUy because they have the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia to keep them honest and competitive. Is not that what it is all about? That is what Medibank is now. People have a do choice. I believe that the rates announced by a Medibank are honestfigures.There seemed to be a suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition that they were cooked, that they were deliberately inflated so that the private health funds done that could undercut them and thus destroy us Medibank. But as the Minister asked, why are cost. they knocking Medibank? More than SO per cent of the people-million s of pensioners and mUlions of people on low incomes-wU l be served by Medibank. This will give a chance for as an competition to enter this field. I would despair if the health insurance field it. were left to a government monopoly because I vitally interested in social welfare. I have with been pubUcly critical of some of the cutbacks that this Government has made in social welfare because I believe that from humanitarian and cost benefit points of view cutbacks in some areas a are not sound common sense. However, in this by area I completely support the Government's proposal because I believe it will result in economies to the taxpayer, thus aUowing the Government to about enter those other areas of social reform. If Medibank had been aUowed to continue in present form, according to thefiguresI have, it would have devoured about one-tenth of the a total money collected by the Government this a year. That would have pre-empted any kind of social reforms in other areas for to come, as has happened in the United this Kingdom and in other countries. I therefore in commend the Government for what it has done in a most difficult area. I do not believe that the people of Australia would share with the Labor Party its concern about this matter, and I support the Government.",53

156,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK,"With becoming modesty the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) restrained himself to describing fantastic the arrangements on Medibank which have been before the Parhament on several occasions and which are being discussed today. He went on to establish beyond any doubt juscause tification for that on the ground that he had inally proposed them. It seems to me to be a ticularly appropriate description of the quahty proposal before us, especially if it was associated at some early stage with the honourable member for Hotham. I quickly looked up the Concise Oxford Dictionary to make sure my recollection reUable. It gives the meaning of 'fantastic' extravagantly fanciful, capricious, eccentric, tesque, and so on. I do not Uke to relate the ties of the scheme too closely with able member for Hotham, but there it is. We have it right from the horse's mouth, as it want to say one thing before I move on to main observations I wish to make today, and that is that although we on this side of the House consistently disagree with the honourable memapparent-th ber for Hotham, we respect his integrity and didoing rectness with which he puts his case. We also thing. recognise that he is about the only honourable member on the Government side of the House Medibank who knows what he is talking about when says something on this topic. The great tragedy of his poltiical Ufe is that he was sacrificed being honest. He said that there were many occasions when being a politician made him and disgusted. He said that many other unwould pleasant experiences were his lot. I can underof stand why that is so, because being honest in Liberal Party does not pay. Honourable members will remember, as the pubUc does not forget, that in the election paign the now Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm tax Fraser) gave a firm guarantee that Medibank its existing form would be preserved. The honourable member for Hotham, because he is a man of integrity, could not comfortably bear with that deception. He bluntly told the Australian pubUc: 'Return us to office and we wiU dismantle it'. Medibank is being dismantled the honourable member is paying the price for being honest during the course of the election campaign. We on this side of the House are sincerely sorry that this unfortunate experience has faUen to his lot. We rather hope that justice in the of events will see him a Minister again I sincerely trust that the growing number of back bench members of the Liberal Party who are promoting him as a future, and fairly immediate future, Prime Minister of the present Government have some success in the maas noeuvres they are undertaking. The Mmister for Health-o r is it Minister for pedestrian affairs; I cannot quite recoUect beI am confused as between his description origand his performance-Uke s to refer to Medibank parMark 1 and Medibank Mark 2 as though there is of some sort of progress. It is Uke proceeding from a modern Umousine to a clapped-out model T Ford. We are going back in time. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) is a man born well after his time. He wants to take us back to the discredited system of private health insurance. He and his was Government want to do deals with the Ausas traUan Medical Association. Most important of groaU, what they are reaUy about is the deceitful quaU-concealment of nothing more than a substantial the honourincrease in personal taxation. were. I The honourable member for Hotham tried to the suggest that because the Labor Government paid for Medibank out of general revenue-w e certainly did; we confessed it openly; it was quite e present Government is justified in the same thing. But it is not doing the same It is not reducing taxes in any way at all. It is substantially increasing taxes, and the levy is, in fact, a Medibank tax. It is a he special, earmarked tax which has been introduced for several reasons-as part of the for Government's fiscal phUosophy, as an effort to get around wage and tax indexation and as a ill device to avoid paying the fuU obUgation it otherwise have to discharge to the States a proportion of aU tax revenue raised in this the country. We can reasonably expect, as time goes by, that there will be more of these special, earmarked taxes masquerading under various descriptions which will be excluded from divvying up with the States under the so-caUed new camFederal financial arrangements. The Medibank represents a hike of about 9 per cent in perin sonal taxation for the average income earner.",54
157,Mr BAILLIEU,MEDIBANK,Would you explain that to us?,54
158,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK,"It is a very simple piece of arithmetic I will sit down with you and do it on a and piece of paper. I promise to use monosyUables for you and even to say words 3 times to help it seep in. It helps to explain why, although the Government is projecting, comparatively, only a 12 per cent increase in average weekly earnings and at most a 2 per cent increase in the work force, there will be an increase of at least 25 per cent in net pay-as-you-earn income tax collections. That is the highest rate of increase in revenue collections from personal income tax in my memory. This is the Government that said it would put money back in people's pockets. This is the Government that even now, in the Budget Speech, is stating that its aim is to give people more command or more control over the money that goes into their pockets. They have less control than ever before. More will go in taxes. There will be less available for discretionary, disposable income purposes. Almost everyone will be worse off as a result of the Medibank levy and the so-called innovations in child endowment. By and large, the innovations in child endowment reach relatively few people. They represent nothing more than a sideways shuffle of a rebate system that the Labor Government introduced. On top of this, the imposition of the Medibank tax means that almost everybody will be worse off as a result of the Government's proposal. This tax will have undesirable economic effects. Not only will it provoke industrial unrest in the community as wage and salary earners realise how their disposable income has been substantially reduced week by week from 1 October as a result of the special tax for Medibank being imposed on them, but also trade unions will try to offset its effect on ing standards of their members. In the case of the celling amount of $300 a year- a contribution of nearly $6 a week-this will represent the unions seeking an increase in wages of about $9 a week which will be required before tax to offset the effect of the Medibank levy. It will contract consumer demand because it will reduce the amount of money that people have available to buy goods. This is not good news for business at present. It will aggravate inflationary pressures. The consumer price index in the December quarter will go up by about 4 per cent as a direct result of the emasculation of Medibank and the increases in other health service charges for which the Government has been responsible. The Government says that it is a government that aims to reduce the cost of Uving for people, to put more money back into their pockets and to reduce the government charges that the public has had to bear. The Government will be nearly $900m better off in a full year as a result of the brutahty it has directed against the Medibank program. If it is to be nearly $900m a year better off, someone will be worse off, and we do not have to be very clever to guess who will be worse off. The someones who will have to meet that $900m wdl be the wage and salary earners in the community. I find it quite unacceptable that the proposal is not only the restoration of the quite unsatisfactory and totally discredited system of private health insurance, but also that as part and parcel of the resurrection of that unsatisfactory system a $65m subsidy- a generous transfusion of Uquid gold into the hardened arteries of the discredited private health insurance system-wil l start off the system. We will be back on the old roundabout that we were on before where the taxpayers must bear greater and greater burdens to support an increasingly inefficient and unsatisfactory system. What we are really debating, more than anything else, is the credibUity of the Government. To gain office, the Government made many promises. Among the many promises it made was a firm guarantee to preserve Medibank and reduce the costs that the pubhc has to bear. It has dishonoured both those promises.",54
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEDIBANK,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,55
160,Mr LLOYD,MEDIBANK,"It says little for the standard of debate by the Opposition that the closing speaker has to re-state the subject. Before I do so, I suggest that in any future debates on Medibank the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. the livG. Whidam) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) get together beforehand and sort out the level of levy they want and how they wouldfinanceMedibank if they were in power. To re-state the subject, it is the Government's failure to maintain Medibank. What is Medibank? Medibank is universal health insurance. It provides 3 basic things. One is universal cover, the second is automatic cover, and the third is no means test at point of entry to the health care system. Medibank overcomes the previous problems that older schemes had of not being completely universal, of time lags for entitlements and so forth. AU of the 3 principles have been retained under the revised Medibank scheme. It is umversal. Everyone must belong, either to Medibank or to a private health insurance fund for hospital and medical benefits. That is checked out through the tax system. It is automatic. If a person does not belong to a private fund he is automaticaUy covered or must be covered by Medibank through the tax system. Whether he pays a levy depends on his income level. Many people who belong to Medibank will not pay the levy. I refer to pensioners and people with taxable incomes, on a family basis, of up to $4,300. That is Medibank. All of us agree that those things should remain. We have maintained Medibank. Not only have we maintained it, we have maintained the Health Insurance Commission, its officers, its agent and its computer. Furthermore, all sides agree on the need for a levy. Even the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions and the real leader of the debate against the Government in this matter, Mr Hawke, agree that there should be a levy. One suspects that the rather hurried introduction of this matter of pubhc importance today, which has fallen natter than any pancake I could ever cook, was brought about by the need for the parhamentary Party to regain some of the ground which was lost because of what Mr Hawke was doing during the parliamentary recess. Mr King-He is the real leader of the Labor Party.",55
161,Mr LLOYD,MEDIBANK,"He is the real leader, I think. The real debate on Medibank is actually on the degree or the percentage of the private and the pubhc shares of the medical and hospital sector, the freedom of choice available to patients, the level of the levy, the cost containment procedures, the correction of anomalies evident in the original scheme and the updating of cost and other procedures due to the passage oftime.Any other argument that the Opposition puts forward, other than these degrees of pubhc and private and so forth, is an emotional rather than a factual argument and is hiding the basic situation that Medibank has been maintained. To indicate that this is not a biased or narrow view I want to quote from the summarised Press release of the Austrahan Hospitals Association, a body recognised by all sides as being independent. Its chairman is Mr Royce Kronborg, who is recognised by both sides as neutral in this matter. This is what the Association says: The Australian Hospitals Association applauds the Government's attempt to come to grips with the alarming rise in health costs by challenging the providers ofhealth vices to play the major role in this vital area. Failure will inevitably result in diminution of the private sector ponent and increased government involvement. Such tives are long overdue and would have been necessary irrespective of the introduction of Medibank. The changes to Medibank will have the following effects: 1. Preserve the concept of universal health insurance. 2. Attempt to distribute the costs of health care between those unable to pay and those able to pay. 3. By introducing a levy promote public awareness health care costs. 4. Introduce means to promote cost containment removal of the open ended financing arrangements. 5. Share administrative responsibilities of running insurance between the public and private sectors. 6. Allow charges to privately insured pauents for diagnostic services in hospitals. That is the independent affirmation of the point we make. It makes a farce of this debate initiated by the Opposition. Medibank in those 3 basic aspects has been maintained, and I believe we have improved it in several ways. I deal first with the pubhc versus private share of health care. The previous Medibank, by its bias against the private sector, particularly reUgious and other charitable hospitals, sought to change the balance permanently. This was contrary to the will of the Australian people, 70 per cent of whom maintained private health insurance and showed their confidence in the private health funds. The previous Medibank increased pressure on pubUc beds to the detriment of pensioners and low income earners. It would have required over a period a massive injection of scarce capital into the construction of additional public hospital beds when private hospitals, religious hospitals, were closing when they had beds avaUable. The second improvement is in the freedom of choice. This is connected with the argument on public versus private share of the health care system. The revised Medibank of this Government provides people with a far more adequate freedom of choice than was previously so. There is Medibank itself, there is Medibank plus hospital cover, and there is complete private health insurance. This is a simple and adequate freedom of choice and is essential for the continuation of the private patient and doctor relationship which is desired by the vast majority of Australians. One of the worse features of Labor's version of Medibank was that it aUowed open-ended cost escalation. The new version of Medibank, or Medibank Mark II, as the minister called it, will cost $800m less than the original would have cost this year. The actual cost in the Budget papers is $407m more than last year. So if the seroriginal Medibank had continued, the cost to the to do soAustralian taxpayer would have been frightencoming. One can criticise the present Medibank for a mitiapreoccupation, simUar to that of the original Medibank, with trying tofita health delivery system around a set of health insurance arrangements. What I believe we reaUy should be doing is deciding what type of health care arrangeequitably ments we really want and buUding the payment of system around that. However, the new Medibank breaks new ground in that for the first and the time cost containment, competition and accountabUity are to become part of the system. health Medibank Private wiU be in competition with private funds. Accreditation and peer review systems will operate. These were opposed rather than supported by the private health funds and the Australian Medical Association, but at least to its credit the AMA is now to go along with them. Hopefully health maintenance organisations will be introduced as experiments in alternative delivery systems. Surely Labor cannot oppose the cost containment and review systems which are now part of the new Medibank. It is important that all Australians, as taxpayers, health care consumers or health care providers, be made aware of the true cost ofhealth care services either as contributors to a private health fund, as payers of a levy or payers in a disguised way-in the past it was disguised-throug h the ordinary tax system. Even with the 2.5 per cent levy there is stiU a large element of government subsidy involved. Where that subsidy is to provide cover for pensioners and low income earners to receive a complete range of services, there is no criticism. I return to the basic point of this debate. What is Medibank? Medibank is universal health insurance. Medibank remains. It is automatic; it is universal; it isfreeofa means test at the point of entry, so why the fuss by the Opposition? I suggest that if the Opposition wants to reassert itself over the leader of the ACTU as the genuine Opposition to this Government, it will have to do better in future.",56

163,Mr SINCLAIR,TIME LIMITS FOR SPEECHES," I move: (1) That, in lieu of the order 91 for speeches on the 'Motion for adjournment of House to terminate die sitting-' , the following time limit shall operate: 'Each Member . . . . 5 minutes (no extension of time to be granted): Provided that, if no other Memberrisesto address the House, a Member who has already spoken to the motion may speak a second time for a period not exceeding 5 minutes'. (2) That, unless otherwise shall operate for the remainder of this year. The motion is essentially a repetition of that which was moved during the last session of this Parliament, that is, a motion which reduces from 10 minutes to 5 minutes the time avaUable for honourable members during the adjournment sition debate. During the early stages when this proon cedure was on trial there is no doubt the system did not seem to work too well, but it was my impression that in the latter part of the trial it was working much better. However, rather than seeking to change Standing Orders at this time, I think it is preferable that we give the 5 minute adjournment speech a further trial. Therefore I put the matter forward in this form. The House will operate in accordance with the motion for the remainder of 1976. I think that should give us any amount of opportunity to examine the proposition in practice and then, if thought lit, the Standing Orders Committee may decide to change the Standing Orders accordingly. I commend the motion to the Parliament.",57

165,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT OF SITTINGS," I move: (1) That, in lieu of the final proviso to the sessional order of 18 February 1976 relating to the adjournment of sittings, the following proviso be substituted: 'Provided further that, if at 11 p.m. the question before the House isThat the House do now adjourn-The Speaker shall interrupt the debate, at which time(0 a Minister may require that the debate be extended until 11.10 p.m. to enable Ministers to speak in reply to matters raised in the preceding adjournment debate; at 11.10 p.m., or upon the earlier cessation of the debate, the Speaker shall forthwith adjourn the House until the time of its next meeting. (g) if no acuon is taken by a Minister under paragraph (0, the Speaker shall fonhwith adjourn the House until the time of its next meeting.' (2) That, unless otherwise ordered, this amendment of the order of 18 February 1976 shall operate for the remainder of this year. time limit specified in standing As honourable members will recall, the sessional order of 18 February 1976 gave a Minister an opportunity to speak up to a maximum of 10 minutes after the normal conclusion of the adjournment debate at 11 p.m. It was used on very few occasions during the trial period. This proposal means that private members are able to speak on the adjournment rather than their time being taken up by a Minister. I believe the pracordered, this sessional order tice was not abused and so I commend the motion and another trial period until the end of this year.",57
166,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT OF SITTINGS,"The Opposition does not oppose this provision. However, I draw attention again to the fact that the Oppowould like written into the proposal a Umit the Minister's right of reply restricting him to matters raised during the adjournment debate, which fall within his ministerial responsibUity. term The right of reply by a Minister has not been used greatly, but I feel that under pressure of debate on future occasions a Minister may choose to enter into a political debate rather than use the time for the purpose for which it is obviously allocated, that is, to answer as Minister, questions raised on matters within his ministerial competence. I have raised this question before.",57
167,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT OF SITTINGS,The motion contains the phrase 'Ministers to speak in reply to matters raised in the preceding adjournment debate'.,58
168,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT OF SITTINGS,I hope that could be narrowly interpreted. I think it would be broadly interpreted. Any special provision giving a Minister the right of reply should limit his reply to matters within his competence. It should not be a general provision enabling him to talk at a time when honourable members would not have the right to speak even iftimepermitted.,58
169,Mr CHIPP,ADJOURNMENT OF SITTINGS,"I will certainly support the motion at this stage but I am very jealous of the Austrahan Labor Party's achievement in adjourning this House at 11 o'clock at night. For years we sat here until midnight or 1 o'clock in the morning. This motion extends the sitting by only 10 minutes but it is the thin end the wedge. The procedure has worked reasonably well up to this point and we are now voting simply to continue it for the rest of 1976.1 would need greater persuasion if it is proposed to change Standing Orders permanently in this regard. I think that this House meets at hideous, unnatural and ridiculous hours. They are absurd. Politicians in this place are almost unable to mix with the Canberra community, the diplomatic corps and the pubhc servants or to lead that sort of life. I would need to be persuaded fairly strongly before I would vote for a permanent change to Standing Orders in any funher extension to the 11 o 'clock adjournment. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 20 May, on motion by Mr Eric Robinson: That the Bill be now read a second rime.",58
170,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Oppoing sition is not opposing this Bill although I underwill stand that some technical amendments will be moved in the Committee stage and we will be asking the Minister for Post and Telecommunithat cations (Mr Eric Robinson) to explain them more detail. The Bill covers 2 separate proposals; the first is to place total limitations on the advertising of cigarettes; the other is to permit the establishment of translator stations in areas where broadcasting and television stations would not normally be expected to operate economically. I think that both these matters had been set in train by the former Government. On the question of the banning of specific types of advenising, it is not unreasonable to say that even though both parties are agreed and have been agreed for some considerabletimeon this matter it constitutes a peculiar set of circumstances in that we are banning one specific type of advertising- I do not quarrel with that and neither does the Opposition-withou t even examining the effects of other similar forms of advertising which currently take place. Some rather insidious advertising takes place, especially on television, in regard to certain types of analgesics and some forms of alcoholic beverages, by which people are clearly given to believe that it is something less than normal not to utilise those substances as part of their daily lives. We have all probably seen one advertisement which goes along the lines of'Let's go in and have a certain brand of powder and a cup of tea', as if it of is part of a way of life when in fact it is advertising a dangerous product. Some of the alcohol advertisements almost put forward the proposition that one cannot enjoy oneself and that people are less than normal if they do not partake of certain forms of beverage. There are other advertisements in the same areas which are quite acceptable. I only make the point that we should wonder at the fact that we are deaUng with one specific type of advertising, to the total exclusion of other sinular forms of advertising. I believe that a set of legislative standards should be set-especiaU y for televisionfor advertising so that both the advertisers and the pubUc know exactly where they stand. At the moment no such standards appear to exist although one can complain about the authenticity or honesty of an advertisement. Some advertisements are of a type that one would not expect tofindin one's lounge room. Second Reading The other proposal in this legislation relates to translator stations and provides the means by which some of the facihties avaUable in the more populated areas will be avaUable to persons Uvin remote and semi-remote areas and thus improve the standard of Ufe of those people. The Opposition supports that proposal. I do not want to pre-empt the Minister but I understand there are some drafting problems in the Bill in which will be dealt with in Committee. The Opposition does not disagree with the concept of the changes which the Minister has put forward but it will obviously want to look at the amendments in their entirety. The Opposidon will put forward any alterations which it thinks should be made to those amendments when the Bill is dealt with in another place and members have had proper time to examine those amendments. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill and hopes that its passage wiU have the sort of effect which the legislation is designed to have. But in the Ught of experience in other countries I have very grave doubts that the banning of cigarette advertising wiU cause great difficulties in view of the ingenuity of the advertising firms which handle those rather large accounts. I do not know whether it is possible under this Bill but in the United States of America other products were given simUar names. Massive advertising campaigns then took place for products with names similar to cigarettes-in most cases tobacco-so the advertising continued and only a device was used to avoid actually naming cigarettes as the product being advertised. The other method used is quite obvious to anybody who watches television programs. Advertising signs are placed at rather prominent places at sporting arenas and at functions so that the advertising is conveyed in a passive rather than a direct manner. This is a means by which the bans will be overcome. As I have said, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. I repeat that, for consistency if for ing else, an examination ought to be made of some of the other forms of advertising which are potentially equaUy harmful. If we are to ban advertising on the basis that it is harmful or injurious to human health or constitutes a threat to society then we should be consistent about it, not select one product and go away wearing a halo, beUeving that we have done something greater than we have done, whilst ignoring other equaUy potent problems.",58
171,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1976 refers to the areas of advertising of tobacco and cigarettes on television, the Ucensing of translator stations, community aerial systems for television and allowing the Ucensing of radio and television broadcasting translator stations. The decision to ban cigarette and tobacco advertising from radio and television stations goes back to 1973. It was planned that the phasing out of this type of advertising should be taken over a 3-year period to enable stations to develop alternative sources of revenue. Although the stations have had 3 years to look at this situation, all is certainly not rosy within the industry. I look especiaUy to the situation with regard to country radio and television stations. The decision to ban tobacco and cigarette advertising from radio and television will put a considerable strain on the television stations and the radio stations in the country. Meanwhile, it is true that television stations in the capital cities are undergoing somewhat of a boom in regard to advertising revenue. Most of the capital city television stations certainly have made provision to take up the slack caused by this dropout of radio and television cigarette advertising. We can argue loud and long as to whether the banning of cigarette and tobacco advertising from radio and television will have any appreciable eifect on the consumption of cigarettes in Australia. Medical evidence shows that 90 per cent of lung cancer cases causing 4000 deaths a year can be directly related to cigarette smoking. However, from figures I have been able to gain, it would seem that there has been very litde appreciable difference in the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco products in countries such as the United States and Great Britain where the advertising of cigarettes and tobacco has been banned for some years. I took the opportumty to obtain some figures from the Parliamentary Library which show the per capita consumption of tobacco and tobacco products in the United States and the United Kingdom over the last 10 years. In the United noth- States in 1970, the per capita consumption of tobacco and tobacco products was 4.40 kilograms. In 1974 it was 4.25 kuograms. In the United Kingdom in 1970 the per capita consumption was 2.55 kilograms and in 1974 it was 2.71 kUograms. They are interesting figures. I think that the drop in per capita consumption in the United States probably could be more directly related to the anti-smoking campaign than to the eUmination of cigarette and tobacco advertising from radio and television stations. The interesting comparison is the position in the Union of Soviet Socialist RepubUcs where there have been massive increases in the consumption of tobacco products during the last few years. Of course there is no advenising in the USSR; so maybe we have more of a social problem than an advertising problem. It is rather discriminatory, I think, that we particularly single out radio and television stations. If we are to be realistic about the whole business of cigarette advertising surely we should be looking a little funher than just banning such advertising on radio and television. Under the terms of these amendments to the Bill we will still have the situation of cigarettes being advertised on billboards around sporting grounds. It will be possible for cigarette companies to advertise their products through sponsorships of programs of sorting events, cultural activities and other areas where the Commonwealth does not have any real control. Admittedly it has been agreed that the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) will pursue with the State Health Ministers proposals to work towards uniform legislation to control cigarette advertising in areas where the Commonwealth does not have these powers of control. However, it seems to me that there will be very Uttle difference in the forms of cigarette advertising from those which are already in existence. If we are to be realistic in controlling this advertising, then we should be looking to the other areas. I do not think we will ever reaUy see the day when cigarette advertising is eliminated from newspapers, magazines or roadside bUlboards, or indeed from those sponsorships I previously mentioned. In this respect, this part of the legislation could be considered somewhat discriminatory. I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in regard to the advertising of certain products, especially on television. I remind him that some rather strict controls have been laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Australian Association of National Advertisers and the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations in regard to the content of advertisements that are shown on television stations. One would hope that all those bodies would be showing a very real responsibUity in making sure that the advertising did comply with a standard that was acceptable to the general community. As I said earlier, there are some very great struggles to survive amongst the radio and television stations in country areas at the moment. The second section of the changes in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1976 wiU help this situation because it is this part of the Bill that provides for changes concerning the Ucensing of television and radio translator stations and the community television aerial systems. This is a far-reaching part of the Bill. These new provisions will help to give Australia a much wider coverage and a much better coverage and, as far as commercial stations are concerned, a much more economic situation than existed previously. It is a fact that commercial television especially is a vital link in our national communications system. It plays a most important role. This is confirmed by the tremendous audiences that commercial television stations receive night after night. It is interesting to go back through the history of the radio and television industry in Australia. From its very early beginnings until the early 1970s it developed and prospered into one of the finest broadcasting systems in the world. I suppose that government policy in those days could be considered as one of benign neglect. But that benign neglect did have a purpose in that it buUt up a most viable and enterprising commercial radio and television system and a national system of which we can be quite proud. However, one of the big criticisms that can be made-this can be levelled, too, at the Australian Broadcasting Control Board-is that over the years there has been this lack of planning in respect of technical specifications especially in the radio and television industry. In many areas there are still some very real problems with regard to good radio and television reception. In regard to television, I think of a situation that exists in my own State of Queensland. I refer to areas such as the Gold Coast where there are problems of reception from the local stations based in Brisbane. At the moment, probably the best television reception that Gold Coast residents can get is from a station based on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It provides a news service that emanates from Sydney and local areas. This is not to say that the Brisbane stations are missed completely by the Gold Coast but there are some particularly bad areas, especially in some of the major populated areas such as those around Burleigh Heads, where it is virtually impossible to get the local signal from a Brisbane station. It seems to me rather ironic that these people could be watching programs emanating from Sydney or from the middle of New South Wales rather than from Brisbane. Over the last few years there have been big moves afoot to pressure the Government into making provision for a decent television signal to be beamed into the Gold Coast from Brisbane. SimUar situations exist in other areas of Australia. The provisions of the new Bill will make it possible for repeater stations to be estabUshed in community of interest areas as well as in areas of difficult television reception. Not only country centres will be affected by the new provisions relating to community of interest. Indeed, in some of our capital cities there are problem areas for television reception. There are some bad reception areas in Sydney and in parts of Adelaide as well as Melbourne. It will be possible now for the signals into these problem areas to be vastly improved to provide the people of those capital cities with A1 quahty television reception. The situation with regard to radio will be vasdy improved as well. As I said earher, over the past few years, many country radio stations have been experiencing great difficulties, so much so that in 1974-75 some thirty-four of Australia's 118 commercial radio stations failed to make a profit. It is a very sad situation indeed when licensees of some country radio stations come back to the Government with their hcence in their hands and say: 'Please take this from we cannot make a profit'. That has the situation over the past few years. These amendments will help to rectify that too. The big advantage that country commercial radio stathe tions have over our national broadcasting system is that they can provide services of a local nature to the far flung areas. That is why in a country such as Austraha it is essential that every ance possible be given to the country radio stations to ensure their survival. The new provisions will make it possible for repeater stations to be attached to country netthis, works, to provide local service and local inforto mation in the far flung areas. They will also in opening up new audiences for these remote stations which will provide a more viable adveryear tising market for the stations. Probably in the distant future we will be able to put up a comamount munications satelUte over this nation and this satelUte we will be in a length and breadth of Australia radio and television signals of high quality. This would be of great advantage to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In the long run it could be a major cost saving factor as well, but we will never get this situation as far as country radio stations concerned. They are there to provide that local service and that is really what the provisions this Bill are all about-to make sure that the local service is viable and can be heard by the people in our far flung areas. The same, of course, can be said of the ments to the Bill concerning the community more antenna systems whereby it will be possible to license major reception facUities and to feed these facilities by means of a cable into homes which reception is difficult. I understand that system such as this has been undergoing some years now in parts of Adelaide. Australia, because of its very nature, because of its remote and far flung population, relies to a very great degree on an effective, efficient communications system and these new provisions will provide tion such a system. I would Uke to make a further point as regards country repeater stations or translator stations for radio. As I have mentioned, country radio stations do provide a great local service which is of interest to people in these farflungcommunities. The people in these communities are also subjected to some quite serious situations from time to time. I think of floods and bushfires especially. There should be provision in the Act to enable these new repeater facUities in times of crisis in a given area actually to go on the air from the transmitter in a purely local capacity to us; provide vital and often lifesaving communialmost been cations and information. Another problem thattiesin with this aspect of broadcasting industry in Australia has been in existence for many years now. It is the incredibly high land line costs. People in country areas look to their radio not only for local information assistbut also as a source of entertainment and a source of information about what is happening in the major capital cities. In the far flung parts of Western Queensland the broadcasting of racing services on Saturdays is a very real example of yet the cost of land lines to bring this service the stations, to my mind, is really quite ludiassist crous. A station in Western Queensland, for example, would have to pay $5,000 to $6,000 a in land line charges just to broadcast a racnot ing service on a Saturday afternoon. On the of revenue that is avaUable to these stafrom tions the impact of these high charges is position to beam the frightening. The new provisions in this Bill are certainly going to be very welcome indeed to the Ucensees of Australian country, and in some cases provincial, radio and television stations. I am sure that are many honourable members are eager to see just what evolves out of the present departmental of inquiry into the electronic media in Australia. One would hope that the results of this inquiry will assist the Government in taking a decision on assistance to the commercial radio and television industry, the ABC and pubUc and access amendbroadcasting, to enable them to become much efficient and viable enterprises than possibly they have been in previous years. I welcome these amendments to the Broadcasting and Telein vision Act. To my mind they are long overdue a and they should be welcomed by virtuaUy all trials for areas of this vital industry.",59
172,Dr KLUGMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I would just Uke to address my remarks very briefly to clause 4 of the Bill which deals with the prevenof the advertising of cigarettes and tobacco. Whilst in my own mind I have philosophical reservations, firstly about whether one is ever entitled to prevent that sort of advertising, and secondly about the efficacy of the prevention of that sort of advertising, I certainly am not going to oppose clause 4 of the Bill. But it seems much more rational to me-and I hope to other members of this House-that the way to persuade people not to use tobacco, not to smoke, or not to do any of the things which a community as a whole feels should not be done, is not by prohibition or by prohibiting the mentioning of them on radio, television, or in other media but by active education, propaganda and advertising against these things. My own view is that it would be much more reasonable and rational and effective to force radio and television stations to use at least part or all of the revenue they receive from advertising tobacco for the purposes of exposing the ill effects of smoking and possibly other things. It was quite depressing for me when I saw, for example, in Appropriation Bill No. (1) which was introduced last night that no more money would be spent by this Government on anti-smoking campaigns. I am not an expert on those campaigns but the name that comes to my mind is Dr Nigel Gray of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria who has done a terrific job. To my mind the Council has spent the money efficiently. It received a lot of free pubhcity for its campaign because it has been a good and effective campaign. It is a great pity that the Government feels that it should no longer subsidise anti-smoking campaigns. I will return to this topic when we are actually discussing Appropriation Bill (No. 1). In the second reading of the speech the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) said: It has also been decided to amend clause provision to ban the advertising of cigarettes or cigarette tobacco on broadcasting and television because the Bill as previously drafted may not have made it possible for anticigarette advertising to be broadcast or televised if considered desirable to do so. My own view is that it is desirable to do so. I therefore support the amendments which have been introduced. I ask the Minister to draw to the attention of the appropriate Ministers in the Cabinet what to my mind is a contradiction or at least something which is being left in mid-air. We decided as a parUament that smoking tobacco is bad. I suppose we must think it very strongly and we must think it is evU otherwise we would not go to what to me is the extreme step of saying that you cannot advertise it any longer or that you cannot mention it on television and radio. Having said that we wash our hands and do not do anything more about it. We are not even going to spend $75,000 which was the amount spent last year to educate people as to why they should not smoke. It does not seem right to me. I would hope that as a result of my mentioning this in the House today it may be drawn to the attention of the appropriate Ministers to see whether they can persuade the Cabinet that if a point is important enough to lead to banning-whic h should be the very last step in a democratic society-the n there must be some intermediate or additional point where rational arguments are used to try to prevent people from doing certain things which are considered to be wrong either in their own interests or in the interests of the society.",61
173,Mr WILSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I rise to speak in this debate to deal with one particular aspect which was touched upon by my colleague earlier. I refer to cable television. The Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill proposes an amendment to the principal Act to enable the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to licence television translator stations. The proposed amendment does not go far enough. It is totally inadequate, and its inadequacy is a clear Ulustration of the inadequate efforts of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in deaUng with the whole policy relating to broadcasting and television. We are told in the second reading speech that the purpose of this amendment is to enable translator stations to be licensed in areas that now receive television signals but which receive those signals from a community different from that in which they live. The Ulustration is given of people who live in Mount Gambier or people who Uve east of the South Australian border who would prefer to receive signals from Melbourne rather than from Mount Gambier because the signals from Mount Gambier contain a South 4 in respect of the Australian community interest. Under this amending Bill we are planning to it was give the Board power to hcence these translator stations to provide an added service to people who already have a service. Under this Bill we are thinking of putting in translator stations and expecting the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Telecom Australia, with their funds, to give resources to remote communities. Yet we have in the midst of our cities remote communities-communitie s which, because of the humbug and bumbling of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, have no television signals or inadequate television signals available to them. In fact, in metropolitan Adelaide there are a number of people today who are unable to get signals at all-o r if they can get them the signals are inadequate. Some 500 or 600 households depend on cable television-communit y antenna television services. But the licensees of these services have been making losses. They have sought over the years to expand their services in order to make the operation vivision, able. But what has happened? They went to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, but bumbled around and referred them to Telecom. Telecom then looked at the matter. It does not have the resources to do anything, and the paper war went on. Telecom referred the matter to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The result is that an elector of mine for years been writing, firsdy, to the cable provider who says that he cannot provide the service secondly, to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board who says: 'It is not us; it is Telecom'. Telecom then says: 'It is not us; it is the Australian Broadcasting Control Board'. During of this time that citizen has no television service. Later this year, because of the inefficiencies the Board, SOO households in Adelaide wiU cease to have access to television services, because provider has announced that it will not renew its Ucence. That provider went to the Board and asked that it be enabled to make its operation more efficient. It asked whether it could be a guarantee of future operation. But, no, we look at a report. Reports are always being made in Australian Broadcasting Control Board area. If wants to put off considering a matter, it has report. The report says that the Government should take it over. Yet the same reportTelecom 2000, which is the latest one-say s that Telecom will not have the resources. Yet private enterprise has demonstrated that it has the resources, and it has put in the network. Now there is no pohcy, and the reason we have no icy is the inadequacy of the Board to which I have referred.",62
174,Unknown,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,63
175,Mr WILSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Before the sitting was suswhich pended I was speaking on the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill. I remind the that this Bill has 2 major aspects. Thefirstseeks to implement the Government's decision to ensure that cigarette advertising on the electronic media is banned from a Utde later this year, and support that proposal. But it was the second aspect of the legislation to which I was drawing attention. I said- I believe this to be the casethe that the proposals before this House are inadstances equate. The inadequacy of the proposals has demonstrated the inabUity of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to come up with an that acceptable poUcy with regard to television and radio Ucensing. Attention has been drawn in various reports to the fact that there are many people in our capital cities who as a consequence of the physical features of those cities do not receive radiated teleor if they receive it the signal they receive is totaUy inadequate compared with the best sigit nals in other areas. The Control Board was aware of this difficulty as far back as 1968. But throughout that period there has been a constant battle- a battle of bureaucracies-ove r this issue, back with the Control Board passing the buck to Telecom and Telecom passing the buck back to has the Control Board, the consequence being that the only loser has been the citizen, the person and then, who would Uke to receive television. The Government in this legislation says that it aU is doing wonders for people hving in remote areas because it is going to permit the Control of Board to authorise the establishment of more translator stauons. It is going to enable people the living in western Victoria to receive through translator stations signals out of Victorian television stations. But these people already receive television signals out of the stations in Mount given Gambier. They already have the pleasure and benefit of receiving information that comes over the the television media. But there are many people it in my electorate in metropoUtan Adelaide-fro m a Tea Tree GuUy to Darlington and right around the foothills-wh o are unable to receive a television signal. It was suggested by the Board a number of years ago that community aerial television systems, known as CATV systems, should be estabUshed to enable these people to have the benefit of television. Those systems were estabpollished. But one of the problems that confronted the operators of those systems was that they were permitted to transmit down the cable only those signals radiated by the television stations. The operator of the cable television system could not offer any extra for the additional licence fee was formally charged and the only Ucence fee that is now charged to those people receiving House their television signal in this way. I have urged the Minister for Post and TeleI communications (Mr Eric Robinson) I again ask him to consider this-to expand the legislation now before us so that it is not merely limited to provision of translator services in circumwhere the community of interest demands that people have a signal other than that received from the normal radiated stations but in the case of cable television the Board is allowed to have a discretion to consider applications and to recommend, where it believes this proper, that the operator be able to send alternative and additional programs. As a demonstration of its inadequacies, short sightedness, conservatism and lack of pohcy the Board, I understand, refuses to accept the responsibihty of considering such recommendations. Why does it refuse? Can it not see that as a consequence of its total inadequacy in this area many people are not receiving television signals, and many who now receive signals in metropoUtan Adelaide will no longer receive them from later this year. Cablevision, one of the operators, has found it so difficult to get any idea about the future of its cable system from the Broadcasting Control Board or Telecom that it has indicated that it will not renew its licence. Thus a large number of people in the Adelaide suburbs will have thentelevision reception cut drastically in the near future. Some households will receive no signal whUe others will not receive all the channels or will have very poor reception. As I mentioned, there are more than 5000 homes from Tea Tree Gully to Darlington which cannot receive a totaUy satisfactory level of vision reception. Tb overcome this problem a number of people in the worse hit areas have subscribed over a number of years to companies providing television reception by means of cables which run from a large aerial in a good ception area to the homes affected. The CATV system has been established in a number of countries and has been a proven success. Yet its development in Australia is being hampered by lack of initiative on the part of Telecom and the Control Board. The fact that Cablevision is not renewing its cence places fairly and squarely before Telecom and the Control Board the challenge of doing something about this problem. Provision for a translator station was made when the Telecom buUding was constructed in Adelaide. Tbis fact has been kept pretty quiet whilst the commercial operator has been led along to the point where he has been losing $16,000 to $20,000 a year. Yet Telecom and the Control Board expects the operator to continue. Now I am told in following representations that the Control Board has asked Telecom whether it will take over the operation of the system. I am told that Telecom is thinking about it; that it is investigating it. Telecom has been investigating this matter for more than a decade, and it is time that its investigations ended and that there was some action. It may be that the Control Board should proceed immediately to recommend to the Minister, and the Minister should announce, that a translator wiU be established on one of the tall buUdings in metropoUtan Adelaide. This would provide over 10 000 homes in the Adelaide foothills with a television signal of better quaUty or a television signal for the firsttime.The problem in Adelaide is mirrored in Sydney and in other major population centres. Action should be urgently taken in this matter. If the Control Board is unwilUng to allow cable television to develop in a viable fashion it must be wUUng to enable translator stations to be estabUshed, and the establishment of those translator stations should not be left to the whim of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. If Adelaide's commercial television stations are prepared to invest the $30,000 to $50,000 necessary to establish a translator station, they should be allowed to proceed forthwith. Telecom should be required to make the stand for the translator station immediately available. The Broadcasting Control Board over the years has set its face against the development of cable television. Canberra could have been a cable city and if it had been many believe we would not telehave that expensive monstrosity on Black Mountain. With the new technologies that are avaUable it would have been possible, with appropriate investment, to ensure that adequate television signals could be delivered to households in re- this city in a more efficient and more effective fashion than by using the radiated system. Likewise, in the foothills of metropolitan Adelaide the people of their own initiative, through private enterprise- a private operatorwould have had television available to them. But the humbug that I referred to before the suspenUsion of the sitting for dinner that has existed within the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has resulted in that company and others firstly being unable to extend the operation of their networks to the full Ucensed area and secondly to develop an adequately viable service. What I have urged upon the Minister- I hope that in the remaining time before we reach the Committee stage he will give it consideration-is that this legislation should be amended further and that it should enable a Ucensee of a cable television network to deUver to the terminal point signals other than those radiated over the radial networks of broadcast television stations. The Ucences could be Umited to those households which would not otherwise receive the signals over the airwaves. The system would not come into competition in any way with the radiated signals. It would mean that people who cannot get the airwave signal would be able to receive television. But oh no, the Control Board, Telecom or a mix of the two are so determined to preserve their own httle empires, so unwilling to facilitate the services that people are entitled to receive, that they refuse even to allow this Parhament to suggest that they should be given the responsibihty of considering applications. It would not cost a cent. It amazes me to think that they are not prepared even to have the power to consider appUcations where the circumstances warrant. Situations I envisage where appUcations would warrant consideration would be those cases where they would not be in any way in competition with the existing television and broadcast stations, where a service would be provided to people who would not otherwise get it. From later this year many of those people have been receiving a service are not to receive things. that service unless, to my great surprise, the Broadcasting Control Board receives from Telecom in the next few weeks a delightful litde letter that says: 'Yes, we wiU operate that cable system. We will extend it at an annual loss rate the moment of $20,000 a year.' Alternatively, will the Broadcasting Control Board authorise the estabUshment of a translator station using ultra high frequency band on the Telecom buUdthe ing in Adelaide? Is it so jealous of its frequency bands that it will continue to deprive the of the foothUls of metropoUtan Adelaide of teledifficulty vision services? It istimethe Broadcasting trol Board and Telecom faced reaUty, began to serve people and stopped the bureaucratic hassle that has prevented these people receiving the sorts of services that every Australian has come to expect and most now receive.",63
176,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I sympathise with the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) in the problem that he has raised and I trust that when the Government, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) or someone else is giving some consideration to further the cause of some of the outlying electorates of Australia we will have his support on that occasion. After all, I know of plenty of areas in which the people receive services equally as bad as those referred to by the honourable member for Stun. Mr Katter- I can tell you of places where they receive no services.",65
177,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I hear the honourable member for Kennedy interjecting. I know that my colleague from Riverina (Mr SuUivan) has the same comwUl plaints. Indeed, I represent a Victorian electorate which is small by comparison with the electorwUl ates of those honourable members and I know that certain areas of that electorate suffer result of poor reception. The Television Amendment Bill is to give effect to a government decision, firstly on the banning of advertising of cigarettes and cigarette tobacco on broadcasting and television stations as from 1 September 1976, and secondly to amend the existing provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to Ucensing of television translator stations, community television aerial systems and to extend the provisions of the Act relating to television translator stations to permit the Ucensing of broadcasting translator stations. In fact, this Bill follows a decision made by the previous Government and we are virtually only completing that original agreement; that is, to phase out the advertising on television and radio who of the smoking of cigarettes and those sorts of BasicaUy, as I see it the Bill is divided into 3 parts: Firstly, the banning of cigarette advertisat ing; secondly, giving authority to the Broadcasting Control Board to recommend the Ucensing of television translator stations; and thirdly, to Uthe cense community television aerials. At present translator television stations can be Ucensed only on technical grounds rather than on practipeople cal grounds. These would include areas of such as those caused by distance and Conblind spots, as have been mentioned by the honourable member fbr Stun. It is obvious that distance and isolation create great difficulties. After all, no commercial station wiU move into an area with a small viewing audience by choice. It prefers a large volume of viewers. It is the policy of the present Liberal-National Country Party Government to see that as many people as possible, including those residing in bUnd spots, receive reasonable television viewing and radio broadcasts. The Minister has indicated that he intends moving funher amendments in Committee later this evening. These amendments will cover the problem that many smaller television stations are worried about. Under the recently introduced legislation it would have been possible for the larger stations to move in and to compete with the smaller stations. The result of such a move inevitably would have crippled the smaller stations and would deprive the local people of local content in thenprograms. I understand that those amendments be moved at the Committee stage. I hope and trust that the spokesman for the Opposition agree to those amendments. I am sure they will because after all the Opposition members as a were responsible originaUy for bringing about Broadcasting and this legislation. The Bill allows Ucensing on a community of interest basis, irrespective of area or distance involved. The same community of interest basis appUes regarding aerial systems, so avoiding the multiplication of mdividual aerials. Television may be classified as a form of luxury on the grounds that x years ago we did not have it. But today, in my mind, if it is good enough for the vast majority, at a cost to the taxpayers, then it is good enough to say that all those who are Uving a reasonable distance from an area of concentrated population should also be entided to the privUege of having television viewing. We talk a lot of the rights of people on other issues so why not extend television coverage and broadcasting privUeges to these people? The other major issue in this Bill that is somewhat contentious is the banning of cigarette and tobacco advertising on television and radio. At the outset I should Uke to say that I not not happy with this legislation for a number of reasons. It discriminates against a section of business community. There wiU be an adverse noon. effect on the income of certain radio and teleonly vision stations, particularly those in country know areas. It sets a very dangerous precedent on very principle of the rights of the individual son, organisation or company to advertise its respective goods that are readily avaUable to public. It sets a precedent for the banning of vertisements for all types of commodities that may or may not affect the general health of the people which, of course, naturally would include such things as alcohol, certain types of medicines and foodstuffs. One could well the simple Aspro? Surely that does have an adverse effect on some people. Perhaps we ought to consider banning that, too, because if it is good enough to ban one of these types of commodities that are doing damage then it is good enough to ban the lot. I would not go along with this. Clause 4 of the Bill covers the question of accitroduce dental or incidental advertising, including reference to the non-receipt of payment for such advertising. To my mind this makes a complete farce of the whole issue. Charges that are laid down by certain sporting organisations differ I do not think honourable members would disbe pute that. I refer to perhaps the greatest sporting arena in Australia, the Melbourne Cricket my Ground. The Melbourne Cricket Ground cence authorities make a higher charge for one side their oval than for the other side. Are we to the advertising of cigarettes on the more imporits tant side of the oval? I think the answer is obvious. I believe also that the Government is cornered with an agreement entered into by a previous government on the understanding that the advertising program will be phased out over the period from 1 September 1973 to 1 September 1976.1, and many other Government supporters, as responsible members of this Parliament have no alternative but to accept the legislation on this issue with a great deal of reluctance. However, I give notice that I would be very reluctant to extend any further advertising bans on sinular grounds in the future. It is not my intention to go into all the ramifications of television and radio in speaking to the Bill before the House. Mr Martin-Why?",65
178,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I would like to make a brief reference to the question of radio and television over Ucence fees. The honourable member for Banks asks: Why? I have been present in the chamber the since the debate on this Bill resumed this afterIt is rather a strange thing that I can count 5 members of the Opposition in the House now. Honourable members wiU be interested to that that is the greatest number of memthe bers of the Opposition that has been in this perHouse since this Bill was introduced. (Quorum formed.) I am grateful to the honourable memthe ber for Corio (Mr Scholes) for calling attention adto the state of the House. I will admit that the honourable member for Corio has been present during the whole of the debate on this Bill but he is the only member of the Opposition to do so. I was about to raise the question of television and ask: What about radio Ucence fees. The House will recall that it was the previous Government which removed such fees. I am not arguing whether that decision was correct or not other than to say that it is a different thing to continue a Ucence fee as distinct from having to reinit. It is my understandig that most of the records that were once held are no longer avaUable. It think most honourable members wiU appreciate that money must be made avaUable for the continuation of our national stations. The and question we must ask is whether revenue should derived in the form of licence fees or be drawn from Treasury in some other form of grant. It is beUef that the reintroduction of television Ufees is not any easy matter. The cost of of administration alone in its implementation ban would soon eat up a lot of revenue derived from reintroduction. I come down strongly on the side that we should leave well alone. That is my recommendation to the Government. I know that a number of other speakers from the Government side would like to make a contribution to this debate. I am prepared to cut short my remarks to allow them this opportunity. Remembering that whilst this legislauon could have certain advantages in the long term, it would be better to depend on a straight out grant to make sure that our national stauons, both radio and television, are retained. To my mind the best way offinancingthem is a direct subsidy from Treasury. I conclude as I commenced: I reluctantly support this Bill.",66
179,Mr BAILLIEU,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) for shortening his remarks so I can make a couple of points. It is typical of the sincerity and the benevolence that the members of the National Country Party extend to their colleagues in the Liberal Party. The honourable member for Wimmera told the House of certain problems associated with the reception of television signals in outlying areas. I want to take just a couple of minutes to tell the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr E. L. Robinson) and the House that it is not necessary to go into the outlying areasthe remote areas-of Australia to receive a poor television signal. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) mentioned poor television reception in the Adelaide Hills. In some areas of my electorate of La Trobe in Victoria within 20 miles of the Mount Dandenong television antenna-whic h is the main base from which the Greater Melbourne area receives its signal-it is impossible to get a first rate television signal on an ordinary receiver. In 1976, with all the technology we have at our disposal, when a decent, strong signal cannot be picked up within 20 or 30 miles of a television antenna, we should not sit idly by. The sort of reception received in this area is a part vision-it is very difficult to identify is on the screen. In some instances double vision occurs. As one who has watched some of the personalities who appear on the television screen I can tell honourable members that when we are seeing those personalities double it just makes it twice as bad. I am thinking in particular of some of the political identities who appear on television.",67
180,Mr CHAPMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Do you mean from the other side?,67
181,Mr BAILLIEU,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It seems a lot of these television personalities support those on the other side of this House. I would not be so ungracious as to say that they actually come from the other side of this House. Every now and again we do see on the television screen a well known political personality with big black bushy eyebrows. When we see four of these eyebrows rather than two it is a little too much to take. Some residents in the town of Warburton, which is at the top of the Yarra Valley and is a very scenic area in the electorate of La Trobe, are going to extraordinary lengths to improve the antennae on the roofs of their houses. They are constructing skyscraper-like antennae systems which are tremendously ugly and in a scenic area like this part of the Yarra Valley are a real intrusion. The antennae are also tremendously expensive. If the money that is going into building these elaborate antennae could be used as a kind of part payment towards a system of cable television in the localised area, it would obviously be to everybody's benefit. There would be a far better signal and money would be saved one way or the other-whethe r it be by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Telecom Australia or the individual home owner. The point is that, in the final analysis, everybody would be better off. There would be television reception which everybody in the town could receive. Sales of television sets would increase, but, of course, the latter is only a side effect. This situation has existed for 15 years, to my knowledge. It was not the previous honourable member for La Trobe who raised this matter; it was the honourable member for La Trobe before him, and he represented the electorate for some 12 years. The file on this matter must be 2Vi inches to 3 inches thick. There has been review after review and all the bureaucratic tangle that one normallyfindswith these sorts of things. I ask the Minister to dig out the file, brush all the dust off it, open it and have a good look at it. I do what this in the hope that before very long he will be able to come back to me and say: 'We can do something for the people at the top end of the electorate of La Trobe who are suffering from this hopelessly inadequate television reception \ Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",67

Since introducing the Broadcasting and Television Bill 1976 on 20 May 1976, it has been brought to my attention that the Bill as drafted may have made it possible for metropoUtan broadcasting and television stations to apply for licences to transmit their programs into areas which are licensed to be served by country or provincial stations. It was certainly not the intention that metropoUtan stations should be permitted to encroach into areas normally served by country stations and I have therefore arranged for amendments to be drafted to the Bill now before the Committee to ensure that adequate safeguards are included in it to prevent such an occurrence. a review of a decision of the Honourable members will note that the amendments provide that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board shall have regard to the principle that, subject to the necessity of ensuring that the needs of the community in the area concerned are adequately served, it is desirable that in an area that is not within the normal range of a metropoUtan station a translator station licence should be granted to a non-metropolitan station. It will also be noted that it will be necessary for the Board to pubUsh in the Gazette and a newspaper circulating in the area that it is considering the need for a Ucence for an area and to notify interested persons who may then apply to the Board or make written objection to the Board to the granting of such a licence. Should two or more applications or an objection be received it will be necessary for the Board to conduct a pubhc inquiry. ""from a nearby television station Another safeguard provides that should the Board make a recommendation that a licence be range of which includes that granted to a metropolitan station to serve an area that is not within the normal range of a metropoUtan station, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the Board's recommendation.

Honourable members will also note that the normal range of a station will be as determined by the Board. Areas will be determined and pubUshed in its coverage maps. There will also be an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against this determination by the Board. I am sure honourable members will agree that very adequate safeguards metres'."". have now been included in the Bill. The amendments also provide that in respect of a community television aerial system programs may only be received from nearby television stations. It will not be possible for the systems to transmit anything other than the programs of existing television stations. It has also been decided to amend clause 4 in respect of the provision to ban the advertising of cigarettes or cigarette tobacco on broadcasting and television because the Bill as previously drafted may not have made it possible for anticigarette advertising to be broadcast or televised if it was considerable desirable to do so. The opportunity has also been taken to include in the Bill amendments relating to the Adrninistrative Appeals Tribunal. This particular Act came into operation on 1 July and it will be noted that appeals may be made against a decision I may make in accordance with section 86 of the Act relating to suspension and cancellation of Ucences and against the Board in respect of section 119 of the Act whereby the Board is empowered to take action against performers, producers of programs, etc. May I also take this opportumty to say that I Ustened very carefuUy to the honourable members who took part in this debate from both sides of the chamber. I thank the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) for his courtesy because these amendments were produced at a late hour. I accept his assurance that his colleagues in another place wiU scnitinise them and I am certain that they will find that the amendments will carry out the intention and the thrust of lation. I Ustened very carefully to what the honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson) had to say. I also had the opportunity to talk to him personally about this matter. I am aware of the problems that exist in the foothills of Adelaide and in his electorate. I commend the honourable member for taking an interest in his electorate, and I assure him that the discussions I have had with him will be carried through enthusiastically. The problems that he has raised concerning his electorate will be considered without delay and with a determination to see that they are successfully resolved. I was not aware until this evening of the problems in the electorate of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr BaUUeu) but the same comments apply in respect to that area also. All Australians should be able to enjoy the facUities of the commumcations network which this large country enjoys. It is quite obvious, of course, not only in the rural areas but also in the large metropoUtan cities and provincial cities of Australia people are entitled to get television transmission of a high quaUty. That objective will be worked towards by my Department, by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, by Telecom Australia and by all those people who are interested in improving the commumcations network throughout this nation. I take this opportunity of informing honourable members that the inquiry into the broadcasting system is proceeding satisfactorily. We hope to have some submissions to the Cabinet within the next 4 to 6 weeks. The whole purpose and thrust of the mquiry are to improve the structure, to sort out the problems that the honourable member for Sturt has commented upon tonight and to ensure that within the constraints of the Government's expenditure we will have the most effective broadcasting system in the world avaUable to us.",68
184,Mr SCHOLES,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"At this stage the Opposition is not opposing the passage of the amendments. The purpose for which the amendments have been moved is one which we find acceptable. If there is any possibUity in the original Act that, by use of translator stations, country licence holders in television and radio could be forced out of the field by metropoUtan operators, I think it is desirable that amendments be passed. The Opposition will be examining the technical effect of the amendments before the Bill is brought forward in another place, and any comments which we have on that will be made at that time.",72
185,Mr IAN ROBINSON,FORMAL AMENDMENTS," I commend the Minister for Post and Telecomthe legismunications (Mr Eric Robinson) for the introduction of these amendments. I support them strongly. I am sure that it was never the intention of the Government to proceed in the way that the original draft proposed. The technicaUties of that became obvious when the Bill was presented in the House and many country television stations quickly became aware and very concerned about what the effect of the original draft may have been. I am sure that the Committee appreciates the Minister's consideration of submissions that were made to him following the initial introduction of the legislation. In particular there is a great appreciation of the care that was taken both by the Board and the Minister in looking into this problem. The Minister informed the Committee a few moments ago ofhis clear intention. The amendment, of course, overcomes this problem. It would have been most unfortunate if the technical provisions had permitted metropolitan stations to encroach that upon areas normally served by country stations. Country stations have a very great task in maintaining viabUity, in meeting escalating costs and in fulfiUing their license responsibUities in terms of presenting programs which are of a satisfactory standard, and one might say, quite correctly, a high standard because there is a tendency for country stations to present programs of the highest standard. It would have been unfortunate if there had been transgression which may have interfered with this capacity, but of greater concern was the risk that translators placed in difficult areas for transmission purposes, still to maintain community of interest and the area of service of a country station, may have been put in jeopardy. This would have been unfortunate. I commend the Minister and thank him for the particular attention given to this matter. I trust that the Committee and another place will fully support the amendments now before us.",72
186,Mr CREAN,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"My comment is more in the nature of a quesuon to the Minister. I am wondering whether he is protecting the integrity of local stauons or the immunity of those stauons from outside program intervenuon. If I may use a simple example, there is always a lot of argument that if one can see a football match called Austrahan Rules as against locals going to their own match, there is some difficulty economically. I can understand that one program can invade another, but I am wondering about the nature of the programs invading or the integrity of the local areas in tion to that invasion. Perhaps I have not put the point as clearly as I might have, but this seems to me to be a fairly fundamental question. I take the example of Geelong in the electorate of Corio. If one is to develop local drama, or something of the kind, on a regional station and it is suddenly invaded by Power Without Glory-to use the great classic of the moment-is that detrimental? Is that what the Minister is seeking to protect here?",73

188,Mr HODGMAN,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"I do not wish to delay the passage of these amendments. However, I wish to comment on one of them, if only for the reason that it is the first amendment to legislation which I have been able to propose to a Minister and which has been accepted. I parprepared ticularly thank the Minister for accepting my proposal. The amendment will now become seccitizens tion 100 (5A) of the principal Act. Clause 4 the Bill provides that a licensee shall not broadcast or televise an advertisement relating to cigarettes or cigarette tobacco. The amendment is very small, but I just mention it in passing cause I am grateful to the Minister- I say it publicly-for accepting the proposal as he quite frankly that I am bitterly opposed to the legislation. Nevertheless he accepted this amendment. If the Bill had been passed in the form in which it was drafted it could have had the effect of prohibiting advertisements which were not directly related to tobacco and smoking. It could have also have had the effect of banning anti-smoking advertisements. It now puts beyond any shadow of doubt that the advertisement must be for the smoking of cigarettes or tobacco- I emphasise these words-befor e it comes within the ambit of the prohibition. If it had been left simply on the basis of relating to cigarettes or cigarette tobacco, I believe that injustice and hardship would have been occasioned on both sides of the cancer dispute. I thank the Minister for the way in which he received the representation. I think the Bill is fairer now to all concerned than it was in its original form because it is clear. If it had not been clarified, there would have been litigation upon litigation, and those who support the Bill would relahave found that it had to withstand a number of court cases to test its validity in respect to this section. Now it is clear and I believe it will be much fairer legislation and, for that reason, better legislation when it goes through the Parliament.",73
189,Mr WILSON,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"I thank the Minister for his assurance that the problem to which I referred will be looked at as a matter of urgency with the aim of finding a solution. I am, of course, disappointed that the amendments we are now looking at specifically limit the power in Ucences for community television aerial to programs that may be received from television stations. The problems here a arise from a number of factors. We need to ask ourselves whether at any time cable television wiU be used in this country. If the answer is yes, nonthe next question must be: Who is to provide it? been The Australian Telecommunications Commission and the report following the last broadcasting inquiry have suggested that the Commission should own the physical transmission plant, but in Telecom 2000 attention was drawn to the problem of resources. That document said that if the Commission is not able to marshal the resources or for some other reason of policy is not to provide cable television it would be difficult to resist the forces of entrepreneurs and who group together for the purpose of of trying to receive a signal that others receive. So if we are to have cable television and it is to be government operated, the authorities which beare to hold the monopolies over it must be given the resources to enable them to provide that serknew vice. If private entrepreneurs are to be encouraged into the area, and it has been proven they could do the job from a technical point of view, they must be given the opportunity of running viable alternatives. It is terribly difficult, when all of us pay nothing for our television signal, because there is no television licensing these days, for a cable provider to say: 'We can provide you with the television signal but you must pay a rent or a licence fee. All I can offer are the same signals that come out of the television station. ' Everyone else is getting them for nothing, but the people in difficult areas are having to pay something for them. The Minister has recognised in his assurances to me that there is an inequity in that situation. Just for the record I shall read the amendment I would like to have seen incorporated in this legislation. I think there should have been a provision as follows: The Minister may, on the recommendation of the Board, grant a permit to a person to use a telegraph line for pose of transmitting television programs from a receiving aerial maintained by that person vision programs to television receivers and for transmitting other services approved by the Board to the television receivers situated in an area specified in the permit. If, in providing a cable service, the only way to make it viable is to grant permission for the provision of services in addition to those transmitted by the television stations, I see no reason why the legislation should prevent that from being done. I spoke at length earher in the debate. I still feel as strongly about it. I hope that all the inquiries into the overall structure of our television and broadcasting system will be concerned with not only reconstructuring the system so that we get a more efficient operation ofit but also restructuring it so that we can have a pohcy that ensures the maximum communications for the community at large.",73
190,Mr ARMITAGE,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"Like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) I would really like to direct a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson). It is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I will give a specific example to the Minister. Radio station 2KA at Katoomba wishes to put in a supplementary booster lower down the Blue Mountains so that it can beam into the western suburbs of Sydney and specialise in the problems of those suburbs, which have a particular community of interest We should keep in mind that these areas now range 35 to 40 miles beyond the centre of the city of Sydney and accordingly no longer should be looked upon as an ordinary metropolis. There was a proposal to establish a high powered station in the western suburbs. That seems to have died. Possibly the Minister could inform us as to what is happening with that proposal. I think it went to court. He will know. That is not the issue. The issue here is the lowpowered stations that want to put in boosters to beam around the western suburbs. I am not touting the interests of any group-fa r from it-bu t it is simply the principle that the western suburbs should be served by radio stations which specialise in the problems of the area. I refer particularly to news coverage and social commentary on the problems of the outer western suburbs area, which is very much a distinctive area and in many ways divorced from the city of Sydney. I want to clarify 3 points. Firstly, could a lowpowered station such as the one I mentioned put in a booster further down the Blue Mountains, or could some other station estabhshed in the future do something similar to serve the area? Secondly, if it is allowed to do that, will it interfere with the the pur- existing programs from high powered stations such as 2GB, 2CH, 2SM, and so on in the metrofor the reception of telepolitan area of Sydney? I think that is the basic question. Mr Eric Robinson-You are talking about radio broadcasting, are you?",74
191,Mr ARMITAGE,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"I am essentially talking about radio broadcasting, not television broadcasting. Thirdly, what impact would this have on community access stations? I know that quite a number of people are interested in establishing such stations in the outer western suburbs mainly on frequency modulation bands, with the-object of providing a specialised service to the area but also at the same time providing the best possible reception and music available to the outer western areas of Sydney, where that type of project is very important.",74
192,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FORMAL AMENDMENTS," I will have to disappoint the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage), because I think it would be very unwise of me to start indicating here tonight what my reaction or my view might be about a particular radio station. There is a sensitive position in the western suburbs of Sydney. In fact I face a couple of sensitive situations. A couple of writs have already been given to me. One of them is concerned with the matter to which the honourable member referred. Could I suggest in broad terms, without responding particularly in relation to a radio station which he nominated, because I do not wish to get myself into a situation where I react in the Parliament about a particular radio stationMr Armitage- I am not asking for that.",74
193,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"I appreciate that and I accept the honourable gentleman's reassurances. This would be a matter on which any radio station should approach the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Then there would be an mquiry. If, following that inquiry, there was an unacceptable decision, the appeals tribunal system could be used. The frequency modulation aspect is one of the reasons why we are having the overall broadcasting inquiry. The Government of which the honourable member for Chifley was a supporter took a tremendous number of initiatives in the broadcasting area during its 3 years in office. Some of them were very desirable but the proliferation was such that there has to be a sorting out. There is even some doubt as to the legaUty of some of the Ucences that have been issued. What I hope to achieve by this inquiry- I say quite genuinely that it is designed to improve the structure of broadcasting-is to see what is in the best interests of the nation as a whole and of areas in particular, and to see that when licences are given they are properly founded on a legislative base and designed to take into account the community which they serve. The answer I have given obviously cannot be satisfactory to the particular station which the honourable member mentioned. If he wants to come and see me privately about a station within his electorate or the problems of broadcasting within his electorate I shaU be very happy to have a personal and frank discussion with him.",74
194,Mr CREAN,FORMAL AMENDMENTS," I understand that we are taking these amendments in globo. My concern mainly centres on television and not broadcasting. I want to draw attention particularly to new section 105AAC and to amendments Nos (7) and (8). Amendment No. (7) reads as foUows: Clause 7, page 3, after sub-section (3) insert the following sub-sections: '(3A) In making recommendations Board shall have regard to the principle that subject to the necessity of ensuring that Uie needs of the community in the area concerned are adequately served, it is desirable that a broadcasting translator . . . I understand that this appUes to television and not to broadcasting. I ask: How does the Board decide upon the necessity of ensuring that the needs of the community in the area are adequately served? Amendment No. (9) seeks to add a sub-section which reads: '(2A) Where the Board is of the opinion that satisfactory reception of television programs from a commercial television station or commeraal television stations is being obtained in an area, but the those programs do not adequately serve the interests of the community in that area by reason of the fact that they are designed to serve primarily the different interests of a community in another area, the Board may recommend that a licence be granted . . . How does the Board decide where there is a conflict between 2 towns, for example between BaUarat and Geelong, to take the State which I know best, or between Lismore and Grafton? The Bill refers to television. I tliink that everybody accepts that there is a difference between television and broadcasting. A broadcasting station can almost be set up in a back room but a television station cannot be set up in a back room and a commercial television station cannot be set up unless it has an assurance of advertisers. I ask again: How does the Board decide between what I referred to earUer as the immunity of the area from an invasion of programs and the integrity of the local area to maintain its own programs? This seems to me to be something which is essential in each of these amendments. I do not know the reason why, after due deliberation, the Government had to make these amendments but now that they are before the Committee I think that we are entitled to know on what sort of grounds the Board will decide in these very intricate situations.",75
195,Mr BAUME,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,I would like to ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) a very simple question. Mr Armitage-Not to do with Patrick Partners?,75
196,Mr BAUME,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"I would expect that kind of helpful comment from the western suburbs. Mr Armitage-B e careful; you are out there, too.",75
197,Mr BAUME,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"The south west has a far greater capacity for intellect, at least in selecting its members of Parliament. I suggest that there is a degree of problem-the oflicers of the Minister's under this section the Department have assured me that it is not a problem-in the wording of various sections which say 'such a licence' or 'recommending that a Ucence be granted'. The word is repeatedly used m the singular. I believe that in the initial Act the words 'licence or licences' appeared. I am concerned, for example, that in clause 7, in sub-section (3), given various conditions the Board may recommend that a licence be granted for a broadcasting translator station to serve the needs of the community in the first mentioned area. I wondered why it was specifically limited to 'a Ucence' rather than to 'a licence or Ucences' in the sense that there may well be 2 neighbouring areas and a degree of choice may need to be Board is also of the opinion that allowed to the people in the dead reception area. Despite the assurances I have received from the Department some legalistic views are that the expression 'such a Ucence' Umits to one.",75
198,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"MCPherson-Minister for Post and Telecommunications) (9.7)_First of all I will answer the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). I am interested to hear his view but my understanding is that it is not Umited in any way and that it includes the plural sense. When the honourable member was speaking to me earlier this evening I noted his concern. In my view and the views of the Board and the Department, his fears are unfounded and the plural of the word is encompassed. I turn now to the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has had the legislative authority for many years- I cannot remember how long but I know that it goes back for a long time, for many years before I came into the Parliament and maybe since the honourable member has been in the Parliament-in connection with broadcasting licences in the commercial area. Mr Crean-We have had television since 1957.",76
199,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FORMAL AMENDMENTS,"Yes, but it still goes back a considerable number of years. When we first brought in this Bill we sought to change the Boards authority from purely mechanical or engineering needs to community needs. If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is concerned as to whether the Board has the competence to decide what is in the community needs I think the safeguard is contained in the amendment because it simply says that where there is need for it the Board will first of aU advertise in the Gazette and in a newspaper circulating in the area that it is considering the need for the grant of a hcence in an area, and interested persons may then apply to the Board or make written objection to the Board about the granting of a licence. If two or more applications or objections are received the Board will conduct a public inquiry. I think that that is the safeguard, so that the public can be convinced that the Board is operating for the good of the community. When a decision is made and submitted to me there are further safeguards in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I do not know whether the honourable member was here when I was speaking earlier and I referred to the publishing of coverage maps. A person will be able to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against any determination by the Board. I sense that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is concerned that the needs of the community are adquately and fairly reflected in the Board's decision, and that is the reason why we are bringing in these amendments. We felt that the original Bill did not cover that safeguard completely and we became very concerned least we have a situation in which large, successful, highly profitable metropoUtan television stations could enter areas where we had previously given a Ucence for a non-metropolitan station. I think it is in everybody's interest that we have a range of stations serving the community, particularly in the provincial areas and the rural areas, and which reflect the community and safeguard it against intrusion. I cannot remember the relevant mileage but there is a delineation as to what is metropolitan and what is nonmetropoUtan. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

200,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"The Australian Heritage Commission was established by a Labor Government after the receipt of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate which was chaired by Mr Justice Hope. The establishment of this Commission was one of the more imponant recommendations contained in that historic repon. The central theme of the report was quite explicit. It was set out in this brief extract: The Australian GovernmentThat is, the Labor Government has inherited a national estate which has been down-graded, disregarded and neglected. All previous priorities accepted at various levels of government and authority have been directed by a concept that uncontrollable development, economic growth and progress and the encouragement of private as against public interest in land use, use of waters and indeed every part of the national estate was paramount. That theme embarrassed members of the then Opposition. It now embarrasses the current Government. It highUghted their 23 years of neglect. It now highlights their attitude to both the Austrahan Heritage Commission and the preservation of the National Estate. The previous Liberal-Country Party Government was a growth for growth's sake government. In other words, it was a government of a bulldozer mentality. After last night, it appears that things have not changed very much. The amendments now proposed to the Australian Heritage Commission Act, an Act introduced by the Labor Government with the apparent support of honourable members opposite, to prevent the desecration of our heritage and to overcome those years of neglect are destined to make that statement come true again. The Austrahan Heritage Commission, the establishment of which was proposed and enacted by the Labor Government, was to be the tool to achieve the fine aim of giving substance to the concept of the National Estate- a fine concept which was identified by the Australian Labor Party and which was enshrined by Mr Justice Hope and his colleagues in theirfinereport. The aims enshrined in the Labor legislation and the report were: 1. Set up an Ausualian Heritage Commission on a broad and representative basis- a basis which ensured that all interests, interests of the various States and Territories and the public and private sectors as well as the interests cerned Australians-to advise the Government and the Parliament on the condition of the National Estate and how it should be protected. 2. Establish and maintain a register of the things that make up the Nauonal Estate. 3. Require that the Australian Government departments and agencies and those acting on its behalf respect the Nauonal Estate and do all they can to preserve it. 4. Finally, in this broad operation with the States to ensure that complementary legislation and actions were implemented on behalf future generations in Australia. Against this broad statement of the aims enshrined in the Labor Government's legislation I shall set out again briefly the history of the legislation, as it is obvious that the Fraser Government has forgotten the good principles and philosophies it espoused when it was in Opposition last year. In April 1973, the Labor Government set up a committee of inquiry under Mr Justice Hope. This committee was given the task of investigating and reporting to the Government on the nature and condition of the National Estate and the ways in which all bodies in Austraha, both government and non-government, could work together to preserve and enhance it. I played a part in devising and publicising the concept of the National Estate when I was the Labor spokesman on the environment and urban and regional affairs between the years 1969 and 1972. During that time, in both the Parhament and the countryside I expressed our wish to preserve for posterity those things that were created by man and nature and that are unique and beautiful. In those years we put particular emphasis on identifying the National Estate and promoting it as a key pan of the Labor Party's pohcy. In our Party's policy speech in December 1972 we promised that a Labor government would enhance and preserve the National Estate. As a government we acted swiftly to discharge the mandate given to us to identify, conserve and preserve the National Estate. Ourfirstaction was to set up the Hope Committee. This Committee was asked to view the National Estate as comprising such things as national parks, nature reserves, historic buildings and structure of architectural merit, areas of special scientific interest, the coastline, inland waters, our wetlands and urban parks. The Labor Government sought from the Committee for the first time in Australian history an inventory of our natural and man-made heritage. In accounting terms, this Committee set out the great assets of our heritage and balanced them against the UabUities that have debased their value. As well of con- as this inventory, the Committee reported on the present condition of the items Usted and made recommendations as to how they might be protected and enhanced. In itself, the Committee's report could be said to form the basis of the register that the Heritage Commission was asked to prepare under the legislation currently being amended. statement of aims, to work in coThe Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has of the stated pubUcly as has the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) who is now sitting at the table, that no money will be spent by this Government until the register to be estabhshed by the Commission is well advanced. I ask the Minister sitting at the table: Has he any idea at all of the amount of work in establishing a national register? Has he had dialogue or discussion with those agencies particularly those in Britain that have set out to compUe a national register? Has he made any detailed investigation? It takes years to compUe a national-register and even when one is compiled that is only the first round. There is always the second round. It takes a good many people to compUe a national register and it takes a long time. The forces which sit on the treasury bench today have proved by their failure to preserve the National Estate that they cannot be trusted. They have decided that no money will be spent on the Nauonal Estate until this yet to be estabUshed register is well on its way. In adopting this attitude they have ignored 2 things. They have ignored the fact that an informal register is already in existence in the report of the Hope Committee. I commend the report to aU honourable members on the Government side. It is well worth reading. They should be aware that the Hope Committee dealt with this matter in great depth. Arising out of that inquiry the Hope Committee made its first recommendation to the Government in that report. Registers have already been compUed by the National Trust, by conservation groups and by historical societies. There is information on this matter within the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. There is an enormous list of things that need to be done now. We on the Opposition side do not want this phoney deal which says that we are not going to spend any money until such time as a national register is under way. We know why a smokescreen has been created. I know there are men of goodwill on the Government side of the House. Does the Minister not recaU that I was a Minister in the Labor Government? Does he not reaUse that when the squeeze comes our friends in Treasury say that if there is one place in which they can reaUy use the knife it is environment and urban and regional development? In fact, on one occasion when Labor was in government, they made an impact on urban proposals and also on the National Estate but fortunately in the second round in Cabinet I did them Uke a dinner. At least I did not stop fighting. When the Treasury bureaucrats cut our programs back I kept on fighting. Unfortunately the bureaucracy of the Fraser Government is controlled by Treasury and there is no appeal. There is no justice when it comes to Treasury decisions unless of course the Prime Minister Fraser has a pet subject when he then says: 'Look, I will have that.' Unless you can get him on side you have got Buckley's chance of defeating Treasury. Mr Newman-Do not get carried away.",76
201,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"Mr Minister, I well know that you inherited thefinestgroup of people in the Australian bureaucracy. When we were in office we created a new department of urban and regional development. We drew people from all over the world, from the private sector, from the pubUc sector, from universities, from planning authorities and from State departments. They were outstanding PubUc Servants. What has happened? The fact is that because of the fear of the economic power of your Department, because they were an alternative economic body in your Department, Treasury has made your Department null and void. It has conspired to deprive you of the opportunity to sit on any economic committee of Cabinet and to have any real say in the economic policy and decision making processes of this nation. Your Department, as it was formed by me as the then responsible Minister, had a say in the whole spectrum of the economy and dealt in a more detaUed and humane way with aspects of the economy because the human problems that are involved are in urban affairs. For 23 years the conservative governments of this nation excluded the human and social problems that buUt up in the urban community and a crisis situation occurred in Sydney and Melbourne. It was only when the Whitlam Labor Government came into office in 1972 that we were able to commence to do something about the problems, to try to rectify many problems and thosefineyoung public servants or, as I call them, young bureaucrats came into help us change the face of our urban community. They are being frustrated now. I know they are being frustrated because the Treasury bureaucracy is laying down the dictum. Might I say- I can say it now because it is already a matter of pubUc discussion-that probably one of the finest economic minds that ever joined the Australian PubUc Service, Dr Michael Keating, in fact helped to break that Treasury bureaucracy budget strategy in 1974-that bureaucracy which would have created unemployment of vast proportion even at the time when Labor was in office. He has now returned to the OECD in Paris. There is no real right of alternative economic poUcy thought in the Australian bureaucracy and you have to toe the line of Treasury bureaucracy-no t the Treasurer but the Treasury bureaucracy. These matters are all interconnected. As it is said, everything is connected to everything else. As m the environment, as in urban affairs and as with our national heritage, everything is connected to everything else. Everything is interrelated. We are now talking about this important body, the Heritage Commission. For so long it was disregarded by these people sitting opposite. It was only we on this side who started to open up this new world. Those who sit opposite also ignored the fact that, in the interim period when nofinanceis to be made avaUable, many parts of our heritage could be lost forever. This Government is opting out of its responsibUities to the nation and to our future generations. All poltiical parties not only supported this legislation when it was introduced but also supported the actions of the Labor Government in appropriating $ 17.2m in the last 3 years to be used for the preservation and enhancement of the National Estate. When Labor was in office the then Opposition spokesman on environment, the current Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), both pubUcly stated in the debate last year on the Heritage Commission that it was necessary to appropriate funds before a formal register was completed to preserve those immediately threatened areas of our national estate. This was referred to as crisis financing and was applauded by the then Opposition spokesman who today sit on the Government side. We could not wait for the register to be completed hke this Government is now doing. It this a smokescreen? That is what I want to ask honourable members opposite. Even before the Hope report was completed we had appropriated in our first Budget $2m for the preservation of areas of the National Estate that would otherwise have been lost forever. If that type of funding had not been avaUable to us as a government, many fine things would have been lost to all Australians. I ask honourable members opposite to recaU Blackburn Lakes in Victoria, Hallett Cove in South Australia, the Palace Hotel in Perth, to name just a few. The honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel) interjects. The Commonwealth Bank owned the Palace Hotel in Perth. Does he think that the Government of the day or the bureaucracy of the day, prior to the Labor Party taking office making the decisions that it did, would have tected the Palace Hotel from destruction by Commonwealth Bank even though they had the power to do so? It was not until we came government that action was taken to protect Palace Hotel. Of course, the pressure will stiU on back benchers opposite to ensure that that commitment is met, because all date is buy the internal fittings of the Palace Hotel, which in fact are in the custody of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Comof munity Development. The Palace Hotel premises are stiU owned the Commonwealth Bank, and the CommonQueensland wealth Bank still has a grand design to develop that area in the name of so-caUed progress replacing with glass and concrete high-rise office buildings that lovely old hotel which has a special gentleness and an aura we will never able to create agam. There are other buUdings about which we should be doing something now. One is the Queen Victoria buUding in Sydney. Do honourcordance able members think that any city councU can protect, preserve and restore a buUding such as the Queen Victoria buUding without assistance from the national Government? There has been a great deal of the buUdozer development mentaUty in Sydney. The protection and maintenance of the Queen Victoria buUding, the Sydney Town HaU and St Andrews Cathedral, which is a unique area in a city which has a policy of growth for growth's sake, can be done only with the cooperation of the national Government. It is too costly to be restored by a city councU. It can be done only by co-operation between the Australian Government, the State Government and local government, as well as with the pressure and suppon of community organisations. That is the only way in which it can be done. I mention also to the House and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) that a buUding such as the EUzabeth Farm Cottage should be preserved. For the information of honourable members, EUzabeth Farm Cottage, the oldest residence in Australia, is situated in the electorate of Parramatta. It was situated in my electorate before the redistribution of 1969. That buUding was erected in 1793, 5 years after Governor PhilUp arrived in this land. Until the Labor Party came to office not one penny of Australian Government funds was ever made avaUable to try to restore and rehabititate Elizabeth Farm Cottage. I made representations time and time again to the governments of the day, and they refused me on each occasion. The only man and who did give me some consideration and underprostanding was a former Minister for Tourism, now the a back bencher, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). But how long can these to things wait? The honourable member for Parthe ramatta can tell honourable members that be Elizabeth Farm Cottage is in awful disrepair and we could lose if for ever unless rehabUitation we have done to work commences soon. SimUarly, it is possible that with the mentaUty the present Government some of the scarce tropical rain forests and mangrove swamps in north Queensland could be lost for ever. We by know of the buUdozer mentaUty which exists in at present and which espouses the poUcy of growth for growth's sake. The Ausby traUan Government is refusing to appropriate funds for this necessary form of preservation in a time of crisis. It is refusing to do those things be which, a mere 12 months ago, it applauded the Labor Government for doing. While the Hope Committee was still conducting its inquiry the Labor Government took positive measures in acwith its mandate- a mandate best exemplified by the statement that the Australian Government should see itself as the curator and not the liquidator of our national heritage. We embarked on a series of what were new policiespolicies which are now being dismantled and destroyed by this Government, pohcies which had an important impact on the National Estate. The Budget which was introduced into House yesterday is a major step towards the truction of those programs. Let me cite those grams to the Minister at the table, who in fact the Minister responsible for them. The Minister needs a bit of a lecture, and I wish to goodness his young bureaucrats would educate ister a little better as to his responsibUities. The programs include the development of growth centres, such as Albury-Wodonga and Bathurstrange Orange, and the setting up of land commissions. Do honourable members know that it was the sponsibihty of the land commissions to protect and to buy areas such as the escarpment of the Blue Mountains and many other places of natuon ral beauty such as the foreshores of the Port Phillip Bay peninsula and many other areas? programs were interconnected with our sewerGovernment age programs which have been almost destroyed by a reduction in funds from $115m to $50m. Area improvement programs which have asLiberal sisted local governments were also interconLabor nected with the National Estate. Those programs have been completely destroyed. We initiated the setting up of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, apart from ensuring that servation organisations and groups received financial assistance to obtain technical advice controversial issues of general community Estate interest. What of the Glebe estate which acquired and which we were rehabilitating. Glebe estate contained a townscape extending over a period of 100 years. What is happening? The fact is that since 1 January this year not one penny has been spent on rehabiUtation of that estate. A deputation will be meeting with the ister tomorrow because since 13 December the project has been neglected and work has not been carried out. All these things are taneous interconnected. Recendy the Mmister had a look at the from Woolloomooloo program, another related part of the Australian Heritage Commission. That area forms part of the history of Sydney and part of the history of Australia. That area was acquired under the Labor Adnunistration purpose of being protected, preserved and themselves. enhanced, but the project has been sabotaged by this Government. The programs to which referred earlier also include endeavours to ensure that environment protection forms the key part of the decision-making process of government. That was done by the enactment of the environment protection legislation, and the appointment of permanent heads of departments that had special environmental significance to the Interim Committee on the the National Estate, apart from conditions desembodied in the legislation currently being proamended. I would not be surprised to see legisis lation introduced into this Parliament shortly to amend the environment protection legislation. If that occurs, it will be just another example of the their MinGovernment's mentality. The Labor Government also started a wide of programs for the rational management of Austrahan water and biological resources. All reof these programs, many of which have been dismantled by the Fraser Government, involved land use strategies and aU had a crucial bearing the National Estate. The Labor Government made a definite commitment and with real deterOur mination to protect our heritage. The Fraser has faded to meet this commitment. I have already said that the legislation now being amended received the full support of the and Country parties at thetimethat the Government proposed it. But where is the financial support, the muscle, to support this legislation? The Government must increase that financial commitment. It must meet its commitment now. The Government has increased the confinancial commitment to the arts. Why cannot the Government if not increase at least make the on necessaryfinancialcommitment to the National simUar to that made to the Arts Council. A we commitment has been made to the arts and we The know that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wants to out do Prime Minister Whitlam's contribution to the arts. The Australian Heritage Commission was an Minexample of co-operation and accommodation between the major poltiical parties at the federal level and also was the result of continuous sponco-operation and consultation with the States, the private sector and groups over a very wide area. The people were consulted and drawn the grass roots. It is their environment and that is why we wanted to work together-the Austrahan and State governments, local government, the private sector, the people's sector, for the people's organisations and the people The legislation that was enshrined as the AusI traUan Heritage Commission Act 1975 was an example of open government and participation in the decision making process on a level unprecedented in Austrahan history. I want to give credit to David Yencken, the present chairman of the Heritage Commission. David Yencken was a member of the Hope Committee inquiry into the National Estate. He has great tenacity and a great commitment and involvement. I am sure that he will do a fine job as Chairman. We do not oppose the Bill but we will be opposing certain amendments when we get into the Committee stage-in particular clauses 4 and 6 relating to sections 7 and 12 of the principal Act.",78
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,81
203,Mr SIMON,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"We heard expressions from the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), who has just resumed his seat, such as '23 years of neglect', 'a growth for growth's sake government' and reference to Albury-Wodonga and other growth centres. I am at a loss to understand what those subjects have to do with the legislation we are now debating. We are debating the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1976. Honourable members will recall the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) introducing this Bill into the House on 4 June last. It may also be worthwhile recalling the terms which the right honourable gentleman used in introducing this Bill and in particular the following words. They are words which the honourable member for Reid could well recall. The Prime Minister said: The Government has repeatedly declared its suppon the objectives of the Heritage Commission. We mitted to the protection of the operation and goodwill of other spheres of government Uie community, we are determined to ensure that the principles set out in the repon of the committee of mquiry on the National Estate are honoured. They are hardly words aimed at creating a smokescreen. I would like briefly to remind the house of the history of this legislation and of the necessity for us all to fix in our minds the responsibihty we have to the National Estate. Why was this legislation introduced into the national Parhament? In 1963 J. F. Kennedy, then President of the United States of America, emphasised the need for his Government and the people of United States to recognise the National Estate ofhis country when he said: We must expand the concept of conservation to meet the imperious problems of uie new age. We must develop new instruments of foresight and protection and nurture in order to recover the relauonship between man and nature and make sure that the National Estate that we pass on to our multiplying descendants is green and flourishing. Those words were uttered 13 years ago. They are even more important in their intent and appUcation in Austraha in 1976. November 1972 saw the general conference of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation-I remind honourable members that this was in 1972 and not 23 years ago-adopting the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural National Heritage. The preamble of that convention emphasised the threat to the cultural or natural heritage of all nations of the world. It highlighted the growing awareness that our National Estate was under threat. The preamble stated, inter alia: That deterioration or disappearance of any item of the cultural or natural heritage constitutes a harmful impoverishment of the heritage of all the nations of the world, that protection of this heritage at the nauonal level often remains incomplete because of the scale of the resources which it requires and of the insufficient economic, scientific, and technical resources of the country where the property to be protected is situated. The terms of those clauses are relevant to Australia. It is interesting to note that the convention was not adopted until November 1972. It was in 1973 that Australia estabUshed a committee of inquiry to ascertain the nature and state of the National Estate and the role which the Australian government could play in the preservation and enhancement of the National Estate. Honourable members will be aware that the committee of inquiry report on the National Estate was presented to the House in September for 1974. On tabling that report the honourable are commember for Reid, previously the Minister for National Estate. With the coand Urban and Regional Development, said: No future government will be able to ignore the impact of Uie report and its implications for the careful planning of future public policy to safeguard the National Estate. Those words, I respectfully suggest, have equal relevance today. It is important that we now note all parties recognise the findings of that committee of inquiry. The present Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who represents the electorate of Gwydir, reflected this Government's view of the Australia Heritage Commission Bill when as the then Opposition spokesman for the environment he said: The Opposition welcomes the legislation which gives legislation expression to the major recommendadons of the report on the Nauonal Estate . . . The environment and for that matter the National Estate surrounds all of us. It belongs to all of us. It is not the monoply of any one man. It is not the monopoly of one generation, one group, one party, one government. That Bill was therefore supported by all parties and by both Houses and received royal assent in June 1975. The co-operation of all parties and recognition of the importance of the Austrahan Heritage Commission was further evidenced in the interrnin report presented by the Chairman, Mr David Yencken, in May 1975. Mr Yencken stated: We have been heartened by support we have received from governments at all levels from different political parties and from many private and individuals. These are words which should be noted by the honourable member for Reid. There are many others who have spoken in support of the Austrahan Heritage Commission. There should be no doubt that this Government has reiterated its firm and unequivocal commitment to the preservation and maintenance of that part of our environment, our National Estate, having asthetic, historical, scientific and social significance for future generations. Honourable members will be aware of the Government's policy of restraining public register spending having regard to the economic conditions facing us at thistime.However, the restriction of expenditure to the Australian Heritage Commission can be justified only if by so doing the National Estate is not thereby prejudiced. If any commitment of the natural environment which would form part of the National Estate and appear on the register in accordance with the terms of the Act is in danger of destruction, despoliation or is in any way versely affected, the Government must take mediate and urgent steps, on the advice of the Commission, to preserve or maintain that comfor ponent. To talk of economic restraint whilst part of our heritage is being destroyed is tantamount to vandalism at a national government level. There unfortunately has been a tendency late to label those in our community who support conservation or express concern for the protechistory tion of the environment-ou r National Estate-a freaks. That notion must be rejected. Many honourable members will recall examples from only their electorates of prehistorical archaeological sites, Aboriginal sites, historical archaeological sites, individual historic buildings, historic strucfrom tures, and other natural features and areas which must under no circumstances whatsoever be desFraser), troyed or in any way damaged by the hand man. There are many examples where people have expressed concern and interest. The feeling of those concerned with the National Estate should be respected if not applauded. too many of us today who are prepared to categorise those who support the conservation of our heritage as being on one side or the other of the political spectrum. Such irrelevant assessments ought to be abandoned. The majority of people in Austraha are concerned with the quality of their environment and are able to make assessments of the environmental aspects of any project likely to threaten that quaUty. the co-operation, interest and The primary intent of the Bill, as amended, is groupsto estabUsh a commission able to advise the Government on matters of poUcy affecting the National Estate. The Commission is also charged with a responsibUity to identify places to be included in the National Estate and to prepare a register. In one sense the register of the National Estate will never be complete in that fromtimeto time it may be necessary to add or delete places of national heritage interest. It will be a resource avaUable to aU government departments, to the State governments, to local government authorities and to interested individuals in our society. In that sense the register can be used as a planning tool for the future. The compilation of the will be the most important task ahead of extremely difficult the Commission. I should like to refer briefly by way of example to the Umted States of America. In that country the National Register of Historic Places, as its name suggests, is concerned only with a register of historic places. It was designed for a federal recommended government system and has subsequently been by Heritage Canada as a model for the Canadian National Estate system. In the adUnited States of America the National Historic imPreservation Act of 1966 empowered the Secretary of the Interior to delegate responsibUity administration of the Historic Preservation Grants-in-Aid Program. Under that Act the Federal Government could pay matching grants to the States and to the National Trust. A detaUed of and expUcit plan has been formulated to ensure that American heritage of historical and presites is preserved. An historic property s under the United States program may be acquired with Federal Government assistance if it is listed in the National Register and if the acquisition conforms with the state historic preservation plan. There is much to be learnt the United States experience and it is pleasing to note that the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm the Minister for Environment, Housing of and Community Development (Mr Newman) and the Commission have examined this and other overseas examples and are very well aware of the requirement and work necessary to There are estabUsh the register. The 1975 report of the Interim Committee of the Austrahan Heritage Commission further emphasised the need for close co-operation between Commonwealth Government, and respective governments of the States and local government authorities. It is stated on page 19 of that report that 'the most effective conservation movement will be one which has deep roots in local communities'. Accordingly it is seen that the protection and management of heritage sites will best be developed with the co-operation and assistance of 3 tiers of government. I would argue that any preservation or maintenance of heritage components should not depend on the completion of the register. Whilst I have no doubt that the Austrahan Heritage Commission will act quickly and compile the register as soon as possible, it would be unreasonable for us to expect completion of the register at an early date having regard to the Commission's present restrictive nnanciai allowance. It accordingly becomes extremely important that the Government be in a position to act on the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission and to have funds avaUable should the Government wish to adopt the advice and take steps to preserve or to maintain that part of Australia's heritage which appears on the register. The amendments contained in this Bill are tection intended to improve the 1975 legislation. time wiU prove the effectiveness of these ments. Should the Commission find that it is tated in any way in carrying out its functions would trust that further amendments will quickly be introduced into this House to facUitate the practical application of this Commission must suffer no disability caused by lack of finance or by government inactivity. The very nature of the legislation, its purpose and The intent demand a total commitment from this which Government to the protection, maintenance and preservation of our National Estate. In conclusion I briefly make the following controlled points: Firstly, I hope that in the not too distant land future the successful National Estate gram can be reintroduced; secondly and finally, that reference throughout the principal Act the amending Bill to 'aboriginal' be spelt with capital ' A ' and not a smaU 'a' which presently appears in the definition clause and other clauses in the amending Bill. I commend the Bill to House.",81
204,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"On included 14 May 1975 the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) introduced the Australian Heritage Commission Bill which was designed to give legislative substance to the concept National Estate. Prior to this initiative historical buUdings, sites and reUcs as well as parks, waterways, rain forests and areas of scientific interest were at great risk. In fact, much of our heritage has already been plundered by developers, by mining compames and by governments and the destructive effects of expanding tourism. Authorities and organisations concerned with preservation have lacked the financial resources, staff and general logistics effectively to fulfil thenobjectives. Without redressing these serious deficiencies Australians would continue to be deprived of the benefit of their sparse but important history and generations to come would be even more disadvantaged. Under that 1975 legislation the Commission was to be the effective vehicle to enhance and preserve the National Estate. It was to estabUsh and maintain a register of the components of the Estate and broadly was to give effect to the recommendations of the committee of inquiry estabUshed under Mr Justice Hope in April 1973. That Committee, with its 8 members, set out to prepare an inventory of the National Estate. Each of these inventory items was to be evaluated in terms of its condition and the steps which would need to be taken to ensure its proand enhancement. As a mark of its good faith and the seriousness of its resolution the Only Government, even before the Hope Committee amendhad completed its work, approved grants of frusmore than $2m to organisations and State and I local governments. The main theme of the Hope Committee report which was presented in April 1974 can probably be conveyed in a brief extract legislation. The from the report. Australian Government has inherited a National Estate has been downgraded, disregarded and neglected. All previous priorities accepted at various levels of government and authority have been directed by a concept that undevelopment, economic growth and progress and uie encouragement of private as against public interest in use, use of waters, and indeed in every part of the grants proNational Estate, was paramount. and An interim committee was appointed in Sepa tember 1974 and that interim committee had a very large membership-som e 17 members. They were representative of the areas of expertthe ise involved with the consideration of the National Estate and its preservation. They environmentalists and anthropologists. I think there were 7 Commonwealth departmental heads. There were scientists and architects and very distinguished public servants represenof the tative of all the States in Australia. I have heard talk tonight about federalism. This was a genuine effort in support of the concept of federalism because all the States were inThe volved and these people worked to give effect to that far-reaching set of recommendations contained in the Hope report. The broad nature of the Committee structure was a tremendously significant factor. I cannot over-emphasise that tonight. In June 197S the Austrahan Heritage Commission Bill was presented to Parhament. The concept of appointing a permanent commission was approved by way of legislation in this Parliament. The Chairman was appointed and the other members-som e 18-were to be appointed subsequendy. These appointments had not been made when the coup occurred on 11 November last. Honourable members can gain the understanding that the Whitlam Government-the Labor Government-wa s well and truly on the way to giving effect to the Hope Committee recommendations. The Interim Committee certainly has done a very great job. I should like to mention its terms of reference. It was to advise the Ministers-that was the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for Environment-o n legislation to create an Austrahan heritage commission, on grants from the 1974 National Estate nnanciai assistance programs and on any other matters related to National Estate issues. The objectives of that Interim Committee were along these lines: The identification and classification of sites; the legal protection of designated sites; the physical protection, includregister ing maintenance, restoration, management and preservation of sites; professional and technical training; community education and information; and support for community groups concerned with protection of the National Estate. Thefirst3 objectives which I have mentioned were given the highest priority by the Interim Committee. It is interesting to note that the Committee was active in advising on the distribution of grants under 3 major programs within the Government's National Estate allocations. The program of the Department of Urban and Regional Development in 1974-75 received $8m as a result of those recommmendations for historic buildings and sites, urban and open space and for National Trusts. The Department of the Environment's program on grants to conservation bodies, amounting to $448,000 was a recommendation of the Interim Committee as was the program of the Department of the Environment for acquisition of land for nature conservation. This involved expenditure of $9m. On 4 June 1976 the Austrahan Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1976 was introduced. main issue in this Bill involves a reduction in the size of the Commission. The Commission will be reduced to 6 members- a reduction of some 12 members. Of course, this will have the effect of excluding from the smaller body the States, certainly local governments and many other interest groups including environmentalists and people concerned about Aboriginal affairs, possibly the National Trust bodies and lots of other representatives who hitherto would have been on that bigger body. The Government's talk about federalism just does not carry any weight in this situation. The number of Permanent Heads of departments on the Commission are to be reduced in numbers as well. The sequel will be a lack of co-ordination between the Federal departments that have some kind of involvement in matters relating to the National Estate and the whole of the Heritage Commission's work will be affected. The Commission will be disadvantaged and so will the Parhament and the people. The Commission also is to lose the responsibility of advising on grants andfinancialassistance. It seems to me that the Government does not want anybody-n o matter how representative-exposing the potential of work that should be done by the Heritage Commission. The Government just does not want to receive any recommendations because undoubtedly it will not be prepared to fund the recommendations of the Commission. The Government willfindall this very embarrassing. So, we find that the new Commission is virtually limited to setting up a of components of the National Estate. It is certainly an innocuous and relatively ineffective body compared with the body which was sponsored by my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), when he was Minister for Urban and Regional Development. In respect of the current situation I should like to mention the funds which have been allocated. In 1975-76 the National Trusts were funded effectively so that in each State grants were made of $30,000. In addition, $125,000 was appropriated for the Territories under the National Estate's program. In 1976-77 the National Trust will receive the same amount as in the previous year and that is equal to a 13 per cent drop in real terms over the previous Budget allocation. The inflationary factor apphed to the same amount gives that 13 per cent diminution in effective value. The Government has really cut into the ability of the National Trusts to serve this concept. Similarly, the National Estate program for the Territories has been adversely affected. Their allocation has been deleted altogether. The National Park and Wildlife Service has had budget cut by an effective 78 per cent from $l in 1975-76 to $240,000 in 1976-77. The next matter that causes me concern is the number of commissioners to operate in respect of the Heritage Commission. This Bill reduces the sationwhere number of part-time commissioners from 19 to 7 tected and removes the requirement that up to 6 Perdisposed, manent Heads of Government departments or committed authorities may be appointed to the Commission and states that no more than two may be so appointed. So much for co-operation between departments in order to protect our heritage which was so importandy stressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his reading speech. As I mentioned earUer- I want to emphasise this point-the Opposition moved that each State be represented on the Commission. But this, despite the new federalism poUcy of the Government, has been put into Umbo. The real result is that, whereas the princito pal Act aUowed for wide ranging representafor tion-a wide ranging Commission, if you likeit representing not only the States but all the interested organisations such as the National Trust organisations, Aboriginal groups and vironmental protection groups, this Act Umits range of expertise avaUable to the Commission and increases theu* workload to such an extent that the program of saving the National will be put back many years. I should now Uke to refer to the question of sacred sites because I believe that one of the important parts of this Bill relates to the ment of section 23 of the principal Act. The amendment in this Bill will effectively eUminate the protection of sacred Aboriginal sites from Federal jurisdiction. This amendment removes from the Commission the authority to place the register Aboriginal sacred sites unless, firstly,the they are already classified under State or tory Acts or ordinances or, secondly, recommensites. dations are accepted by the Mmister from proved persons or organisations. When this legisfunding lation is read with the Nothern Territory land rights legislation that has been introduced into this Parhament, with the new proposal to hand back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the power to regulate sacred sites, when the record of that Assembly is viewed the Parliament, we will see why the Hope ComCommittee mittee of inquiry was so definite in recommendrecommended: ing that this area be placed under Federal control. Commenting on the legislative protection afforded by the States, the Hope Committee stated that the State legislation allowed for the declaration of a temporary sacred site, effective its immediately, and for 6 months after the negom tiations were entered into. The report, in part, stated: Regrettably this is not the case in the Nonhern Territory the Ordinance provides that acquisition with compenmust occur before a site may be designated or proin any way. Thus a landholder or lessee, if he is so may destroy a site with impunity as no onence is until the site has been acquired and declared. The Northern Territory ordinance is clearly ineffective and needs to be brought with aU urgency at least to the standard generaUy accepted second in the States if not improved on. has The words that I have been reading are not mine; they are the considered words of the Hope Committee of Inquiry. They contam afirm,unequivocal and high principled recommendation this Government which has so little concern Aboriginal people and their sacred sites that has completely disregarded that veryfirmand forthright recommendation from this Committee of Inquiry. It is no wonder that the Aboriginal enbudget has been slashed by something like 33 the per cent or 34 per cent when the Government can ignore such a recommendation relating to Australia's culture and the heritage of the Estate indigenous people of this country. Under the Ordinance only 6 sites have been most declared between 1955 and 1973. In addition to amend the transfer back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly of power over Aboriginal sacred sites the Institute of Aboriginal Studies budget for 1976-77 has been severely reduced. This will have a wide ranging effect on Aborigion nal programs, one of the most important being traming of Aboriginals as site recorders, site Terriwardens and guardians of Aboriginal sacred Another aspect of the Australian Institute apof Aboriginal Studies program has been the of specific programs administered by the State and Territory authorities and agencies into the recording of Aboriginal sacred sites. The effect of the Budget cuts will be to Umit such studies and funding of studies to approximately and 60 per cent of the 1975-76 Budget aUocation. In by relation to Aboriginal sacred sites, the Hope of Inquiry into the National Estate (a) that the Australian Government introduce legislation to give uniform protection on a national basis to Aboriginal sites of significance throughout Australia; (b) that the provisions of the legislation be drawn into discussions with the State authorities who have the present responsibility vation of these sites, and (c) that the Aboriginal people be afforded every opportunity for full and effective consultation throughout the process of drafting. It is clear that the recommendations of the Hope Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate with regard to sacred Aboriginal sites have been totally ignored by this Government. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) must accept responsibihty for this. The funcdons of the Heritage Commission have been undermined. The Fraser Government has removed parts (b) and (c) of the principal Act relating to the functions of the Commission. That is, it has removed the powers to recommend expenditure on programs of preservation and conservation and has abolished the Commission'srightto authorise grants for research through the States or through their own efforts. The effect of such a deletion may well be that the Heritage Commission will become yet another lame duck commission acting in name only, and that the Austrahan heritage, sought to be protected by many thousands of Australians and acted on by the former Labor Administration, will now take second place to the industrial, mining and pastoral development of Australia. The party of speculators is back in government. The well being of the ordinary people and the indigenous people of this country, and the preservation of our National Estate can take second place, it seems for the period-the Umited period, I hope-that this Liberal-National Country Party CoaUtion wiU be in office.",83
205,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"Northern Territory) (10.14)Before dealing with the Bill I wish to make some observations on the comments of some of the previous speakers. The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), spoke at length about Aboriginal sites and deplored the fact that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly may have some authority with regard to assisting the Aborigines in declaring and having declared sacred sites. What does he know about the Northern Territory and what the Aborigines themselves know about their own law, whether it is their land law or their Aboriginal sites? He was the man who produced a nonsensical Bill about Aboriginal land rights. He gets up in this House and attacks the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly-peopl e who have been born in the Northern Territory, and who have worked in the Northern Territory and who would know far more than the whole of his former Department put together, about land for die conservation and preserrights, Aboriginal sacred sites and Aboriginal law. That will be proved before very long. He and his coUeaguesrisein this place and, in thencomplete and utter ignorance, parrot remarks of that kind. The Legislative Assembly has fought for the Aborigines. Members of the Australian Labor Party wished to have the right of entry-the permit system-throw n out so that aU their left wing mates could go through the settlements in Arnhem Land. Year after year the Liberal and Country Parties fought for the right of Aborigines to decide who went into these parts of the country. Mr Garrick- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member's remarks do not relate to the Bill before the House.",86
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,I think there has been a Uttle Ucence so far in the debate. There is no substance in the point of order.,86
207,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I was provoked to say that because the former Minister spent a lot of time on this subject. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence. Mr Garrick-Ge t back to the Bill.",86
208,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I am coming back to the Bill, but I am discussing the remarks of previous speakers. The former Minister then said that the budget for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been slashed by 34 per cent, but he neglected to say that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) have assured the Parliament that after the interdepartmental committee report and the Hay report on the tremendous wastage which occurred when he was the Minister",86
209,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,You have not even seen the Hay report.,86
210,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"Of course I have not seen it, and neither has the honourable member-no r should he have seen it.",86
211,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,Then what are you saying?,86
212,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"All right, I refer to the interdepartmental committee report on the shocking waste of money under the Labor Government. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Treasurer have said that money will be provided for Aboriginal enterprises. The former Minister went on to say that the speculators had now arrived on the scene and that the Aborigines would get nothing out ofit. For Heaven's sake, if the place is not developed the Aborigines will not get anything out of it, anyhow. I ask honourable members to remember that. In many areas Aborigines are getting quite a lot of money out of these enterprises, whether they be on Groote Eylandt, at Yirrkala or anywhere else. The former Minister knows only too well that the Aborigines are getting millions of dollars out of these projects for their own enterprises; and so they should. Now I come to what was said by the former Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), in most emotional speech. He said that the national heritage had been downgraded by years neglect and that this would continue under the Liberal-Country Party Government. I find that in the 1974-75 Budget proposals he and his partment were asking for $73m to set up trahan Heritage Commission.",86
213,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,How much?,87
214,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"In that year there were grants of $5.8m. I am led to beheve that the present Government is voting $ 1.35m to get the Commission under way. I see that the honourable the member nods his head. Then he said that this Government cannot be trusted. That is absolute and utter nonsense. He was terribly emotional the whole subject. I refer to an article concerning the Heritage Commission which appeared in the Canberra Times of 28 July last. The Government is spoken of as having the unpopular task administering the National Estate maintain strict Budget restraints. That fact having been acknowledged at the first meeting of the established Commission, the Minister for Environment, had been Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) said that the Commission had no doubt that the Government was pohcies which would protect the environment. He said: All commitments arising from programs in previous will be met. The Government has been subjected to a tirade about it intending to do nothing about the National Estate. The Minister has said exactly the opposite. The previous Minister kept on fighting-of course he would-for these high ideals and for money which his Government and Australia could not produce. AU of us could do the same thing-w e could have these great ideals. Let us face facts. There is nothing wrong with that, but we must pay for them somewhere along the Une. Honourable members opposite must remember that. It is no use their coming into this place tonight or at any othertimeand making a great noise about what would have happened if only they had the money. They had these fine ideals.",87
215,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,Why are you opposing the Commission?,87
216,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I am not opposing it at aU. The former Minister blamed the Treasury. He blamed this Government. We cannot have the stars. Let us look up to them, by aU means. I am not slamming him for introducing the original legislation. He said that the programs were destroyed by this Government. What he and the a Australian Labor Party forget, and what I hope the Australian pubUc does not forget, is that the of previous Government nearly destroyed Australia. It gave Australia and this Government no chance to carry out ideals of that sort. The Deprevious Government left us with no money the Auswhatever. It nearly broke the country. Mr Innes-Tell us what you intend to spend on defence. Tell us your priorities.",87
217,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"Since you are so keen to raise the matter, the previous Government ran down defence of this country. It did so in its sociaUst manner, in the hope that at some time in the future there would be no one left to defend it, the on same as in ChUe. The former Mmister, in his emotional tirade, said that the ALP was the curator, not the liquidator. He said that the poUcies were dismantled by this Government. The of Chairman of the Commission, Mr David while trying to Yencken, said: The future of the Heritage Commission, which was being by the Labor Government before its dismissal, in doubt for months because of uncertainty about its acceptance by the Fraser Government. The former Minister has been hammering that. committed to Mr Yencken also said: Amendments to the Act introduced by the Prime Minister 2 weeks ago had not removed or affected any of the imporyears tant roles or powers of the Commission. Why all this emotionaUsm? Why all these false attacks? If the previous Government had paid more attention to keeping down inflation and unemployment, to supporting the primary industries and the exports which earn the money, which would have given it the means to pay for these high ideals, mstead of supporting the Coombs report, company bashing, business bashing, private enterprise bashing and so many of the long-hairs, bludgers, no-hopers and nonworkers around the country, it might have had the money and it might stUl be in government. If it had done that in government we would have had the money to do all these things. I return to the Bill. The original Bill received assent in June 1975.1 note that there were 12 to 19 members of the Commission. I note that now there will be one Chairman and 6 commissioners. Looking at their names, I think they would be commendable people. I am sure they are. Mr Innes-There are 6 States. Will each State be represented?",87
218,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I hope they will work with the States and the Territories. We have had so much misinformation about the Northern Territory Legisladve Assembly this evening. I hope the commissioners will work with the thousands of private citizens, including myself, who are more than interested in this sort of thing. Mr Innes-11 1 bet you are interested.",88
219,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"Look up my record, you mug.",88
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION, I Order! The honourable member for the Northment ern Territory will withdraw that remark,88
221,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"It is probably true, but I withditional draw it.",88
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,I suggest that the honourable member for Melbourne allow the honourable member for the Northern Territory to make his speech on his own.,88
223,Mr CALDER,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I have been subject to constant harassment. In the next 12 months a register will be established. It will take a long time and a lot of money. Why does the Labor Party and the former Minister think they are the only people in Austraha interested in these things? It is a mammoth job. It is a job for all Austrahans. I commend the Government on the appointment of a private citizen as chairman. I am sure he will very good chairman. The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and other people seem to think that the most nificant part of the National Estate concerns Abgreat original sites. These issues can be quite complex. Where are these sites? Did I hear an interjection earlier that there should be a member of the Commission from each State? I am not criticising the members of the Commission. They probably know something about the national heritage. I do not know what they know about Aboriginal an sites. I have no complaints about them. If the Commission is to have a lot to do with sacred Aboriginal sites, let us see on the Commission someone from the Northern Territory, someone from the north of Western Austraha, someone from South Australia or someone from Queensland. I would hke the Government to look at that suggestion. I deal now with clause 3 of the Bill. When discussing the original Bill a former member referred to the fact that the word 'aboriginals' is used. That word strikes me as being the adjective, not the noun. I do not think it should be 'aboriginals'. I think it should be 'Aborigines'. The definition that appeared in the Aboriginal Lands Fund Bill, the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and Labor Bills of that ilk appears again in this Bill. I want to know why this definition keeps on appearing. That definition is not acceptable to Aborigines in the Northern Territory or in Western Australia. There should be a definition which does not allow people who have never been to the Territory to go there and claim rights from people who were born and bred there or who have Uved there for many years. So ask this Government-the previous Governtook no notice-to look very closely at the definition. It could cause great strife among traAborigines when the matter of sacred sites or traditional landrightsis dealt with. Alter the definition before it is too late. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. NA Australian Opera Company-Shipbuildin g Industry-Touris t Industry in Queensland",88
224,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 18 February 1976,1 propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",88
225,Mr GRAHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"It is be a my privUege this evening on behalf of the organisation known as the Friends of the Australian Opera to bring before the Parliament the problems of the Australian Opera Company. I sigwould Uke the Parliament to know that there is distress at the seriousness of the financial position of the Australian Opera Company. I wish to bring attention to the urgent need for immediate action to avoid jeopardising the future of what has become a major national institution in the relatively short period of 20 years. We may feel here in Australia that we are unable to afford opera company at this stage. If that is the case I think we ought to consider the fact that this may well mean that we will never have a viable opera company. Twenty years ago numerous Australian singers had to go overseas to gain time employment as singers. They could obtain only three or four months employment in a year in Austraha at that stage. Many of these singers, as honourable members would know, have attained world renown and some have now returned to the Austrahan Opera Company because they want to Uve in Australia and to sing on a professional and fuU-time basis. With the present structure of the Opera Company these would be reasonable expectations for these internationaUy famous Australians to hold. If the Opera Company should now have to revert to part-time activity many of these singers will have no choice but to return overseas. I can well foresee that if this occurs they will never again accept a contract in Australia as their expectations at this stage in 1976 have been so very much disappointed. I would Uke to bring to the attention of the decided House of Representatives a number relation to this matter. The Australian Opera perienced an increase of 4S.8 per cent in ticket any extra assistance to it. The sales between 1970 and 1976, a rise 224 900 to 328 000 paid attendances. In addition to this, aU Australians have the opportunity of enjoying the Company's work through radio and television broadcasts of its performances. Its subto An sidy level is drastically below subsidies generaUy received by overseas opera companies. In provide Australia it is approximately 42 per cent of mercial expenditure, and generaUy in Europe these ensure figures are as high as 80 per cent in countries petitively where opera companies have been estabUshed building over a long period. The Austrahan Opera Company is an enYet semble company that carries a responsibUity long-term employment for most of Australia's finest artists in thefieldof opera. Thencontinuity of employment ought not to be jeopardised, should we aUow them to be lost to overseas panies. The 12 musicians recently dismissed from the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra have had to be employed by the Australian Opera Company, since it is impossible to present opera to the standard which we now expect from the company with an insufficient number of players. Tbis employment has placed an additional cial burden on our Opera Company. In spite of the smaU number of opera productions it holds in stock because of its short history, the Australian Opera spends much less each year on new prowhere ductions than do most of the overseas compames. I bring this matter to the attention of the House in the hope that it will be brought to attention of the Government and that full- course we in Austraha can look forward with pride to the sustenance, development and further progress of the great Australian company. I know that there are many people in Sydney now who have come from other parts of Austraha to watch the opera in the Sydney Opera House. As the company travels around the other capital cities, many Australians have the opportunity to enjoy the wonderful professional performance of artists Uke Joan Sutherland who is, of course, internationaUy known, and others of whom all Australians includmg, I am sure, aU members on both sides of the House are very proud.",88
226,Mr WALLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I take the opportunity to raise a matter of vital importance in my electorate in its effect on the largest city in that electorate, the city of WhyaUa. The Federal Liberal-Country Party Government has in the last few days that the Australian of points in Despite vastlyindustry shipbuUding must go to the wall. exindustry, the Government circumstances changed in the has decided to refuse decision was taken from despite the pohcy adopted last aUtion parties. That poUcy stated:year by the coAustralian shipbuilding and repair industry is essential the national interest. The Liberal and Country parties believe Australia must maintain an independent capacity to and service the relevant requirements of our comshipping and our defence forces. A federal Liberal and Country Parry government will pursue policies which the ship building and repair industry operates as comand efficiendy as possible. In this we will provide a subsidy to protect our relatively small but vital industry. despite this statement of policy, the Governfor ment has taken the decision announced last Friday. The Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has endeavoured to explain away the decision by nor blaming the former Labor Government. The comLabor Government did not give any authorisation for the four 15 000 ton Australian National Line ships to be buUt overseas. The Liberal Country Party Government has given that authorisation. It is now considering giving authorisation for the importing of a further 4 ships, all of finanwhich could be built in Australian yards. Included in these 4 ships are two general cargo vessels for Broken Hill Pty Ltd, itself the owner of the largest shipyard in Australia. Of course, doUars count values such as loyalty to the nation and to one's own employees get short shrift. If BHP receives permission from this Government to import these 2 ships instead of buUding them in its own yard the employees of the the Whyalla shipyards will have a very bleak in due future to look forward to. Whyalla is a large decentralised city that relies on its 2 main secondary industries, namely ship building and steel works, for its very existence. With the possible close down of the shipyards because of the lack of orders, one-third of the main work force can look forward to a very gloomy future. Because of Whyalla's comparative isolation 245 miles from Adelaide, alternative employment opportunities are just non-existent. In one trade alone over 800 employees will be made redundant. In making the decision it has made, what plans does the Government have to relocate these people? What of those who have purchased houses in the city? Are they all to be thrown to the wolves? Quite recently a statement was made by Solan MCLennan of BHP that if the ship building industry was not profitable BHP did not feel that it had any responsibihty for Whyalla. Is this a natural reaction in a society such as the one we Uve in? When we look at the real situation at Whyalla we can see how irresponsible such a statement is. The shipyards are outside local boundaries, so they escape many normal responsibUities to local government. The whole infrastructure of Whyalla-housing , water and all the other essential services-ha s been provided by the South Australian government. The majority of its work force has been recruited overseas, with the Federal Government making the major contribution to the cost through the Department of Immigration. It operates under the Whyalla Indenture Act, which was considered a gift from the South Australian Playford Government with its many advantages to BHP. In view of this can it be said that BHP has no responsibUities to WhyaUa? Can it withdraw from the shipyards leaving behind a large pool of unemployment and a host of social problems? It appears that the industry in Whyalla is to receive no further consideration from either the Government or BHP and will be aUowed to grind to a standstill. Much has been said by Government supporters and the Minister for Transport regarding industrial relations. They have placed the blame on the employees in the industry. But it is a fact that there has been no major industrial dispute at Whyalla for a number of years. Those who saw the television program concerning Newcastle, on This Day Tonight, know that there has been no dispute there for quite some time. From my own knowledge of industrial relations at WhyaUa, the dogmatic approach of the major employer has been one of the main contributing factors in many of the earUer disputes that have taken place. If time aUowed I would give some detaUs. However, for a number of years there has been a reaUsation by the unions that some rationaUsation would assist the mdustry, with unions and employers agreeing to come to some suitable arrangements. In 1974 the previous Australian Labor Party Government sent a delegation overseas to see what was going on. Rank and file members were included in the delegation. However, this Government's decision, if carried out, will not aUow those discussions and examinations to show any results. In making comparisons between the output of Australian and Japanese yards, the Minister should also examine the more modern equipment in Japanese yards and the much less modern equipment in Australian yards- a legacy of the previous 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule. The more labour intensive Australian yards have to compete with the more capital intensive yards of Japan.",89
227,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman'stimehas expired.,90
228,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,On a previous occasion in this House I mentioned just how diversified were the activities in my electorate. It is a very big electorate and part of the area that it covers are the islands of Moreton Bay. Mr Martyr-It is a beautiful bay.,90
229,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Indee d it is a most beautiful place. For many years it has been visited by hundreds of tourists every year, and that is the reason for my speaking in this adjournment debate tonight. The tourist industry that has been buUt up in the Bay islands area- I think especially of North Stradbroke Island and Point Lookout-is undergoing tremendous pressures at the moment and it looks as though the tourist industry in that area of Queensland could come to a grinding halt. I think that we should go back in time a Uttle and have a look at just what effect the tourist industry has had on this part of Queensland. The tourist resort of Point Lookout was begun in 1934 by the Kennedy famUy and, as a result of their venture on this island, thefirstpost office, thefirstaccommodation, the first shop and the first transport across an old bush track to this area of the island were established. The resort was taken over by the defence forces during World War II and was re-estabUshed after the war. Consequently a special barge service was set up between the mainland and the island to provide the first transport to the island. Mr Donald Cameron-Do not forget the Claytons.",90
230,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Since then a number of different organisations have been established there and, as the honourable member for Griffith reminds me, we have the Claytons guest house, the Headland Chalet, Samarinda resort and the Stradbroke Hotel set up there. But now costs are overcoming them. In the last few years the wages factor has resulted in a big downturn in the service that has been provided to the visitors to that part of the world, so much so that it has become completely a family concern, with famihes running these individual organisations. The Point Lookout-Stradbroke Island Tourist Development Association is appealing to the Government at the moment for some long term loans at low interest rates to help them get their particular problem. lem facing the whole of Queensland and many other areas of Austraha. I think that this remedy could get the tourist industry back on its feet again. The responsibility for this aspect of the tourist industry should not be left only to the Federal Government. I believe that State governments have a very real role to play in the rebuilding of the tourist industry, as has local government. Let wise me give an example of some of the problems facbetween ing the operators of resorts on islands off the the less modern coast of Queensland. In the case of Point lot more labour intensive Lookout on Stradbroke Island a particular with the more capital intensity organisauon is seeking to develop new facihties Added to attract more tourists. This of money. In addidon, the local council asked the economies of scale organisation to provide a 100 per cent bitumen time nation and a great car parking facility for every cabin in the complex. That in itself would cost between $60,000 aatblot and $70,000. On top of that the local authority ourselves wanted the organisauon also to provide $10,000 It is not tootolate towards the cost of making a new road. So that decision- a course project was shelved because, with the total costs heading to well over $100,000, it was not a viCountry Party Government able proposition. So we need understanding now for 9 months. It is too latehas from State and local governments as well. I will continue with what I was saying the need for long term loans at low interest rates for rebuilding the tourist industry It is a matter that I think should be brought to the attention of the Government and one which should be acted upon very quickly before vital tourist industry in Queensland and other parts of Australia comes to a grinding halt.",90
231,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I call the honourable member for Grey.,91
232,Mr WALLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to finish the remarks I was making earlier when I referred to the comparison between the AusCombined trahan and Japanese shipyards. The Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) should also examine the more modern equipment in Japanese yards and compare it with the much less modern equipment of the Australian yards. Mr Donald Cameron- I rise to order. My understanding of the Standing Orders is that there must be no other prospective speakers before an honourable member who has already spoken in the adjournment debate can rise to speak again. On my understanding even if 2 members on the same side of the House were to follow one another this would exclude a member who has already spoken. Mr Speaker, would you please tell me whether I am under a misappreover hension or whether my understanding is clear Indeed this is a proband precise?",91
233,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I think that the honourable member for Griffith is clear and precise but there was nobody standing. I looked around the chamber carefully and saw only the honourable member for Grey. I called him. I now call the honourable member for Grey to continue.,91
234,Mr WALLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, for a decision. I was talking about the difference the more modern Japanese yards and Australian yards. Our yards are a but we have to compete yards of Japan. to that is the fact that with the much will cost quite a deal larger volume of production in that country, can be achieved. As a maritrading nation, it will be on our conscience if we allow the shipyards Whyalla and Newcastle to close and leave the mercy of overseas shipbuUders. for the Government to reverse its course I hope it will Iadopt. would recommend and a The Liberal-National been in office for it to blame all its Uls on the former Labor Government. This about Government has had time to make its own decisions and it should take the blame for what it at a later date. has done. A couple of months ago the Government set the up a committee to examine the shipbuUding yards. Some of the members of that committee listened to what they were told-som e of them have made remarks to me-and they have shown concern about industrial relations at Whyalla. They were probably shocked to learn that the Broken HUl Pty Co. Ltd does not recognise the senior trade union body in that city, the Whyalla Union Council. It is essential if we are to achieve industrial harmony in these areas that the trade union organisations be represented. It would be very mteresting to know-w e will probably never know-wha t that Liberal committee which visited the shipyards recommended to the Government and whether it recommended the course of acdon that was taken. I repeat that it was not a good decision by the Government. It is not too late for the Government to reverse that decision. The Opposiuon certainly hopes that it will do so in the interests of the Austrahan nation and the people in the shipyards of Austraha. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.49 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Public Service: Staff Ceilings Mr Uren asked the Prime Minister, upon noUce: (1) What was the individual staff ceiling for each Australian Government Department and Authority in existence as at 30 October in each of the years 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975, and as at 29 February 1976. (2) What was die actual number of people employed by each of those Departments and Authoriues on the same dates. (3) What is the estimated individual establishments for the Departments and Authoriues currendy in existence as at 30 June 1976. (4) What is the difference between this estimate and the staff ceilings recendy set by him. Mr Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) It is not the practice to publish the individual ceilings set for each department and authority. (2) See attached tables A to E inclusive in respect of Public Service Act employment. Staff numbers in respect of non-Public Service Act employment for 29 February 1976 are listed in table G. NonPublic Service Act staff numbers for the other dates in question are not centrally recorded nor, in all cases, would they be readily available. However,figuresof staff numbers at 30 June 1975 are listed in table F. (3) The establishments at 30 June 1976 for Departments and those Authorities whose employment is under the Public Service Act are listed in table H. In respect of non-Public Service Act employment, the PubUc Service 'establishment' concept is not universalsome bodies do not have an 'estabUshment', and others have Aboriginal Affairs one in a Umited sense only, which makes their estabUshment Attorney-General's not comparable with diat of other authorities or depanments. Establishment figures have therefore not been provided in respect of non-PubUc Service Act employment. (4) See(l) above.

(3) What number of positions gained by the Department in the latter half of 1975 was tions to that Department from other than existing Departments or the result of the abolition of certain statutory authorities.",91
235,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT EMPLOYMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The establishment of the Depanment of Urban and Regional Development was 200 in October 1973; 267 in October 1974; and 1731 in October 1975. (b) It is not the practice to publish the individual ceilings set for each depan- December ment and authority. (2) The two major relevant changes in the Administrative Arrangements Order prior to December 1975, as they Since affected the Depanment, were the transfer of responsibility for the Australian Housing Corporation from the Minister for Housing and Construction, and the absorption of functions and staff of the Cities Commission into the Depaninquired ment of Urban and Regional Development. The changes volved increases in establishment of 1231 and respectively. (3) 1352 positions. Scrutiny of Members of Parliament Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice: Who is entitled to authorise police or security scrutiny of members of the parliaments of Australia and the States. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Total Services has provided the following reply to the 3 433 honourable member's question: 370 If circumstances were to arise that required either police or 722 security scrutiny of a member of parUament, the person en209 titled to authorise scrutiny would, as in the case of the scru1061 tiny of other citizens, be an appropriate poUce officer or (in security matters) the Director-General of the Australian Security IntelUgence Organization. In so far as the scrutiny 11314 would involve the interception of a telephone service, the 2 972 warrant of the Attorney-General issued at the request of the 10 057 Director-General would be required under the Telephonic 13 257 Communications (Interception) Act 1960. 2 558 1 659 Business College Subsidies (Question No. 285) 542 357 Mr STEWART asked the Minister representing 4 271 the Minister for Education, upon notice: 13 085 (1) How many private business colleges are receiving a subsidy for students under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, and how many have had appUcations for subsidy rejected. (2) What are the (a) names of, (b) locations of, and (c) (Question No. 219) amounts received by the approved coUeges. (3) What are the (a) names and (b) locations of the rejected coUeges. (4) What are the criteria applied in considering appUcations. (5) What is the future of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme.",98
236,Mr VINER,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT EMPLOYMENT,"The Minister for Education has supphed the following answer to the honourable member's question: the result of transfers of func(1) Fees assistance in respect of students at certain non profit making private institutions is not provided under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. This assistance is provided under a separate program. It is true however that all the full-time courses approved for fees assistance are also approved for Uving allowance payments under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. In 1975 there were ten private business colleges receiving fees assistance on behalf of their students. In November and 1975 an additional eight institutions were approved for fees assistance for 1976. However, in view of the economic situation it was decided between November and December that no funher institutions would be approved. 13 December 1975 eleven business colleges have been advised that no funher courses or colleges will be approved for fees assistance. There is also a number of other colleges the (exact numbers are not known) which have generally about the possibUity of gaining approval and what insteps were involved. They too have been advised that no 121 further colleges will be approved for 1976. (2) In 1975 the following colleges received fees assistance: New South Wales $ St Joseph's Business CoUege, Leichhardt 15,913.89 (Question No. 229) St Mary's Commercial CoUege, Paddington 15,725.00 St Patrick's Business CoUege, Sydney . . . 60,720.00 Bedford Baptist Business College, Sydney . 28,017.64 Hales Secretarial Colleges, Sydney . . . 97,300.00 Victoria Holmes Commercial Colleges, Melbourne . 171,130.00 Hales Secretarial CoUeges, Melbourne . . 48,204.00 South Australia Muirden Business Studies Centre, Adelaide Haies Secretarial Colleges, Adelaide . . . 48,204.00 Western Australia Edwards Secretarial College, Perth A number of institutions which had taken steps to become non profit making were approved for fees assistance for 1976. These were: Mercury College, Sydney Cambridge Secretarial College, Sydney Metropolitan Business College, Sydney Stotts Secretarial College, Melbourne Pride Business CoUege, Adelaide HartUl-Underwood Business College, Perth Olympia Business CoUege, Perth MitcheU CoUege, Hobart The amounts of fees assistance to be paid to these and other institutions in 1976 are not yet known since accounts have not been received for the full year in all cases. The maximum assistance payable is an amount per student up to the level of the 1975 enrolment calculated according to the fee charged in 1973 plus 44 per cent If the course commenced in a year later than 1973 a simUar formula is appUed. (3) Names and locations of colleges which were advised that no further coUeges were to be approved: Dacomb College, Melbourne, Victoria Riddell Commercial CoUege, Melbourne, Victoria Highfield CoUege, Caringbah, New South Wales Campsie Business College, Campsie Civic Nu-Way Business College, Newcastle, New South Wales National Business CoUege, Crows Nest, New South Wales Northern Business College, Pymble, New South Wales Parkes Secretarial CoUege, Ashfield, New South Wales B. A. Chown Pty Ltd, Chatswood, New South Wales Central Coast Secretarial CoUege, Gosford, New South Wales Stotts Secretarial CoUege, Perth, Western Australia (4) Prior to the decision not to approve any further colleges under this scheme, for a coUege to be approved it had to become non profit making in accordance with the appropriate regulations under the relevant sections of State legislauon. Articles of Association and the Memorandum of each institution were submitted for advice by the Attorney General's Department for confirmation of non profit status. In addidon, an examination of the course was made by the Depanment of Education. The criteria appUed included whether or not the courses were full-time, their equivalence to other approved courses, the absence of a reUgious entry test, and the nature of the quaUfication obtained. (5) The Government has stated that the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will be maintained. Mr Hyde asked the Minister for Transport, upon nodce: (1) What was Qantas' profit or loss in the financial year 1974-75. (2) What are Qantas' borrowings and at what interest rates are the outstanding loans. (3) Were these funds obtained at commercial interest rates. (4) If not, by how much was each loan above or below the current commercial interest rate at thetimeof borrowing. (5) Were the terms of any loans more generous than 50,356.78 would have been obtained by a normal loan subscribed by the pubUc. (6) Is Qantas a signatory to any restrictive agreement . . . 101,937.50 relating to fares, if so, what is the name of the agreement, what are its broad terms, and who are the other signatories. (7) Are some airfares to Australia higher than they would be if Qantas were not a signatory to a restrictive agreement, if so, by how much from: (a) Singapore; (b) Honolulu; and, (c) Auckland. (8) Are some airfares from Australia higher than they would be if Qantas were not a signatory to a restrictive agreement, if so, by how much to: (a) Singapore; (b) Honolulu; and, (c) Auckland. (9) Are airfares to and from Australia higher than they would be if other international airUnes which are not signatories to a restrictive agreement were encouraged to fly routes in and out of Australia. (10) If so, has any estimate been made of the cost to Australia's tourist trade resulting from these higher fares. (11) Would the terms of any agreement to which Qantas is a signatory be acceptable if entered into by two or more Australian domestic companies. (12) If not, which Act would be offended by the agreement, and in what manner. (13) What are the specific benefits to Australia of a flagcarrying airUne. (14) Are any routes flown by Qantas unprofitable, if so, which routes. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) For the financial year 1974-75 Qantas showed an operating profit, after realised gains and taxation, of $534,000. In addition, there was an extraordinary item arising from the sale of aircraft and other costs of $5,826,000 after tax. (2) Qantas' outstanding loans as at 31 March 1976 totaUedS 173.41m. The interest rates currently prevailing on such outstanding loans range from 5.25 per cent to 11.5 per cent as listed below: % $m 5.25 0.03 6.00 48.84 6.125 15.79 6.50 2.33 6.75 13.09 7.00 11.92 7.25 1.71 7.50 12.65 Qantas Finance 8.00 24.58 (Question No. 290) 8.50 0.26 9.50 26.84 10.25 2.37 11.50 13.00 (3) In accordance with Acts ofParliament loans amounting to $ 158.23m outstanding at 31 March 1976 were borrowed by the Australian Government and were made avaUable to Qantas for purchase of aircraft. Loans amounting to $15.18m also outstanding at 31 March 1976 were borrowed directly by Qantas at commercial rates of interest. (4) The loans of $158.23m initially by the Australian Government on behalf of Qantas came from the following broad sources: Export-Import Bank of the United States Public or Private issue Overseas bank loans Loans obtained from the Export-Import Bank of the United States were negotiated at interest rates prevailing at the time for loans to the Australian Government for the funding of American manufactured aircraft purchased for export from America. Overseas bank loans were negotiated on a competitive basis, the final selection of the lender being generally determined from an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the various offers as enunciated in the competitive quotations at the time. (5) The Export-Import Bank of the United States was established, inter alia, to provide United States funds to foreign governments and corporations for the purchase and export of US. manufactured equipment. The Export-Import Bank usually sets its interest rates at a competitive level to encourage the export of US. manufactured equipment. The Australian Government has normally availed itself of this finance for its transport authorities. It is unlikely that such interest rates would have been matched by public loans although this would depend upon the particular overseas country in which there was a public loans market. (6) As a member airline of the International Air Transport Association Qantas is a signatory to IATA agreements relating to fares which have been approved by the Australian Government. These IATA agreements establish, subject to Government approval, passenger fares, cargo rates and associated conditions of carriage and agency rules on international scheduled air services, including routes to and from Australia. Currently there are 109 member airUnes of IATA. The air services agreements that the Australian Government has concluded with twenty-four other countries require Qantas, as the Australian designated with the designated airline of the other party on the tariffs to be charged on the route concerned. Whenever possible such agreement is to be reached through IATA and, in all cases, the tariffs agreed by the airlines are subject to the approval of the Australian and the other Government. (7) and (8) In view of the above-outlined procedures governing the estabUshment of tariffs on scheduled international air services, it is not considered that air fares between Australia and, as instanced, Singapore, Honolulu and Auckland are higher than they would be if Qantas was not a member of IATA. The Australian Government considers that the approved fares to and from Australia are the lowest that are economicaUy viable in current circumstances having regard to the requirements of aU airUnes and governments concerned. (9) and (10) All airUnes operating scheduled services to and from Australia are required to abide by the tariffs and conditions approved by the Australian Government. These include agreements adopted by IATA and fares otherwise agreed by the airUnes concerned. Thus any additional nonIATA airUne which might obtainrightsto operate scheduled services to and from Australia would be bound by the same requirements. The Australian tourist industry has been one of the major beneficiaries of the various low fare schemes, such as excursion and package tour fares, which have been introduced in recent years by the international airUnes operating to and from Australia with the approval of the Australian Government. (11) and (12) Qantas is the only Australian company issued with a Ucence under the Air Navigation Act and Sm Regulations to operate international air services. Accord. . . 51.17 ingly, under IATA rules, it is the only Australian airUne eU17.42 gible to participate in the negotiation of tariffs within IATA. 89.64 (13) The benefits to Australia of having a flag-carrying airUne are numerous. To name the most important Qantas 158.23 provides an essential transport Unk for a country Uke Australia with its somewhat isolated geographical position. In 1975 the airUne carried 1 134 987 passengers and 27 268 tonnes of freight and maU to and from Australia. Qantas is able to participate in the procedures through which air fares to and from Australia and in other areas of the world are estabUshed. As one of Australia's largest employers (over 13 000 employees as at 31 March 1976) Qantas provides employment opportunities in a wide-range of skUls. The airUne makes a substantial contribution towards the nation's balance of payments position. In this regard, it has been estimated that, if Qantas' services had not been avaUable to the travelling pubUc in 1974-75, the net loss to Australia's balance of payments would have been about $ 175m. Qantas'fleetof eleven B747 and nine B707 aircraft and its pool of trained aircrew and technicians constitute a valuable defence reserve. Qantas also undertakes engine and instrument maintenance for the Services. (14) The international air transport industry has been operating for some years in very difficult economic conditions arising from a significant reduction in traflic growth and substantial increases in airline operating costs. WhUe these conditions prevaU all airUnes find it extremely difficult to operate profitably. Qantas has withdrawn from certain uneconomic routes in recent years, which after vigorous promotion by Qantas provided Uttle prospect for improvement in the future. There are many other routes operated by Qantas where the yields at a time in which the international airline market is depressed are somewhat less than desirable, but which are maintained because they are considered essential, not only from the point of view of the interests of the travelling pubUc, but also with respect to Qantas' commercial requirements having regard to longer term prospects. airUne, to reach agreement Applications for Australian Citizenship (Question No. 304) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: How many persons over 16 years of age in each nationality are residentiaUy quaUfied to apply for Australian citizenship but have not done so. Mr MACKellar-In reply to the honourable member's question, the following table shows the estimated number of aliens 16 years of age and over who are residentiaUy qualified, by virtue of three years residence in Australia, to apply for the grant of Australian citizenship but who had not done so as at 31 May, 1976: NationaUty Number (b) Albanian 200 Argentinian 1 160 Austrian 7 530 Belgian 1340 BoUvian 60 Brazitian 450 Bulgarian 250 Burmese 600 ChUean 2 540 Chinese 1950 Colombian 200 Nationality Cuban Czechoslovak Danish Dutch Ecuadorean Egyptian (UA.R.) Estonian Filipino Finnish French German Greek Hungarian Indonesian Iranian Iraqi Israeli Italian Japanese Jordanian Korean Latvian Lebanese Lithuanian Mexican Norwegian Peruvian Polish Portugese Romanian Russian (a) Saudi Arabian Spanish Sudanese Swedish Swiss Syrian Thai Turkish Ukrainian Uruguayan US. American Venezuelan Vietnamese Yugoslav Stateless Other Nationality not stated Total (a) Includes Byelorussians (b) The estimation of the number of aliens eligible to apply for citizenship in Australia is based on a computer table, following the transfer of the manual records into computer system. Conversion to computer processing has resulted in a validation of the manual records previously maintained. This validation has resulted in some variations to figures compiled under manual methods before June 1972. The table excludes nationals of countries of the Commonwealth of Nations who, under Australian law, have British subject status and are not required to register on arrival in Australia in the same way as other settlers. It will not be possible to estimate accurately the number of such people who are eUgible until the next census ofpopulation.

Other aircraft are available within Australia and, I understand, IPEC is negotiating with the owners of those aircraft. use a facepiece; if not, why not. (3) Yes. The IPEC claims would, of course, be disputed by other operators. I expect that Mr Nimmo would have reviewed his recommendations if it were demonstrated that a more efficient and cheaper air freight service were available. No doubt the extent of the review would have depended upon the extent of the efficiency and the cheaper rates.

(4) Are line maintenance gang numbers being maintained with at a level that will ensure safe railway operations. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable to the national member's quesdon is as follows: (1) Staff on the former Commonwealth Railways section to of Australian National Railways have been reduced in midday numbers from 4208 to 4056 since staff ceilings were when Parliament is introduced. While ceilings were not set by the Government for the South Australian or Tasmanian sections of Australian National Railways, the Commission directed that these system endeavour to reach target ceilings imposed by the Comby 30 June 1976 of8000 and 2000 respectively. On 1 May 1976, staff levels had reached 8240 in South Australia 1990 in Tasmania. (2) Detailed information is not available for the South Ausualian and Tasmanian systems which are at present administered bytiieState authorities on behalf of Australian National Railways and the following detailed information relates to the former Commonwealth Railways system. (Question No. 690) Reductions in respect of (a) salaried and (b) wages staff for each Branch of the former Commonwealth Railways system are as follows: Salaried Staff Wages Staff Total From To From To From To 128 121 1 458 1 381 1 586 1 502 18 17 35 42 S3 59 103 106 756 716 859 822 261 260 859 842 1 120 1 102 161 159 117 109 278 268 33 33 174 168 207 201 22 23 18 16 40 39 65 63 65 63 791 782 3 417 3 274 4 208 4 056 (3) The number of employees in line maintenance gangs has been reduced from 562 to 513 since staff ceilings were introduced.

Local Telephone Calls Mr Short asked the Minister for Post and did Telecommunicauons, upon nodce: (1) What would be the capital cost involved in adapting introducing telephone equipment to have local calls charged on a 3 minute unit basis. (2) What would be the increase in annual Telecommunications Commission if local calls were charged on a 3 minute unit basis at the present local call rate for each 3 minute unit. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Telecom Australia advises that initial studies show that capital expenditure of at least $50m would be involved in modifying existing equipment to provide fortimedlocal calls. Importantly, the necessary modifications could take quite some years to effect bearing in mind the many other major capital works necessary to expand the network to meet traffic growth as well as to provide unproved facUities and replace obsolescent equipment. (2) ReUable estimates are not avaUable. Studies made cations some time ago showed that the average duration of local calls in predominantly business areas was below 3 minutes and the average for calls in predominantly residential areas was above that period. However, the untimed local call tem has been so long estabUshed in tremely difficult to estimate the effect which timing would have on residential subscribers' hence the additional revenue that might accrue. Studies on where theappUcations, this and related aspects are in hand. Mr MACKenzie asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons, upon notice: (1) Is a career in farm management, either as an operator or as an employed manager, propriate occupation for training under the NEAT Scheme. (2) Are courses in farm management offered by agricultural colleges recognised as appropriate retraining courses for persons wishing to enter the rural industry. (3) How many appUcations for farm management training under the NEAT Scheme were (a) received and (b) rejected in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and what were the main reasons for rejection. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable whole member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Assistance ment as a farm manager is avaUable subject to the following conditions which apply to all those seeking assistance under NEAT;first,the appUcant must be a person who is unable to obtain employment with his or her current skills; second, there must be a strong labour market demand for the occuNew South Wales pation in which training is to be provided. As to the second condition, research by my Department indicates that newly quaUfied farm managers can expect to face a selective labour market, although this is somewhat less the case in Victoria. is to ensure safe operation of to Regrettably I am unable to answer the honourable member's statistical questions in the full detail that he requires. However, 111 persons were approved for training in farm management between 1 October 1974 and 31 December 1975. (Question No. 698) In the period 1 October 1974 and 30 June 1975 some 76 persons who had appUed for assistance with such training not pursue their appUcations or were not approved for assistance. or Training under NEAT has been undertaken at various agricultural coUeges throughout the country, both private and Government funded institutions. Preference has normaUy been given to the latter, but the needs of the individual revenue to the are taken into account. Applications for Telephones (Question No. 708) Mr Wilson asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) What reduction could be made in the backlog of deferred appUcations for telephones if the construction staff and resources allocated to the giant co-axial cable project announced by Telecom in a press statement dated 5 May 1976 were diverted to providing telephone services to those who have appUed for them or are Ukely to apply for them in the immediate future. (2) How many and what proportion of the deferred appUfor telephones are there in each of the States. (3) How many and what proportion of the deferred applications for telephones are there in (a) Adelaide, (b) Brissysbane, (c) Canberra, (d) Hobart, (e) Melbourne, (f) Perth Australia that it is exand (g) Sydney. (4) What steps are being taken to reduce the number of local catling habits and deferred particularly in those States and cities proportion is higher than average. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourNEAT Scheme able member's question is as follows: (Question No. 701) (1) Telecom Australia as well as meeting current demands for new subscriber telephone services has an obUgation to extend the telecommunications network to improve its services for existing subscribers. The Commission advises that ownerthe Ceduna-Cobar coaxial trunk cable project is being recognised as an apundertaken to: cater for the increasing trunk traffiic between the Eastern States and South Australia and Western Australia and for international caUs connected over the Indian Ocean satelUte provide route diversity, and thus more security, for EastWest trunk traffic and international calls, and incorporate Broken HUl in the national STD network.

Positions vary widely in their duties and responsibilities and therefore in they are accorded. In some situations, positions of higher classification may have counter contact with the public as a second stage when complex issues are raised at the primary contact level. The following table provides a guide to the range of classifications and duties of positions in depanments and agencies which have counter contact with the public: Classifications of Positions which have Counter Contact (a) Primary Contact Classification Clerical Assistant, Grade 1 Clerical Assistant, Grade 2 Clerical Assistant, Grade 3 Clerical Assistant, Grade 4 Clerical Assistant, Grade 5 Clerical Assistant, Grade 6 Clerical Assistant, Grade 7 Assistant, Grade 2 Assistant, Grade 3 Clerk, Class 1 Clerk, Class 2/3 Clerk, Class 4 Preventive Officer Senior Preventive Officer, Grade 1 Senior Preventive Officer, Grade 2 (b) 'Second Stage' Clerk, Class 4 and above Examples of Typical Duties for Counter Staff (a) Primary Contact Reception and direction of visitors; Primary contact point for information on services available; Simple inquiries on limited range of facilities and services; Receive applications and examine for completeness; Give information on a wide range of benefits, facilities or services; Cashier/Collector of Public Monies; Guide visitors; answer simple queries about production processes; Counter supervisor; deal with complex enquiries; Receive applications; assess fees and collect payments; Taxation enquiries; Examine passenger and crew baggage and effects.

The IAC uses the concept of minimum efficient scale (m.e.s.) which is where doubling of scale of production would not reduce costs by more than 2 per cent. The IAC found that the m.e.s. of stamping was 600 000 p.a. and of engine manufacture 3S0 000 p.a., and concluded that to take full advantage of economies of scale a manufacturer would need to fully utilise a plant with a capacity of 400 000 p.a. However, it appears that once 200 000 p.a. is reached, the put are greatly reduced. (2) The IAC found that total Australian capacity (for the three manufacturers) was 430 000 p.a. for stamping and 440 000 for engine manufacture. Details of capacity on a plant by plant basis are not available as this information is regarded by vehicle manufacturing companies as confidential. (3) According to figures produced by the IAC in its 1974 report, the variable cost of producing a vehicle (excluding fixed overheads) ranged from $2,200 per vehicle at a production run of 30 000 p.a. 500 000 p.a.
