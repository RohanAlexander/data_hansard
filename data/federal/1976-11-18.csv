The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That the use of uranium as a source of energy is currently unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (c) That then; is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposing of radioacuve wastes, nor is there likely to be. (d) That the export of uranium from Australia is internationally irresponsible and is not, in the long term, of benefit to Australia. (e) That the export of uranium from Australia discourages importing countries development funds in finding viable alternatives. (0 That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved third world will increase yet further. (g) That the securing of land rights by Australian Aborigines, promised by successive governments, is prejudiced by uranium mining. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of uranium until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world's energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity.

Budget 1976-77 To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The Budget will increase unemployment to unprecedented and crisis proportions at a time when hundreds of thousands of Australians, especially school-leavers, young workers and apprentices, are without work; the Budget completes the dismantling of Medibank as a simple, effective universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community; the Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transport programs, will worsen the quality of life available to many Australians; the Budget will compel state governments to reduce their services and increase charges; the Budgetreducesspending on Aboriginal affairs by 30 per cent expenditure on Aborigines to pre-1972 days; the Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leaves room for concern over the future of ethnic radio; the Budget, despite the government's earlier rhetoric about defence threats to Australia, continues to hold the size of the armed services at levels; and the Budget, despite all the above, still expected to reduce Australia's annual inflation rate below twelve per cent.

That Technical Assistance Grants and Administrative Support Grants to community organisations are needed to partially redress the gross imbalance in technical expertise and resources suffered by community's case against the exploiter.

3,Mr JACOBI,URANIUM PRICE FIXING,"I draw the attention of the Attorney-General to my questions on notice relating to alleged uranium price fixing and action being taken under the United States antitrust laws. Is the Minister aware that subpoenas were lodged in the Supreme Court of New South Wales last Tuesday week? I am led to understand that requests for the collection of evidence of this nature for foreign tribunals would be regulated by the practices and procedures of relevant State courts. Has the Minister considered taking legislative action similar to that taken by the Canadian Government last September where it approved a regulation under the Atomic Energy Control Act to prevent removal from Canada of information relating to this matin jeopardy, as a new ship order ter? Can the Minister state what effects the action being taken under the United States anti-trust laws will have on his Government's uranium policies? Finally, can I get an answer to the questions that have been on the notice paper since 8 September?",19
4,Mr ELLICOTT,URANIUM PRICE FIXING,"There has been, I understand, what is called a letter of requestfiledin the Supreme Court of New South Wales which seeks evidence, including documents and oral evidence, from Australian companies which are interested in uranium mining. I think the request originates from a suit in a court in the United States. The honourable gentleman is quite correct when he says that this is regulated by some procedure of the New South Wales jurisdiction. I think it is called the foreign tribunals evidence The procedure. A procedure is laid down. This matter arising raises significant questions. For instance, there is the question as to whether in international law matters the United States anti-trust law does not travel too far because the anti-trust law of the United States not only extends to residents and corporexample ations of the United States but also touches residents. The serious question is raised by some people as to whether it does not go too far. Another question arises out of the fact Australian Government does have considerable power to fix, under the Customs (Prohibited nard, Exports) Regulations, the terms and conditions and I had upon which uranium, if it were exported from this country, would be so exported. The matter of whether such evidence should be produced under consideration at the moment. I will see whether the answers to the questions which the and honourable member has placed on notice can be for Defence. expedited if they are not already on the way. MAJOR-GENERAL STRETTON",19
5,Mr CHAPMAN,URANIUM PRICE FIXING,Is the Minister for Defence aware of Press reports that he has initiated inquiry into the allegations made by Major General Stretton? Can the Minister tell me the much. nature and extent of the inquiry? Will he make available the documents presented to the observes: Government yesterday?,20
6,Mr KILLEN,URANIUM PRICE FIXING,"This is thefirstquestion have been asked in this House concerning I Major-General Stretton. As a consequence of that I would have thought it strange that the word 'inquiry' would be attributed to me. I not used the word 'inquiry' in connection with Major-General Stretton at anytime.The word 'inquiry' has not come from my hps. I hope there is no ambiguity about that. Yesterday my arise, colleague, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, was asked a question on this matter. will read to the House what the honourable senaecutor tor said. He said: The Minister for Defence advises me that he has read the bookThat is, Major-General Stretton's bookand the official reports on the subject. It is the Minister's opinion that there are undeniable and the reports. He has put to study all criticisms Major-General Stretton. I repeat that for the benefit of honourable House members: HeKillenhas put to study all criticisms made by Major-General Stretton. The Minister went on to say: Minister has no intention of seeking to hide anything out of the book or the reports. It is undeniable that there are lessons to be learned arising out of cyclone Tracy. The Minister himself, when in Opposition, raised several in a question in another place in relation to the procedures adopted in Darwin following the cyclone. I want to give to the House and to the country an of the sort of conflicts I have in mind. I nonleave it to the quiet judgment of honourable gentlemen as to whether there are conflicts. Let me give 2 illustrations. On page 27 of the book that the Major-General Stretton says this: I had no ministerial authority. My own Minister, Mr Barwas incommunicado at a holiday resort in Tasmania to deal with his private secretary in Canberra. Yet in his official report to the Parliament, tabled is in this House, the General observes: The national emergency operations centre was activated the defence force alerted at the direction of the Minister If a man is incommunicado, how is he going to alert anything? That is one conflict. I will pass on to give another one. At page 158 of the book, after making allegations regarding one unit, the an General concludes with this sentence: I came close to being ashamed of the Service I love so Yet in paragraph 13 of his report, the General The 3 branches of the defence force played a major role in that I the relief operation. would have thought that if he came to the state at which he was ashamed of the Service he loved, he would have said so in his oflicial report. That have was the place to state it. The General would know that if the Crown presents an indictment against a person charged with some offence and within the Crown case conflicts of that nature any counsel worth his salt will be on his feet saying to the judge: ' I ask your Honour to I take a certain course-to direct the Crown prosto return the indictment and to enter a nolle prosequi'. I confess to the fact that I am mildly prejudiced in this matter. I cannot say that I am disinterested because I placed 24 questions on the notice paper concerning cyclone Tracy at the conflicts between the book made by time. Hindsight is the best of all sight, as we know. We learn from experience. But I tell the this: I sought during the crisis to get a man into Darwin. I think that he was the manager at thetimeof Tickle Industries. It so happens that Tickle Industries provides 80 or 90 per cent of the food distributed in Darwin. I could not get a permit for that man. I reacted predictably, as all honourable gentlemen would know. I had a word with a person in the national emergency headquarters. Knowing the delicacy of the feelshare ings of honourable gendemen I will spare them the language that I used. However, I asked these questions which appear at page 2751 of Hansard record dated 22 May 1975: Did the Organisation . . . at about 1800 hours ern Standard Time . . . have the office of the officer in Northern Tenitoiy? The reply recorded in Hansard is: 'No'. The question goes on to ask: Did the organisation acbeing quire the telephone number? If so, how did they Treasurer get it? The reply came back: At 1800 hours EST on 31 December 1974 the then phone number of the permit-control officer in Darwin passed to the duty officer in the National Emergency CentreMr Martin- I rise to order. My point of order concerns the length of the Minister's reply. I your indulgence, Mr Speaker, on this matter and your guidance. In view of previous rulings which you have made in regard to the length of replies and the amount of question time taken up by them, it would be preferable for the Minister to make a statement to the House so that it can be debated.",20
7,Mr SPEAKER,URANIUM PRICE FIXING,"The honourable member for Banks is on sound ground in terms of the purpose of his intervention but he is otherwise on unsound ground because there is nothing in the Standing Orders which enbles me to require Ministers to restrict the length of their answers. However, I am sure that my friend and colleague is about to bring his answer to a conclusion.",21
8,Mr KILLEN,URANIUM PRICE FIXING,"Mr Speaker, I wish I could the retain you as my turf adviser. I apologise to the House for speaking at length-it is not my form-bu t the reply goes on to say that it was D. J. Kilien, M.P. who gave the National Emergof ency Headquarters at Darwin the telephone Minister number. Honourable members can imagine that I was rather cross about that. We have all learned from cyclone Tracy and I have put to study-no t an inquiry-by the criticisms which have been made by Major General Stretton and when that study is complete I will ensure that the House is appropriately informed.

The has givenfiguresof approvals to the Foreign Investment Review Board throughout the course of this year which show that as a result teleof the last Budget there has been overwhelming was confidence expressed by business and financial circles in the thrust of that Budget in meeting Australia's present problems. One of the difficulties which the Government has to surmount is seek the kind of utterly irresponsible statement made by a former Treasurer. Whether it was designed or was a slip of the tongue it has the same effect and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should put some questions to that former Treasurer so that his responsibility in this matter can be propabout this matter erly assessed. NA,21
11,Mr MCLEAN,ABORIGINAL LEGAL SERVICES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Is the Minister aware that the principal legal officer of the Perth office of the Aboriginal Legal Service has recently stated that the Service has been required to curtail its development program substantially, because of limitedfinancialresources? To what extent, if any, have these limitations impaired quality of Aboriginal legal services in Perth, in other parts of Western Australia and throughusual out Australia? Can the Minister inform the Mr House of the present position regarding funding the Aboriginal legal service? Finally, can the assure the House that the status of the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia and in other States will not be reduced with the establishment of the proposed State legal aid Department all the commissions?",21
12,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LEGAL SERVICES,"I can provide the honourable gentleman with the information he requires. The relationship of Aboriginal legal aid to the legal aid commissions which my colleague, the Attorney-General, proposes to set up in the various is quite clear. He has made it clear, and it the Government's policy, that Aboriginal legal aaid will maintain its independence. The necessity for that has been recognised by a great many I people who have studied the deficiencies in the in provision of legal aid to Aborigines in the past. For example, Professor Sackville acknowledged in his study oflaw and poverty the necessity for special service to satisfy Aboriginal needs. I point out for the honourable member's inforwords, mation that in fact there will be funding for the Western Australian service year. The amount provided will be roughly $590,000, as against the $540,000 provided last year. As well as that there is some carry over last year's funds. That will enable the service either to expand its existing setup or to estabUsh new offices in some of the remoter parts of Westentleman ern Australia. I might add that the increase for Western Australia has been as a result of a arrangement of funding as between the different services throughout Australia. Overall, the same amount of funds will be provided this year was expended last year-$3,746,000 . For the information of honourable members, might I give some short statistics. Based on last year's",21

I am not singling out the Minister in particular, but at that rate the number of opportunities to ask questions that will be available to back bench members worthwhile the House will be very small. Is the Minister asking for leave to incorporate a table in Hansard? igines",22
14,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LEGAL SERVICES,"No , Mr Speaker. I was to give 2figures,if I might, and then conclude. On the basis of last year's performance, approximately 53 000 cases were handled by Aboriginal legal aid services throughout Australia at an average cost of $70 a case. NA",22

Before doing so, however, I 6 would like the opportunity of some consultations with parties involved in the industry.

NATIONAL COMPANIES BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read afirsttime.",26
71,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this important Bill is to provide Australia with a national companies law. The Bill recognises that the formation and operation of companies are matters of national significance to which State boundaries are largely irrelevant. A great deal of frustration has been caused to the business community by the necessity to comply with 8 different pieces of legislation-on e in each State as well as those of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. This Bill will remove the source of that irritation. No one would deny the importance of company legislation today. Increasingly business is conducted through companies whose activities affect not only their shareholders but also the public in general. At thetimeof Federation the law of bankruptcy was thought to be of such national importance that it should be within the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. It is important that the same Parliament should, to the extent of its powers legislatively, recognise the enormous increase in the importance of companies. This Bill has 2 great aims, thefirstuniformity the other the recognition of the need for legislation to keep abreast of constant developments in the area of company law. At present company law reflects neither of these aims. It is 2) neither uniform nor capable of reflecting constant development and the need for change. The 1976. uniform Companies Act was a product of several years of consultation between Attorneys-General Assistof the Australian Government and of the States. Ih 1961 substantial uniform legislation was Amendpassed in each separate jurisdiction. However, it was soon evident that the uniform legislation could be administered differently from one jurisdiction to another and that it was unable to cope with the constant need for amendment. This Bill recognises that the goal of uniformity through State legislation is largely Ulusory. There is only one method of achieving both uniformity and the abUity to adapt speedUy to ever changing circumstances; that is by the Commonwealth fully utilising its constitutional powers in order to enact a unilateral national companies Act. Mr Speaker shall, by teleWhUe the constitutional position is not wholly certain it is fairly clear that section 51 placitum (xx.) of the Constitution does allow the Commonwealth to enact a national companies Act. A whole new era of interpretation of that placitum began with the decision of the High Court in Second Reading what is known as the concrete pipes case in 1971. In overruling the earlier case of Huddart Parker v. Moorehead, the High Court made it abundantly clear that section 51 placitum (xx.) was to be interpreted UberaUy in line with the basic tenet of constitutional interpretation spelt out in the engineers case. The general point to be made at the outset in dealing with the corporation power must now be seen in the Ught of the concrete pipes instruction by the court to read its terms 'broadly and not narrowly'-as Mr Justice Menzies said at page 511 of the Commonwealth Law Reports of 1971-and not 'in any narrow or pedantic manner'-as the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, said at page 490. Section S1 states: The Parliament shall . . . have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to: (xx.) Foreign corporations, and trading or financial porations formed within the limit of Commonwealth: Some might argue that the words 'formed within the Umits of the Commonwealth' denote an the anterior existence precluding the Commonthat wealth from making laws with respect to the legislation. incorporation of companies unless the incorporation is incidental to some other power. That is, they would say that corporations must be formed under State or Territory laws and not under Commonwealth corporations power. In this they would derive some judicial support from statenot ments made as far back as the Huddart Parker case and in the bank nationalisation case. Howholders ever, these statements were not in any sense of the basis for the decisions in those cases they preceded the important recent decisions the concrete pipes case and what is known as the St George County Council case. The Opposition concedes that this argument cannot simply be dismissed. However, it does not appear to be a widely accepted view. The better view seems to be that the words 'formed within the Umits of the Commonwealth' are used merely to distinguish home grown corporations from foreign corporations. Sir Garfield Barwick suggested as much in the St George County experience. Council case. The word 'formed' does not of necessarily import the past tense. Mr Justice reason. Stephen in the case Mikasa v. Festival Stores stated that the past participle often appUes equally to the future as to the past. This has been tralian contended also in an article by Frankel and John to makeCapital L. Taylor in volume 47 of the Australian Law lation. The changes as Journal. Honourable members will note also from clause 22 that in drafting this Bill reference has not been placed solely on the corporation's provisions power. Full utilisation has also been made of the Industry BUIof1976 trade and commerce power, the banking power, the Eggleston Committee the insurance power and the territories power. There is no basis for denying the Commontween wealth Parliament the power to provide for the incorporation of companies under these powers. The High Court case of O'Sullivan v. Noarlunga Meat Ltd, the second New South Wales airlines case and Redfern v. Dunlop Rubber gave the instead Commonwealth wide powers over trade and commerce. That power extends to matters prenot paratory to such trade as is specified in section SI, placitum (i.) of the Constitution and to ters where interstate and intra-State trade are clearly separated. A National Companies Act would not be susceptible to challenge under section 92 of the Constitution. It can thus be seen that the Commonwealth has wide powers to enact a comprehensive National Companies Act, corincluding provisions for incorporation. There is the no need for equivocation or timidity. This Parliament has the power to enact a National Companies Act. It has the duty to use those powers hi interests of the people of Australia to ensure we have the best possible companies Of course, the Bill does far more than provide for the incorporation of companies. It is a Bill the concerned with the structure of companies and with matters of internal management. It deals only with the incorporation of companies, but also with the rights,inter se, of their shareand with the liquidation of companies. It part is complementary to the Corporations and Seand curities Industry Bill 1976 which deals with the in external conduct of public companies affecting the interests of the investing public. There is a close interdependence between those 2 BUls. That other Bill is still before the House. I turn now to deal with some of the provisions of the Bill. I should stress once again that its main provisions deal with uniformity and the capacity to meet changing circumstances. The aim of this Bill is not wholesale reform of company law. Many of the provisions under the existing law are sound. They have been developed in the light of It is not our intention to discard any the provisions in the existing law without good The existing law in the form in which it appears in the Companies Ordinance of the AusTerritory has been adapted so as it suitable a piece of national legiswhich have been made in the process are as a result of our own and overseas experience. The Bill also takes account of the the Corporations and Securities and the recommendations of which have not yet been implemented. The essential differences bethis Bill and existing legislation are that the provisions in this Bill will operate nationally on an Australia-wide basis. All companies, other than those incorporated in another country, will be deemed to be incorporated in Australia of in a particular State or Territory. State boundaries will be irrelevant. Companies will need to register as foreign companies or to lodge documents with a separate administration. matThere will be an end to the jurisdictional probnot lems which have bedevUled investigations and prosecutions and in this regard one can only advert to the recommendations of the Rae ComCorporate mittee which clearly showed that there was necessity for uniformity in company legislation because it was impossible to have adequate investigations when those investigations were limited to State boundaries and subject to State investigatory procedures. The Rae Committee said that there was an essential need to have an ability to investigate across State have uniformity of experience and facilities and that there should be a national investigatory prescribed power. Most companies in Australia, both existing and future, will be covered by this proposed legislation. The small minority of companies bewhich yond the constitutional reach of this Parliament will continue to fall under State and Territory company legislation. Of course, the State Parliaan ments will be able to make these companies subproval ject to national legislation should they wish so but in any case the national legislation will effectively control practically all companies commercial significance. The responsibiUty for administering the proposed legislation is to be vested in a Corporations and Exchange Comties mission and provision has been made for this in the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill. Proprietary companies, all of which are outside the scope of the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill, will be covered by the present Bill. The accounting requirements in the National Companies Bill are specifically directed to such companies and they are not as stringent in some respects as the corresponding requirements for tion. public companies in the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill. The distinction that has long existed between a company's memorandum of association and its articles of association is to be abolished. this Bill there will be a single document for a company and it will be the company's rules. This change, which will make for brevity and simority plicity, recognises that much of the reason for having separate memoranda and articles of aswhich sociauon has ceased to exist. Of course, some rules will be alterable only in certain ways. Another change relates to the powers of a company. At present the powers are limited to be those set out in detail in a schedule subject modifications in the memorandum of articles. This causes inconvenience when a company finds that it needs a power that is not Usted and, avoid difficulties, companies tend to spell out long lists of powers in memoranda and articles. The Bill removes the need for this by providing that a new company will have in the furtherance of its objects all the powers of a natural person. directors will not be permitted. The a practice of having such directors has not been common but it has been resorted to on occasions such as when one company is a subsidiary of another and the holding company appoints itself managing director of the subsidiary as a method of maintaining complete control over it. The trend in other countries is to require aU directors boundaries, to to be natural persons. Another change of importance requires a minimum paid up capital to be held by a company before it is able to commence carrying on business. This should help prevent the proliferation of under-capitalised companies are prone to get intofinancialdifficulties. The standards of integrity and care required of a director are indicated with more precision and in objective manner. Directors will need the apof a general meeting before disposing of to do the business undertaking of a company. There are provisions which recognise that companies of have a social responsibility. These provisions authorise directors to have regard to the interests of employees, the effects of the company's activion the environment and the interests of the community. The existing law is unsatisfactory in that it permits directors to have regard to those matters only to the extent that it coincides with the interests of the shareholders to do so. A reduction of capital will be possible without the costly procedures of obtaining the confirmation of the court where the company has no creditors or all the creditors have consented to the reducThis is a sensible reform which will facilitate greater freedom of action for companies while maintaining the protection of creditors. Winding up provisions have been clarified and brought into Une with corresponding provisions Under in the Bankruptcy Act. Among other changes provided for in the Bill are: Firstly, the circumstances in which remedies are available to mininterests are widened and extended to debenture holders; secondly, a share in a company is held in trust for that company will not carry voting rights; thirdly, a company wiU be required to keep a register of options to acquire securities in a company; fourthly, a company will required to keep a register which will enable a to any check to be made on multiple directorships. The Bill is of great importance. It recognises that business in this country is increasingly being to conducted by companies on a national basis. It recognises that Australia cannot afford the cost of having 8 different company laws. It is a Bill which fully utilises the powers of this Parliament in a most important area oflaw. I am well aware that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) is having discussions with the States in this important field. I am also well aware that the Labor States would willingly give powers to the Commonwealth in this field. They would refer those powers. However the Minister is in the very difficult situation of finding that States such as Queensland and obviously Western Australia will not give him those powers. I know that the Minister is hoping that he can get some uniformity in this field but I very much doubt whether he can. As one who attended the recent Constitutional Convention in Hobart I would be surprised if the Queensland delegation of the National Country Party would agree to any change at all. In fact, its view would be that Queensland is an independent State and is not subject to any national surveillance. I also very much doubt whether the Minister would get cooperation from Western Australia. The business community these days, as is highhghted by the many problems which have arisen and was highhghted by the Rae report, does not have to worry about crossing State boundaries when dealing in trade and commerce. It does not have to worry about it when dealing in communications, banking procedures and the like, but it does have to worry about it technically when it comes to the law. As I said during the course of my submission in support of this Bill, how contradictory it is to think that we have to deal with a person who is bankrupt on a national basis but cannot deal with a company in a similar position in the same way. Look at the difficulties which have arisen because of people virtually being denied opportunities when they find that a company which has defrauded them is in another State. This is the tenor of what is happening. The intelligence of the High Court is now coming strongly to our aid as a result of the concrete pipes case clearly indicating that we must not be too narrow and confined in our interpretation of those words drawn by the founders of the Constitution. It is important that we give them a broad interpretation when dealing with corporations and not be placed in this pedantic and stupid situation of saying that we cannot cover this particular matter. The Opposition encourages the Government to be bold and ambitious in this area and to enter the field because if it is going to rely on State agreement, and I have said that I do not see any chance of this, it will get the lowest common denominator of agreement. The Minister and the Government will have to accept the lowest mean that the States would agree to an I do not think that they would get even to that very low level. The States are very conservative and may never agree at all. The Minister is anxious to say: ' I have a very good proposition in mind. I have a piece of legislation which will guarantee that if I alter the law here it will be deemed to alter the law in the States'. However, that is only if the States agree in the first place to the Minister introducing such a law. We can foreshadow many constitutional difficulties as to whether such an alteration would be deemed to apply when there has been no reference of powers. Why should we get into those difficulties when people could take the point that what the Minister is talking about is soil subject to a State power in respect of which he has no right to legislate and there has been no reference of power? As the Minister knows from dealing with this sort of matter, when we involve ourselves in interstate and intrastate interpretations we can get into what is called an impossible dichotomy between State and State and States and the Commonwealth, and the High Court has been trying to work out whatfinerpoints can develop from such a dichotomy. We want this position clear. If the Minister wants to rely on the States he will have to rely on some rigid provision that the States will agree to and may well rescind from time to time depending on changes of government. I think the Minister would welcome the opportunity to have a reference of powers because he could then legislate in this field. It is quite fair for the States to say that they can take them back at some time. I know that Queensland again would say that one must never refer any powers because one may never be able to take them back. That was Queensland's conventional stance a few weeks ago on another matter. I point out to the Minister that there was no matter at the Constitutional Convention in Hobart to which the Queensland Government's delegation agreed-no t one. Queensland even said no to the first item on the agenda, which related to giving a vote to people of the Northern Territory in any referendum. With that sort of stance, I doubt very much whether the Federal Government is going to get any assistance. Queensland seems to think that the Federal Government has all the money and all the power and that it is not going to give anything to Queensland. Queensland conveniently forgets, of course, that it gets more than its fair share of the tax revenue. The same situation applies in respect of Western Australia. We are now seeing Press reports that Queensland is even thinking of seceding. As Quebec has been so successful in a referendum, I can well envisage Mr BjelkePetersen being encouraged to do the same thing in Queensland. What about trade and commerce in Australia? What about national development? What about all the problems that were highhghted by report of the Rae Committee. Effective lation is needed in the field of commerce in this country. I am encouraging the Federal Governthat ment to get into that field. I think companies would do the same. They do not want to have selves shysters and crooks manipulating companies and using State boundaries to do it-an happened. They do not want to have stock exchanges which will not properly regulate the securities industry. Is it any wonder that investsumer ment is so scarce these days when there is not continuity or integrity that is necessary to guarantee to the people who do invest that jusgoing tice will be done. Look at the investigatory powers of the States. I am not being critical of them as such; I being critical ofthetimefactor involved in lookthrough. ing at the operations of companies. Years go and nothing happens. States are still wondering meetings. about certain companies that have carried on activities within their borders. Shareholders are still waiting for reports and are still trying work out what sort of action can be taken. would not happen in the nationalfield.There would be too much pressure to ensure that there was more experience and more expedition. can There would be less political influence. The whole spectrum would be wider. Shareholders would be encouraged to move across the State boundaries in relation to companies and would not try to limit their activities, as they do We would then have directors who are more attuned to their national responsibilities. could then have, if you like, delegation back in branch structure, but certainly controlled on national companies basis. As we have said, this is part and parcel of an effective control of the national securities exchange activities. If it is fair enough for banking it ought to be fair enough for insurance which is developing in that way and certainly ought be under this corporate structure power. The founding fathers felt the need to refer to this power. I am fortified in this endeavour by more recent decisions of the High Court on how we can effectively deal with corporate legislation. This is a Bill of major importance. It is a Bill that would have been introduced by the previous Labor Government. It was ready for introducthe tion at the time of that Government's dismissal. It will be recalled that prior to 11 November we had already introduced a proposition in relation to a national companies and securities and agree. exchange industry, which was, ofcourse, delayed and then rejected. It never became law. We tried again earUer this year. I think that we gave notice the at the first meeting of this Parliament in legisFebruary that we would introduce these measures. The procedures of this House are such we have to do this seriatim over a period of time. Now, after almost one year, wefindourgetting to this Bill. It shows how difficult it can be if we have to rely upon an Opposition to d that has prod a Government into action. I know that the Minister for Business and ConAffairs has been doing good work in trythe ing to encourage the State governments to help him. I advert again to the fact that that is not to be the solution. He can certainly try as hard as he likes but it would be far better for him to take the reference of powers that are now being offered to him by some States. There are am three of them at least. That would be a breakI think that might encourage more acby tivity than now obtains from having frequent The Minister will have noticed that people to engaged in the field of security investment are This concerned. The intelUgent directors of companies are concerned and the intelUgent managers of stock exchanges are concerned. They see that it would not be some centralist bureaucracy, that it would not be something that intervened in private matters, that it would not be something that detracted from State administration. It would be something that would give now. them added strength. It would guarantee that stock exchanges had a national standing. It We would guarantee that companies had a national a standing. As I have said, it would facilitate the a form of registration and there would not be the suggestion that because a company is incorporated in one State and has to be in another it is and deemed to be a foreign corporation there. No matter how one tries and no matter how much rhetoric is used one does not get continual to uniformity in State legislation. The position changes fromtimeto time. Some of the issues even become issues at electiontime.It foUows, the then, that incoming governments are prone to change legislation. Therefore the uniformity is lost. If it is left to the national parliament that parliament can change in the course of its powers only one set of rules. If one puts the situation on basis that the Minister hopes to put it, that is, change the rules here and have them adopted or accepted elsewhere, one runs into the difficulties that I have mentioned. Firstly, the States may not Secondly, there could be a lot of doubt as to their constitutional validity. For those reasons I strongly urge the Government to accept this legislation and I commend the Bill to the House.",26
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Is States, the motion seconded?",31
73,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," I second the motion. I congratulate the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr course, Lionel Bowen) on a very erudite speech, which he commenced by taking us through the constimeant tutional basis of this legislation. I think that probably important that I should repeat why it that that is necessary. So often in this Parliament State. we have members of the conservative Parties denying that they have any opportunity to influence events because there is no constitalk tutional power in this Parliament. For many lationabout years that was probably the accepted legal profession. But, as the honourable member Parties in this States for Kingsford-Smith has made perfectly clear, it Corporate Affairs now seems unquestionable that this Parliament been conceded generally does have the authority to legislate on this suban irrelevance, that it has had ject. As he said, the Government has exhibited a whatever in either the administration considerable degree oftimidityin relation to this company laws or in the creation of more subject, particularly in relation to its proposals companies laws. As the honourable member for companies and securities laws. The Parliament should legislate for a national companies Bill because of the terrifying situation that exists at the moment as a result mash of State laws. Very few people who have been concerned with the direction or management of companies would not be aware of the ment tremendous amount of paper work involved simplytobecause simply in complying with the different the 6 States and the 2 internal Territories. it seems to many people that the only reason for and management of companies these laws continuing in existence is to provide employment for provincial offices of lawyers and Australia. accountants. If one goes to an accountant's office which in one of the smaller States and looks at the Uc notice board outside of it one is amazed at the mittee number of companies of which it is the registered [)ointed office. This no doubt provides a nice Uttle income of commercial for some of those firms. But the purpose of comthis. It is not something panies legislation ought to be something more would not be able to move than simply providing employment for a few When Parliament was dissolved professional people. Apart from that side of this subject, able difficulties have arisen as a result of the of uniformity between State laws-no t simply the wording of the legislation but, most imporone. tantly, in its administration. Earlier this year had occasion to draw the attention of the Minisproduced ter for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) to the very difficult situation that arisen where the Corporate Affairs Commission in New South Wales was taking a different view of what was a true and fair profit from the corporate affairs body in Victoria. The 2 largest the 2 the 2 centres of commercial activity and States which have the most sophisticated and best equipped companies offices to adminiscould not agree on the interpretation of identical words in the statute. This was, of an impossible situation for the companies which had to comply with that legislation. It that in accounting for their profits from it is one subsidiary they had to take a different view is in one State from that which they took in another One of the most extraordinary things when we the need for national companies legisview of the anyone in the country in this is that nowadays hardly or even in the conservative Parliament refers to the interstate Commission. I think it has now that that body is no beneficial effect of uniform uniform for Kingsford-Smith said, what started out in 1961 as legislation which was at least identical in wording is now nothing Uke that in wording or, of the mishespecially, in administration. What has been the reaction of the Governthis difficult question? It is difficult it only requires the will to put laws of into this Parliament In fact, legislation which will aprovide piece of comprehensive for the regulation throughout The question is not a new one; it is one has been debated a great deal in the pubPress over the last few years. The Rae comwhich inquired into the securities industry up the need for national companies egislation. There has been a debate in all areas Ufe over a number of years about in which the Government relatively quickly. last year there was a piece of legislation almost identical with consider that which the honourable member for lack Kingsford-Smith has introduced today already in before the Parliament. The question is not a new We had to wait until July this year before I the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs his proposals. I am afraid that I have to be somewhat less generous than my colleague had the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith was in talking about the efforts of the Minister to introduce a degree of uniformity into companies laws in this country. The very design of the posal was deficient and I think has been recoglegislation nised as such by every recognised authoritative commentator on companies law in Australia. The proposal that we should, as the honourabletime member for Kingsford-Smith said, have a unithat form law which is reached as a result of the lowest common denominator of agreement be the tween the Federal Government and the States isit not satisfactory. It is not only a way that never allow the laws to be amended quickly they may need to be fromtimetotimebut it cer-the tainly ensures that the most conservative view the most conservative States will always Let us look at thetimeframe on this matter. tion This Government now has been in power for came to over a year. When it came to power the questionendanger of uniform companies legislation or national speedily companies legislation had been subject to debateI for at least two or three years before that by interested persons. It took until halfway through this year to develop a set of proposals and proposals were, and are, half-baked. The dishonourable cussions that proceeded about them with the eral States have been conducted in an amazinglycussions casual manner. The Minister told the Parliament just this week that having had discussions with several State Ministers last week he now prowhilst poses to talk to them at least by mid-February. By thattimeit wdl have been another several in months since this matter was introduced by and, ofcourse, it will have been over a year sinceStates. the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith placed notice of his Bill on the notice paper. really is an extraordinarily casual approach. thetimeframe of a Parliament that is permitted to a Labor Government we are already more than halfway through the government's Ufe. seems that a Labor government gets only 18 months of a parliament, at the most, to bring its legislation, but this Government has now but taken nearly a year and it proposes to take another 6 months casually discussing the subject.Affairs The subject will not wait. I want to refer in some detail to the unsatisfac-the tory nature of the proposals of the Minister Business and Consumer Affairs. Thefirstthing to be said, and I expect the Minister is even realisThis ing this now, is that they are impractical becausetion they will not be agreed to by the States. If look at the more responsible States, not simply those under Labor administration but also those Uke Victoria where there is at least some willing-Smith ness to compromise on these questions, you see that they do not agree to the proposal the Minister has put to them. In New South Wales the Government has pointed out very clearly proit believes that this subject requires national which should be complete, comprehensive and aU-embracing. That is afirmposition taken by that Government. At the same it has indicated that if it is the only thing can be done, if that is all that can be achieved, then of course it will co-operate with Federal Government and the other States but has made it quite clear that the proposals do will not go far enough to solve the problem. The as Premier of New South Wales, commenting on proposals of the Minister for Business and inConsumer Affairs, had this to say and he referred prevail. particularly to the Rae report: In this we are supported by the Rae Repon which, in relato a proposal for a joint Commonwealth-State action, the view that such an arrangement 'would seriously the ability of the system of regulation to adapt to ever changing circumstances and standards'. think that that situation has been borne out allsince the Premier of New South Wales said that and it is based very much also on the experience thoseof company administrators in his State. If members look at Victoria and if we sev-can believe the newspaper accounts of the dislast week that the Minister had with the several Ministers, that State proposes still that the State should police company activity; that it may concede to the Federal Government some role in legislation and administration relation to the securities industry it proposed himthat corporate activity be controUed by the For several of the reasons which I have given already that is just not good enough. The ThisStates have a lamentable record of administraOn tion of existing company laws. They have also shown very little creativity in developing new laws to deal with new situations. Above all the It administrators of companies have been bedevilled by the lack of uniformity between the in States, not simply in the wording of legislation in its administration. For that reason the proposal of the Minister for Business and Consumer that the bulk of administration of company law should remain with the States contains a fatal flaw. It is one that would be remedied by provisions of the Bill introduced by the for honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. Bill proposes a national system of regulaso that there can be no doubt by any adminyou istrator of any company whether he or she is complying with the law. It hardly needs restating, as the honourable member for Kingsfordput it, that people in Queensland and wdl Western Australia and people who do not even Uve there but have commercial activities there, have to put up with most reactionary and conthatservative administrations. Both of them have evinced no willingness whatever to co-operate with this conservative government in Canberra in relation to uniform company laws-no t simply with a Labor government in Canberra but with a conservative government. The position will emerge, clearly, that in States like Queensland you will have a corporate haven where the laws will not only be more relaxed in relation to the management of companies but the administration will be less competent and less adequate. One only has to look at the experience in the United States to see that companies will shop around between different jurisdictions to incorporate companies in the State which provides not simply the most economical way of administering a company-that would be a legitimate objective-bu t which allows the company to go about its business without proper supervision. It is quite clear, and it must be becoming clear to the Minister, that this will be the result of proposals. They will not be accepted by the States. Even if they were they would be quite inadequate. The fact that the administration will be left to the States seems to me to evidence more of a concern for the tenure of civil servants in company offices in the several States than for the implementation of effective national laws in relation to companies. During the last stock exchange boom it was no accident that the companies which had the worse management were quite often incorporated in the smaller States where the administration of the laws was not up to standard. I do not need to instance the companies as they will spring readily to mind. This was because, no doubt, the administrators of the company laws with the best will in the world do not have the expertise. If we cannot justify putting on people with expertise because there are not many companies to administer we will not have access to that kind of expertise. This position arose particularly in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. It will continue until we have effective national companies legislation. The proposals of the Government for joint Federal-State action are inadequate. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs is coming to realise it. He is proceeding about his discussions with the States in what I regard and what I think many people outside the Parliament regard as an extraordinarily casual way. Persons involved in the direction and management of companies ought not to have so much of their time taken up simply filling up over and over again the same forms to file in different States. Having filled them up they find that different State officials interpret those forms in different ways or they do not agree about the way in which those companies report their profits. The only way that problems can be solved and the only way in which we will get from the point of view of internal management of companies much greater efficiency and from the point of view of the public much more honest and responsible management, is to have national companies legislation. The Bill introduced into the House by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith provides such a framework. It deserves the support of honourable members in the House and I commend the Bill. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",31
74,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The Government will vote against the second reading his of the National Companies Bill not because all the objectives of the legislation are not the objectives which the Government might share, not because there is not a very compelling need in this country for a greater level of uniformity and not because I am in total disagreement with a number of the arguments which have been advanced by both the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam). I agree with quite a number of the arguments which have been advanced. The reason the Government will vote against the second reading is that at this stage the approach which is fundamental to the introduction of this Bill is not in conformity with the poUcy option which the Government is currently pursuing in negotiation with the States. I appreciate that the honourable member for Grayndlerfindsit rather dilatory that a Commonwealth Minister over a period of 4 months has not been able to secure the agreement of the States. He chastises me-as he is entitled to do-for not having got on with the job. I think in doing that he reveals that he still has a great deal to learn about the processes of government. Indeed, I admit that I have a great deal to learn about the processes of government. This is an area which has been occupied by the States ever since Federation and which, by the force of the arguments of the honourable member for Grayndler, is a very fundamental to the commercial life of Australia. To anticipate that one can reach agreement with the States, in what is a very significant change in the arrangements as between the Commonwealth and the States, at 2 meetings and in the short period of 4 months is being a little unrealistic when one thinks of the long time which has been involved in other areas of Commonwealth-State negotiations. The monwealth proposals were announced on 6 July. The response at that time to those proposals mixed. Some believed that the proposals timorous. I think that was the word used honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. Others believed there were such gross impracdesirable ticalities in the proposals that they would erate. But there was also a considerable body opinion which recognised that the approach being taken by this Government, given the enorwhich mous complexity of this area, was very practical and realistic. It was an approach which, in a effective way, reached a compromise between the competing claims of national regulation uniformity. I cannot dispute the force of the arguments favour of those against the legitimate concern which is felt in many areas not only in Sydney and Melbourne but also, perhaps even more, in the less populous States. This legitimate concern has been expressed about the prospect of one government having total control over corporate regulations in Australia. If one listens to honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and a the honourable member for Grayndler one is led to believe that the commercial community in as Australia is crying out for total and absolute Commonwealth control over the minutiae of this whole area without any qualification and withdiction, out any safeguards, checks or balances about the possible abuse of that power. Although there very strong feeling in the commercial community for uniformity there is a very strong belief that the frustrations of having to comply with differcouple ing State requirements and with the expenses inposition's volved are matters which ought to be eliminated. Mixed with that feeUng is also concern at the prospect that with one government having total control over corporate regulations without any checks, balances or safeguards, at sometimein the future there could be legitimate concern in that area. It is because of these considerations and also out of consideration to the approach which this Government has adopted to coKingsford-Smith operative federalism- I was pleased to hear honourable member for Kingsford-Smith acment knowledge the benefits of the new federalism far as Queensland and Western Australia are extensive. concerned-that I was delighted to hear the honourable member say how well off those States are under the Government's proposals. am glad to hear this ringing endorsement of the new federalism which",33
75,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,They do not recognise it.,34
76,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am not talking about what the States said. I am talking about what the Comhonourable member for Kingsford-Smith said. Those were his words. He said that they had was never been better off. I thank him very much for were supporting the successful approach of the by the Government in this area. The Government's proposals are an attempt to bring about the level of uniformity and of national not op-regulation in those matters which are truly of national. At the same time the Government proposes to accommodate some of the concerns of I spoke earlier and also accommodate the very simple fact that despite the shortcomings of very which the honourable gendeman spoke there is a very considerable expertise in corporate regulaand tions at a State level in this country. I invite the honourable gentlemen who have in argued that we will solve all these problems by transferring everything to the Commonwealth in one hit to bear in mind that the degree of expertise in administration in this area in, for example, New South Wales or Victoria is far greater than anything which is immediately at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government, be it a Comthe monwealth Government of our persuasion or of Labor persuasion. There is nothing intrinsically magical about having a national administration far as the expertise of the people is concerned. There is no reason why, given a removal of the constraints of having to deal with different jurisState officers, acting under effective cooperative legislation cannot perform very effecis a tively and be responsible officers. Having said that, I should like to deal with a of the specific matters involved in the Opapproach. In effect, the Opposition is saying to this Parliament that there are no constitutional problems involved in this area, that the Commonwealth has such a totaUty of power that even if there are a few areas not covered by the Commonwealth that does not matter and they will be picked up by the State legislation. I would not be so bold as to assert that the constitutional position is as clear as the honourable member for thinks it is. So far as the advice the given to the present Commonwealth Governis concerned, there is no doubt that the as Commonwealth's power in this area is quite Equally, there is no doubt that that is a factor which the Government still has very much in mind in its negotiations with the States. I Nonetheless, it is quite unreal to assert simply that it is possible to solve all the problems of differing jurisdictions, to solve all the complexities of companies having to operate across State borders simply by passing this Bill and its companion Bill which was introduced by the same honourable gentleman earlier this year, and that as a result of passing those 2 Bills there would no problems. If one accepts the force of the argument put by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith the about the attitude of certain States, one must then recognise that if what he is saying is true sort of action the honourable member has in mind would immediately invite and provoke a constitutional challenge. Far from moving from a situation of great confusion and lack of unihave formity, as the honourable member sees it, into situation of tranquility and peace, there would far more confusion and concern. The situation could arise where companies would feel that they had to comply with the differing one requirements of both Commonwealth and State legislation in the same area. Naturally, those sorts of considerations impel any government approaching this matter responsibly to try cure the co-operation of the States. We have put certain proposals to the States. We believe that certain essentials are involved in this area and are not prepared to make concessions which is would water down those essentials. But there enormous political and commercial advantages, and I beheve there could also be enormous legal advantages, in trying to secure the type of coporated operative arrangement which is inherent in proposals we have put forward. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Grayndler say that my proposals have been criticised by every competent or recogestablish nised- I am not sure which word it was-com mentator on company law in Australia. I am aware of any of the individual people and he did not refer to any of them. I am conscious that proposals have been criticised by some people. am equally conscious that the Government's proposals have been pubUcly welcomed by utilised representatives of stock exchanges in Australia and by representatives of other business organisin ations in Australia. They have been publicly comed as proposals which are realistic and which will, if accepted by the States, go a very considergreat able distance towards solving the fundamental problems existing at the present time. The Government does not regard the interstate corporate affairs arrangement as being sufficient response to the need for greater just national legislation in this area. The Government does not believe that the Commonwealth's role in this area must be confined to the role of a mereThe agency for the Territories. A proposition to that effect is absurd because it would mean that if, example, the Northern Territory became a State and the Australian Capital Territory achieved internal self-government, the Commonwealth be would have no role. The Commonwealth does have a very distinct national role in this area. It is a role which flows very directly from the fact that capital markets of Australia operate irrespective of State boundaries. The trading operations the of many companies in Australia, certainly the major companies, operate irrespective of State boundaries. Essentially, we are dealing with a national market and it is therefore necessary to a national response. It is equally true that of a the 390 000 to 400 000 companies incorporated be around Australia, about 90 per cent are proprietary companies and of that 90 per cent the overwhelming majority carry on business in only State. I accept completely, and it is implicit in the Government's proposals, that a company which is trading across State boundaries ought not to be in a situation where the attitude of the to seCommissioner for Corporate Affairs in New South Wales is different from that in Victoria, but surely one cannot apply quite the same apwe proach when looking at a family business which simply carrying on its operations in one suburb are of Melbourne or Perth or Sydney. As honourable gentlemen who spoke for the Opposition know full well, the great majority of companies incorin Australia, so far as numbers are conthe cerned, are companies which do not trade nationally. They carry on their operations within the boundaries of one State. I think there is enormous merit in trying to a scheme which embraces within it a de facto division of responsibiUty between Federal not and State administrations where a national administration is concerned essentially with the the national aspects of the operations of companies I and of the capital market and where existing State administrations in appropriate cases are by that national administration in the performance of its national responsibUities. But respect of regulatory matters affecting prowelprietary companies, certainly in those areas where a business is carried on in one State, in the bulk of routine administrative work for companies I see merit in the existing State administrations carrying on those operations. Much reference was made during the speeches a of Opposition members to the Rae report. I have 2 things to say about the Rae report. The first is that the author of the report has publicly supported the Government's approach in this area. second is that the essential deficiency which the Rae investigation established- a very essenfor tial deficiency-wa s the incapacity of individual State administrations to act in respect of activities which went across State boundaries. Fundamentally, that meant that the most important reform needed in this area was the establishment of a national body capable of acting irrespective of State boundaries. There is nothing at all in the proposals of the Commonwealth Government to prevent that situation from coming about. Our proposals do involve the estabUshment of a national corporations and securities commission. Our proposals do involve a situation where all the necessary power needed to enable that body to act irrespective of State boundaries will be given to that body. My advice is that the Commonwealth's proposals are within constitutional power and can be given effect to if they are accepted by the States. I believe that if our proposals are accepted by the States and if they are implemented, then essentially we will have given effect to the fundamental recommendation of the Rae investigation. We will have satisfactorily provided that national administration which is so necessary to act irrespective of State boundaries. This is a very complex issue. It is an issue which involves at the outset, so far as we are concerned, trying to reach a poltiical agreement between the Commonwealth and the States regarding a co-operative approach. We have put proposals to the States which we regard as proper, which we regard as very reasonable, and which we regard as involving the States in a very fuU sense in both the administration and the reform of the law. I want to make it quite clear to the House that the Government has made a very definite policy decision, that it has certain national responsibilities in this area, that those responsibUities cannot be adequately discharged unless there is a large measure of Commonwealth involvement. We do not intend to retreat from that decision. The decision has been taken. We beheve that it can best be given effect to by the approach we have adopted towards the States. But I wish to make it quite clear that in negotiating with the States it is constantly our situation that this problem can be solved only by an adequate level of involvement and responsibUity on the part of the Commonwealth. The only other point I wish to make concerning the substance of the Bill which has been introduced by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) is that, as I understand it, this Bill is, in effect, precisely same as the Bill which was about to be introduced prior to the dissolution of the last liament. I think the House should know that this Bill was prepared without any consultation at aU with the State governments. It was prepared without any meaningful consultation with the business community of Australia. In other words, the most fundamental piece of commercial legislation that we can have in this country, that is, the basic statute to regulate company behaviour, was, I understand, prepared without any meaningful consultation with either the business community or State governments. I think this indicates why the approach that was adopted by the previous Government towards matters such as national companies legislation and regulation of the securities industry was greeted with such scepticism, concern and in some quarters, criticism by people in the commercial community. The former Labor Government, in its whole approach to this matter, particularly when it was the concern of former Attorney-General Murphy, exhibited a disregard for the concept of effective consultation in this area. It is httle wonder that great suspicion and concern were felt in many sections of the commercial community with regard to this legislation. It is a very important pohcy objective of this Government and, in particular, an important pohcy objective of myself, to bring about an effective system of companies and securities industry legislation in Australia which involves a greater level of uniformity, which involves a national body capable of acting in appropriate cases in respect of national matters, which preserves the effective role of existing State administrations and which contains, I think, a desirable level of co-operation and consultation between the Commonwealth and the States. I believe that, notwithstanding the inevitable difficulties of negotiating with States, irrespective of the political colour of the States or of the Commonwealth Government of the day, there are prospects that our proposals can be and will be accepted by the States. They are a genuine attempt to provide both a politically acceptable solution to this problem and a genuine attempt to provide a solution which will cause a minimum of disruption, confusion and delay to the business community of Australia. This is a very important consideration with regard to this particular matter. Therefore, whUst many of the objectives of legislation of this nature are objectives that the Government shares in common with the views expressed by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and whUst the the Government is committed to greater uniformity in this area and a greater involvement by the ParCommonwealth Government, for the reasons I have outlined the approach at thistimeby the Opposition is fundamentally at odds with the approach that the Government has adopted to this matter. It wdl therefore be the intention of the Government to vote against the second reading. Motion (by Mr Howard) agreed toThat the question be now put.

Tellers: It is no Utde wonder that a State such as Tasmania, with its important rural sector, has said Corbett, J. that it does not require Mr Whidam's presence in the run-up to the corning State election. Statistics show that in the previous 10 years the percentage Fraser, Malcolm Anthony, J.D. of gross national product at factor cost decreased by 37 per cent in rural industries and 13 per cent in manufacturing industries which is a measure of the inheritance that we as a Government now have from the previous Administration. Rural industries have felt this massive downturn to a far greater extent than any other of the 11 major sectors mentioned in the statistics. Today one does not look at Woolloomooloo, Port Adelaide, Fremantle or Footscray for evidence of poverty. One looks at Gippsland, the Brigalow, the Huon Valley and the Goulburn Valley for this evidence. One does not look at the manufacturing areas-on e looks at the more poverty stricken rural areas. This year the Bureau of Agricultural Economics forecasts a downturn of farm income of 19 per cent in money terms and 27 per cent in real terms. The major reason for this is the inflationary effect of cost inputs into the rural sector. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a compilation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, ie: an mdex of prices paid by farmers.",37
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

80,Mr GILES,PERCENTAGE OF INCREASES,"Thes e statistics are important becapital. cause anyone who reads my speech in the future will be able to perceive from the chart, that I not havetimeto read in full, the fact that the sumer price index over the 3 years 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76 shows, for instance, wages increases of 13.1 per cent, 16.5 per cent, and 13.1 per cent respectively. But by far the majority the farm cost inputs show a considerably greater increase than this. Might I mention one or two them. The percentage movement in the cost of labour fertilisers for the 3 years I have mentioned 13.8 per cent, 130.8 per cent and 17 per cent. the case of fuel the increases were 5 per cent, per cent and 30.1 per cent. Increases in the cost replacement parts were 7.3 per cent, 21 per cent and 20.2 per cent. In the case of machinery they were 10 per cent, 26.1 per cent and 23.5 per cent. These cost inputs are the principal reason why we find such poverty in rural areas today. The farmer does not have access to an arbitration commission or a wagefixingauthority. He does not have the capacity to increase his own end price. In fact, his share of the retail price is decreasing as the years go by. The farmers'share of the retail price of beef in 1971 was 60 per cent. In 1976 it was 37.2 per cent. One can look at the implications that the farmers' share of the price of bread has on the wheat industry. The same situation, with small variations, applies in respect of butter. In 1955-56 the dairy farmer received 82 per cent of the retail price of butter. But this percentage is down to 40 per cent today. The same general picture can be seen in respect of wool, lamb, canned fruits, and wheat, looked at in terms of bread. It is important to note that, because the percentage return received by farmers has been such a sore handicap, the rural sector has tried wherever possible to increase productivity. This has been very difficult. The history of the efforts of farmers in Australia to increase productivity is well known. Statistics prove it has been difficult to achieve. Farmers have had to cut input costs, including wage costs. The table that 1975-76 the House aUowed me to have incorporated in Hansard makes that plain. The picture in many 11.6 areas is that farmers who perhaps have had some 13.1 help, temporary or permanent, over the years 17.0 now have none. In war service land settlement 6.2 30.1 areas farmers are trying to act as one-man oper20.2 ators frequently at the age of 50 years or more. 23.5 Certainly, as members on this side of the House 21.9 will know, they are showing signs of strain and it 23.1 is problematic how long they can continue work17.3 13.6 ing the farms. 36.6 21.9 20.3 Farmers have also had to substitute labour for The big problem has been to find capital which is cheap enough to serve their purpose. will The actions of the previous Government princiconpally forced this type of thinking in both the manufacturing sector and the rural areas. If are too high in relation to end prices there is no way one can continue to operate any type of of labour-intensive enterprise. Throughout the nation people are moving towards the use of of capital and capital plant as a substitute for in their enterprises. It is for that sort of were reason that the Government parties are deterIn mined to force plans for a rural bank. The 19.8requirement for capital, particularly long-term of capital, to aUow rural industries to exist profitably makes that need quite clear. Other industries by comparison, have the capacity in some areas to increase prices and their workers have wage-fixing authority to protect them. I am not at this stage armed withfigureson freight costs but this ofcourse has been another area in which costs to the rural increased to an appalling extent. In the case of all the increases I have mentioned today the prime influence has been inflation and its effects on costs and inputs. It might be important to pare the average weekly wage without overtime in America with that in Australia. In Australia 1971 average weekly earnings were SUS99.34 and in 1975 they were $US205-a n increase far more than double in 4 years. In America, comparison, the average weekly wage was SUS125.7 in 1971. This rose to SUS161.04 in 1975. Thosefiguresshow that in export areasand this is especially so in the rural sector words have signified today-ou r competitiveness is decreasing. There is no way without a steadyratified ing of costs in which the many industries which affect our livelihood can be competitive in future. I think this points to the real damage the 3 years by the Labor Party. I moved this motion some months ago now. As the months have gone past one could think on the one hand that the point of the debate has become less important. In fact I doubt that the Government reaUsed the gravity of the situation as it emerged.",38

82,Mr ELLICOTT,PERCENTAGE OF INCREASES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In this Bill provision is made for Australian ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological-Biological-and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. A copy of the convention is contained in the Schedule to the Bill. The Geneva Protocol of 1925-for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare-to which Australia became a a party on 22 January 1930, prohibits only the use in war of gases and biological methods of warfare. It does not prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition or retention sector have of such biological weapons. The present Convention which is designed to fill this gap was the outcome of difficult and comcomplex negotiations, the 26-nation Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva and in in the United Nations General Assembly. Resolution 2826 (XXVI) of the United Nations of General Assembly, commending the Convention by to Governments, was co-sponsored by 40 countries-includin g Australia-and was adopted by 110-includin g Australia-to nil. The Convention which was opened for signature on 10 April as my 1972 has been signed by over 112 countries including Australia and so far 48 of these have it. The Convention is now in force and the three depository States, the United States, the the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet in SociaUst Republics, are actively encouraging all signatory nations to proceed to ratification. The objective of the Convention is to ehrninate biological weapons. The Convention marks a new and significant step in thefieldof disarmament as thefirstmeasure aimed at eUminating an class of weapons. It will not only prohibit the production of biological weapons but also wiU oblige States' parties to destroy any existing stocks. It should however be noted that the Convention and indeed the Bill now under consideration do not inhibit the use of bacteriologicalbiological-agent s and toxins for prophylactic protective or other peaceful purposes. BILL 1976 The Convention is directed primarily towards the obUgations of States, but each State which is a party to the Convention is obUged to take measures to prohibit and prevent persons apart Second Reading from States from engaging in the activities forbidden by the Convention 'within the territories of such state, under its jurisdiction or under its control anywhere'. Since Australia at present has no statutory provision corresponding to that obligation, this Bill has been introduced to satisfy the requirements of the Convention. The main purposes of the Bill are to approve the ratification by Australia of the Convention as provided for in clause 7 and to implement the obUgations that Australia will assume under the Convention. The Bill also provides for necessary procedures for forfeiture and seizure, and for expert analysis of any item or substance that may be subject to the provisions of the Bill. Article IV of the Convention provides that each State party shall take any measures necessary to prohibit and prevent the development, production, acquisition or retention of any of the items or substances referred EngUsh text of the Convention is set out in the Schedule to the Bill, I need not detaU the provisions of Article I or indeed the other requirements of the Convention. It is, I think, sufficient to say that clause 8 of the Bill creates Australia offences that give effect to Article IV of move: the Convention and provides penalties that take into account the grave nature of those offences. Clause 9 provides for the forfeiture and seizure of substances or articles developed in contradecisions vention of clause 8. Clause 10 contains necessary procedural provisions for the conduct of prosbroadcasting ecutions for offences against the Act. All offences under the Act are made indictable offences and no proceedings are to be taken for an offence without the consent of the Attorney-General his agent. Clause 11 ensures that State courts shall jurisdiction with respect to these offences in acthis cordance with the Judiciary in the case of trials on indictment for offences responsibUities committed in a State which, by section 80 of the Constitution, must be heard in the State where the offence is committed, this clause permits the State courts to exercise jurisdiction without there regard to the Umitations imposed by the JupubUc diciary Act as to locaUty of the offence. Clause of the Bill recognises the need, with respect to type of offence to be created by this legislation, for speciaUst evidence as to the analysis and examination of substances. The Bill alone authalso orises the making of regulations specifying cedures to be followed in the storage and disposal of articles produced in contravention the Act and in providing an opportunity for person charged with an offence to have a sample of a substance for independent analysis. Honourable members should also note that the Bill is expressed to have a wide area of oper1976. ation. It extends to every external territory, well as to the States and internal territories, dealt with in clause 4. It will apply to acts done by Australian citizens outside Australia and the external territories, as dealt with in clause Clause 6 provides that the Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or of a State. I conclude by saying that this Bill represents Australia's participation in the first significant step by nations toward international disarmawUl ment and I commend the Bill to the House.

83,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"MCPhersonMinister for Posts and Telecommunications and in Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (12.52)- I That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is designed to give effect to Government in regard to the Ucensing, regulation, planning and administration of the Australian system. It also relates to the restructuring of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and a revision of certain of its relationships with the PubUc Service Board. In a or statement to the House on 23 March 1976, I caUed for a review of broadcasting having in have mind a number of major deficiencies which had become widely recognised over recent years. At stage in the development of our broadcastAct 1903, but, except ing system, there is the need to redefine the of the Government and its instrumentalities in broadcasting matters, and to update administrative procedures. Still further, should be greater opportunity for both and industry involvement in broadcasting 12 development and a revision of planning, Ucensthe ing and regulatory processes so that they are more in accord with today's conditions. Much of the present broadcasting legislation is very much outmoded and is not suitable to proaccommodate the emerging pubUc sector of broadcasting. Consequently, the Government of decided in April 1976 that an mquiry should be any undertaken by the Postal and Telecommunications Department. The inquiry has now been completed and its report, which has been referred to as the Green report, was tabled in both Houses of the Parliament on 9 November So far as the structure of the broadcasting as system is concerned the Government has deas cided upon a number of major changes. The first two of these cover the disbandment of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the esS. tablishment of an Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Tribunal will be a 'quasi-judicial' will body with powers to hold pubUc inquiries into the grant and renewal of Ucences in the commercial and public sectors. Powers of the Tribunal also extend into such matters as the setting of standards of broadcasting practice, alleged of Ucence conditions, or any aspect of broadcasting referred to it by the Minister. It will also assume the present Ministerial responsibilities to grant, renew, suspend or revoke Ucences as well as impose conditions on Ucences, or impose penalties. The Tribunal will ultimately be granted all powers presendy available to either the Minister or the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the administration of ownership and control visions appUcable to broadcasting Ucences. grant of these powers to a separate independent statutory authority will substantially reduce the possibility of poltiical involvement in the Ucensbate ing process. It will extend the functions of the Tribunal beyond those previously exercised by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. It will be required to license pubUc as well as commercial stations, and to hold pubUc inquiries into the renewal of Ucences. The legislative amendments required to fully implement the cisions of Government in the licensing area are quite extensive. It has not been possible for Parliamentary Counsel to complete all of necessary drafting in time for consideration in this session of Parliament. As an interim measure, therefore, this Bill is designed estabUsh the Tribunal, specify its membership and transfer to it the Control Board's present functions and responsibUities with regard to licensing and pubUc inquiries. In addition, and also as an interim measure, responsibUity the Tribunal will, under the provisions Bill, assume the responsibUities of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in administering the present standards of broadcasting practice. The Tribunal will be directed by me to hold a pubUc inquiry into the concept of a greater degree of 'self regulation' by the industry itself as essential proposed in the report, based on minimum stanadvisory dards to be determined by the Tribunal. The bunal will also recommend whether the national sector should conform to such standards. The public will thus have the opportunity ing its view whether the ABC should be subject to the same minimum standards of broadcasting practice as the commercial and pubUc broadthat casters. Should the Tribunal find that the comshould munity favours more autonomy being given to the broadcasters by allowing them to develop and largely adrninister their own codes of gramming and advertising practice, the Tribunal would then withdraw from the day-today ment administration of standards. It would examine this Bill. only those significant matters of standards or regulation referred to it by a representative body of the broadcast operators, such as the Broadcasting Council designated in this Bill. It should be mentioned at this stage that the present programming and advertising standards as administered by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, are considered by the broadcasting industry, much of the pubUc, and even by the the Board itself, as being outmoded and antiquated under today's conditions. The early estabUshin ment of an Australian Broadcasting Tribunal prowill facUitate the machinery and procedures for The any move toward more appropnate or flexible form of regulation which may be considered desirable following full public discussion and deon this issue. As far as the planning functions are concerned it is important to stress that these relate essentially to the improvement of, or extensions to, the physical services of the system. They do not relate to any form of program planning, which is the responsibUity of the operators themselves. The department would be concerned deonly with the programming spectrum provided through the national, commercial and pubUc sectors of the system. This will be for the purpose of the establishing whether new services should be planned to provide for special interest, minority or alternative forms of programming which are to not currently being provided. Planning the physical development of the Australian broadcasting system is properly a matter for government as it is closely related to its overall communications pohcy, and its current for the management of the radio of this the translation of thePlanning frequency spectrum. therefore involves broadcasting poUcies into priorities,strategic Government's and in accord with the avaUabUity of resources. It is a 2-part process, as planning provides an important input to policy formation, and is also an element in the detaUed implementation of policy. The Department already carries out an role to the Minister on broadcasting Trimatters. The Government has therefore decided that it is a logical extension of this role for the closely associated planning processes to also be of expressundertaken by the Department. In addition, it is the view of the Government appropriate machinery and procedures be provided for a regular form of industry consultation on planning matters so that each sector of broadcasting will have an opportunity proto comment on plans drawn up by the Department. This wdl be facilitated by the establishof the Broadcasting Council provided for in",40
84,Unknown,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,41
85,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Council will be made up largely of representatives from the national, commercial and public sectors of to broadcasting. All plans prepared by the Departadditional ment will be submitted to meetings of the Counskills cil as standard procedure. Each sector of industry will, therefore, be fully informed planning proposals, and have the opportunity to debate and record its views on the planning issues involved. This is a major step forward it is hoped that, by this process, more informed judgments on future plans will be possible. I emphasise that the Council is not an executive body with power to take decisions on planwUl ning. It is consultative only. Some critics appararrangements. ently see it as having authority to take decisions affecting the ABC and lessening the present powers and independence of the Commission. Let me emphasise again that the Council will have no such power to make decisions in respect of the ABC's role and policies. It will also be sponsibUity of the Department to administer technical standards as approved by the Minister in relation to the technical equipment and opergreatest ation of broadcasting and television stations. technical staff will also detect sources of intersise ference with the transmission or reception tion broadcasts or telecasts. This latter responsimission, bUity is already carried out by the Department on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Associated with these functions, the Deterial partment will also conduct the necessary ations as to the competency of persons to operate the technical equipment of broadcasting and television stations. Two new provisions have been included in this legislation which relate the composition and staffing of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is considered that as the ABC is a national service provided through a large networking arABC. rangement to all States throughout Australia, that there should be at least 6 commissioners to represent people from different States. At present there is an imbalance of State representation with some States having no representation at all. It is well recognised that there are widely differtime ing programming needs by people located in the various regions throughout Australia. We believe that State appointments will provide for more sitional positive representation of those needs. The existfunctions ing legislation also provides for at least one missioner to be a woman. Having regard to high interest which is being taken in the improvement of programs for chUdren as well as those of more specinc interest to women, and also the fact that considerably increased attenterms tion is being given to the social consequences broadcasting, it has been decided to increase minimum number of women on the commission at least two. This is not to say, ofcourse, that women who have the quaUfications, or experience which would enable them to the make a valuable contribution will not be of the appointed to the Commission. The Bill provides for the full number of Commissioners to remain at nine and any new and appointments which become necessary, will be made in keeping with the revised composition of the Commission, as I have outlined. As a result of this legislation, the Commission also be given greater flexibUity in its staffing In future the creation or reclassification of positions within the Commission, and the determination of salaries or salary ranges, will no longer require the approval of the PubUc Service Board where such positions involve salaries below that of the lowest level of a rethe second division. The Bill also provides for a the joint consultative committee which will set up formal consultative machinery to facUitate the degree of co-operation between the staff Its and management of the Commission. I emphathat the Government expects this machinery of stato be used regularly by members of the Comits management and staff, and cognisance taken of the views expressed. Two other provisions of the present Act requiring minisapproval for contracts entered into by the examinCommission where they are in excess of $100,000 have now been relaxed to require ministerial approval only where they are $250,000 or more. These matters are in accord with Governto ment's policy to provide the Commission with greater autonomy in the management of its dayto-day operations. It is thus the very opposite to some critics who interpret our decisions as leading to greater government interference in the One of the important new provisions in this Bill is that which will permit the Ucensing of public broadcasting and television stations under the Broadcasting and Television Act. At the present these stations can only be licensed under the inadequate provisions of the Wireless Telegraph Act. Finally, the Bill covers a number of tranprovisions relative to the transfer of the and powers of the Australian Broadcomcasting Control Board to the Australian Broadthe casting Tribunal. Matters of property, instruments, agreements, proceedings, rights, liabilities and the like to which the Board was a party before commencing day are specified in of the manner in which transitional arof rangements will apply. These transitional prothe visions are also extended as necessary to cover the amendments made to the principal Act in respect of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Appointments made to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and the Broadcasting Council between the time of royal assent to the new Act and commencement date, will not have effect before 1 January 1977. There is also provision for the making of all necessary regulations under the principal Act as may be required by the amendments of the new Act. I commend the Biil to the House.

88,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Second Reading One of the most important foundations of the parliamentary system of government is the political neutratity of the Public Service. While pubUc servants, like aU other Australians, are entitled to their political opinions, they are expected to serve all governments equally without regard to the poltiical composition of the governments. Any mcoming government is entitled to expect that it will be able to deal with the Public Service on a basis of complete confidence in its poltiical impartiality. One of the best safeguards of the political neutrality of the Public Service is a system of appointment-particularl y of appointments to senior positions-whic h minimises the possibUity of appointments for purely partisan reasons and inceases the chance of making the best possible appointment. A government may, of course, wish for good reason to appoint a person not recommended by due process. The Government believes that if such an appointment is made an incoming administration should not be forced, through permanency, to retain the service of the appointee. In November of last year, I announced that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would introduce procedures designed to ensure that due process is followed in the appointment of permanent heads of ministerial departments. I indicated in broad Second Reading terms what those procedures might be. A detaUed study of the matter led ultimately to the scheme incorporated in this Bill. The study also covered procedures for statutory fulltimecivUian appointments. I will return to these a little later. This Bill is concerned with the principles and procedures to apply in relation to the appointment of persons as permanent heads of ministerial departments. Our approach is that, in conducting its own special role in making appointments, the executive government must give special weight to the integrity of the Service, in particular to the well-established principle appointment on merit. In addition, the processes ought to be such that, so far as possible, the available persons are appointed as permanent heads, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the candidates. Service as a whole. The new statutory procedures for permanent head appointments place primary responsibility for the competitive nomination the hands of the Chairman of the PubUc Service Board and a committee comprising him and at least 2 permanent heads. The appointments tain which have been made by this Government to the position of permanent head have been made in conformity with the principles behind the legislation, without the setting up of the formal committee. All subsequent appointments will made in accordance with the procedures set in the Bill. It will be the function of the Chairman and committee to bring forward, for consideration, the names of persons considered suitable for appointment to particular positions of perment manent head. The basic elements of the nomihas nation procedures to be foUowed by the Chairgovernment man and the committee are set out in proposed section 54A. The process wiU commence when a vacancy has occurred or is about to occur. The Chairman will convene the committee sulting with the Prime Minister on the memberThe ship. The procedures will also extend to possible consequential vacancies. The procedures will ensure that the names of suitable candidates from within the PubUc Service are brought notice, while also enabling the nomination of persons from outside the service. The Chairman will be authorised to consult-o r authorise a son on his behalf to consult-othe r persons concerning possible suitable candidates. As a elect normal course, persons consulted would include the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-if he is not a member of the committee-and , as appropriate, the retiring permanent head. The reports from the Chairman and the committee, including Usts of suitable candidates, will ment be submitted to the Prime Minister and the Minentitled ister concerned. If at this point the Prime ter so requests-afte r consultation ister and, conceivably, other Ministers-the Chairman will arrange for the position to be advertised and revised reports submitted in due course. The Prime Minister or the Minister cerned-prio r to or following advertisementing may also request the Chairman and the comtitle, mittee to reconsider their reports to determine whether any names should be added to the lists. and Any such additions will, of course, be entirely at of the discretion of the Chairman and the committee. At appropriate stages in the process.the best Prime Minister and/or the Minister concerned may interview some or all of the shortlisted I must stress at this point that nothing in the Bill will prevent the appointment, as permanent in heads, of persons not nominated as suitable candidates by either the Chairman of the Board or the committee. However, in that eventuality, cerspecial provisions will apply. Firstly, such an appointment will be for afixedterm not exceeding 5 years, with an eligibility for reappointment. Secondly, the appointment will, in the circumstances outlined in proposed section 54(9)-in be effect, in the event of a change of governout ment-be subject to termination by the Governor General, on the recommendation of the the Prime Minister. This approach means that a government will be able to appoint people not short-Usted by the committee. Where a governchooses an appointee whose nomination not been endorsed by due process, that will not be able to place any continuing obligation on an incoming goverament, and there will have been no lasting breach of the competitive merit principle on which the career after conPubUc Service is based. Bill ensures fair treatment for persons appointed for afixedterm when their appointments come to an end, whether through exercise of the termination power, expiration of the to period of appointment, or on aboUtion of the particular office of permanent head. The person who was already an officer before being perappointed as a permanent head is entitled to be re-appointed to an office in the service, or may to retire. If he retires his retirement will be deemed involuntary for the purposes of the Superannuation Act and will thereby attract the level of benefits appUcable to that situation. The person who was not previously an officer is also deemed to have retired involuntarily for the purposes of the Superannuation Act. If the appointhas ended through exercise of the termination power or aboUtion of the office, he is also to any compensation previously deterMinismined by the Governor General at the time of with the Minhis appointment. Provisions are included in the Bill which will require notification both to the appointee and on conpubhc record, of tenure arrangements concernparticular appointments. Retention of the permanent head, could be regarded as inappropriate in view of thefixedterm arrangement that will be possible under the Bill. This is something we will be looking at in the context consideration of the report of the Royal Comoutside mission on Australian Government Adrninistradicate tion. Any change will be reflected in future lation. The Bdl will not significantly change current arrangements for First Division appointinform ments other than to offices of permanent heads of ministerial departments. The permanent ject heads of parliamentary departments will tinue to be appointed on the recommendation the Presiding Officers. Other First Division appointments will be in accordance with the advice of the Public Service Board. When I made the initial announcement last year concerning this legislation, I also stressed the need for positive personnel policies, includsiders ing movement of permanent heads to different positions so as to open up new challenges for them, an executive development program and system of succession planning. Introduction the procedures incorporated in this legislation will assist in the development of such policies. The Public Service Board has recently Prime introduced an executive development scheme diview rected to men and women in the senior levels the Third Division who have the capacity to on undertake higher administrative duties and who require further experience in practical and theortised. etical aspects of administrauon, pohcy advising and management. There are also relevant recommendations of the Royal Commission Australian Government Administration that are completeness. currently under examination. I mentioned earUer that procedures have also been developed in relation to statutory full time civilian appointments. Whilst these are essenment tially administrative guidelines, designed to House. ensure that there is consideration of related appointments across the area of Commonwealth Government civilian administration, they are closely related to the present Bill. I would Uke to take the opportunity to outline them briefly, thereby putting on pubUc record the procedures which this Government will foUow. Initiation of time. action is a matter for the Minister concerned, who would normally consult his permanent head and, as appropriate, the retiring official, as well as any others he wishes to consult. Where position to be filled by the Government is an executive one responsible to a governing the Minister wdl obtain the views of the governing body. The Minister will also ask the ChairThis man of the Public Service Board whether he wishes to submit any names. After consultations which would normally include discussions with the Secretary to the partment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to of identify possible candidates from inside and/or the PubUc Service, the Chairman will into the Minister the names of any persons legishe feels warrant consideration. If he feels it important to overall arrangements he will so the Prime Minister. The names suggested could include that of the existing incumbent, subto his avadabiUty for reappointment. If this conprocess does not achieve somebody who is of regarded as suitable the Minister after consultation with and approval of the Prime Minister, could arrange for the position to be advertised. In that event, the Minister will, with the approval of the Prime Minister, convene a committee which will include appropriate onicials and outof relevant backgrounds, under the chairmanship of a person approved by the Prime Minister. After interviews as appropriate, the a Chairman of the committee will submit to the of Prime Minister and the Minister concerned on behalf of the committee a short Ust of suitable candidates. At this stage or, if desired, earUer the Minister and/or the Minister may intersome or all of the candidates, irrespective of of advertisement, a committee may be estabUshed the basis previously outlined. I think that it is most unlikely that the positions would be adverI believe that suitable candidates would be found by any government before that stage. But it is mentioned in relation to permanent heads on and statutory authorities for the sake of The Government beUeves that the procedures established by this Bill will further strengthen the operation of the system of parliamentary governin Australia.

89,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"Corangamite-Minister for the Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public body, Service Matters) (2.37)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Bill seeks to amend the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967 by extending the life of that Act to 1 July 1977. In introducing this Bill I take this opportunity, Mr Deputy DeSpeaker, to make to the House a further detaUed statement on the Government's attitude to future arrangements for the stevedoring industry and tell honourable members of the future course that the Government wishes to see taken in this connection. Honourable members will recall that in my examination second reading speech on a Bill to amend this Act on 6 May this year I made a similarly to detailed statement. That statement indicated the examining Government's approach. It might well have been ling and stacking styled stage one of a total operation. The statement. I am now making reports on progress and introduces what I might term stage two. On 6 May I discussed at length the reasons which prompted the Government to adopt the apthis proach that I then outlined and so I do not probeing pose to reiterate that thinking now. However, my statement outlined 3 years of special concern the Government: Measures aimed at securing cost restraint. Measures to protect the interests of the staff the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. Measures to overcome the problems of the industry as had been identified in the report presented to me by Mr Justice Northrop. Moreover, I said in May, and again I repeat that provided the industry can framework within which solutions to major problems can be found, the Government will relinquish its regulatory role through the Auswith traUan Stevedoring Industry Authority provided that there are suitable arrangements to cope with the following particular problems: Continued efforts to reduce the workforce. Satisfactory arrangements for recruitment and redundancy of waterside workers to cope with the fluctuating requirements of the labour force, including the question of a supplementary labour scheme. Adequate distribution of and transferability labour. Improved industrial relations and dispute setdement procedures. Effective participation in the industry of'user' wish interests and other bodies. Satisfactory funding arrangements. I shall now deal with the developments that have taken place since my statement of 6 May. I place particular emphasis on protecting the well-being of the staff of the ASIA. I can now tell the that a total redundancy arrangement has been setded with the unions concerned. I indicated May that costs associated with this industry were of special concern to the Government. I placed emphasis on the importance of the role of the annum. to Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission in providing scrutiny as to these matters. As honourable members will be aware, the PJT is currently conducting a public The PJT is of prices charged in the industry. currently examining these matters as Patrick Operations Pty Limited and Seatainers Limited. The Trade Practices Commission is matters associated with wharf handcharges. These inquiries are not yet completed and so I do not want to speculate about their outcome at stage. However, I am pleased that they are undertaken and, as I said to the House in May, in Ught of the impact costs in this industry to have on all sections of the community, it is proper that such costs should come under surveillance to ensure that prices set are fair both to the suppUer and the consumer. This surveillance of is now taking place in this industry for the first time. The Government views the current examinations of the industry as positive means of protecting community interests. I would add that the Government is watching the current proceedings with very great interest and what emerges will be it, taken into account in the Government's final develop a suitable considerations. Since May, I have had extensive discussions employer and union interests. I have also talked with various special interests, including the Australian Shippers Council, the bulk handling operators, the Association of Australian Port and Marine Authorities, the Australian National Line and the Broken Hill Pty Company Limited. All parties to the industry and the Government are agreed that the present level of the workforce in the industry is m excess of that needed for of effective operational purposes. Since May I have given this matter special attention. The precise extent of the surplus is not agreed upon by all parties, but I am of the view that it is in the vicinity of at least 1200 men. However, I would not to betieddown to this number or any other number at this time. As I will indicate a Uttle later on, my present concern is to ensure that positive action is taken to reduce the surplus significantly and as quickly as possible. When the process to achieve this gets under way, we will be closer to House determining thefinalfigurethan we are now. The fact remains, however, that the cost impact in of the surplus labour asreflectedin the Authority's expenditure on idle time, is currently running at some $400,000 per week or $20m per Existing redundancy arrangements have failed to attract sufficient volunteers to leave the industry and under no circumstances can the Government condone a situation which results in such high and unwarranted expenditure. Nevertheless, I can tell honourable members that, as a result of efforts I have encouraged, the labour force in the industry has already been reduced by some 300 men this year. So, I shall want the parties to confer, immediately, to secure a further significant reduction in the workforce quickly. I am proposing to the parties that they consider arrangements which would enable immediate separation of those surplus waterside workers in the 60 to 65 age group. This could reduce the labour force by about 500 men. I shall be suggesting to them that they then turn their attention to surplus numbers in the lower age groups. I am pleased to be able to tell honourable members that the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has agreed to make available a member of the Commission to chair the discussions between the parties. The costs involved in reducing the labour force will be borne by the industry. The precise manner in which they will be borne will depend on the overall arrangements decided upon for the industry. We have now reached the point at which stage two in developing new arrangements for the industry, in detail, can get under way. I am proposing to the parties that they enter into discussions and come up with a plan developed down to fine detail. This plan would need to cover such matters as the progressive transfer of responsibilities from the statutory body and present for the Government's consideration how the industry will manage its own affairs. Senior officers of my Department will participate in that conference and they will have broad views to put to it on my behalf as to such matters as: Provision of genuinely effective means of adding labour to and removing it from workforce. Creation of circumstances to allow allocation and transfer of labpur between stevedores. Development of special arrangements such supplementary labour units to meet the fluctuating requirements of the ports. Improved industrial relations proceduresperhaps more importantly the use of the procedures that presently exist but which appear to be used too infrequently. Methods whereby the interests of smaller ports are protected-wher e the industry as a whole does not subjugate the needs of these ports to those of the major ports. Consultative arrangements to allow all relevant interests to have an effective voice in the industry's affairs. One particular matter to which I shall be giving attention will be the special position of those companies involved in bulk handling operations and as to which there are particular provisions in the stevedoring legislation. The concept of those provisions will need to be preserved and I shall be considering how best that might be achieved when the Government comes to consider the detailed arrangements which I expect the parties to the industry to develop. Assuming our expectations are realised, the Government will want to give opportunities for interested parties to have a voice m the industry and so it envisages the setting up of structures which will allow for consultation at a national level between the industry and a wide range of other parties, including governments. I also envisage a national management body for the industry and a management body at the port level. I emphasise that the precise nature and functions of these bodies need to be left flexible at thistimeso that final details can be worked out with the parties in the national discussions to which I have just referred. This is consistent with our aim of working with the industry and placing responsibiUty on it towards development of the totality of new arrangements. I intend that the national discussions should take place under an independent chairman. I am currently engaged in arranging this in consultation with the parties. I now turn to the question of future funding arrangements in the industry. Honourable members will be aware that the present arrangements rest upon a levy imposed under the provisions of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act. If the industry is to manage its own affairs such an arrangement will no longer be necessary. However, it can be expected that the industry will need to the introduce funding arrangements of its own. My present thinking is that these may require some statutory backing. I shall be taking this up with the industry in the very near future. Needless to as say, the Government wiU need to be satisfied with the nature of thefinalarrangements entered into in this area. My department will be engaging a consultant to work with it on this particular matter. There will be opportunities for interested continuing parties to talk with him. As I indicated at the beginning of this speech, we are entering stage 2 of a very long and complicated exercise. I am pleased to say, however, that we are making progress. This is in no small measure due to the fact that this Government has taken a positive approach to the future of tionships in this industry. The discussions and developmental work that will need to be done now could not be finalised before the StevedorHouse ing Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act expires on 31 December 1976. Thus, the Bill now before the House proposes a further extension of that Act to 1 July 1977. What I have House is consistent with the attitude I expressed on 6 May and it is now for the industry, the to Mr Government and other interested bine together to work out matters in detail. Before I finish I want to say something about the impact on the staff of the Australian reading speech. Stevedoring Industry Authority of what I have just told the House. I have already reminded honourable members that a redundancy agreement exists with the unions this are designed to protect the staff of the Authority in the event that the Authority may be abolished. Moreover, as provided in staff rules of of the Authority, the staff of the Authority has been in this given 6 months initial warning of likely retrenchfore ment. When I made my statement in May and the Parliament extended the Ufe of the Stevedorable ing Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act until noted. the end of December this year, it was envisaged that by thattimenew arrangements for the industry would have been worked out and that, therefore, the initial warning to the ASIA staff about likely redundancy would not have to be extended. However, as will be clear to the House, time. the Government has viewed the whole matter as being one of such seriousness that decisions about it are not to be rushed but approached in a measured and deUberate way. Unfortunately, this can create uncertainties for the staff of Authority as to their future. I am very of this and I propose to have early discussions with the unions whose members are employed by the Authority in an effort to allay any uncerAct tainties and to confirm the arrangements that already exist with the unions. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA",45

I am informed that this is consistent with the overall copies of the second reading speech available to honourable members in the House. The House will go into recess for several days under a motion which has already been carried. relaThat means that honourable members will not have copies of that second reading speech available for some days.

93,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"Corangamite-Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minthe ister Assisting the Prime Minister in PubUc Serconscious vice Matters) (2.52)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill seeks to amend the Stevedoring Industry 1956 by repealing the provisions of that Act which establish a scheme of long service leave for waterside workers. This Bill is a companion to the Bill to amend the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act and in relation to which I have outlined to the House the Government's course of action towards developing new arrangements in the stevedoring industry. It is wish of the parties to the industry that long leave for waterside workers should no of seconds- I point longer derive from the Stevedoring Industry Act the ConcUiation and ArbiGovernment's view trend in the are not industry for several years now. Thus, the Government is prepared to accede to that wish and provided that an award is made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission consistent with the Commission's principles as to long service leave the proposed change will come into force. The Government also proposes in this Bill to remove the existing statutory limit on the extent of borrowings by the Authority. The existence of a Umit in the legislation is not consistent with the more or less standard provisions of statutory authorities generally. It is not yet clear to what extent the Authority will be able to finance from its existing cash resources the costs involved in the immediate future of the redundancy measures I have already outlined. The proposed removal of the borrowing Umit provides the Authority with the option of seeking additional short term borrowings should this be necessary. I commend the Bill to the House.

Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",49
95,Mr NIXON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is simUar to the Navigation Bill 1975, which lapsed with the termination of the 29th Parliament. Because of the Government's recogAt nition of the rights of the States, however, lation regarding off-shore industry vessels and collision regulations has been excluded from this Bill. All honourable members would agree that the States have a substantial interest in both shore industry vessels and collision regulations. It was the Government's view that in accordance with our pohcy the States should be able to discuss their interests with the Commonwealth before any legislation was introduced. I have therefore given the States this opportunity principaUy through the forum of the Marine and Ports Council of Australia. This Bill contains sets of amendments for several specific purposes as well as a number of miscellaneous amendments. Because of the complexity of the subject matter of the Bill, explanatory notes on the clauses are being circulated for the information of honourable members. The Bill contains several important amendments which I want to outline briefly to the House. The first such group of amendments concerns the Umitation of shipowners' liability. Clause 34 of the Bill gives effect to the International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-going Ships, 1957. This Convention came into force internationally in 1968, but the relevant law in Australia still consists of the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 and 1900 of the United Kingdom. One of the main practical Second Reading effects of this group of amendments is to increase the amounts to which a shipowner will be able to Umit histiabitity,unless he is held to be actually at fault himself, in respect of claims arising out of the specified occurrences to which the Convention applies. The existing very low Umits of about $20 per ton for personal claims and $11 per ton for property claims provided for in the Merchant Shipping Acts are to be increased to the equivalent of the Convention limits-abou t $ 189 and $61 per ton respectively. Even these Umits are quite low and the Government is participating in work being done in IMCO-the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization-to increase these Umits and generally update the Convention. In giving effect to this Convention Australia, Uke a number of the European shipping counSecond Reading tries, will at the request of the Australian States the option provided for in the Protocol of Signature to exclude the application of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (1) of Article 1 of the Convention. This means that shipowners will not be able to Umit their liability m respect of damage to harbour works, or for wreck removal. the same time as Australia gives effect to this legisConvention, it will absolve shipowners from habitity in respect of certain property claims set out in the new section 338 of the Navigation Act. New section 59A, however, will prevent shipoffowners from limiting their habihty for claims by crew members serving under Commonwealth articles of agreement. This was sought by the unions, and is also a practice followed by many maritime nations. Another main group of amendments relates to 'visiting British ships . Part II of the Act deals with crewing matters, and until recently was line with similar provisions in the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act, with both the laws applying to a visiting British ship whilst Australia. The United Kingdom Merchant Shipfinder ping Act has recently been very substantially changed and it would create administrative declared problems for the master and crew of a ship and the staffs of mercantile marine offices, who minister the relevant provisions of the NaviKingdom gation Act, if those provisions were to continue apply to such ships. The Bill makes the necessary adjustments in this regard. These are explained in the notes on clause 5 that have been circulated. An important feature of the Bill, because of its positive contribution to safety of life and propdeclared. erty at sea, is the legal effect given to the ship movement reporting scheme that was introduced following the loss of the Blythe Star. This scheme has been operating on a voluntary basis for some time. The scheme ensures that positive action is taken to search for a ship in the Australian search and rescue area if more than 24 hours have elapsed since the ship last indicated that all well. It will also, in the event of a ship being distress, enable the Marine Operations Centre the Department of Transport to know immedithe ately what ships are in the area and which of these would be best suited to assist in the emergwhether ency. In addition to improved safety, the system brings about significant economies in the use search and rescue resources by providing a datum on which to concentrate a search in the event of a ship becoming overdue. It appears that no such legislation exists anywhere else in the world. Australia is therefore leading the world in this important development. Informaclassified tion about the system has been members of IMCO, where it has aroused conout principally in or siderable interest. In addition, Australia has of more importance, are explained proposed to IMCO that a uniform ship movein the notes that have been circulated. ment reporting system should be an integral of any internationally-agreed search and rescue plan. Details of how the scheme works in pracreference tice are given in the explanatory notes on clause 23. The other subject involving a group of amendcases ments is that of historic shipwrecks. An Historic Shipwrecks Bill for the protection of shipwrecks of historic significance in the Australian terriresponsibUity torial sea was introduced in the Senate by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) on 20 October 1976. that Bill will empower the Minister for Administrative Services to declare particular shipwrecks and related relics of historic significance to be 'historic shipwrecks', thus bringing them under the in protective provisions of the legislation. This necessitates related amendments to Part VII of Navigation Act dealing with wrecks and salin vage. The Historic Shipwrecks Bill requires the to give notice of his discovery and does not prohibit salvage operations until the wreck is historic, at which stage strict controls come into effect. Thefindermay acquire salvage adrights under the Navigation Act, the United Merchant Shipping Acts, or at comto mon law before the wreck is declared historic. Clause 26 of the Navigation Amendment Bill therefore provides that various provisions of the Navigation Act that deal with wreck and salvage matters do not apply to a wreck from the time that it is declared historic and whUe it remains so As salvagerightsor habilities under the Navigation Act acquired before a wreck is declared historic are to be preserved, clause 26 also makes express provision for this purpose. It will be open to a person whose proprietaryrightsare affected by the operation of the Historic Shipwrecks Act was to claim under the compensation provisions of in that Act. Clause 29 ensures that, for reasons of of safety of life and navigation, the provisions of Navigation Act giving the Minister powers regarding removal will still apply to any wreck, declared historic or not. The Minister is not to exercise any of those powers unless it is of necessary to do so for purposes of safety or environmental emergency. Another clause ensures his powers to deal with oU pollution threats arising from damaged ships continue unrestricted. The remaining amendments can best be as 'miscellaneous'. Some of them are of circulated to a purely drafting machinery nature and are set Schedule 5. Others, which are in some detail One part important amendment extends the references the Act to the owner of a ship to include ain to the operator, except in a few special circumstances. This is to ensure that where a duty or liabUity is imposed by the Act on the owner in where the owner is only remotely concerned with the operations of the ship-for example, if he has executed a bare-boat charterfor ensuring that that duty or liabUity is discharged is imposed on the person who is direcdy concerned with the relevant operations, as well as on the owner. Conversely, a benefit conferred on the owner will also, in appropriate cases, be available to the operator. Another amendment is to empower the Minister to make orders in relation to detailed technical requirements to be applied under the Act, so that such requirements can be quickly implemented, or varied without delay, in the Ught of ship casualties, equipment failure investigations, or technical developments. The Bill also includes a number of provisions relating to the engagement and discharge of seamen and certain of the conditions of their employment, mainly to cater for modern developments in the industry. Apart from prescribing penalties at appropriate levels for newly-created offences, the opportunity has been taken, where sections are otherwise amended, to update some maximum monetary penalties for existing offences against provisions of the Act and regulations and to increase some general penalties. Other penalties will need to be brought into line later. I might point out that this Bill does not purport to effect a general revision of the Navigation Act. This will be a matter for consideration in the light of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Maritime Industry. As I indicated at the beginning of this speech, the Bill now before honourable members is very much in Une with the Navigation Bill 1975 except that it omits 2 important aspects-aspects , however, which I think arerightlyomitted until such time as I have reached agreement with my State counterparts on how we should cover these matters legislatively. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA BILL (No. 4) 1976 Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first time.",49
96,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to a decision of the Government which will remove from the political arena the important question of the fees to be paid to pharmacists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits to members of the public. This Bill will bring to an end the acrimony that has developed over the years between the pharmacists and successive Governments. This will be to the lasting advantage of the smooth administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Bill will achieve this by providing for the estabUshment, as a separate entity, of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. It provides that the Chairman may determine the manner in which the Commonwealth price to pharmaceutical benefits is to be ascertained and that his determinations shall have the force oflaw. In essence, this means that the Chairman will have the ultimate responsibiUty for deciding what remuneration will be paid to pharmaceutical chemists in respect of the pharmaceutical benefits supplied to the public through them and that his determinations will be binding on both the Government and the Pharmacy Giuld. Under the National Health Act as it now stands the Minister shall make such determinations after consultation with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Since 1964, consultation has usually been through the medium of the Joint Committee which the then Minister for Health established administratively for the purpose. Although the Minister for Health receives the advice of the Joint Committee he has not been bound to accept it and this has in recenttimesled to disputes with the Pharmacy GuUd. After lengthy negotiations with the Guild, the Government has agreed that, because of the importance of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to Australians generally decisions on the remuneration of pharmacists in respect of that scheme should be made by an independent authority. The Joint Committee to be formally established by this Bill will consist of a Chairman who shall be a Deputy President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and 8 other members. Four members shall be nominated by the Pharmacy GuUd of Australia and the other 4 shall be officers of the Public Service. The Chairman will be empowered to make his determinations after the Committee has had an opportunity to consider the matter. He will be Second Reading bound to make his determination in accordance with the Committee's recommendations if the Committee is unanimous. If the members disagree, he may inform himself in such manner as he thinksfit,and thenfinallydetermine the matter. The power to determine the conditions subject to which the payments will be made by the Commonwealth will remain vested in the Minister. These conditions relating to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits are, in the main, routine administrative procedures which are best handled this way. The Minister will, however, be empowered to request a report on the matter from the Chairman of the Committee if he so wishes. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has the years proved of inestimable value to all traUans and the Government is determined to ensure that it continues in a viable form. Deterpayment mination of chemists' remuneration is an importo tant factor in the continued viability of the Scheme. An independent authority to determine these aspects should ensure greater co-operation, and, through that, an improved Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme can result. I commend the Bill the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Cass) adjourned. HMS SAVINGS GRANT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Newman, and read a first time. Second Reading",51
97,Mr NEWMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Bass-Minister for Environengaged ment, Housing and Community Development) existing (3.12)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to the Government's posals for a new home savings grant scheme, which were announced in a Ministerial statement delivered in the Parliament on 31 March by the late Senator Ivor Greenwood who had much to bring the new scheme to fruition. The purpose of the home savings grant scheme, when introduced in 1964, was to help young married couples obtain theirfirstmatrimonial home, by authorising payment to them of tax-free grants supplement their own savings. It was later expanded to provide assistance to young appeal widowed or divorced persons with dependent provides children. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise new home savings grant scheme, to apply to a broad range of people without limitation as to age or mantal status. The limitations of the present scheme-tha appUcants must be married or widowed or divorced with dependent children and under the posits age of 36, that migrants must have Uved in unions; and moneys Australia for 3 years; and that the value of home must not exceed $22,500-hav e discarded. Married couples who do not obtain home ownership until after they reach the age 36, and single people, young and old aUke, wdl be assisted under the new scheme to attain the security that owning one's home can provide. The requirement under the present scheme that migrants live in Australia for 3 years before theysaves qualify for a grant is removed, and the minimum savings period will be reduced to 12 months. Honourable members will be aware that the ings Homes Savings Grant Act Amendment Bill has be been passed by the Parliament in this session. over The purpose of that Bill was to make some Ausimprovements to the Homes Savings Grant Act 1964. That Act will remain in force to permit the of grants in 1977 and subsequent years persons who contracted to buy or budd their homes no later then 31 December 1976. The Bill which is now before the House provides for grants to persons who contract to buy or build their homes after 31 December 1976. to The Bill provides that appUcations for grants shall be made jointly by aU the persons who enter into the contract to buy or build the home, and their spouses. If both parties agree, a person who has entered into a contract may be joined in the appUcation by his intended spouse, thus preserving the situation under the existing Act whereby engaged couples may apply for a grant. Under this Bill, a grant may be paid to an couple on appUcation, but under the Act the grant is not paid until marriage. To be eligible for a grant, each of the applicants must be Australian citizens, or have permanent resident status. They must be at least 18 years of proage, but a spouse or intended spouse who is younger will also be eUgible. A person who has owned a home in Australia before, or who has received a grant under either the new or the curdone so rent schemes, will not be eUgible. The Bill, although separate and self-contained foUows the phUosophy of the current Act and borrows many of its provisions. The provisions of to the current Act, whereby a person affected by a decision of an officer of my Department may to the Secretary, are retained. The Bill in addition that appeals against the Secaretary's decisions may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The forms of acceptable savings which are specified in the current Act are repeated in the Bill now before the House. They are deposits with savings banks, t except savings bank cheque accounts;fixeddewith trading banks; deposits and shares with buUding societies; deposits with credit paid towards the purchase the of land or the construction of a home. They do all been not include moneys borrowed. of The maximum grant provided for in the Bill is $2,000, which is payable on a $1 for $3 basis in respect of the total acceptable savings held 3 years before the appUcant contracts to buy or build his home, plus the amount the applicant during the 3 year savings period. There is a Umit of $1,200 in respect of the increase in the applicant's savings in each 6 months in the savperiod, but excess savings in any period may applied to offset decreases in savings in a subsequent period. Where there is more than one applicant, the savings of the joint appUcants are aggregated and treated as though they were the savings of one person. It wiU be for the appUcants joindy to determine to whom the grant will be payable. For savings periods of less than 3 years-that is, where the appUcant held no acceptable savings on a date 3 years before the date of the contract to buy or build the homethe current Act provides no reward. This Bill provides a maximum grant of $667 where the savings period is at least one year, and $1,333 where the savings period is at least 2 years. The Bill provides that savings periods shall commence before 1 January 1976. Conseto quently, during 1977 the maximum grant paypartly able will be $667. Grants of up to $1,333 come payable from 1978, and the full $2,000 grants will become avaUable from 1979. As a concession to those people who were not holding their savings in the acceptable forms at the time the scheme was announced on 31 March, and to give themtimeto convert savings not held in acceptable forms, the ministerial statement undertook that savings held at 31 May 1976 would be deemed to have been held since 1 January 1976, and the Bill gives effect to that undertaking. Honourable members may recall that the Home Savings Grant Act 1964 provides that grants under that Act are paid from the National Welfare Fund under a special appropriation. The Government has decided that grants payvision able from I July 1977 under the new home savconstruction ings grant scheme will be funded by way of an annual appropriation. This step has been taken solely for the purpose of enabling parliamentary scrutiny of home savings grant expenditure, and is not to be construed as implying any intention on the part of the Government to Umit the of expenditure on grants. Since the Appropriation Acts do not provide for funds for grants to Bill, be paid under the new scheme in this financial year, the Bill provides a special appropriation ing from the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund in respect As of grants payable up to 30 June 1977 only. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the 12 years of opervided ation of the current home savings grant scheme, more than 360 000 grants have been made to assist people to acquire their first homes. I fidently expect the new scheme to assist a far greater number, and to be of real and continuing benefit to the people of Australia. I commend Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) show adjourned. NA (No. 2) 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 November, on motion by Mr Nixon: That the Bill be now read a second time.",52
98,Mr MORRIS,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"The function of this Bill-the Roads Acts Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976-is to amend the National Roads Act 1974 and the Roads Grants Act 1974 by allocating to the States an additional amount of financial assistance totalling $35.8m for the curnot rent financial year. The Government's decision grant this supplementary assistance, which onsets cost increases in the current year, will bewas first announced by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his mini-Budget on 20 May. In line with the low priority accorded transport expenditure by this corrupt conservative Government the amount of $35.8m to be appropriated is less than one-quarter of the cost escalation adjustthe ment of $ 157m recommended by the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads for 1976-77. Despite the pleadings of State Ministers for Transport at the forty-sixth Australian Transport Advisory Conference held earUer this year for a substantial cost escalation grant to offset the ravages of high inflation and record unemployment fostered by this Government, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has acted as an apologist for his Cabinet colleagues by supporting the proof only $35.8m for cost increases in road and maintenance. It is a pity for the transport scene in Australia that the Minister does not apply some of that same vigour and inflammatory approach that he displays in his union bashing exercises instead to his Cabinet coUeagues to ensure that transport in the States level gets a fair share of national revenue. Although the Opposition does not oppose the I will at a later stage in the debate be movan amendment to the Bill in its present form. has become usual with previous transpon matters, the Minister has sought to misrepresent the true position in relation to funds being proby this Government for roads. In his statement issued on 20 May 1976 following the Treasurer's mini-budget of the same date, the conMinister, by referring to cash oudays, sought to give the impression that including the $35.8m in this Bill, a total of $453.5m would be avaUable the for road construction and maintenance this financial year. He compared thisfigurewith an amount of $413.5m for 1975-76 and sought to that $453.5m was an increase of $40m for this year. It was another paltry exercise in figure juggling as he neglected to point out that this corThat rupt Government had asked the States to defer rate claims on road funds of $20m for 1975-76 until July so that the cash payments of $20m would show as a cash outlay in 1976-77. The facts are I that $433.5m was appropriated for 1975-76 and the same amount will be appropriated for this year, as is correctly shown in the Budget Papers. In real terms-that is after allowing for inflathink tion-the available funds for roads this year been reduced by 12 per cent, or one-eighth. The apportionment of the $35.8m provided for in Bill is as follows: Additional grants in respect firstly, maintenance of national highways in programs. Queensland, $2m-and that is the only provision for national highways; secondly, construction of rural arterial roads and developmental roads shared amongst the 6 States, $13.83m; thirdly, construction and maintenance of rural local roads shared among the 6 States, $ 16.37m; and fourthly, construction of urban arterial roads which is shared by Queensland $1.6m, South Australia $lm and Western Australia $lm, givlook ing a total of $35.8m. I draw the attention of the House to the fact Wales. that the Bureau of Roads had recommended that year $ 157m be made available to the States this year needed by way offinancialassistance to offset cost Bill it will increases. The provision of $35.8m in this Bill is Bureau's recommendation. 23 per cent of the amount that the Bureau ommended. Under the circumstances, this is a pressed as a proportion of the provisions quite inadequate provision. It is pointless for Minister to claim that State Ministers for Transport were consulted on this matter. They miserableness were told by the Minister that they what they would get and that was that. That was February 1975, an additionalGovernment. the extent of the consultation. At the Australian avaUable at the request of the Premiers Transport Advisory Conference meeting last year 1974-75. The Hayden Budget of last March the transport Ministers strongly provided emphasised the difficulties they called for the linking of road grants to the consumer price index. But that request was to no avail. Increases in road costs are in the main beyond the control of the States. Increases in the price bituminous products flow from international market prices. But this Government has chosen to ignore the pUght it is creating for road construction authorities by providing only 23 cent of the cost escalation grant recommended by the Bureau of Roads. The Government's cUs. action is in keeping with its past record transport funding. We only have to look at Hume Highway to see the result of 23 Liberal Party and National Country Party neglect of road planning and road funding. The 1975 Bureau of Roads report stated: the national roads program should have the highest of growth of any of the road programs as this area of expenditure has been relatively neglected in the past and 1 there is a large backlog of work to be overcome. recall that in an earlier debate of this nature this year the Minister made the point that the amount being provided for national highways was much greater on a percentage basis than was being provided for other categories. On that occasion I the House decided to delete from the prohave gram that had been approved by the previous Minister for Transport a sum in excess of $6m. the That amount of money has been diverted from of, the national highways program to other The Whitlam Government did much to remedy the problems created by the neglect of previous conservative governments. No government in a mere 3 years could have solved all the problems in our road system which were brought about by 23 years of maladministration by previous Liberal-Country Party governments. Let us in more detail at the recommendations of the Bureau of Roads in respect of New South The Bureau recommended an inflation adjustment for New South Wales in the current of $56.4m. New South Wales desperately and expected at least $32m. Under this receive $ 11.3m or 20 per cent of the That 20 per cent is receven less than the Bill's total Bureau's extotal the recommendation.

I take the tunity of welcoming the Minister into the chamber. This is thefirstBill, in a succession of, think, four, for which the Minister has seenfitto pay the Parliament the courtesy of attending.

We beshould be looking for the reasons behind this the Bill. We should not be looking at the amount of work that needs to be done and not at the kilometres of roads that need to be maintained, upgraded or built, but at the policy of the in ensuring that there is a record of unemployment and that there is a reducthe debate tion in real wages.

I That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the second reading of the Bill the is of the opinion that the Bill fails to provide adequate financial assistance to the States for cost escalation governments. If in the current year'. I turn now to the importance of road programs in the national transport scene and to future funding of road programs. Transport in all its aspects - sea , rail, road and air-is a major component of our economy. Some 10 per cent of gross national expenditure relates to transport; 6 per cent of the workforce is employed in the transport industry in one form or another-that is more than 350 000 Australians. It is important in a federation such as ours with vast areas and with population spread mainly on the seaboard with a sparse scattering through the interior that transport have a very strong voice in the economic management of the country. Transport decisions have very important effects on other industries and on other aspects our economy. Transport planning and transport expenditure ought to have a major priority in federation. The major problem looming for the future in respect of transport and particularly respect of roads is the intentions of this ment towards road funding. Earlier this year the Minister at an ATAC conference of Transport is Ministers talked about future means of funding road programs in Australia. Unfortunately more has been said of what is to happen. At present time the State governments dered as to what are this Government's intentions for the financial year beginning 1977-78. The current triennium for road funding coneralism. cludes on 30 June next year. There is a very long lead-intimeinvolved in road construction. cisions have to be made upon where roads ought to go. There are decisions to make on what roads cide ought to be upgraded or improved. Firstly, that has to be done at local level, then at State government and Federal Government levels where necessary. Then there has to be the told budgeting of funds and an application and apinterpretations proval of funds. In many cases, this will be lowed by the calling of tenders for work or the supply of materials. All of those things mean that there is a very long lead-intimeinvolved road construction. It is vital if we are to have continuity of ployment in the workforce associated with roads and road maintenance that the States know the position as soon as possible. The triennium cludes on 30 June next year. The States should have been informed up to 12 months ago of what the Government's intentions were for the next period-that is the period after 1 July next We have heard a great deal about so-called federalism which I choose to define as coercive eralism because it means in effectMr Wilson-What did you say?",54
100,Mr MORRIS,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will explain to the honourable member for Sturt what the policy of his Government represents. It is coercive federalism. If he has any doubts about this, I suggest that he talk to some of the State Transport Ministers and learn. The honourable member heard his own Minister speaking at the table here a few minutes ago. He told us how he successfully stood over the State Transport Ministers. I cannot give the honourable member any better proof than that in reply to his interjection. That is the definition and operation of coercive federalism. What I fear is that the Government has in mind a certain course of action. I do not believe that the Minister would give any indication of it. It would be unlike his character to of make an explanation during this debate. What I and some of the State Transport Ministers fear any the Government proposes to do after 1 July next year is to make bloc grants to State treasuries and in then leave it to the State governments to apGovernportion what money they will spend on education, health and transport. I think possibly that alien to the Minister's nature. I know that such a proposition is opposed by his own department. no But it is the kind of policy that has been the iromoted by the present Government, particuare bewil- [arly by the Prime Minister. It is defined as federalism. I call it coercive fedIn effect, it is an answer to a federal politician 's dream. It means relieving the Federal DeParliament and the Federal Government of the responsibility to make difficult decisions, to dedifficult priorities. If this is to be the case, the States ought to be told now. If there is to be a new triennium and a continuation of amended existing arrangements, the States ought to be that now. But all the signs I see and all the I can make of statements by the folPrime Minister lead me to the opinion that what for the Government has in mind is to make bloc grants on an annual basis from 1 July next year. in A special meeting of State transport Mimsters with our Federal Minister for Transport has been called for 3 December. Such is the state of conemsultation that this special meeting has had to be called to enable State Ministers to try to ascertain from this Government what it proposes to do in 7 conmonths time. I do not know whether we will obtain any result from that, but surely this is the place and thetime,late as it is, for the Government to be laying down what it proposes to do in year. financing road construction in the future. fedLet us move a Uttle away from that subject to deal with the apparatus behind road funding and road programming. I want to refer specifically to the future of the Bureau of Roads. As announced earlier this year, the Bureau of Roads is to amalgamated with the Bureau of Transport Economics. The Bureau of Roads Act 1964 is be repealed and the Bureau amalgamated back into the department. Already from all around Australia objection is coming from local councils and motorists' associations to this move by Government. It is a further move to secrecy, to close off the access of the community, including councils, members of the general pubUc and motorists' organisations. This point was put very strongly by the motorists' organisations from the States to the Bland Administrative Review Committee. This was another secret inquiry fights whose report is so good it cannot be tabled in the Parliament. We do not know about mendations of that Committee. The Government does not place a high priGovernment ority upon roads and a high priority upon coma munity input. Its attitudes towards transport must be such that the members of the community - Mr and Mrs John Citizen who use our roads, trains, buses and aeroplanes-hav e an increasing opportunity to say something about the decisions that are being made in respect to the services they pay to use. The Bureau of Roads since has performed an excellent job in laying down financial policy or making recommendations specifically uponfinancialpolicy for road programs to Fedfact eral governments. The Bureau has won wide accommittee ceptance from all levels of government and, of aU, from the community. To disband or abolmittee ish the Bureau and to make it part of the departto ment, as the Minister proposes, is a retrograde step for road users, for all motorists and for local government authorities. I urge the Minister to reconsider that decision and to leave of Roads in its amalgamated form as an independent statutory authority. There is an alternative. The Bureau of Transport Economics could be amalgamated with the Bureau of Roads into an expanded independent authority. The Opposition believes that this is the proper course to follow. A further matter to which I wish to refer relates to road funding and the difficulty that will be created from a national economic manageapproach ment point of view because the Government has indicated its future course on road funding is of integrated transport management. The Libbrought eral and National Country parties stated in their policy speeches that they beUeved in integration of transport modes by rail, road, sea and air. it is poindess to have a pohcy like that if your Prime Minister is promoting a view to the effect that the States should be left more and more to be themselves. Urban roads were among the matters referred to by the Prime Minister at the to Premiers Conference last February. They were cited as among those activities that would best be left to local government. If the policy to be followed by this Government means that funds are the to be handed back to the States and the States left to decide priorities, we will have aU sorts of catfightswithin State governments as well. We will see not only an abandonment of a planned move towards proper and efficient co-ordination all of public expenditure upon various modes of transport. We wdl also see develop then cat within State treasuries. State Transport departments will be trying to obtain priority within the recomtheir State treasuries. Let me make the position very clear to the Government. So far as the New South Wales is concerned, it would prefer to see situation in which there is a continuation of specific purpose grants. It would prefer to see a continuation of legislation sinular to that brought in under the Whidam Labor Government-the National Roads Act, the Road Grants Act and the various categories of roads or programs. They may not be in such a specific form but that 1964 State favours a continuation of funds made available under section 96 of the Constitution for road purposes. Irrespective of the that I understand the representatives of the in Victoria are meeting in relation to most transport- I think that the Queensland comalso has been instructed by its government press for the bloc grants I spoke about earlier- I want it made quite clear that there are States which prefer and strongly desire that the section 96 system of specific purpose grants for the Bureau transport be continued. The integration that I mentioned earUer of transport expenditure is a vital issue so far as our Federation is concerned. It is pointless just to refer to transport as being important, to complain about transport and blame the unions for the problems in regard to it. The major problems of transport are problems that developed between 1949 and 1972 because of a lack of coordinated planning. A return to a stop-go kind of to transport funding will be a return to the same situation. There wdl be more of the that same lack of policy we had until 1972 which about duplication and triplication in modes of transport and complete severance of transport facilities in some areas. The responsiBut bUity is now with the Government not to play poUtics with transport, not to use road funding as a means of increasing the number of unemployed, and not to give State governments 23 per cent of their proper entitlement for cost escalation grants in the current financial year. It is up to the Government to see that transport gets proper priority and that is the Minister's responsibility. I do not think he was here when I commented earlier, but I will repeat it for his benefit, that to make sure that transport does get the kind of money that is needed I wish he would use on his Cabinet colleagues some of that vigour and inflammatory approach which he uses on unions. I have expressed the Opposition's attitude earlier and it is outlined in the terms of the amendment. I commend the amendment to the House.",56
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,Is the amendment seconded?,58
102,Mr WILLIS,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,58
103,Mr WILSON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"We have just heard the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) present to the House a totally illogical argument about the Government's new federalism policy. He criticised that pohcy as being coercive. I want to bring to his attention what to reasonable men is a proper and correct definition of 'coercive federalism' and for that purpose I draw on a quotation from Professor Mathews in which he pointed out that 'coercive federalism' was a style of government marked by centralisation of power, unequal bargaining strength and the distortion of the priorities of lower levels of government. In a recent speech deUvered in Canberra the Chairman of the Grants Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell said: Had there not been a change of government 12 months ago it is probable that the stage might have been reached where, as Chief Justice Latham had said in the first uniform taxation case, the States would independence a large measure of their capacity to initiate their own policies. Having criticised this Government for its federalism policy, the honourable member for Shortland went on to advocate a continuance of the coercive use of section 96 grants which grew a great deal under the Labor Administration to the point where those grants rose to represent some 50 per cent of Commonwealth transfers to the States other than loans. In our federalism poUcy we indicated that we were concerned at the manner in which section 96 grants dominate the revenue of the States. We acknowledged in that policy that many of the existing section 96 grants are now a part of well established and universally accepted programs within the States and that moneys for such programs could be transferred to general purpose revenue reimbursement and ultimately absorbed in the States income tax revenue or in local government income tax revenue. In the case of grants for roads we have a classic illustration of where this process of absorption could and should be appUed. I emphasise that the process of absorption does not merely mean giving to State or local governments a responsibility to fulfil road programs and leaving them to find the financial resources. What 'absorption' means is the replacement of a tied section 96 grant with general revenue grants sufficient to enable the lower levels of government to carry out the functions which have been transferred to them. Turning to the roads program, roads representing 10 per cent of section 96 grants and 3.99 per cent of income tax or 4.64 per cent of total Commonwealth funds provided to the States. Many of these programs are now running in such an estabUshed fashion that it is appropriate for the Government to seriously consider the transference from section 96 provisions into general revenue grants. I am pleased to note that in a number of departments responsible for section 96 grants there are working parties and I believe that one is operating in the Department of Transport. I await with keen interest the outcome of its investigations. I trust that it will examine in all seriousness the Government's federalism policy and, with real determination, make decisions that will devolve responsibUity and revenue resources on State and local governments. It is sometimes argued that because there are spUl-over effects a road going through one municipality or passing through one State cannot be effectively constructed and designed as part of a total network without adjoining areas being taken into account. Of course that is true but it is no reason for decision making on roads to be have lost if not their political totally centralised. Under a federal system of government it is important that the various levels of government acknowledge the fact that there are these spUl-over effects and that they occur no more significantly than in the case of roads. It is important that in doing so each unit of government should not think that it is being efficient within its own area if it disregards the effects on other areas. There is a danger that 'each unit of government will think it is being efficient but the totality of decision will be inefficiency'. However, local government and the States recognise this fact and so long as they do have just as much capacity to determine appropriate road programs as the Commonwealth Government. I believe that the Bureau of Roads 1975 report on roads in Australia should be re-examined. That report was handed down towards the end of last year. It was prepared at atimewhen there was a centralist government in office and report failed to take account policy. This document should be sent back to Bureau of Roads or its successor with a request that it be re-written to take account of the ment's federalism pohcy. What it did was merely take account of the financial arrangements were operating at the time it was prepared every aspect failed to identify the significant ement in the federalism pohcy, that is, that each level of government which is responsible part of the program should have the revenue resources available to it to enable it to implement that part. In a recent report on local government in Australia and New Zealand, the Underbility Secretary for Local Government in New South Wales, Mr J. T. Monaghan, said: Theoretically there is something to be said for channelling all such assistance through one local government assistance fund. I beheve that the working party that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has set up to look into the question of funding of roads should give serious consideration to whether the funds going to local government, including those funds being made available for roads, should go through one local government assistance fund. see no reason why the local government Grants Commission within the States could not be given the responsibility of distributing the general revenue funds and those that might be block granted or earmarked in a general way for expenditure on roads. The reports of such local government Grants Commissions could should take into account the recommendations of a body like the Bureau of Roads. But, insofar as local government has now come to accept as part of its regular income the grants it receives under the roads program, I think local governNew ment could be better served in the long run by having those revenues coming as part of its general revenue linked as a proportion of income tax. The joint study into local government financHis ing itself recommended that it would seem apcils of propriate to undertake a complete review of the has been system of grants to local authorities in Australia the councUs with the view to establishing a more systematic the New South and co-ordinated approach. It had in mind the South Wales Government lack of co-ordination that now exists in the proreasonable proposal put forward vision of funding for local government through Minister that Statefinancialassistance general revenue grants and through the provision of road money. Road money is now, for many shires and councils, part of their established revenue and, insofar as it is so established, it is a classic illustration of a Section 96 grant a program eminently suitable and appropriate the be absorbed into the general revenue of local of the federalism government. the The same also can be said of many of the programs relating to roads within the States. Indeed, Goverunder the framework of the then centralist socialist Government, the Bureau of Roads did that consider as one option in its recommendations and in the possibility of the Australian Government elfinancing only its own road program and suggested that if that were the case all that the for a Commonwealth need do would be to provide 18.8 per cent of the total road funds. What the Bureau there faded to do was to identify the fact that if there were to be that transfer of responsito local government and the States there would have to be a transfer of revenue so that the States and local government could meet their new responsibilities. I believe that transfer of general revenue should take place and I urge the body examining this matter to study this proposal most carefully. It may be that in the short run, however, the process needs to be a phased one from a specific grant through some form of now block grant arrangement which requires the States and local government to spend money on roads and prevents them from substituting those I resources for their own funds which they then spend on other areas. I believe that as the roads agreement comes up for examination it is essential that those who work upon it do so against the background of the Government's federalism pohcy, which is designed to pass decision making priority determination down to the State and and local government bodies.",58
104,Mr BAUME,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL," I have been an enthusiastic viewer of a fascinating battle that is being fought by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) with his opposite number in the State of South Wales. It is a battle that I hope the Federal Minister is going to win. It is a battle on which he so clearly is in the right and about which the proposals he has put are so clearly the proper proposals that I believe it would be most unfortunate if he were to faU in his endeavours. endeavours are on behalf of the local counNew South Wales. The Federal Minister endeavouring to do therightthing by that have been, in effect, starved by Wales Government. The New has rejected a very by the Federal be given to local government for its rural roads programs. Many questions have been put to the Minister in this House and the Minister has quite clearly for indicated that he believes that it is only right and to proper and, under the federalism proposals, which already have been discussed here today, evidendy in keeping with the co-operative federalism supported by the Government that the State governments contribute something to local government for local government's road programs. Mr Cox, the New South Wales Minister for Transport, has rejected the Federal Minister's suggestions and in fact has been very difficult to get on with about how the extra $ 11.3m in Federal money being allocated to New South Wales for roads should be distributed in the country areas. In fact, the State Government wanted to grab most of it for its own main roads operations. Of course, the residual amount that would then go to local government simply would not be enough to sustain the essential work that is required in the country areas. This seems to be a typical example of the tralian Labor Party's attitude that the rural areas do not matter a damn. That pohcy-thos e attivious tudes-ar e clearly reflected in both the previous Government's attitude to the rural areas and, course, the attitude of the present Labor GovernFor ment in New South Wales. There is a massive concentration on the more dramatic expendiAustralia, tures, such as the expenditure on the Hume Highway. I must say that I am very grateful to see a large amount of money being spent in electorate on the Hume Highway. I would like take this opportunity of thanking the Minister allocating half, I think, of the total amount money to be spent on the Hume Highway year to the electorate of Macarthur. But the facts are very serious when one takes into consideration the obstructionism in terms of assisting the rural sector, where there are many centres that are farflungfrom each other, where the road is in fact a vital means of communication, where other systems of transport are not available and where the road is the link between people in the country. It is interesting that the 1975 report of Bureau of Roads recommended in recommendatrying tion 101 that the Australian Government should request the New South Wales Government to make appropriate contributions for rural local roads under the control of local government authorities. That report was presented in 1975, when a different government was in power here. I believe that the report is a very sensible one. wonder how a Labor Minister for Transport in this place would be now responding to the oblegislation. structionism of the Labor Minister for Transport in New South Wales. There is a clear need for this money to be directed to local government. Of the $11.3m provided by the Federal Government to New South Wales, $6.63m is to go towards the State's expenditure in rural areas, leaving only $4.67m. That alone is probably not enough. That is what we have recommended. Mr Cox, of course, is reluctant even to aUow that level of funds to be spent among the local councils. The fact is, ofcourse, that we do not have the power to direct, nor should we have the power to direct, the State Government how to distribute this money. I agree with the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) that federaUsm should in fact mean a withdrawal of even some of our existing powers of direction and that we should leave it to the good sense-in this case the absence of good sense-of New South Wales to direct where the money should go. But the fact is, of course, that, left to themselves, governments Aus-Uke the present New South Wales Government have not done their bit-it may well be that pregovernments in New South Wales have not done as much as I believe should have been of done-for the rural people of New South Wales. example, the Bureau of Roads has advised that the States themselves overall, throughout increased their outlays on roads at an average rate of only 8.7 per cent per annum from 1970 to 1975. This means, in fact, that they did my not keep pace with inflation over this period. to That means that the amount spent on roads in for real terms has been declining on these kinds of of roads compared with a 16.4 per cent growth in this total State budget outlays. Apparently the States no longer consider that maintenance of roads at this level is an important function. I suggest that one of the reasons this has taken place is because of the intrusive role that the Federal Labor Government played in giving the States the false impression that the States could abrogate their responsibilities because of the paternalistic, oppressive, centralist role which was being played in Canberra. I hope the the recognition that this Federal Government is to do therightthing is widespread. I hope there is widespread recognition of the faUure of the New South Wales Government to contribute at all to local councUs in the State. In fact it is something which should be changed. It is true that the State legislation does not allow the New South Wales Government to make these conI tributions to local government but there is nothing to stop that Government from changing the I believe it is only right and proper that that legislation should be changed. Let us face it, that Government does have a responsibUity for local government. Local government in fact comes under the legislative control of the State of New South Wales and I think it is quite disgraceful that it should continue to duck for cover in this area. In conclusion may I commend the Minister for Transport in this place for what he has achieved. There is no doubt that this Government has increased the total amount of funds provided over that provided by the Labor Government, which regrettably was here for 3 disastrous years, by $7.15m to $51.52m or 26 per cent. That is $820,000 above the level recommended in the report by the Bureau of Roads. No one can say that this Federal Government is ducking its responsibilities, that it is not meeting the objecseriously tives set, and quite properly set, in the report commissioned by this Government's predemembers cessor. It is important to recognise, when we the Opposition spokesman on transport turn-around complaining about lack of money and saying that not enough is going in this direction, this Government is exceeding the target set in fact is endeavouring to do the right thing by the local councils in New South Wales, which concern me in particular, whereas a Government of his political persuasion in New South Wales still refusing to meet its responsibilities to improve and maintain the roads in that State through the proper authorities, the local governwas ment authorities. I commend the Minister chamber for what he is doing and I wish him well in his continuing battle with the State Labor improper Minister in New South Wales. I trust that Mr House should Nixon will triumph over that kind of adversity.",59
105,Mr MACKENZIE,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"It is likely that I am the last speaker in this debate and I very conscious that there are other issues on the notice paper of this House, particularly bate on the defence statement. Therefore what reluctandy I shall make my remarks brief. This issue of roads is an extremely important and I look forward at some other time in House to speaking at greater length on the critical situation of roads, particularly the situation we must face up to in future. I think honourable members would be well aware that there has been a change in the administration of road grants funding by the Commonwealth. Under the previous Act, the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, there was an been inbuilt multiplier effect of, I think, 5 per cent which provided a continuing basis on which local government and the State governments could ensure that road funding was forthcoming. That Act cut out in 1973-74 when a new Act was instithe tuted to take effect from 1974-75. Whilst it worth noting that Federal road funding throughout Australia continued to increase at what could be called a satisfactory rate, and total road funding for a State like New South Wales also continued to increase at what would be considered a satisfactory rate-it kept pace with inflation- I draw to the attention of the House the fact that this was not the case with some road categories. It certainly was not the case with rural road categories, both rural arterial roads and rural local roads. In fact with the implementation of the new legislation by the previous Government funding for the 2 rural categories headed for a disastrous decline. That decline was even more reflected in rural local road funding than in rural arterial road funding. If honourable could see these graphs that I have here hear they would see that there was quite a dramatic in funding. In fact there was not only a very real decline; it fell well below the that level that it would have been if the Commonand wealth Aid Roads Act had been continued and its 5 per cent increment had been continued. This is yet another example of the attitude of the previous Government and the previous Minister for is Transport, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones). I could hardly regard his performance today as being honourable. It indicative of his Party's attitude towards the in this plight of people in rural areas. Mr Morris- I take a point of order.

106,Mr MACKENZIE,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"On e of the greatest problems that resulted was the inflationary increase in road building and road maintenance costs. It was considerably higher than the overall level of inflation we experienced during the previous Government's regime and during this Govern-., ment's regime. Some indices of road costs have increasing by 15 per cent, 20 per cent, and in some cases 25 per cent a year. Other consequences of the disastrous cutback in funding under the new legislation introduced by the previous Government are well illustrated now by problems of unemployment that local shires is and municipalities are now experiencing. We know of examples where they have had to stand down staff. I understand that as a result of decisions some shire councils are in even more serious circumstances, such that they have the capacity to maintain roads. The cutbacks that we experienced in the 1974 legislation have resulted in increased transport costs following the deterioration of road surfaces. We have seen increased safety risks, particularly with school children in buses. Of course, this been totally contrary to the whole thrust development of decentralisation in country areas. It also has affected some of the industries stituting which supply the materials used in road making ond and the materials and goods used for road hardBill ware and road furniture. The Commonwealth States Bureau of Roads did point out that there is siderable cost benefit return for investment in roads. I now turn to the provisions of this Bill. This the second time that this Government has firmlyfor committed itself to restoring the level of road funding, to getting over the disastrous level we experienced under the previous Government. The first measure that it introduced in this respect on coming to power was to provide additional $64m for the 1975-76 program. This legislation provides an additional $3 5.8m current year's program. The honourable memGovernment ber for Macarthur (Mr Baume) has dwelt at length on the problems which are being experiment enced by our Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) in this House and by his counterpart in New South Wales. I believe it is hightimethat States took on their responsibility for rural local road funding and stopped trying to hide behind the supposed excuse that their legislation does not provide for them to do so. I have had people say to me that the Minister for Transport in this House is not fully how serious the conditions are of our rural local and arterial roads. I remind honourable members that from my experience some of the roads have been over in the electorate of Gippsland undoubtedly the worse in Australia. I recomshadow mend the Suggan Buggan road, the Omeo Hightrayed, way or the road down over MCKillop's Bridge. trunk it is not at all relevant that people say the Minister is not aware of the plight of local councils and municipaUties in relation to financing. He is aware of how serious the economic situation of this country was when we government. We cannot turn around and rectify those examples of neglect overnight. The ation will be restored. I encourage the Minister and support him, in conjunction with the honourable member for Macarthur, in ensuring that the Commonwealth plays its rightful role in those association and agreement with the States and that the States also play their rightful role in the may not whole area of road finance.",61
107,Mr NIXON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-I thank the honourable members who have taken part in the debate today. After hearing the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) speak I am reminded of has how easy life must be m Opposition. He has and moved an amendment which states: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'whilst not opposing the secreading of the Bdl the House is of the opinion that the fails to provide adequatefinancialassistance to the for cost escalation in the current year'. a conThat is an extraordinary amendment. Let us have a look at the history of this legislation. The Act was brought into this House by the Ausis traUan Labor Party Government and it provided a 3-year program. I shall cite somefigureson urban arterial roads. The Bureau of Roads recthat ommended that $460m be made avaUable. The Labor Government gave $355m. In relation to rural arterial roads, the Bureau of Roads recan ommended $257m but the Labor Government gave $105m. On rural local roads, the Bureau of for the Roads recommended $200m and the Labor gave $156m. I think that puts in proper perspective the sincerity of this amendand just how much the Opposition means when it moves amendments of this nature. When the Labor Party was in government it simply the faded to do what honourable members get up and talk about today. Another point of interest which ought to be made is that only one member of the Labor Party spoke on this roads Bill which again demonstrates the Labor Party's real lack of interest in roads matters. I think that that explains the paucity of the Opposition's interest aware of when it can provide only one speaker. I come to some detaU. Today I attended a Imeeting of some 200 local government councilare lors. It was an interesting meeting. I wish the Minister for Transport, as he is porcould have been there to listen to some of I the comments. I shall cite somefigureswhich that affect his own State and which were introduced by the Labor Government. In 1974-75 the Buroad reau of Roads recommended that $21.3m be made avaUable for rural arterial roads. The took Labor Government made avaUable not $21.3m but $ 11.2m. In 1975-76 the Bureau of Roads recsituommended $26.4m and the Labor Government gave $9.7m. In 1976-77 the Bureau of Roads recommended $29.2m and the Labor Government gave $8.8m. Is it any wonder that I had to attend a meeting of 200 local government councillors today and explain to them why it was that they were unable properly tofinancetheir roads? add to this situation the fact that in New South Wales the State Labor Government does not give one cent to local roads. We can see from the poor position in which authoriuesfindthemselves in New South Wales. That brings me to another point. The honourable member for Shortland accused me of using cowealth ercive federalism. Mr Morris-You admitted it.",62
108,Mr NIXON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"I did not admit that at all. What I said was that I had been successful with the State Ministers. Let me come to that story. All States but Victoria and New South Wales agreed with the proposals we put to them in relation to this legislation. The Victorian Government had been saying for a long time that there were not enough funds for local councils in rural areas. State members of Parliament were going around the countryside blaming the Commonwealth for that fact. When we announced that we were givgests ing an extra $35.8m for roads, of which $7.5m or was for Victoria, I said that the $7.5m would in addition to the roads funds and the roads grams already announced in Victoria. But apparconspiracies ently it was in the minds of those who run the roads authority in Victoria to swallow the $7.5m by extracting $7.5m of State funds and leaving the totalfigurethe same. But I was not prepared to accept that. If that is called coercive federalTransport, ism, then I am guilty of coercion in that way berequest. cause the Victorian Government had been saynot ing that there were not enough funds in total terms available for local rural roads. I wanted see that the $7.5m was in addition to that amount. The Victorian Government after some difficulty; nevertheless, it saw reason. That is my explanation of the Victorian situation. Let me come to the New South Wales position. I think The New South Wales Government does not has saidthe give one cent to local government authorities for local roads. The Government has legislation which prevents it from doing that. Mr Cox, the New South Wales Minister for Transport and Minister for Highways, has written to me saying that he will not change the legislation to allow New South Wales to give money to local governinform ments for local roads as they ought to be able do that out of their own pockets. In Mr Cox's proposals to me he wanted 30 per cent of those funds for urban arterial roads. Ifindthat in ney he is busy selling off land which viously acquired for urban arterial roads to finance his subsidy of the rail transport fares. That is what he says he is doing with the money. On the one hand he is selling off land which was acquired for urban arterial freeways and on the We other hand he is asking me to make more funds available for urban arterial freeways. The man is totally illogical. There is no sense to him. this Mr BAUME - Who provides the money in the the local government first place?",63
109,Mr NIXON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"That is right. It was Commonfunds in the first place. So I say to Mr Cox that this does not seem to me to be fair. It seems to me that as the previous Government reduced the level of funds to rural arterial roads and rural local roads and as the Commonwealth Government is seen to be totally responsible for funding local government authorities, the extra $ 11.3m ought to go to local government authorities. That seems to me to be a normal, rational proposition. Mr Morris-Standover !",63
110,Mr NIXON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"The trouble with the honourable member for Shortland is that he is a conspiracy man. Everything he sees is a conspiracy. He sugthat the Government is hiding information it is not doing that; that it is appointing secret be committees. I know the honourable member procomes out of the Newcastle area where are the order of the day. But he happens to be in the national Parliament. If he cannot grow physically, it is time that he grew in stature, at least a little, so that he can leave the conspiracy bit behind. Mr Cox, the Minister for has not yet responded to my last I say now to Mr Cox that the $ 11.3m will be paid to New South Wales until I know what is to happen to it. This Parliament has a to right to know what is happening to the funds. Mr Cox has not yet responded and we will wait until saw reason he does respond. Mr Morris-That is what I said.",63
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL, Order! honourable member for Shortland himself. quite enough. I suggest that he restrain,63
112,Mr NIXON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Shortland raised one other matter, that is, the amalgamation of the Bureau of Transport Economics and the Bureau of Roads. I am able to the House that yesterday the Governto ment agreed to the proposition that those bodies be amalgamated, and I have here a Press statement which I can read to the House if necessary. SydA lot of emotion has been engendered about this was preproposed amalgamation by some vested interests who do not wish the amalgamation to take place, without proper care and thought being given to what they were doing. The fact is that the amalgamation will lead to a better body, much more able to judge the whole of the transport scene in Australia and at the same time still provide for the national Parliament and for those who were interested reports on roads needs which they have provided in the past. Nothing wiU be lost by the 2 bodies being amalgamated. Indeed, a lot will be gained because members of the Bureau of Roads will be able to expose their thinking to other members of the new amalgamated organisation and hopefully they will come to even better judgments than they have in the past. I say quite frankly that I look forward working with the new amalgamated body. I am sure it will give better service to local government authorities throughout Australia in respect of roads and in respect of the many other areas on which governments have been assisted over the past few years. The honourable member for Shortland, in his conspiracy fashion, put out a Press statement 14 November. He called for an Australia-wide study to be undertaken into the transport try. Obviously he has not been doing his homefor work properly, and he ought to confer with honourable member who was retired from the debate. House this morning for some reason or another. Mr Morris-He didn't appoint his relatives to jobs, did he? You cannot say that about him.",63
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for Shortland will not interject. He has made his speech. He should let the Minister finish his speech in peace and quiet.,64
114,Mr NIXON,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"What the honourable member is forthwith. saying is that not enough studies are being done on the transport industry in Australia and he has called for an Australia-wide study. The Bureau time. of Transport Economics has done an enormous amount of work on transport problems throughout Australia. All those reports have been made available, but the honourable member for time. Shortland obviously has not been bothering to read them. The studies have been done on a very broad and wide-ranging series of subjects. Indeed, they have added considerably to the depth of knowledge of transport problems in the States for both State authorities and for the monwealth. Unbeknown to the honourable Levy member for Shortland, the studies have been very widely accepted by State authorities, and the Bureau of Transport Economics stands high in the minds of State transport authorities. Bill makes provision for an extra $35.8m roads. Of course the Government would like to do more. If the Labor Government had left the economy in reasonable shape we would have done more. Let me turn to one other matter which the honourable member for Shortland raised. He complained that the State authorities should have been in a position 12 months ago to know what was going to happen next year in respect of roads grants. The simple truth is that the Bureau of Roads report was not presented until 15 December 1975. Unlike the honourable member for Shortland, what I have done with that report is send it to the Australian Transport Advisory to Council Ministers-the State Ministers-for their consideration. They have had the report for some months, and a special meeting of ATAC will be held in the next couple of weeks to discuss future road legislation. For the honourable member for Shortland to come into this House and say that the States should have know about this 12 months ago again indicates that he does not know what he is talking about. I thank the on honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) for his contribution, the honourable member for indusSturt (Mr Wilson) and the honourable member Macarthur (Mr Baume). Those 3 speakers at the least made very sensible contributions to the Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Nixon) read a third APPLE AND PEAR LEVY BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first Second Reading",64
115,Mr SINCLAIR,ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. ComThe purposes of these Bills, the Apple and Pear Collection Bill 1976, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Bill 1976 and the Apple and Pear Export Charge Collection Bill 1976, are to provide for the imposition and collection of levies on This the production and sale in Australia of apples for and pears and a charge on apples and pears exported from Australia. These legislative proposals give effect to the recommendations of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association for a new basis offinancingthe activities of Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. The Corporation-prio r to September 1974 the Australian Apple and Pear Board-ha s derived its funds from a charge on apple and pear exports. With the steep decline that has occurred in the export trade, particularly in apples, the Corporation is lacking the necessary financial resources to carry out functions, particularly those related to development and promotion in the Australian domestic market. Given that the great bulk of production is sold in the domestic market, the Apple and Pear Growers' Association has proposed, and the Government has accepted, that in the interest of equity all growers should contribute finanwith cially to assist the activities of the Corporation. Honourable members may recall that proposals were before the Parliament, at thetimeof the double dissolution last year, for the Corporation to befinancedfrom the proceeds of a levy on bearing areas of apple and pear trees. The apple and pear growing industry, having reconsidered this proposal, has confirmed its original view it would prefer the levy to be based on the tity of fruit marketed, both in Australia overseas. This Bill and the Apple and Pear Levy CollecGenerally, tion Bill 1976 respectively, provide for the imposition and collection of levies on fruit marketed in Australia. As provided for in these measures, the rates of levy will not exceed 6c per box for apples and pears sold for consumption in fresh form, 60c per tonne for juicing fruit and $1.40 per tonneforprocessing fruit-othe r than pears for the production of canned fruit. Since growers delivering pears for the manufacture canned fruit are required to pay levies under the terms of the Canning-Fruit Charge Act 1959 for the purposes of the Australian Canned Fruit Sales Promotion Committee, they will be exempt from payment of the levies to be imposed, under the terms of the current proposals, in respect of canning pears. The Canned Fruit Sales Procial motion Committee is responsible for the conduct of promotional arrangements within Australia on, inter alia, canned pears. The Apple and Pear Export Charge Bill and the Apple and Pear Export Charge Collecexport tion Bill 1976 respectively provide for the imposition and collection of a charge on exports of apples and pears. The rate of this charge also not exceed 6 cents per box. Provision is made for the operative rates of levies, in respect of all leviable classes of fruit, to be prescribed regulations made after recommendations of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association the have been considered. In this connection I mention that the Government has accepted the Association's recommendation that the rates of levies to apply from the commencing date of the legislation, that is, 1 January 1977, should be 5 cents per box for fresh apples and pears, whether marketed in Australia or exported, 50 cents per tonne for juicing fruit and $1 per tonne for adequately its processing fruit. In general, the liability for the levies rests with the producers of the fruit. However, in order to reduce the number of collection points, and thus the costs of administering the scheme, the responsibility for remission of the levies to the Commonwealth will, for the most part, be placed selling agents, processors, quantity purchasers and exporters who, however, are being given the authority in law to recover the payment from their supplying growers. To further economise on the costs of administration, certain exemptions wiU apply. These wdl be in respect of fruit sold direct by growers at the orchard or at roadside stalls, or used by the grower himself for that juicing or processing purposes, if the relevant quanquantities do not exceed 500 boxes per annum, and or such other level as may be prescribed by regulations. the levy is payable 28 days after the end of the month in which the fruit was sold, processed or exported. An exception to this rule will be in the case of a grower who sells small quantities of fruit to minor fruit retailers or direct to consumers by retail at the orchard or roadside stall. In these circumstances the levy is payable by 28 February after the end of the year in which the sale was made. The appUcation of the rates of of levies proposed by the industry from 1 January 1977 is expected to provide the Corporation with an annual income of around $850,000. This compares with the Corporation's income of about $250,000 per annum from the proceeds of the existing charge on exports of apples and pears. These Bills are designed to ensure afirmfinanbase for the Apple and Pear Corporation, which has a vital role to play in assisting the industry in the face of problems which have developed in recent years, resulting in a severe 1976 cutback in the volume of apples moving to markets. The additional funds to be placed at the disposal of the Corporation from the new levy arrangements will enable it to make will a more positive contribution towards market development, particularly on the domestic scene. I might add that the industry has, unfortunately, by been in quite a parlous plight. The industry itself feels that part of the solution to developing future market arrangements lies in strengthening the role of the Corporation, and I am quite sure that this legislation will facilitate that objective. I am confident that there is a place in Australian horticulture for a viable apple and pear industry, and I believe that the Corporation will become more significant as a focal point for the industry's reorganisation and adjustment. It is imperative, however, that its financial support be assured if it is to fulfil its objectives. I further add in that regard that each of the producer organisations has said to me that it strongly supports this legislation and the levy that is part of it. I commend the Bill.

120,Mr HOWARD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure concerning this legislation. I suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill, as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put in regard to each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, that you permit the subject matter of the 3 Bills to be discussed in this debate.",66
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL, There being no objection I shall allow that course to be adopted.,67
122,Mr YOUNG,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Opposition is not opposed to these Bills. I should like to make some remarks concerning the provocation offered by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) when he spoke a few minutes ago; I shall be very brief. He accused the Opposition of not putting up speakers. It is not the practice of the Opposition to put up speakers merely for the sake of speaking. The Opposition has taken the attitude that members of the Opposition will speak on Bills which we consider important dealing with those areas in which we feel we ought to be expressing a view. However, we do not believe that it is in the interests of the Parliament or of the people merely to spend time speaking to Bills which concern procedural matters. If it is the wish of the Government that we put up more speakers, we can do that and thus delay the legislation and the rising of the House. The actions of the Opposition throughout the year have been to speak, when necessary on those matters, and on that legislation which is important to us. The Customs Amendment Bill is one of the matters which concern the rules of origin in the one-half area content whereby certain powers are being vested in the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) to be operated by his Department, which can be perhaps, without the information being passed on to the Parliament. There have been occasions when complaints have been received from indusfor try about being left in the dark in relation actions that have been taken by the Department without the Parliament being notified and, sequently, without interested parties outside Parliament being notified. I would have thought that whilst we agree, particularly in the case Papua New Guinea, with giving the Minister disidea cretion to waive the one-half rule, it is perhaps appropriate on occasions when that power is used for the Parliament to be notified. We have no objection at all to encouraging this discretion to be used in order to see that the independence of Papua New Guinea may be assisted. I just make those comments. Perhaps the Minister can take them into account when the discretionary power is used. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition I put it to the House that we have no opposition to the Bills.",67
123,Mr ABEL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Bills. I do not rise simply to take thetimeof the House in idle chatter or because a government speaker is the next speaker to receive the call. I would like to refer specifically to the second reading speech of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) wherein he states that action against trafficking in narcotics and the possession of narcotics illicitly imported still remains a function of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Narcotics are responsible for the greatest human tragedy that this country and the world has seen. I am sure that I would be joined by most honourable members and concerned Australians in predicting that in a few short years unless something is done to ensure that the import of illicit drugs to this country is cut off, we shall have a tragedy which we shall gready regret. I am not suggesting for one moment that the Bureau of Narcotics is not doing its job. Quite the contrary. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Bureau of Narcotics and its officers on the job that they do. Their job is not easy because those who would illicitly import drugs into this country are dealing in a multi-million doUar empire and their ways and means are devious. In most instances they use innocent people or those within their organisation who have little or nothing to lose but a lot to gain. The front page of last night's Daily Mirror carried a simple headline which referred to a real Business and tragedy. The headline stated: Smoking pot at 13 . . . shooting heroin at earned out, 16 . . . dead at 18. This is the story of a young boy with a lot to Uve who at 13 years of age was introduced to pot to and graduated to the big scale at death. His death was brought about by people throughout subthe world who have found a wonderful way of the making money. I refer to trafficking in heroin, marihuana, hashish, LSD and cocaine. I do not of know whether honourable members have any of the current value of the illicit drug, heroin. At the moment heroin in 0.2-gram capsule form sells for $40. On that basis a kilogram of heroin is worth $250,000. That is a lot of money. The size of the product is not very large economic but it can cause so much death. Seizures this year from 1 January to 31 October of heroin alone amount to 10 806 grams. This was almost 11 kilograms and the estimated market value is $3m. The 11 kilograms of heroin confiscated or seized was in pure form. However, the dealer and the pusher do not sell the heroin in that form. They like to adulterate They like to put various additives with it to increase its value. As it passes from one hand to another it goes into an adulterated form. Information that I have suggests that it can be adulterated up to a ratio of 10timesto one but that on average the ratio would be four orfiveto one. So this year 50 000 grams or more of adulterated herom could have found its way onto the marketplace at a market value of $ 10m. I have spoken about the value and quantity of heroin. But what about the doses? About has 250 000 doses of heroin could have obtained from the quantity I have just mentioned. Some of the 250 000 doses could have been available to my children, to the children all honourable members and to children and adults throughout this country. I am concerned about this problem. I am not standing here in this House as some sort of fool pushing a wheel banow. I stand here as a member of this place who has an opportunity to make the people of this country and honourable members aware of the seriousness of this problem. Illicit drugs multi-million dollar business that deals in death. I would like to refer again to the story of Jamie MCGRATH, the boy who smoked hisfirstjoint marihuana at 13 years of age. The father of this boy is concerned because he has lost a son. He concerned enough to devote time, effort and financial resources now to setting up a rehabilitaI tion centre to help young drug addicts. I hope people that the people of New South Wales, particularly narcoticwho those in Sydney, will get behind Mr MCGRATH and help him with this project. It is not a matter of catching the importer of drugs; we have a revidefor sponsibiUty as a Commonwealth government as said before much as the State governments to ensure that a ensure action proper rehabUitation program is provided for the poor unfortunates who become addicted to narcotic drugs. I believe that Mr MCGRATH will go tunatesable throughout his Ufe helping the unfortunates to through these have a future. Every day I read newspapers which carry headlines such as '$250,000 in drugs' and' Four on charges' or I read how $ 1 worth of drugs has been seized. As a matter of fact, $3m worth of drugs was seized at Ashfield, which is in my electorate, just 3 short weeks This sort of occurrence indicates that something has gone wrong with society. There seems to me to be a certain acceptance of drug taking today. There seems to be some degree of unawareness of the real problem. It is true that the problem is heroin, cocaine and LSD. But over one ton of hashish has been seized this year and surely that is where the problem is it. beginning. I am not a medical expert. Maybe marihuana has no harmful effects. But the fact is that an 18-year old boy who started smoking marihuana died from using herion.",67
124,Dr KLUGMAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,He started on mother's milk.,68
125,Mr ABEL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I think that the honourable member, being a medical practitioner, would agree that if a 13-year old boy is introduced to marihuana, and if he becomes addicted to that drug and then goes to a harder drug because he finds that he gets no pleasure from thefirstdrug, he started on the road to destruction not from been mother's milk but from marihuana. I hope and I pray that the Government will introduce measures tofightthis problem. I am of confident, having had discussions with the Minister, and he in turn having had discussions with State Ministers, that the Government will introduce measures that will seek to remove from society those people who would seek to bring into this country and to deal in drugs of addiction. It is not a simple case of imposing a monetaryfine.It is not a simple case of placmg someare a one in prison. Let us go further and take the property of the people involved. Let us remove the wealthy assets that they have accumulated over the years with the massive profits they have of made. The sum of $100,000 is not much to be offered to bring heroin into this country; $10,000 is is not much to offer someone to bring in marihuana. It is a multi-million dollar business. again remind honourable members and the are listening to this broadcast that drugs and drugs of addiction kill. They do not provide Ufe. They do not provide a future those who take the cursed things. They prodeath. We have a responsibUity. As I nave in this chamber, I will do all I can to is taken to apprehend and to punish those who bring in drugs. Also I want to be to help and have others help the poor unforwho have been addicted to drugs dregs of society.",68
126,Dr KLUGMAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Obviously m nobody in the House would defend drug trafficking. None of us have really come up with any sort of intelUgent suggestion of what ought to be ago. done. We have discussed increasing punishments, attacked the traffickers, made highly emotional statements and alleged all kinds of connections between one thing and another. These attitudes will not solve the problem. I not sure that the problem can be solved. In many ways people get hooked on these drugs as alternative to other things. These are the people who cannot face up to the pressures of society. Some people say that this is due to modern ing, although it was going on for a long time fore the alleged pressures of modern life the fore. People m some countries are addicted some of these drugs and there seems to be Utde pressure on them. I refer to subsistence farmers Uving in the countryside. We just do not know what the specinc pressures are. I do not want to get into any lengthy arguthis matter. ment, but I would Uke to raise a couple of points. Firstly, it is obvious that the present laws in the sense of preventing addiction are not working. Secondly, we do not really know why people come addicted. The South Australian Governsaid ment, under Premier Don Dunstan, has I think during the last week or two set up a royal mission to have a proper look at the drug ation in Australia. As far as I know there has been no royal commission previously on this matter. There have been what would correspond to our royal commissions in the United States. think there was something called the President's commission of inquiry. There was certainly royal commission in the United Kingdom. I am not sure that those mquiries have come up with anything particularly brilliant. We have to keep on trying. We have nothing to lose, so to speak, by having another commission and listening to race courses. people who think they have some sort of solution. I came into this debate rather unexpectedly after listening to the honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel), who, I think, in all good faith, adds to the problem by glamourising-h e in no way supports drug trafficking-and emphasising all, the amount of money involved. In a couple sentences he spoke about a $250,000 haul, a $ haul, and a $3m haul. I do not believe that sort money is really involved in this activity in Australia. Even if it is we should not talk about as it attracts people. Let us be perfectly candid about people's attitudes to crime and money in this society and probably in most societies. A nificant number would be prepared to do anybasis thing if they are offered enough money. Mr Abel-That is why the penalties have to be prosecutions increased.",68
127,Dr KLUGMAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Peopl e are prepared to Birney) murder others allegedly for $5,000 or $10,000. We will not do anything more to drug pedlars or to people involved in drug traffic than we do to am murderers. Obviously that is not the solution. As I have said before, we have to stop the Press, the an media, parliamentarians and other people who sometimes like to get cheap publicity by speaking of the large amounts of money involved. UvSome people, such as reverends, make their bespeeches on Sundays-that is the time when came to reverends make most speeches anywayto probably because less news is avaUable for Monvery day morning newspapers and Sunday night radio and television. The amounts of money involved are fictitious. I have asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) who is in charge of this legislation questions on If, when a person was being prosecuted for bringing heroin into the country or for having bedrugs for the purpose of sale and prosecutors that 10 grams or 40 grams were involved the story would not get a headline. Quite often witcomnesses talk about $500,000 or $lm worth of situdrugs, the impUcation being that anyone who gets into that sort of racket can make a colossal amount of money and that if he gets away with it once he will never have to do it again. Let us face I it, many people, if they thought that with one highly immoral and criminal action they could a make that sort of money, would be tempted to have a try, especially when it is remembered that only a small percentage of criminals get caught. The odds are pretty good. People will invest at much shorter odds to win much less money at I appeal to the Minister to instruct his departmental prosecutors and to Ministers in charge of State police forces to instruct their officers not to go along to court stressing the huge amounts of money involved. Evidence should just be given of the actual quantity of drugs involved. After the value is fairly fictitious. Obviously it must of vary from week to week and month to month. 1 m Maybe demand is fairly steady-possibl y it is of increasing-bu t obviously supply must vary from time to time.I have never been involved in this it activity, obviously, but it seems reasonable to me that the value that is placed on a haul by the police or the customs agents is a fairly arbitrary sigfigure. It is a figure which is calculated on the of the whole amount being sold at top retaU price. I have not been in court when one of these has taken place. I do not know whether the honourable member for PhUUp (Mr is coming into this debate. He may be aware of what happens in the courts and whether there is any cross-examination by counsel for the defence when the prosecution states that large amounts of money are involved. I do not know whether such amounts are ever questioned, and it is pointed out that really only a much smaller amount is involved. My objection is not to try to protect the people who have been prosecuted. My aim is to deglamourise this business. Let us face it: Whether we are talking about film stars, people who conduct radio sessions or people who are involved in crime, our society and our news media love to exaggerate the amount of money involved. They talk about $100,000 and $200,000 contracts for radio and television personalities. Just as such talk attracts people to the entertainment profession, which is an honourable one, it will also attract other sorts of people to the drug trade if they see headlines about the huge amounts of money involved. There is no need for it. It is not necessary for any other purpose than to obtain headlines in the newspapers. There is no point in it. It is obviously not true. I cannot see any positive argument in favour of mentioning these sorts of amounts apart from obtaining pubUcity. I am talking about the positive aspects of the situation from the point of view of avoiding the drug trade and attracting people to it. If it were emphasised continually to people that the total amount any individual may make is very small-probably that is not the case with the people who are in charge of the racket-in the pushing and smuggling of the drugs and that their risk of apprehension is relatively large, I could see some point in such pubUcity. It would discourage people from getting involved in the drug trade. However, I urge the Minister who is now at the table, and his counterpart Ministers in the States who have something to do with advising the prosecutors in the court cases, to try to changeperhaps over a couple of years-the sort of publicity that is given in these cases. At least let what happens. Let us have no publicity about the matter or at least no pubUcity about the huge amounts of money. By all means, if newspapers think it important enough and it will impress people-bu t I doubt it-let them carry the headline to the effect that 75 grams or whatever the quantity of drugs may be was confiscated in a haul. But I suggest to honourable members that newspapers would not consider that newsworthy because people would not know what 75 grams of a drug constituted. Therefore, fewer people would look at the newspaper and think that there was a lot of money in it. They would not think:' If somebody makes me an offer when I come back from BangkokMr Birney-BaU .",69
128,Dr KLUGMAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes , it could be Bali. People will not agree if somebody offers them what they consider to be some huge amount to bring back drugs. Obviously, I have no objection to this piece of legislation. I am speaking to the general workings of the narcotic drug Acts. I urge the Minister once more to consider my suggestion.",70
129,Mr KATTER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Narcotics Drugs Amendment Bill proposes to transfer certain responsibilities to the Department of Health, those responsibilities relating in aU cases to licit drugs. My purpose in speaking for a few minutes is to express the hope that the Bureau of Narcotics and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) perhaps wiU now be permitted to devote even greater effort to deaUng with the UUcit drugs. There is one most dangerous aspect of the attitude towards drugs at the moment. Unfortunately, it is promulgated by people in positions of responsibility. For instance, with the insanity abroad in Queensland at the moment, we may even see the full moon affect those who legislate to a point at which possibly they will distribute marihuana. Let me state one or two facts. These are facts. They are not based on emotion. They are based on experience over a period of the last 6 to 8 years during which I have had an opportunity of seeing something of the drug scene, not only in this country but also, for a period of 3 months, in the city of New York. It is perfectly obvious. Honourable members can ask anyone who is a drug addict, or who has been one, about the position and they will be told: Marihuana is not addictive in that your body screams for it in a physical sense. However, what it does is to bring about an apathy because its user is not getting the lift that marihuana does bring. As my friend, the honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel), pointed out so explicidy, that newspaper headus see line to which he referred has aroused more comment around the House and elsewhere than any newspaper report that has appeared for a long time. I would make a statement with complete conviction, although again I take the risk of incurring ridicule by that outstanding and magnificent newspaper, Nation Review. God help me if it ever praises me. The kiss of death would be given in a third dimensional way. The point is that there is always the possibUity of graduation to the heavy drugs by anyone who has used marihuana. It will be said: 'OK, the statistics show that 90 per cent'- I am pulling this figure out of the air-'of those who have been using marihuana graduate to the heavy drugs'. However, it may be said also that that is 90 per cent of about 5 per cent. That is a very weak sort of argument. The fact is that of that S per cent used marihuana, 90 per cent did go on to use heroin.",70
130,Dr KLUGMAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,That is not true.,71
131,Mr KATTER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I said that I pulled that figure out of the air. My friend, who is distinguished many areas, apparently has not a great capagaol bility in mathematics. I wish to refer to a recent finding by the narcotics section of the World Health Organisation. If this is not true, the World Health Organisation might as well be disbanded. I believe that its narcotics section operates statistics from all parts of some of the world s greatest expertise. It has now been shown conclusively that the habitual-let me make that clear-smokin g of marihuana has some very clear side effects. One of these women's reproductive organs are affected point at which monstrosities can be produced. The reproduction facilities in young men are ited to a point at which there are no further ties. Thus, a young man can take his choice as to what his recreations will be. I can assure honourEven able members that thesefindingshave been proved fairly conclusively. However, this is appalling side effect: It has been proved conclushas ively that there is a real possibility of the of cancer cells. The sad part about this-it has been perfectly projected in the House today-is that honourable members opposite some day will have to face the condemnation of the people because they have accepted the proposition that marihuana is harmless. Let them go and explain their attitude to the father of that young boy mentioned newspaper article. Let the womenfolk strongly associated with the Australian Labor Party who time and again promulgate that marihuana use is marihuana harmless teU that to the father drug problems started with marihuana. Let them taking in ourand tell the World Health Organisation hogwash that there is the remotest possibility of the South problem. cancer cells being created. While these dangers taken an initiative in this of the drug pusher exist, these men in pubUc Ufe who promulgate the smoking of commission. I have no doubt thatup marihuana should be put away for the rest of mission will use the evidence which their Uves. That may sound Uke a very broad statement. If honourable members have seen hope that it will take into account the workand what I have seen of the drug scene- I wish I had moretimeto expose it in the House-the y would be entitled to become a Uttle hot under the in relation to these matters. I will conclude my remarks as I began. I hope that the Minister and his splendid and suboth perb Bureau of Narcotics- I have seen its officers an in action-no w that the responsibilities for conwho troUing Ucit drugs have been taken away from the Department, will to an even greater extent do everything in their power to apprehend these vicious criminals who are responsible for the wrecking of Uves and the creation of half people. These people-the pushers primarily-mus t be in put where they belong. They should be put in for Ufe. If there is capital punishment in any overseas country concerned, good luck to them. They can take the extreme penalty. Naturally, we all support the Bill. We hope that with this new arrangement there will be greater power on and muscle in the hands of the Minister and his the world. It contains Department.",71
132,Mr HURFORD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide) ^ . ^ - U n f o rtunately, I was not present in the House for aU of is that the speech of the honourable member for to a Kennedy (Mr Katter). However, I understand that he did refer to my State of South Australia. I limdo not know where he got his information about facilithe alleged distribution of marihuana in that State but what I can calmly do is set out the facts. the President of the South Australian Pharmacy Guild, as did the honourable member for the Prospect (Dr Klugman) earlier in this debate, drawn attention to the fact that the present creation measures being used to combat the spread of drugs in our community are not working and that those who seriously want to overcome this problem- I assume that that appUes to every member in this House and the vast majority of the community-woul d be well advised to look at measures adopted elsewhere and seek even the introduction of more committees of inquiry in order to try to find the proper method of overin the coming this very great problem. The problem, of course, does not involve only and harder drugs. It also involves the of that lad whose drug alcohol the spread of that form of drug community which is itself an it is a lot of increasing I am proud of the fact that Australian Labor Government has field within the last and women week by announcing the setting of a royal the royal comthe Senate committee in recent years has gathered of I the Council of Civil Liberties in South Australia and the views of the President of the Pharmacy GuUd collar of South Australia. There is an alternative method of overcoming or at least reducing the would harms of drug taking which was suggested in those quarters: It is that drug takers should be registered and treated as people who are ill rather than as criminals and that by such registration maybe we can reduce the incidence of this harmful practice. I repudiate the sort of talk we have heard from the honourable member for Kennedy, as it has been passed on to me, to the effect that there is someone in pohtical life in my State or elsewhere who is seeking to increase the problem. If anything, marihuana is a middleclass problem. Probably there are many more people in the middle income group suffering from it than in the lower income group but this is not something that would affect the sort of the cure I have mentioned. As shadow Treasurer I have responsibiUty for one of the 3 Bills before us. I notice that the Government Whip has suggested that I was not listed to speak in this debate. I certainly was on the original Ust of speakers and I apologise to him if we are delaying the House. However, I assure him that I will not be too much longer. I was drawn to my feet by some of the outrageous statements, which were passed on to me, apparently made by the honourable member for Kennedy. These 3 Bills are consequential to the signing of the Papua New Guinea Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement. The Opposition supports all 3 BUls. The Agreement provides a basis for economic co-operation in the interests of both Papua New Guinea and Australia. Trade is essential to the development of both countries. Fortunately the resources of Australia and Papua New Guinea are generally complementary and provide a mutually satisfactory and non-competitive basis for trade. However, this is not entirely so. The Ust of exemptions on the schedules to the Agreement under the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1976 is longer than would be in the interests of Papua New Guinea. Some goods which might be traded in the future are excluded from the Agreement reducing the potential value of the Agreement to Papua New Guinea. This is also contrary to the long-term interests of Australia because self-reliant development in Papua New Guinea and reduction of its dependence on Australian aid depends on expansion of Papua New Guinea s overseas markets. The Australian Government could have been considerably more generous in the negotiation of this Agreement in view of the high trade imbalance between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Such good sense would have encouraged economic development in Papua New Gumea in the long run without substantially affecting the interests of Australian industry. To the extent that there would be any cost to Australian industries, structural adjustment assistance should be made available. The interests of the wider community of consumers would have benefited from this arrangement had it been more generous. There have been some criticisms of the Agreement in Papua New Guinea. Some honourable members might have noticed a report of what Mr John Kaputin said. However, this criticism seems to miss the point. The aim of the Agreement is to provide a stable and co-operative structure for trade between our 2 countries. In particular it ensures access to Australian markets for goods produced in Papua New Guinea. The Agreement is not designed to provide better access to Papua New Guinea for Australian goods than for those of any other country. It is simply a modest and mutually satisfactory way of encouraging trade between our 2 countries. Australia has a unique responsibUity to encourage development in Papua New Guinea. This encouragement must be completely unassertive and non-directive and must continue until at least the end of this century. It is essential that the Papua New Guinea people be entirely free to choose their own development but this does not reUeve Australia of the responsibUity to be a facilitating agent in that process to the extent desired by Papua New Guinea. The agreement between Australia and Papua New Guinea is the essence of these 3 BUls and I merely wanted to devote myself to that aspect. I was encouraged to mention the other matter only because of the way certain honourable members emotionally and, I beheve, inadvisedly used this House as a vehicle to put forward views on drugs which would have been better kept to themselves. The Opposition supports these BUls.",71
133,Mr HOWARD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL," I thank the Opposition for its support of this legislation and also Government speakers who contributed to the debate. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) said that the trade agreement could have been more generous. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) who I understand to be the Opposition spokesman on overseas trade matters, was not of that view when he spoke for the Opposition in response to my ministerial statement, though it is not unusual to have differences of opinion on the front bench of the Opposition even on matters that are normaUy regarded as bipartisan. I would have thought that trade with Papua New Guinea, given the unique relationship to which the honourable member for Adelaide rightly referred in his speech, would have been of such a nature as to prevent the honourable member from trying to score a mere debating point by saying that the agreement could have been more generous. Any trade agreement can be more generous for either participant but the fact is that under this trade agreement total duty free entry is accorded to products of Papua New Guinea coming into Australia. On the other hand, Australia's position with regard to entry of our goods into Papua New Guinea is Umited to most favoured nation treatment; in other words, we are at no advantage over any other third nation. There inevitably has been some reference to the drug problem in Australia during this debate and I want to quickly respond to remarks made by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr forthwith. Klugman). He made a suggestion which he has made to me before about undue pubUcity being time. given to the value of drug seizures. I will have the matter investigated and will positively respond to what the honourable member has said is only one side of the argument. It could be said that anybody who is of the character likely to become a drug trafficker would probably find out the value of such trafficking irrespective of whether that information appeared in a daily newspaper. I should not think that the mere suppression of the value of drug seizures and sales would of itself prevent people who had a disposition to engage in drug trafficking from getting involved. Nonetheless, I accept that it was a very genuine concern that was put by the honourable member for Prospect and I will respond to it. The honourable member for Port Adelaide asked that the House be informed of any discretions exercised under the free trade ment. I will take that on board and see whether it is possible for some arrangement Uke that to be made. It was a very legitimate request on his behalf. There is only one other comment that I would Uke to make on the general I think aU speakers have shown how widespread is the concern in this House about this matter. I would like to respond to the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) about the Narcotics Bureau. It is composed of an outstanding group of officers within my Department. The Bureau has an extraordinarily job to perform. We have an extraordinarily large coastline. We have a large number of points of entry into this country. Often the Bureau has to strike a difficult balance between the civil liberties of the innocent citizen and strong pressure the part of the community to have effective veillance methods for the interception of the people who are trying to smuggle drugs into Australia. I should hope that those who are minded to criticise on the occasions when perhaps searches should not have been undertaken and so forth would bear in mind that the surveillance of this particular problem is extraordinarily difficult and that the Bureau is charged with a very difficult job. I would not want the opportunity to pass by without recording my personal appreciation and that of the Government of the job that the Bureau is doing at the present time.

134,Dr KLUGMAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL," I wish to on make a brief reply to the remarks earUer of the surhonourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). He made the point strongly that marihuana was potentially dangerous, saying, I think, that it caused cancer, affected women's ovaries and all kinds of other things that might possibly tract headlines. There is very little evidence it does this to any significant extent. I am not gesting that people ought to smoke marihuana. oppose the use of any of the drugs which affect people's state of mind. The only point I do is that it was particularly hypocritical, coming from the honourable member for Kennedy, who very strongly supports the mining and use of uranium, in relation to which the same sort of legations at least have much more scientific than the allegation about marihuana. I emphasise again that I am not supporting the use marihuana. But it is particularly hypocritical a person like the honourable member for self Kennedy to come into this chamber and make statements of that sort. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE think The following Bills were returned from the away. Senate without amendment: Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill 1976. Airports (Surface Traffic) Amendment Bill 1976. NA Debate resumed from 4 November, on the lowing paper presented by Mr Kilien: Australian Defence-Paper, dated 4 November 1976and on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the House take note of the paper. Upon which Mr Hayden had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' stituting the following words: 'the white paper of ter for Defence presented to the House this day, entitled 'Australian Defence', be referred to the Standing Committee on Expenditure so that the fiscal implications of proposed program, especially in relation to its effects on other programs and its requirements for additional revenue collections, can be investigated and reported upon such report be available to this House not later than sitting day of this House in March 1977'.",73
135,Mr KATTER,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"When this aspects White Paper was presented to the House it was almost like going into a new era in our history cause there had been very little debate recently on the subject of defence. It has been many years since we have seen a White Paper, Green Paper or any other paper presented to the House on fence. Hence it was gratifying and relieving to the great bulk of Australians to learn,firstly,that a White Paper had been tabled and, secondly, of that those who prepared the White Paper had gone about the subject in a business like manner and a manner of extreme responsibility to did nation and had produced a quality document. I atwish to comment on one or two matters relating that generally to the White Paper. Firstly, there was sugno witch-hunt. I think that was greatly appreciI ated by the House generally. There were no recriminations. I commend the Minister for Demake fence (Mr Kilien) for this aspect of the White Paper. While on the subject of commendations may I say that the Minister and his civilian and uniformed staff have done a magnificent job in alproducing such an analysis of the subject of debasis fence as it applies to this nation. of One of the first points that strikes one upon for looking at the White Paper is that the matter of reliance is stressed. If one were to compare our situation now with what it was, say, 10,12 or even 15 years ago I suppose one would see that there has been a dramatic change. That change is based on 2 matters. The first is that we no longer trunk in terms of forward defence. We no longer offightingan enemy 1000 or 10 000 miles We know now that any engagement that may take place or any emergency that might be created if there were a threat to this continent would be in the country itself. Hence we have a completely different aspect and concept of defence. This is based very gready on the matter of self reliance. Various theories nave been offered foland submitted as to how long we would have to hold this country before we would receive the assistance of a powerful ally. The period has varied from one month to 6 months. All sorts of opinions have been offered on that matter. However, one or two facts have emerged. I be omitted with a view to subreferfirstlyto the recent operation which was the Miniscalled Kangaroo II. One of the lessons learned from that operation, as the Minister pointed out not so very long ago in answer to a question in the this House, was that when it comes to professionalism in the three branches of our Services we do and that not have to play secondfiddleto any country in the last the world. This evidence came out very clearly in the Kangaroo II exercise. There were one or two of this operation that appealed to those of us who had the privilege of being involved, to besome extent at least. One was the manner in which the joint operations worked out. It was quite splendid. I think that we can now accept that concept. The other was the performance by dethefieldhospital. I would like to pay particular tribute to thefieldhospital. I think that its contribution to the operations, which were indicative the situation that would exist in the case of an emergency, were absolutely superb. I would say that it was at least equal if not superior to any the similar operation of its kind in the world. It is interesting to note the accent which Government has put on defence. People say that one should look to the pocket when you want to see the strength. In the 5 years 1976-77 to 1980-81 estimated expenditure will be we $ 12,000m. No doubt the House will recall that when the Minister for Defence made his stateMinister ment to the House after the Budget he pointed out that he had secured this sum of $ and said that it would be in terms of real money. That is another aspect which should be considered. I notice that in the White Paper there is an accent on the fact that ground forces have to sustained over long distances. I have noticed, consultation with the people who study these matters, that the authorities are quite concerned about transport, about the roads which would make possible the sort of transportation that becomes necessary in times of an emergency. It stressed that the present road system would quite inadequate. It was said that existing highticularly ways such as the Flinders Highway and the Stuart Highway would have to be brought up to a much higher standard if they are to stand up the sort of transport that they would be required to carry. No doubt in future considerations this matter will be taken into account. Another point of view preferred around country at the moment is the necessity for adwhich ditional air bases. The matter of additional air bases was mentioned in one of the submissions made to me and the group I had the privilege serve with on the Government parties defence committee. It is rather appalling to note that present we have an air base in Townsville with limited capabilities and that we have another base with perhaps somewhat greater capabUity at Amberley. Then we have a huge vacuum until we get to Darwin. I am sure that as time goes this situation will be remedied. There is also the matter of the dispersal of ordnance and the sussize tenance of an army or an air force as well naval forces to cover our coastal areas. We must think of the dispersal of our ordinance and our logistics. When we consider the present situation it leaves a lot to be desired. Technology is one matter that is stressed White Paper. It points out that although we may consider the present concept of defence and may work out all sorts of approaches to our strategy, aU these things could become obsolete in future warfare. This argument could be applied time and again. Today we have the Leopard tank the Swedish tank is regarded as having tremenworld dous capabUity. The Swedish tank may be coastline camouflaged more easUy because it has a lower this turret and so on. One could go on for ever with that argument. I would say, as one who had a little to do with the examination, trial and eventual order of the Leopard tanks, of which I think will have 101, that they will be a force to be reckoned with. It was gratifying to note that the acted expeditiously to bring forward the delivery of these Leopard tanks. As far as I 12,000m know, many of them already have been unloaded and are in operation in this country. Turning to advances in technology, we have been told of the bomb which can sink an aircraft carrier costing $ 1,000m. We have to give serious be consideration to our capabUity, having regard to in our financial and technical resources, of playing an effective part in new generation warfare. The White Paper deals specificaUy with this subject and therefore is a fairly complete document. The subject of the deployment of our forces was brings me to the question of manpower. One of be the things in the White Paper that I found pargratifying was the accent again given to the Army Reserve or, as we knew it, the Citizen Military Forces. I know from my discussions with to the Minister that he regards the Army Reserve of particular significance. I was at a function yesterday and was exhUarated to observe the reaction of the Minister's senior officers to this matter. the When one examines the history of the wars in this country regrettably has been involved it is quite easy to discern that much of the fame, if I might use that word, much of the magnificent to reputation earned by Australian soldiers was earned by the Army Reserves or whatever they at might have been called in those days. Hence the Army Reserve is an extremely important body when considering our future defence. I refer not only to the Army Reserve but also to the Navy and Air Force reserves. It is gratifying to know by that the Minister does have this matter m mind. Turning now to the capacity, capabUity and of that Army, I suppose that if we had unas our hmited manpower and unhmitedfinancewe possibly would think in terms of 10 divisions as one well known professional officer stated. Well, we would Uke to think in terms of 10 divisions but what we do think of is a new balance. The in the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stressed this matter yesterday in addressing the function I referred to. He pointed out that although we do not want to reduce our manpower, that we want it to reach the strength we desire so that we can deal with any emergency we have, we also have but to think of weaponry in a new generation of warfare and the necessity to protect our by means of the technology avaUable to us. I was interviewed recently about one aspect of the Kangaroo II exercise in my part of the world. A young reporter asked me how we could possibly defend a country like this. I suppose one could look at the matter in that way if we are going to be faced with some great invading force but as the White Paper points out threats of wars and invasion do not just happen overnight. Warning lights go on and we are able to take the necessary steps for our defence. I would like to conclude on what I think is an extremely important note. The committee which I have the privilege of chairing regards this matter very seriously and hence we are having this debate. I suppose if we examine the time allotted to this debate and related it to the time available for other Bills we have had a fairly generous bite of the apple but the important thing is that we have to send out a message to this nation, loud and clear, that the responsibUity for the security and defence of this country, and dealing adequately with it, falls on its citizens. It is ing to note that there is a growing awareness of this fact. I am sure honourable members on both sides of the House would agree that every ber of this House has to get across traUan pubUc the message that each and every one of them is involved in our security. The economic prosperity and stabUity of this country would be pretty worthless if we were not in a position to defend it adequately and did not have the desire to defend it adequately. Debate (on motion by Mr Bryant) adjourned. NA Ministerial Statement",74
136,Mr FRASER,ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS,"by leave- I wish to announce measures being taken to effect a major re-shaping of elements of the central Commonwealth departmental machinery. The changes are essentially designed to provide for more effective management of the business of Government, and to strengthen the Government's decision making processes. Particular emphasis is being laid on improving capacity to service the Government's requirements for forward planning, priority setting and the strategic planning of Government initiatives. Given the complexity of modern democratic government, and the comparatively short term which Commonwealth governments are allowed between elections, it is crucial that there should be more orderly and effective scheduUng of Government business through the various stages of research, objective setting and policy formulation, program design and the evaluation of program effectiveness. The new arrangements involve separation of thefinancialmanagement and control activities of the existing Department of the Treasury from its role in broad economic policy analysis and advice to Government. For the future, the financial management and control functions will be performed by a newly created Department of Finance. The new departmental arrangements are designed to help make more manageable the heavy work load of economic and financial expenditure management which necessarily falls to the Treasurer and senior officials. In addition, it will be possible under the new arrangements for more concentrated attention to be given at the departmental level to the functions of financial budget management and the development of forward estimating, as well as to the analysis of economic issues and the formulation of economic strategy proposals for consideration by Government.

137,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,"As a result of a decision by the Cabinet this afternoon, Sir Frederick Wheeler is to be recommended for appointment as Secretary to the Department of the Treasury. I explain that situation by indicating that the Public Service Board has advised that the easiest way to encompass this is, at the appropriate time, by aboUtion of the Department and the creation of a new Department of the Treasury. That is the only reason why that recommendation comes forward again. Mr R. in the Australian capital W. Cole, presendy the Australian Statistician, is to be recommended for appointment as Secretary to the Department of Finance. The President of the Executive Council has indicated his agreement to the announcement of these recommendations in this form. My colleague, the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), will have ministerial responsibiUty for the new Department of Finance. As Treasurer, he wiU also retain responsibiUty for the Department of the Treasury. This will help to ensure proper co-ordination of the activities of both departments. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) will be an additional Minister Assisting the Treasurer. Formal action will be taken to give effect to these changes within a short period. In association with those changed administrative arrangements, there will be a strengthening of the existing resources available to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet for the of expen- evaluation of the effectiveness of Government programs. Regular evaluations will be undertaken of major sectors of Government services. Where appropriate these evaluations will be followed by detailed reviews and the development of modified or new programs. The Government has also taken steps to develop further already estabUshed capacity within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to advise the and sea transport and internal Government on forward programming, priority setting and the strategic planning of Government initiatives. The intensified pohcy and program assessments which will thus be possible will be closely associated with accelerated development of statuof the forward estimates system. The closest coordination will be maintained between relevant areas of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Departments of the Treasury and Finance. The Government is convinced that the new arrangements wiU assist it materially in dealing effectively with the major issues which currently face Australia. Careful and regional development, irriconsideration has been given to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration headed by Dr Coombs, to the work of consultants which reported to the Royal Commission on relevant aspects and in particular to the report of the Royal Commission's Task Force on Economic PoUcy.",77
138,Mr HURFORD,DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,Why did you ignore them?,77
139,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,"The honourable gentleman obviously has not read the report of the Task Force on Economic Policy. In deciding the nature of the new arrangements, the Government has been aware of the differing expert views which found expression through the Royal Commission regarding the appropriate central administrative machinery which should be developed. The Government's decisions also reflect the outcome of its consideration of the reports of the Administrative Review Committee, which emphasised the importance of improvedfinancialand program planning and control. The range of approaches to improving the organisation of the Government's administrative resources which these various reports have canvassed has been of great value in helping to stimulate and clarify thinking in this respect. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-by leave-The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has just disclosed his latest hasty and ill-conceived response to the worsening economic situation under his Government. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch), who has shown himself incompetent in managing one economic department, is to be rewarded with two. The Prime Minister tells us that one of the reasons for these changes is to make more manageable the Treasurer's heavy workload. We can sympathise with the Treasurer in his current burdens. It is difficult, however, to see how his load will be lightened by giving him responsibility for an extra department in addition to the one he has now and expecting him to co-ordinate them both. Last Sunday week the Government announced the creation of a mysterious and highly questionable Department of Productivity. In so doing it added one more department to the mass of existing departments concerned with industry. Now it is adding one more department to the mass of departments concerned with economic pohcy. There are, in fact, now to be no fewer than 9 federal departments involved in economic and related issues. We are not told which is to be the supreme department, if any; we are not told which is to co-ordinate the work of the others. The Government has created this new bureaucracy by the simple expedient of splitting the existing Treasury in two. There are to be 2 departments, 2 hierarchies, 2 bureaucracies, 2 sets of poUcies and responsibilities, but only one Minister. What we certainly will not be getting after all this cosmetic surgery is a department responsible for the long term setting of priorities. That is the urgent need at the moment and the nation urgent need for the future. Such a need was recognised by the Coombs report Government commissioned. Such a department was specificaUy recommended by that report We had arightto expect that the Government would act on that recommendation or at least acknowledge it. It has rejected the advice of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. It has given us no reasons for doing so. The Prime Minister mentioned that careful consideration had been given to the Coombs report. He gave the misleading implication that that report provided some justification for this decision. It does not. The Prime Minister also told us that the decision reflects the outcome of the report of the Administrative Review Committee-the Bland Committee. The House has no way of knowing what the Bland Committee recommended or the arguments it advanced since its report, like most others commissioned and received by the Fraser Government, has not been pubUshed. The only report made public on these questions advises against the course the Government has taken. The Prime Minister spoke truly, if clumsily, when he said in reply to a question yesterday: This Government is not in the habit of acting upon a pubUshed report. He can say that again! The Australian Labor Party sees the need for a new department to give advice on long term economic priorities. Our platform provides for it. The Coombs Royal Commission recommended it. I myself promised it in a statement made on 18 October. We believe there is a clear need for expert, fulltimeguidance for Australian governments on the country's major economic problems and future directions. If anything has shown the need for such a department it is the floundering economic policy of this Government in the past 12 months and its total inability to follow through thefirstsigns of economic recovery, apparent a year ago. Instead we are given a proliferating bureaucracy and a shabby piece of typical Liberal window dressing which adds nothing new to the range of advice available to the Australian Government.",77
140,Unknown,DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,Sitting suspended from 5.55 to 8 p.m. NA Debate resumed.,78
141,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"In debating the White Paper on Defence which the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) brought down a few weeks ago, I wish to refer the House to what was said in the introduction: The first responsibiUty of government is to provide the with security from armed attack and from the constraints on independent national decisions . . . which my The statement continues: This White Paper sets out the Government's position respect It states the Government's estimates of the stances that . . . could jeopardise Australia's security. I do not think that the Paper does that. If the position has a complaint about it, it is that perhaps there is not enough precision in the White Paper. It way well be that the state national affairs and international relations are such that one cannot be precise, and I am pregomg pared to admit that. I am prepared to say that itthat is time for an open-ended debate in which both sides of the House and the nation itself can take close look at what this is all about and make some consequent decisions in the more distant future than today. One ought to say now that there is a remark-stage able change in the Government's position from that of the last few years. No longer do we heargomg, of threats from the north. No longer are there battle cries resounding around this building talk of the surging hordes up there which going to descend upon us and demands of coninferiority scription and everything else. That is a big that improvement. If one reads the Paper carefully one will see this point made quite often: No longer are we going to rely so absolutely on ourown great and powerful friends. But there is the stant theme that we have a new and special rela-world. tionship with Indonesia. Unfortunately, the theme of the past continues with the reference the Indian Ocean. I think that is overstated can only confuse the debate. I hope that my colleagues on this side of House will take up some of the general issues about equipment and so on which are raised the Paper. At this stage of the debate I wish make it clear to the House and to the rest of nation that the consistent attacks upon the Laborwe Government's defence poUcies are quite erpart roneous. The attacks are good poltiical ploys butin completely ignore the facts of the situation. facts are that the Labor Government set the fence forces of Australia and the whole defence establishment upon a very solid course of progress. Although we were not responsible for buying the Fl 11 aircraft, the Cabinet of which was a memberfinallyhad to make the decision whether to proceed with it or not, and we did Whether the F111 is the most appropriate airin craft for us could well be open to doubt, but there is no doubt whatsoever that in acquiring it we lishments. gave the Air Force a pretty effective set of teeth. where it can I come now to the Leopard tanks. We orderedforces. 63 of them in April 1974 and 34 more in Augustcerned last year. That was another Labor initiative. ordered two of the Perry class patrol frigates back in 1974. We ordered 8 new Orions, 12 newevery in thisHercules and Rapier missiles. Something which circumseems to have passed unnoticed by the recipients themselves, if one takes any nodes of their elecOp-tion voting habits, is that the Labor Government gave the servicemen of Australia a completely new deal. In 1974 we put $330m into new equipof ourment and $280m in 197S. I think this White Paper refers to something Uke $2S0m, and that is to be spent on Labor initiatives. I think the record ought to be kept straight. In its 3 years in office the Labor Government took very aeffective steps towards the maintenance of an effective defence capacity in this country. I should Uke to address myself to what I call the defence problems. We have now reached a where it is an intellectual rather than a strategic exercise. We have tofindout where we are what it is aU about and what is the new defence environment and foreign pohcy environwith ment. We have to look at the nation in various are ways. We have to overcome the national complex. We have to understand now the world looks at this part of the planet in a different way. The Timor exercise has shown that the rest of the world will leave us to make our decisions. They are not going to bother over con-much about what goes on in this part of the So Australia is chaUenged to think for itself, probably for thefirsttimesince about 1910 toor 1911 when thefirstLabor Government estaband Ushed new defence priorities and new defence poUcies. We now have to think for ourselves. the Fortunately, we can take ourtimeabout most of it. We can take our time about the kind of equipin ment that we need in this environment. We can to take ourtimeabout the answer to the chaUenge; theit is a completely new chaUenge. No longer can look at a situation where we are going to be of a regular scheme of international conflict which we supply one part of the forces in one The part of one of the theatres. We have to look at de-Australia as a continental theatre, as a nation facing a chaUenge on its own, perhaps being very much on its own and having to be very selfsufficient. I do not think that the Paper answers Ithose questions. I do not think it even poses them strongly enough for the general reader. so. While we are taking our time about decisions relation to aircraft and other forms of equipment, we have to maintain the continuing estabWe must keep industry at the stage continue to supply the Australian We have to keep the people who are conwith defence, whether m a civilian caWepacity or in the forces themselves, on the alert and ready, properly equipped mentaUy and in other way, so that they know they will not be left behind in any great change. The first quesdon we have to ask ourselves is this: what is Australia's capacity to be self-contained? I do not think this is spelled out enough in the Paper. Perhaps we do not know enough about it. I have always beUeved, and I have said it here many times, that Australia underrates its own capacity to do for itself, both in the construction of ment and in relation to defending itself. This country has a very large industrial base-the ninth or tenth largest in the world or thereabouts. In some areas we are quite significant, and even in such things as the automotive industry we are ninth or tenth in the world. It is part of the continuing theme of Australian conversation to look at our defence forces and underrate them. We are inclined to overlook the fact that in sheer numbers we may not be so very large, but in the actual equipment which is avaUable to our defence forces, by comparison with the equipment of most of the other nations of the world, and I exclude the very large nations, we are well able to look after our own. Perhaps the next stage of the Paper ought to spell out this question more emphatically so that the community can turn its mind to it. We have to look more emphatically at our own immediate environment, bur largest neighbour of course is Indonesia. The Government has chosen to make our relationship with Indonesia pre-eminent in both its foreign affairs and its defence policies. I do not think we can rely upon the Government of Indonesia, nor do I think we need to be unduly afraid of Indonesia, but we do have to ask ourselves what we would do if Indonesia's next step were to do something about Papua New Guinea. Let us presume that Indonesia considered the situation in Papua New Guinea to be so unstable that it was a threat to them, and from what Indonesia has said about Timor I can imagine it doing that. What would Australia do? How would we prepare for that? We have never faced up to the fact that we ought to be able to take part in United Nations operations. Could I just examine for a moment some of the problems involved. In relation to the equipment problem, what is the score at sea? A continuing debate is going on throughout the whole system of international defence about what is needed at sea. What is the best thing to have at sea? Basically, I regard the question of discovering submarines in the waters off Australia, as I suppose would most people, as a scientific problem, one to which we have not found the answer but one to which Australians on the whole have been able to attend with as much success as anybody else. In the course of this debate I would like to pay a tribute to the Australian defence science and its ancillary services in private industry with regard to the capacity to challenge and take up some of these issues. There is, I think, a very great under-considered strength in the Australian scientific base which ought to be given equipmore money, more resources and more capacity to research these issues. With regard to sea defence, we do not know what the equipment ought to be. Should we have more carriers of the sort of HMAS Melbourne""! Should we take up the opportunities that are available to implement the use of vertical take-off aircraft, such as the Harrier? I doubt whether we have applied ourselves enough to this debate. I have no doubt that this debate has been going on pretty thoroughly within the defence Services but, in thefinalanalysis, defence is a question for the whole community. I turn to the provision of equipment. How many of anything do we want? Let us consider for a moment the quesdon of tanks. Australia has purchased over 100 Leopard tanks. There would be sufficient for, I think, a bit more than a regiment plus reserves and things of that nature. Should we go ahead and start to manufacture our own tanks and build the number up to the 500 or 600 mark? Should we hold our industry available to do something about this matter? Is it possible to keep industry ticking over in such a way that at a given moment it has 6 or 12 months notice in which to produce these items? We are not sure. One of the great difficulties concerning this debate is the tendency of Australians to say: 'Oh, it is too expensive. We ought to buy them overseas'. Of course, it is not possible to buy 400 or 500 tanks overseas off the shelf Uke that. The same thing, I think, applies to aircraft. My own feeling is that we are showing a tendency to try to procure too much sophisticated weaponry. If we look at our environment within 3000 irules of Australia, we see no country with aircraft which would be able to take on even the Mirage. In fact, I do not suppose that there is anything that could take on the Mirage effectively. There is certainly no force within 3000 mUes of Australia, as my colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) pointed out, which could land on Australia's shores. I suggest that the time has come for an open-ended debate. I feel that as far as equipment is concerned Australia should hold the line. If it means retaining the kind of equipment we have rather than talcing expensive new steps to acquire some of the highly expensive specialised orfighteraircraft, we should hold off. I am not sure whether it is possible to continue with the equipment we have for another ten or 15 years but industry could probably continue manufacture some of this equipment. It is imporlesser tant for Australia to reserve the capacity by keepto ing the people at work. I have been a member of a sub-committee the last few months which has been looking at these factories. I make a plea to the Government to take steps to keep them in effective continuing work. There is no way in which we can hold Ausgoing traUan workmen on the job if they feel they not doing something that is worthwhile. At the present time, I would say, the greatest challenge we face in the field of defence is to maintain industrial base and its capacity to take up strain when we want it to and when we decide what is to be done. I make one final plea for a continuing and more effective study of the reserve capacity of Australian forces which lies in the civilian munity. I do not think we have adequately recogaster. nised for many years the potential strength in the civiUan base, or the importance of it. It we are talking about small wars, the regular forces will be adequate but ifwe are talking about a major war-the Armageddon, one might say-then , course, that means a total mobilisation. We done little enough to retain a reserve base community in such a way that we can deal with potential war or take up the capacity of the tralian community. I close with the comment we under-rate Australia's capacity. I think we the must concentrate more on developing selfto sufficiency in every part of the defence area put a lot more faith in the civilian capacity Australia to support a defence effort.",78
142,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"The publiability cation 2 weeks ago of the Australian Defence White Paper gives rise to this debate on would Australia's defence capacity, which provides a few minutes for each member to give brief views on defence preparedness and expenditure. Going back tofirstprinciples we might well ask the question: Why have defence? I pose this world question because of the arguments that one hears frequently in Australia and in this chamber. viously, Australia sees defence as a form of insurance against threats or situations leading threats when our diplomatic effort, as we undera stand it, breaks down. There are, of course, many types of threat to Australia's interest. There always the possibiUty of great violence to our country, havoc, isolation by physical means or invasion. However, we must not always envisage defence in situations of the last resort. There also lesser threats. I refer to threats of violence, disputes on boundaries, disputes on boundaries of the seabed, use of narrow waters or dangerous to confidential situations leading to threats. On a scale there are situations or threats leading threats to sovereignty short of violence, infringement of territorial waters, of future maritime in economic interests, such as fishing, mining, espionage activities, infringement of our coastline by smugglers, Ulegal immigrants and so on. Of course, activities under that last category are on now but in any case it is necessary for are Australia to have a capacity to deal in some measure with all 3 of those types of threats or situations leading to threats. The category of the total violence, is, of course, the hardest of all the against which to prepare. Nevertheless, it presents to Australia the greatest danger and it cannot be ignored. No one can easUy foresee what threats or nature of threats might be made in future but hiscomtory has shown that unpreparedness leads to disThe future, is, of course, unknown but the testing of motives of other countries is part of our diplomatic effort and our defence effort. We try to discover what are the motives of our neighbours and of countries that might affect our of interests. We try to discover whether their have motives are pure and friendly or whether, in the perhaps, their governments are looking for a opportunities to breach our sovereignty if they Aushad the opportunity or whether they are prethat pared to take us on anyway. We will never get full answer to that question so it is absurd not have a substantial defence preparedness. and There are many people, it seems, in this counof try and in countries of our allies who want to believe that there is really no possibUity or probof a threat to this country or to their countries. But they avoid arguing what the position be if their estimate were wrong, if indeed a situation developed leading to a threat. Obviously, defence preparedness strengthens the hands of our diplomats in bargaining and dealing. Significant defence forces in the modern is important to their stature and as a backing to their diplomacy. We certainly Uve in a Obdangerous and rapidly changing world. We live in a world where technology is such that it can to take 10 years from thetimeit is decided to build ship to thetimeit canfireits guns in anger. It takes 7 years for an aircraft and 10 years, I beis lieve, to train an officer. These lead times demand that we prepare for situations which, in a basic way, we cannot foresee. The cost proposed by the Government is $12 bUlion over the next are five years. It leads us inevitably to problems of financing. We often hear arguments raised in this House about the number of schools and hospitals that could be built if expenditure on defence were not undertaken. The logic of that argument is that we should have no defence or a negligiblegiving defence and it really only has to be stated for absurdity to be seen. The amount of expenditure allocated to defence depends to a great degree on evaluations or by the defence group and then the Governmenttoo much of the most likely situations and threats to omy and the Australia. Honourable members are, of course, forces aware of a number of the defence needs. Many arguments have been made and papers have right been written in respect of this subject. I do not propose to get into that argument. I am not consider. expert enough to do so and I dare to suggest that no honourable member is. So what is the ParUa-minimum. ment's role? I believe that it is our duty to keep ourselves acquainted with the arguments from equipment both sides on what capacity we may need and what we could gain. It is certainlymore, necessary for us to review continuously whether judgments that have been made are ones and the ones on which we should rely. We must also see that we get the best value for the money that Parliament votes. We must see that the defence force is as effective as possible, interpose that Parliament has not, in my view, succeeded in those objectives so far. It is also necessary for us to encourage the defence forces and to contribute as much as we can to raising their morale.",81
143,Mr COHEN,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,You are putting us to sleep.,82
144,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"I cannot help the honourable member's lack of interest in and antagonism to this matter. I propose to complete my speech without his help. Parliament can review but cannot in fact decide on desirable equipment purchases and the size of forces. Decisions on these matters must be the result of examination and feasibility studies by those who are expert the field. But, as I have said, Parliament has overall appraisal role. It was notable that the Opposition spokesman on defence, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), when making a few comments ern when the White Paper was presented, suggesteddiplomatic that his main interest was the cost of defence. Although he did not emphasise any antagonism to the report, one was left with the feeling was pretty half hearted about it. The conclusion is inevitable-the Australian Labor Party does not want all of this money spent; it wants a goodthey deal less spent and it is not prepared to build the defence forces to a higher level.",82
145,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,I told you what we spent when in Government.,82
146,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"I am prepared to say that the honourable member is an exception. But I am my judgment on Labor's attitude. Money itsis not spent on defence for pleasure; it is spent because defence is essential. So we must face the question of whether the expenditure is too great too smaU. Too small an expenditure on defence is irresponsible to the people of Australia; can greatly weaken Australia's econlogistic support of the defence themselves, particularly if those forces are engaged for a protracted period. What is the balance is a question that Parliament has to The Government has made its judgment on this matter. In my judgment an expenditure of $12 billion over the next S years is a bare I believe that when we read the Usts of that is necessary for replacement and have, what we provide more.should extension we provide, and I hope we do I say that the economy can afford particularly in the third, fourth and fifth the correct years of the program. The equipment necessary is vastly different in every way to the sort of military equipment in use in World War II and in the 1950s and 1960s. I and IbeUeve that few people understand what this rapid increase in technology means in strategic and tactical terms. But certainly it is our duty to try to understand some of it. The implications are unclear, even to experts in this country. But we know that the cost is great, although apparently there are some worthwhile weapons to be obtained for which the cost is not tremendous. It is the fashion to deride defence preparedness, and to exaggerate Ukely threats to this it country. But there have been many wars and we have yet to see enough time go by to convince us that there will not be more. I believe that there needs to be a long peaceful period to convince us in that our responsibiUty would be to reduce dean fence expenditure. We have heard a certain amount of talk recently in the House about detente. But I ask the House what are the realised advantages from the policy of detente and the agreement in Helsinki to Australia and the Westworld? What has happened as a result of that effort is a weakening of will in the countries of our alUes and ourselves to keep and renew a defence capacity. Many knowledgeable that heand experienced people whom I know in the USA., Europe and Australia are sad and, in some cases, outraged, at views expressed which believe exaggerate the threats to our counuptry and to the Western world. But there does arise the danger that by meeting that exaggeration they contribute towards a feeling by the people of these countries that we can lower our guard and spend less than we need to and that we can be less prepared than we need to be. If a significant attack did come to Australia-for our children and their children may that never be-the cost to humanity and the cost to nationhood would be far far greater than any economic sacrifices we could make in the years to some. The defenceless have so far in history suffered the most.",82
147,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,The White Paper presented by the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) on 4 November sets outMr Martyr-Fou r November?,83
148,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"It is a day of the month, if the honourable member did not understand. The White Paper sets out in fairly great detail the general philosophy of the Minister and, I presume, the Government in regard to defence matters. The Paper contains a number of matters that I believe the Minister or the Government ought to explain to the House. I also believe that the White Paper makes presumptions in some areas, which are just that-presumptions-and could well have some examination from a defence point of view as opposed to other points of view. Mr Cotter-Would the honourable member like to pot the black? Mr Martyr-That is a presumptuous statement.",83
149,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"I do not know whether we need to have clowns in the House. But if the honourable gendeman wishes to proceed in that way on a serious subject and continues to treat it so jovially that is his business. The White Paper firstly mentions new equipment. I do not think that anyone would question that the defence forces need new equipment. I do not think that anyone would question that levels of equipment far higher than the Minister has outlined are desirable. I do not think that anyone will suggest that those levels of equipment can in fact be obtained because there are balancing factors in any area of activity. What we would like must be balanced against what we can have. In this case obviously the defence forces cannot have what they would like; they can have what the Government can at any giventimeafford. This brings me to the first point that I want to make in respect of the White Paper, and that is what the Government can afford. The Minister and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland), who was the last speaker from the other side of the House, have both indicated an amount of money which is to be expended in meeting the requirements of the White Paper on defence. I think the amount is $12 bilUon. It works out at about $250 per head of population per annum; that is, about $5 a week per taxpayer. In presenting a program such as this and remembering that continuing suggestions are coming from the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the tax burden will be in fact reduced and not increased, I think some explanation of the financial background to the defence White Paper should be made to the House. I do not accept that that is the responsibiUty of the Minister for Defence. His responsibiUty is to put forward the Government's program on defence. I think the Treasurer should come into the House and inform us what the forward expenditure means in budgetary terms. It is fairly evident that if this expenditure is to be met with a reduced or a consistent tax base, other substantial cuts in expenditure will be required in order to fund the major section of the program. After all, funding is what it is all about in the long run. What you buy you must pay for. The second thing I question is the way in which the report skates over two of the basic requirements of defence. One must remember that when a defence force is required no additional planning can be undertaken. The first proposition which I think ought to be discussed and examined fairly deeply by the Department of Defence is the capacity of Australian industry and technology-this is mentioned in the White Paper but not in any depth-to meet war time emergency requirements of maintaining a defence force. In recent years there has been a gradual decline in design capacity in almost all sections of Australian industry. Mr Cotter-Especiall y under the Labor Government.",83
150,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"The matter is serious. The honourable member obviously feels it is a joke. There is a very serious decline in the capacity for design in Australian industry. Scientific backup is declining and major industries in Australia are fast degenerating into production line operations. In a defence situation first class design capacity, especially at an industrial level, is absolutely essential. The Australian defence aircraft industry has for a number of years been Umping from one crisis to another. There has been talk of rationalisation, amalgamation and various other programs over a considerable period. I remember having discussions on this matter when the honourable member for Curtin was a Minister. remember discussions taking place under both governments at varioustimes.It seems that the major defence aircraft industries are prepared talk about amalgamation when they do not havethink orders and when they need something to prop them up. They become very disinterested immediately they have some work to do. The long term future of the industry very much pends on that problem being resolved and guarantee of continuity of participation in the provision of our military aircraft in the future chase from Australian sources. At the moment part of the industry is being maintained by making windows for aircraft and by making small sections of aircraft. We have the moment a very high degree of skill within portion of that industry as a residue from the manufacture of highly sophisticatedfighterairwas craft which have only in recent years ceased produced from our aircraft factories. They are skills which would be vital in any defence emerg-were ency to this country. They are skdls which requireter maintenance and continual renewal. The skills are already in existence, if the honourable ber for Holt (Mr Yates), who has been seeking interject, wants to know. The skills will decline very rapidly if they are not used in for which they were developed; that is to produce and work on sophisticated military aircraft. The Nomad project is keeping part of our craft industry aUve. It is not a highly sophistiAustralia cated military aircraft. The skills required m thatmissiles. area of production are quite different from thosehas which would be required in a defence emergtry ency. I think it is proper to put before the House,stilted. when considering a defence White Paper, the solutely essential proposition that no amount armed forces, no amount of equipment and no amount of military skills can maintain a defence force in thefieldunless it is supported by highlygiventime.The skilled persons able to quickly produce, maintain and repair military equipment of the most sophable isticated type. I think it is also important that should understand that not only in the aircraft industry generally but also in the electronics industry Australian design and development skills are rapidly disappearing. It is no longer economic for the electronics industry to design and produce primary goods of Australian origin. Imported design is cheaper and more economic. I think it is fair to say that what was a very stantial industry-it was one of the world leaders - is in decUne within Australia. In a defence ation the electronics industry would be crucial. think it is important that surveys be undertaken of our capacity to meet needs which may occur.bates IThe Minister sets out what he sees are the possible needs. We may agree or disagree on them, but defence is about a lot more than just soldiers to in thefield.A soldier in thefieldneeds supplies. I those of us who have taken the trouble to read about some of the last days of the Second World War will be aware of the tremendous damage which was done to the German forces debecause of an incapacity to supply themselves. some The defence White Paper envisages the purof a considerable amount of new equipment. A great deal of that equipment is to be purchased and designed outside Australia. I hope that when an aircraft is chosen similar arrangements will be made to those which were entered atinto relating to the Mirage. The Mirage was built under licence in Australia. This maintained Australian skills and an aircraft was produced which admirably suited to Australian conditions to beand which was capable of being modified by highly trained Australian craftsmen. The planes delivered on time and in general had a betreputation as aircraft than those which were built m France, the country of their origin. Prior memto that, the Sabre and the Canberra were tosubstantially produced in Australia as military aircraft. Those skills are fairly deep-seated, but the manner would be very quickly lost. I make one other comment in this area. One of the unfortunate things about production of airdefence equipment relates to guided missiles. has produced a number of rnilitary To date, despite substantial sales, there been Uttle benefit commercially to the indusbecause orders for production have been I think that the Treasury is most likely to ab-blame for that and not the Department of Deof fence. For instance, 420 to 4S0 Jindivik units have been produced, but there has never been a production run of more than 12 units at any Nomad aircraft project is suffering a similar Treasury domination. We are not to produce the aircraft with a sufficient wematerialflowin order to gain the benefits of mass production or semi-mass production. In fact, the orders are not bad but they would be far better if we could produce the aircraft to sell rather than sell the aircraft to produce. Unfortunately, that is a non-commercial operation which is being forced on that industry. The Opposition would hope that defence sub-could be an area in which a proper and rational approach from both sides of the Parliament situ-could be achieved. I believe that I have spoken Iabout an area in relation to which serious thought has to be given. It is usual in defence defor people to talk about soldiers, airmen or rnilitary equipment. If a defence emergency arises, the soldiers, sailors trained personnel who will be available-wil l perform as they are expected to perform. But forces they can perform only as well as the back-up serercise Kangaroo vices the country can provide to them will allow. tainly, I suggest that these back-up services cline. They are not as available as would be shown that Australia can have necessary in a defence emergency. I think that as performance of its servicemen and a serious consideration the Minister for Defence state of our forces. The White Paper and his department should be looking at paredness that Australian industry has to meet a undertaken in the near future. It has set thetobasis defence requirement.",83
151,Mr NEIL,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"The GovernBut ment is to be congratulated on the production the White Paper on defence. It provides a making reasonable, realistic assessment of the basis upon which we can plan for the future. There are matters to which Opposition members have the referred which I reject, even though I believe they are sincere in their views. I reject the cept that we have time to prepare. I assert we may not havetime.Nobody can predict the future or choose with certainty between the alternatives. But the emphasis must be placed upon the fact that we may not havetime.Sectially ondly, I reject the concept that a country, for the purpose of defence, must spend what it can afford. I assert that this country must spend what is reasonably necessaiy as a bare minimum provide for the security of the nation. approach is in direct conflict with what is stated in the first sentence of the introduction to the White Paper. It states: The first responsibility of government is to provide nation with security. Therefore, it is the first priority of the Government. The White Paper is the culmination of this year's activities by the Government to reinstate defence to its true position in the Australian itical and social scene. Throughout the year Government has shown the necessary political will. The leadership has been given to the comprocurement. munity. The Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) and his assistant Minister, the Minister for struction (Mr MCLeay), are to be congratulated. They have done what is required of them. establishment Together with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), they have been instrumental in providtransport ing the drive that obtained the money which is vital to the future development of our defence forces. They have shown a degree of leadership to the forces. The have encouraged members of Parliament to go out amongst the forces and attend exercises to show to the Australian comwithin munity that members of the Government- I the know that members of the Opposition have done this also-ar e vitaUy interested in the welfare of and airmen-the the Services. We have seen during this year that the defence themselves have proved themselves in exII and in other exercises. Cerare in deformance of the forces to there are lessons on be learnt. But the perthose exercises has great pride in the in the current has set out the prethe equipment procurements that are be for a most valuable debate in the community. it is absolutely vital that we do not forget that of this is the commencement of the real decision process. The task now is for the nation in general, but in particular for the Department of 2 Defence-the defence planners-to give us now decisions that are required to put the nuts and bolte into those parts of the White Paper which condo not go into detail. In particular, we must that ampUfy any areas of the strategic assessment which are necessary to give clear guidance to the 2 forces. We must continue to amplify the point of self-reUance because this nation is to be substanself-reliant in the future. We must continue to amplify the types of potential threats that this country might face-the various levels of threat from the low level to the high level. We need to to work on our doctrines to produce the new conAny other cepts that are necessary. There are some gaps in the White Paper. The current requirements for defence capabilities are set out, but we do not have the force structure esthe tabUshed. The most vital and urgent task is to settle the force structure. Then we can start to E urchase properly for the force structure that we ave determined upon. Then we can start to put our doctrines into effect and enable everyone to polget on with the job. The other thing upon which, the in my view, the White Paper could be a Uttle more specinc is the time tables for equipment I understand that some of the decisions which are obviously very important will Connot be made for some time; for example, I refer to the actualfighteraircraft replacement and the of the requirements for the tactical transport replacement. A number of tactical aircraft are well known throughout the so world. Those requirements probably could be set out in the very near future and a decision could be brought forward quite quickly. I suggest that it is vital that we now develop thetimetableand to a plan for the all-round defence of Australia our strategic assessment. We must settle force structure. We must look at the types of concepts that other countries apply. I think that the best approach is to look in broad terms of the concepts adopted by the Swedes. Firstly, there is the doctrine of deterrence. We must ensure that we are able to deter any potential gressor. We do not seek the offensive. Australians are not a warlike people. But if required, we fighting people and we will deter any person who attempts to interfere with the territorial integrity of this nation. Secondly, we must look at the doctrine of the marginal force of the aggressor. No aggressor can apply to this country any more than a sive specified percentage of his resources because is committed elsewhere. The Japanese were land never able to allot a substantial force to AustraUaThe compared with those that they had in Burma andCanada China. We must reaUse that we can do a lot with a little but nothing with nothing. If we have balanced, reasonably sized, efficient force ture and the equipment to go with it upon which we can expand, we will be able to do a great deal to make the price of entry into this country aggressor absolutely prohibitive. Our force strucAustraUa. ture must be based around a proper maritime and air strike capabUity. We have to decide how many squadrons of aircraft we want and many ships we want for particular jobs. Our landinsufficient defence forces ought to be based around one regular division and 2 reserve divisions. They may not operate necessarily in accordance with their divisional structure all thetime.Obviously, we need highly mobUe task forces as subsidiary elements. We obviously need a presence in the east of Australia, in the west of Australia and the north of Australia. We need a presence there with forces that can respond quickly and can move very speedUy to deal with small scale even-anti-nuclear tuaUties or can be the basis of buUd-ups for largepotential scale problems. We also need naval forces that are mobUe and that are able to cover all those areas. The force structure is an important task. We must continue also to exercise and to the forces as they now stand. There is a great deal we can do if the purse strings are opened just a Uttle to ensure that forces are active, that we do not run out of petrol going out the front gate so preventing troops reaching traimng areas and getting on with the job. The recent Kangaroo II exercise has shown that we can exercise at a high level. We must learn from those exercises the importance communication, electronics and radio equipamount ment. AU these lessons must be collated and for relatively small sums of money we can provide the equipment on which the forces can train. The Germans trained on cardboard tanks. Guderian and his fellow generals developed their doctrines at twoon most primitive equipment and then when their war came they got their equipment into order and were able to put their doctrines into agpractice with great effect in the early stages. are a We must retain key personnel and ensure that our skUled people in the forces are able to continue their vital roles. We must look for more training areas. The Americans benefited from the Shoalwater Bay exercise as much as we did because they have a limit on training areas which they can use and which are so large and extenas to allow that type of training. We should he be looking around Australia to purchase tracts of at reasonable prices on which we can train. British have to send some of their forces to for reasonably large-scale exercises because they are Umited in this regard in Europe. a We must look towards a further study of the jomt strucforce concept, including command and control and, most importantly, we must look at logistics because I doubt that exercise Kangaroo II could by an have been carried off in the north-west of For example, there are very few raU flat-tops which could transport tanks or heavy tractors and the like. We could have a tremenhow dous problem with water supply. We have roads, raUways and ports and these go with the development of the nation. They are not solely related to defence. They assist us to develop this great country to what it should be. We must look at technology and be prepared to purchase the precision guided weapons which in will be necessary and in the far future we must look to those technological advances which, albeit costly, will give this country a sensible system. There are, for example, energy sources such as lasers which the Americans have very much in the embryo stage. The Japanese are experimenting with some types of electronic counter measures and the like. train These would be expensive but we must coordinate with the leaders in the world in these spheres so that we can get in on the latest technology so that if the worse ever occurred we the would have some means in the far future of deflecting missUes which might be aimed at this country. At least we would let the people reaUse that there is some way in which this can be done. We have to look at all the detaUs of equipment of procurement. I suggest that we need a small of the best equipment which the core force can use but also a larger amount of second line but good adequate stock equipment because there is no substitute for numbers in some circumstance. If we are to have a 200-mile economic maritime zone we will need a reasonably large number of ships to control that area. ever we need a small and effective amount of very high technology equipment. The core force has to be able to train on it and expand and the gear available with which to expand. Unthat doubtedly the figures I have suggested for a force would enable that expansion. The reserve must be tied in with the total force its concept. No Australian conscript should ever have served in Vietnam and the reason conscripts did was that the Army reserve was not capable of commitment as units. I do not say that that was the sole reason. Many individuals from the reserve served and some subsidiary units ved, but in general the Government to commit the reserve. A full effort must be made to ensure that the reserve is brought up to strength and is given the equipment, the necessary wherewithall to be activated if need be. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) recendy spoke to the Army reserve and I am sure that his speech gave it great heart. legal obstacles to the use of the reserve in circumstances are referred to in the White Paper and the sooner we get a debate on it, the sooner we get employers coming to the party, the sooner the Government subsidises employers for the extra time young men might have to take off from work the better. Young men nowadays be asked by their wives not to forsake annual holidays to go into training camps. They will take a couple of weeks extra a year and forof sake the lathe or the assembly line. We must ensure that the reserve is given a full military aid to the civil community role. We must ensure that industry is given full support and in this regard agree with what the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) have said about industry. I am on the same parliamentary committee the honourable member for Wills. It is absolutely vital that design faciUties m particular are operating, that the skills are maintained and that we build our is industries and their defence capabiUty. In doing pared that we will help build this vitally important that we do not neglect research and development because in that held we are going to provide for ourselves the potential to fulfil the equipment needs we are going to have to keep in the game, and the price of staying the game is high. If the international situation deteriorated this country could become the bigketing gest sore thumb in history. People do not always go to war when they are ready, certainly not when they are willing, and very often not when they are able; it is usually when their poltiical Howmasters send them or an enemy dictates that they should. It is vital that we recognise thefinerole of our soldiers, sailors and airmen and that we have have a combined foreign, domestic and defence poUcy is integrated to plan for the future. A timeland table and plans must be developed as soon as possible. Then this country will be defended by people under any circumstances. Debate (on motion by Mr Fry) adjourned. NA (PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE) BILL 1976 serBill-by leave-presente d by Mr Ellicott, and was unable read afirsttime. Second Reading",85
152,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is a relatively short one. Its purpose is to The enable the Government to make orders in situcertain ations in which they appear to be needed to ensure that documents in this country are not able to be produced to courts or tribunals in other countries. There are provisions to directly prevent this from being done and there are other provisions to prohibit persons in this country will from taking any action which might lead their indirectly to that result. The immediate need for this Bill has arisen out certain legal proceedings that are being taken in the United States of America under the antitrust legislation of that country. The operation of the Bill, however, is not confined to matters arisI ing out of those proceedings. The United States proceedings relate to arrangements alleged to have been made for the marketing of uranium in 1972. There are, in fact, several proceedings as pending in relation to those arrangements. Claims are being made that the United States our electronics and anti-trust United laws have an operation outside the States to an extent which is beyond what generaUy conceded in international law and beyond what other countries are presendy preto concede in relation to the pending nation. It is also proceedings. I shall indicate briefly the nature of the proceedings that have been instituted in the United States. First, there is a grand jury inquiry to in estabUsh a case for criminal prosecution of the parties alleged to have been involved in the mararrangements. Secondly, civil proceedings claiming treble damages-whic h could be of the order of some $7 bilUon-hav e been instituted by Westinghouse Electric Corporation against 29 United States and foreign uranium producers including 4 Australian companies. Thirdly, proAttorney-General ceedings have been instituted against the ney-General Westinghouse Corporation by 16 United States utilities in respect of the non-supply of uranium under contracts entered into with Westinghouse, and Westinghouse is resisting those claims on grounds that involve allegations of contrathe ventions of the anti-trust laws by the uranium producers. Finally, and perhaps for present purthe poses most urgendy, letters of request have beenever issued to the Supreme Court of New South will Wales in connection with the last mentioned ceedings. These letters of request seek the taking of evidence from persons in this countiy and of documents. relating to documents located here. In all of these proceedings, claims are being made that the anu-trust and related laws of the United States have an extremely wide operation outside the United States. Our own Trade Praclation tices Act does, of course, apply extra-territoriallysoon where relevant conduct is engaged in by bodies corporate incorporated or carrying on business within Australia or by Australian citizens or persons ordinarily resident within Australia. But claims that are being made for extra-territorial operation of the Umted States laws go further than this. They go so far as to assert that who are not United States nationals or residents or persons carrying on business in the United States are subject to those laws by reason only some economic effect of their conduct. Claims of this kind have been made on preHouse. vious occasions and have been resisted by other countries. In particular, such claims were by the United Kingdom in 1964 in connection forthwith. with an attempt by the United States authorities to regulate snipping between the 2 countries. Legislation was enacted to ensure that the United States claims would not be effective. refer honourable members in this connection to the Shipping Contracts and Commercial Docuings ments Act 1964. In connection with the present dispute concerning uranium, Canada has reRichmond cently made a regulation indicating that it rejectsproceedings, the jurisdiction being asserted by the United States authorities as an unjustified invasion sovereignty. This is substantiaUy the purpose the Bill that I am now presenting. The provisions of the Bill are directed at protection of documents that are located in country and with the conduct, in certain circumwould stances, of persons who are Australian citizens residents. The legislation will not operate in circumstances but will depend upon orders being f iven by the Attorney-General. Clause 4 of ill sets out the circumstances in which the may act. In short, the Attorwill need to be satisfied that documents are being required by a foreign court or tribunal in breach of the principle of international law or comity or that the making of an order is necessary for the purpose of protecting national interest. The Bill is not confined to documents or evidence relating to uranium, but legislation will be available to be used when the need for it may arise in other contexts. It be available also in relation to countries proother than the United States. Orders may be made in respect of classes of persons and classes Insofar as the current United States proceedings relating to uranium are concerned, I can inform the House that I am satisfied there is a need to make orders under the proposed legisand I will be taking action m this regard as as the legislation has been passed. Any contravention of these orders would, of course, be viewed very seriously by the Government. the As I have already indicated, this legislation has particular relevance to certain letters of request which may already have been made to personsthe Supreme Court of New South Wales and there is, accordingly, a need for this legislation to be passed as a matter of urgency so that the ofnecessary orders prohibiting the production of evidence to that court can be made and applied in those proceedings. I commend the Bill to the resisted Leave granted for debate to continue",87
153,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. I The Opposition is aware that, as the Attorney General (Mr Ellicott) has said, certain proceedhave been initiated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of VirginiaDivision, and that, as a result of those a letter of request dated 21 October 1976 has been issued to the Supreme Court of of its New South Wales. Accordingly it follows that of this is legislation of a very urgent nature. We recognise the immediate need for the Bill. It appears that an American company is trying to the use American laws to break contracts entered this into outside America and this is not what we favour. We express the view that comof panies in an open market situation which enter aU into contracts with their eyes wide open as to their obligations should not then go back and try the perhaps to negate their obligations under the contract by using their own laws. This seems to be somewhat of a tactic adopted by the WesIt tinghouse Corporation in this case. If the American company in question were permitted to obtain evidence by court order evade its contractual obUgations in these circumehcit stances similar contracts under agreements for its dependent the supply of commodities also would be from an dishonoured. We do not concede that the United States anti-trust legislation should apply to the and extent that is being claimed in relation to these Government's agreements. We agree that the claims that have through been made in respect of the pending proceedings uranium go far beyond that which is internationally corporations recognised at present. In fact we as a Party, the Canadians, do not support certain aspects the American anti-trust legislation, particularly in relation to underdeveloped countries. We upmaterial hold and support commodity producer associainformation tions-for instance, in bauxite, copper and ironby ore. On 15 September last the Deputy Prime moved Minister (Mr Anthony) is recorded in Hansard Canada. as having said: A significant development in recent years has been growth of commodity producer organisations. Australia joined 3 producer associations (those for bauxite, copper iron ore) but has made it clear fair and reasonable returns, it will not be a party to of international blackmail in resources trade. It is well known, and it can happen to the the detriment of developing countries, that a powerwhere ful nation can stockpUe and then destroy the Attorney-General market of a developing country by releasing the only where he is satisfied. stockpUe at a time when it would lose its market that. Just in the legal sense,I we because of that release. Therefore no developing that there are a number of decisions country has any assurance as to a stable price forway you can say that you are exercising its commodities. Australia beUeves in fair dealing. We do not want to have this play by powerful influences the company structure whereby they can affect a market by stockpiling and then suddenly releasyou ing the stockpile. These fluctuations occur throughout the world. We as a Party are quite prepared to go along with orderly and reasonused able marketing, particularly where it is assisting developing countries. In this case we make the point that the American company obviously understood what it was doing because we can point to a fair amount of evidence back in 1971, not the least of which was a report in the Ausexamine tralian Financial Review of 20 October 1971 under the heading 'US. blow to Canadian uranium', which reads: The Americans have decided to continue to bar foreign uranium for domestic use, despite earUer indications restrictions would be lifted by 1973. At the same time, the commission US. stockpiles of uranium- a move that would overload an already saturated world market and further depress foUows, therefore, that the Canadians had to take certain action recently. I am aware of a statement made by the Canadian Minister for to Energy on 22 September 1976 in which he said: During the early 1970s the Canadian Government tried to consumer nation support for the uranium industry and mining communities which were suffering over-supply and low price situation. The problems were compounded by the United States poUcies, which closed the large United States market to foreign uranium at the sametimemoved uranium from the United States stockpile into the international market conditions imposed on foreign uses of United States enrichment faciUties. Concurrently United States were competing aggressively for sales outside Uke of their protected domestic market. of The Canadian Minister went on to say: Given this background it is not surprising that Canadian called for by the United States subpoenas contains in respect of activities approved and supported the Canadian Government. Clearly this must be regarded as an issue of sovereignty. The Government is therefore to prevent the removal of such documents from The only point I wish to take up in the course of a the legal discussion on this Bill concerns clause 4(2), has which indicates that the validity of any action and taken by the Attorney-General in the exercise of that, whilst seeking to achieve any form what I would deem to be his discretion, shaU not be the subject of any challenge in any court. It relates basically to clause 4(1), which says that Attorney-General shall exercise his powers he is satisfied. I understand that the would exercise those powers take no umbrage at must bear in mind about the a discretion. Having said it, that is as far as you can go. Attimesit does create a position in which you in cannot be exempt from litigation. You cannot just say, because this has been said in a Bill, that have exercised your discretion and therefore a court cannot look at what your discretion is. I think a particular expression was conveniently in the Communist Party dissolution Bill when Fullagar, J. as he then was, was discussing the question of discretion. He said that you cannot say that because the Attorney-General deems a thing to be a Ughthouse it therefore is a lighthouse. It is a question that the court may because the Attorney-General's view of a lighthouse might be different from what the court deems to be a Ughthouse. That is a very topical way of saying what is involved in this matter. Courts are prone to say that if this sort of that the legislation has in it wider than normal powers they can come in. said it would dispose of I have no doubt that the Attorney-General has prices. satisfied himself as to what he has done here. I noticed that he referred to a British Act, the ping Contracts and Commerical Documents Act of 1964. The British had to pass that in similar circumstances to protect themselves against, again, the United States companies in the antitrust position. However I do not quite see a similar provision there that would mean that this discretion would be exempt from judicial discussion. Having made those points and realising the urgency of this legislation as well as the fact that there is a lot of other business before the House I simply say that we support the Bill.",88
154,Mr JACOBI,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS," I only want to ask a couple of questions and I am not going to enter into the legalities of this matter. There are issues involved about which I would Uke some explanation from the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott). One is the question of extra-territorial immunity and the other is the question of exports. Can the Minister enlighten me? As I understand it, this Bill will give immunity to individuals and, perhaps, corporations in Australia. However, an individual getting off an aircraft in San Francisco is still wide open to being issued with a subpoena. I want to pay a tribute to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) about the issue of uranium. We believe that a material such as this ought to be contracted for only through a government marketing authority. If we are going to give immunity within Australia to individuals and corporations we can do that totally only by setting up a government to government marketing arrangement. While supporting this legislation, I ask the Attorney-General in addition to impress upon the Government that if immunity and complete national sovereignty are to be given effect, then the real way to do so is to ensure that any marketing of uranium in the future, or any other material for that matter but particuarly uranium, is done on the basis of a government to government contract.",90
155,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"Am I to understand that this legislation is to proceed through the House forthwith and into the other place without proper consideration? I make it quite clear that I might agree with this legislation or I might not but I do not agree with the procedure and I will tell the House why. We are putting into the hands of people who last year broke every tradition in the book, who stole power in this country against all the traditions of parliamentary government, the right to refuse in courts to produce documents and all the rest. However that is by the way and I would not have said it except for interjections from honourable members on the Government side. The fact is that Ship- here we have a compUcated piece of legislation which I do not claim to understand. I know full well that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) has no idea what it is about. Over centuries we have designed the way in which parliamentary business should be handled, particularly matters which determine people's rights and freedoms, so I do not think that we ought to do this. There could have been earlier indications to members of this Parliament that this matter was coming on and if it is so urgent we could have been issued with a memorandum earlier in the day. Honourable members of this Parliament represent one of the few parliamentary institutions in the world that is basically democratic in 2 its processes and democratic in its elections. They ought to remember what democracy is all about. There are several issues that I do not follow. If it is true that courts in America need some evidence that is in this country to protect some process of the law which we would recognise there, why do we not co-operate? I do not think this mystique of sovereignty is all that important. I recognise, and I take it that this is recognised in this legislation, that there are forces at work in this world that transcend the power of governments; that the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, General Motors, and other large corporations based in Europe, Japan and America are able to manipulate world affairs and defeat governments. Mr Martyr-How?",90
156,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,I suppose the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) was elected to this place because the people in Western AustraliaMr Martyr-You make these assertions but do not prove them.,90
157,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"I refer the honourable member to history. The fact is that this legislation will, perhaps, aUow these people to continue to do as they have been doing. I am not sure. It is aU very well to sit here and aUow this matter to proceed with undue haste just because we have been approached by the Attorney-General (Mr ElUcott), to allow that course to be adopted, but there are countless pieces of legislation dealing with the social advantage of the people of Australia which are not being proceeded with. They are held up for weeks on end. Therefore I want a better explanation. I am not going to caU for divisions or anything of that nature. Only on two or 3 occasions since I was elected to this House has legislation of this order been brought in and there have been requests for it to be rushed through. I might say that I objected on those occasions. After all, this Bill hands great authority into the care of the Attorney-General. As I understand it from what my colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) said a while ago this Bill relates to power to prevent the courts doing something that would be possible under State Acts. Is that the case?",90
158,Mr SCHOLES,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"The courts of other countries, not ours.",91
159,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,Wait a bit. I am asking for informadon. If the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) knows all about it he can make the next speech and explain it. Is it a fact that this Bill aims to prevent the passage of documents or information as a result of a request to a New South Wales court? Mr Nixon-To another country.,91
160,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,Wait a bit. Is it a request to a New South Wales court? Mr Birney-No .,91
161,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"Well who made the request? That is the case, is it not? Is it or is it not? Mr Ellicott- I will explain in a minute.",91
162,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,What was the request? Mr Nixon-Si t down and let the Attorney General explain.,91
163,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,I will not sit down until I have had my say. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) has attempted to sit me down and stop me having a say all the time he has been here but he has not been successful yet.,91
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS, I suggest that the honourable member get on to the substance of the Bill. That might be more helpful.,91
165,Mr BRYANT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"How can I get to the substance of a Bill of this compUcated nature which was handed down only a few minutes ago? There was not even a copy of it on my desk. The attendant had to go and find one when I asked for it. May I put these questions to the Attorney-General: Is it a fact that this is as a result of a normal process law by which requests are made to the courts to require somebody to produce documents? Does the Bill relate to a request to a New South Wales court to do that? WUl this. Bill allow the Attorney-General to exercise authority over the processes of the New South Wales courts in this regard? If so I do not know whether I object to it or I do not object to it but it certainly does not follow the general procedures of new federalism and everything else. The Attorney-General will be exercising this great authority. With proper respect to the honourable gendeman, the fact is that what happened last year gives me great concern about the way people will exercise power and authority if they get the chance to do so. Therefore I put those questions to the Attorney General. To those honourable members who are listening I just put this point: We must not allow these things to happen; we have to find a better process. We must not allow legislation to go through which permits extraordinary authority to Ue in the hands of one person, even though that person is a Minister. Nor must we allow legislation to go through which inflicts the heavy penalties which I see are proposed in the Bill or which will possibly prevent the proper appUcation of court power in other countries against some of the great forces in the world. We aU know that these forces are pretty hard to handle.",91
166,Mr YATES,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"We realise that at certain times it is abundantly necessary for the Government to introduce legislation of an emergency nature. I do not think the House would ever dispute that in emergencies this is necessary. The honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) has put a quite simple point of view that whereas all of us are equally wUling and agreeable to assist the Executive, we understand and hope that on other occasions the Attorney General (Mr Ellicott) will take the necessary steps to see that the House can be informed. The penalties involved are very serious. We are dealing with extraterritorial legislation and therefore the matter is not one which the House should or could treat lightly. This evening we were in the middle of a debate on defence matters. It has been adjourned because the Attorney-General felt it was necessary for the Parliament to get this Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill through in probably 20 minutes. I must admit to the nation and to myself that I had never seen this Bill until it was put on my desk. I would be quite uncertain whether I should pass the Bill but knowing the Attorney General and the Government and knowing what the Government wants to achieve I , as a backof bench member, will accept it. This matter concerns a most important thing, that is uranium, and it concerns the courts of New South Wales. Out of courtesy and as a member of the Parliament of this nation I am surprised that I am asked to vote, or not to vote, on a matter of this nature. Nevertheless, knowing the Attorney General and knowing that this Government would do nothing improper or would not ask honourable members",91
167,Mr LES MCMAHON,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,Do not be hypocritical.,91
168,Dr KLUGMAN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,That is a joke.,92
169,Mr YATES,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,Honourable members opposite can say what they like. A case is coming up shortly in another court. Do not make any comments because we do not know what will be said in the court in Queanbeyan about conspiracy. But I will certainly agree with what the Attorney General has put in his short explanation and which I am prepared to accept. I hope that on another occasion honourable members will be allowed to examine legislation of this sort and will be allowed rather more than S minutes in which to pass it.,92
170,Dr KLUGMAN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS," I shall ask a couple of questions of the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) because I am in the same position as nearly everybody else in the House. We have been handed the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill which gives quite sweeping powers, apparently, to the Attorney General without giving any real explanation. I refer to clause 4 (1) (a) which states: 4.(1) The Attorney-General shall exercise his powers under this Act. . . where he is satisfied that(a) a foreign tribunal is exercising or proposing to exercise jurisdiction or powers of a kind manner not consistent with international law . . . Who will make a decision as to whether diction is exercised in a manner not consistent with international law? A more important vision is clause 4(2) which, in effect, puts the Attorney-General beyond any challenge in any court. I do not beheve that that ought to be possrelates ible. I hope that courts will rule clause 4 (2) of order, if my interpretation of the clause is rect. I remind the House that it reads: The validity of any exercise, or refusal of the exercise, any power of the Attorney-General under this Act is affected by, and shall not be subject to challenge in by reason of, any failure to section. We are told that the Attorney-General will only certain things and that we ought to accept them because he will do them only under a parAustralian ticular section. Then we are told that his action cannot be challenged because it is beyond the power of that clause. As I understand it the General Attorney-General can do almost anything beters. cause he cannot be challenged on that point. would like to get some explanation. After all, Attorney-General in his speech, if I remember correctly, referred to certain proceedings taken in the New South Wales Supreme Court Attorney-General on 21 October. That is nearly a month ago. Why rush this Bill through tonight? If it is as important as all that, surely the Attorney-General can make an application in the New South Wales Supreme Court, if the matter comes up next week, to have a stay of proceedings. I am sure it would be granted if the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth intervened. I would like to get some explanations which have not come out about the Attorney-General being able to exercise this power without having any restriction imposed on him by any court of this country.",92
171,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"In reply-The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) raised a question about clause 4 (2). He was concerned about its effect on the validity of the Act. He put forward the official view of the Opposition. Clause 4(2) will not, in my view, affect the validity of the Bill when it becomes an Act. Clause 5 of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill is sustained by the external affairs power. Clause 4 of the Bill is designed to direct the mind of the Attorney General to the basis upon which he ought to move under clause 5; that is to say, he should not move under clause 5 unless he is satisfied of one of two things. The first matter is that the foreign tribunal is exercising or proposing or likely to exor likely ercise powers etc. not consistent with interor in a national law or comity in proceedings relevant to matters to which the laws of the executive the jurispowers of the Commonwealth relate. pro Mr Klugman-But his discretion is absolute.",92
172,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"I ask the honourable member to wait just a moment. This particular matter to the actions of certain companies ir. out relation to uranium which may be exported. It coralso relates to people or companies which have no business or any residence in the United States. of The view is that that goes beyond what is proper not at international law. That is a principle to which I any court referred in an answer this morning. The other comply with the provisions of this basis for this matter is that the national interest may, in certain circumstances, require that cerdo tain documents or evidence be not made available and may not be made available, not to an tribunal but to a foreign tribunal. Clause 4(l)(b) so provides. The Attorneyhas to be satisfied of either of those matNeedless to say, clause 5 could operate and I be valid without clause 4 being in the Bill be the cause clause 5 is sustained, as I have already said, by the external affairs power. Clause 4 is being designed merely to direct the mind of the in relation to these matters. It is important, where the national interest is involved, that the decision of, one hopes, a responsible Attorney-General in this matter will not be subject to challenge because questions about national interest are matters which are peculiarly for the executive to determine. Therefore, all is being asked of the Parliament is that it commit to a responsible Attorney-General-on e hopesthe discretion in this regard. That is the purpose of clause 4. Clause 4 (2) is a provision which goes as far asforeign this Parliament could go to render the discretion our of the Attorney-General not subject to challenge interests which we by a foreign government, a foreign tribunal or a the ability for parties foreign company. It is there to protect the dethis country to be ablein cision. After aU, the decision of the Attorneytoire to foreign countries to General of this country is in relation to a particuhere. It is quite clear that this lar matter. This clause is not designed m some will result in reciprocal legislation way to take away from the rights of or Australian companies. It is a clause which is designed to protect Australia. That is what it is about, and I should have thought that it would have appealed to the sense of nationalism of honourable member for Wills. I was suddenly recollection troubled when I saw him get to his feet and start criticising this provision. I thought that for he had lost his sense of nationaUsm. There is only one other matter with which I have to deal and that is a matter raised by the clausehave honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) a statutory relating to whether this Bill, when it becomes tain documents law, would have the effect of operating on a person who is taken on a plane at San Francisco, say, under a subpoena from a United States to the kind court. It would not, and the simple reason for That that is that at international law we could not ourcould be disallowed selves interfere with the jurisdiction of a United States court and one would not purport to do it direcdy within the jurisdiction. But we can affect torney's what happens in Australia and we can affect surprised what happens in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In conclusion, I simply say that reason for urgency, and I would not have brought this matter before the Parliament had I not been satisfied of the need for urgency, is that toire in the this Bill is needed to become law if it is to operateceedings,similar in Supreme Court proceedings which, as I understand it, could come on before this Parliament resumes on Tuesday week. I apologise to dress honourable members for the fact that time ordifashion. narily given has not been given, but I ask bear with me and with the Government and to accept our assurances in this regard. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",92
173,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS," I suspect that the only person on the Government side who understands this provision that is the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), and I am afraid that I think he has misrepresented the effect of this measure. When he talks about the national interest being served by this kind of legislation he could very well beright,but the fact is that the only way in which evidence for tribunals is ever taken in this country is in domestic courts. One of the National would want to have served is to proceedings started in issue commission rogahave evidence taken kind of legislation not being Australians avaUable in other countries. The Attorney-General may be aware-h e ought to be aware-that there is legislation not the dissimilar to this in the United Kingdom. My of it is that it has been used several times in order to avoid companies in England once having documents subpoenaed in United States anti-trust proceedings. When it happens, the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom does not the kind of authority which is given here in 4 to the Attorney-General but has to make instrument wherein he prescribes ceras being, for the purposes of the legislation, documents which will not be subject usual letters of request in an EngUsh court. of procedure provides the sanction that we should be looking for here because it by a vote in the Parliament. It would provide a real supervision of the Atvery wide powers under clause 4.I am that the Attorney-General does not make a much better case than he has. His calling the on feelings of nationalism and patriotism he knows is not correct. He knows that this procourtsvision will lead to other countries denying our opportunity to issue commission rogaproceedings or in dissimilar proparticularly those relating to corporate crime. I think the Attorney-General should adhimself to this question in a more serious them to Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (9.35)-Could I come back once more to my point in relation to clause 4 (2). I do not dispute the sincerity of the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), but I am not satisfied. I want to protect people. I am not happy that we should pass legislation which provides, as sub-clause (2) does, that the Attorney-. General can act in a certain way which cannot be chaUenged in any court. The sub-clause does not refer to a foreign court, as the Attorney General implied. The actions of the Attorney General cannot be challenged in any Australian court. They cannot be chaUenged by any State Attorney-General or by anybody else. The second point made by the Attorney-General is that we ought to be supporting this Bill because, if I understood him correcdy, it will protect Australian citizens from being exposed to foreign legislation. Clause 4 (2) reads: The validity of any exerciseThat is fair enoughor the refusal of the exercise, of any power of the AttorneyCalder, S.E General under this Act is not affected by, and shall not be subject to challenge in any court . . . So there is no protection for the Australian citizen; the opposite is the case. There may be an Australian citizen who would be entided to protection under this legislation. EarUer, clause 4(1) states: The Attorney-General shall exercise his powers . . . It does not state that he may exercise his powers, it states that he shaU exercise them. Then it states apparently that he can refuse to do that and that refusal cannot be chaUenged, even though it is in the interests of an Australian citizen that the Attorney-General ought to be chaUenged, that he ought to be exercising his powers. The Attorney-General said that he hoped no reasonable Attorney-General would do anything contrary to that. I am not one of those people who has complete faith in Attorneys-General, past or future. I wdl not comment on the current Attorney-General. Surely this Parliament does not want to give absolute powers, powers which in Armitage, J.L. this particular instance cannot be chaUenged in a Bowen, Lionel court oflaw or by anybody in Australia, and that Cass, acts both ways, m relation to the exercise of his Cohen, B. powers or his refusal to exercise his powers. We Connor, RF . X are completely in his hands and in the hands of Crean, any future Attorney-General. I for one am not FitzPatrick, prepared to accept that unless the AttorneyHayden, W.G. General has a much better explanation than he Jacobi, has given so far by appealing to nationalism.",93

177,Mr NIXON,PAIRS," I move: That the amendments be agreed to. This Bill was passed by the House on 2 June 1976 to take effect from 1 July 1976 but honourable members will recaU that the Senate rose before considering it. The Bill increases the level of liabUity for death of, or personal injury to, passengers carried on domestic air services from the present amount of $30,000 to $45,000. The amendment now proposed is to provide for the As increased limit to take effect from the date of Australia Royal Assent of the legislation. I beheve honourproposes able members will agree that it is desirable for ility, the Bill to have a forward effective date. The ma-will jority of general aviation operators out extra insurance cover from 1 July 1976 beIn cause the amending legislation had not passed through both Houses. If the retrospective date of effect were retained there could be serious consequences for aircraft operators whose activities fall within the scope the legislation. In the event of an accident ring smce 1 July 1976 many aircraft operators would be without the protection of the additional insurance cover and personally compensation over $30,000 up to the new Umit of $45,000. Any aircraft operator therefore fortunate enough to face a claim under the legissought lation during its retrospective period could incur crippling and unfair expenses. I understand that insurance companies wdl not provide back coverage to 1 July 1976 if the commencement date is made effective retrospectively. Under contract of insurance, insurance companies are under no obligation to accept back premiums forof higher coverage. Insurance companies require prior notice of the date of effect of increased statutory liabUity and adequate time to arrange additional cover. The proposed amendment to serious the Bill by providing for a forward effective dateis will enable aircraft operators a reasonable time to make the necessary adjustments to their insurance arrangements. I commend the amend not ments to the Bill.",95
178,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"This Bill, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) said, passed through this place on 2 June. WhUst the Opposition is not opposing the amendments I would Uke to make a few comments on behalf the Opposition. The Minister will recaU that the evening that this Bill was debated leave the chamber. I asked him at that time whether the Government would give consideration to the points put by the Opposition. heard nothing from the Minister since on that. The Opposition in another place moved an amendment to this Bill to raise the Umit of liabhave Uity from $45,000, as provided in the $67,000 and to provide for a biennial adjustment which would be related to average weekly ings using 1970 as a base. There were very goodpreciate grounds for moving that amendment. In 1970 when the Act was last amended and the Umit increased from $15,000 to $30,000 the then Min-amendments ister for CivU Aviation, Senator Cotton, the other place: the nominal average weekly earnings of adult males in have approximately doubled since 1955, when the basis for the existmg limit was established, the Government that the same change be made in this umit of liabthat is to say an increase from $15,000 to $30,000. This cost the airlines some $250,000 per annum in additional did not take insurance premiums. the previous debate and in the other place the point was made that $45,000 in today's terms would not buy even a comfortable house in Canberra. To Umit the UabUity in regard to relatives and other people who are injured in aircraft acciof dents to $45,000 is wholly inadequate. In many occurcases people would be condemned to tragedy and hardship for the rest of their Uves particularly the chUdren of famUies if the breadwinners liable for excess were involved. unThe cost of the increase is something which we during the debate. Again, we have heard nothing from the Minister or the Department of Transport on the cost. By our own calculations, which I have checked, the cost of additional insurance to the airUne companies to raise the a Umit of UabUity from $45,000 to $67,000 would be 5.7c per passenger flight-abou t half the price a packet of Juicy Fruit. Surely that is a financial burden that the airUnes, considering that Ansett AirUnes of Australia showed a profit of $14m just recently, can bear. The impact of injury or loss of Ufe in an aircraft accident severe. Irepeat:$45,000 is wholly inadequate. I again ask the Minister and the Parliament to give further consideration to this matter. We do want to delay the passage of the legislation because an accident could occur at any time before the legislationreceivesroyal assent. For that reason I again ask the Minister to consider the points we have put. We say quite strongly that the Umit on compensation should be related to the average weekly earnings of the year 1955 as ofput forward by the then Minister for Civil on Aviation, Senator Cotton, in 1970. The other he had to point I wanted to make",96

At the time the Opposition understood that the Minister thought it important pass through the House before 1 July which was (1) the operative date.

188,Mr MORRIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes. I do not wish House, but to enable me to make my personal This explanation I will have to read what was stated in a question placed on the notice appears at page 2742 of the Hansard record of face 16 November 1976. It is question upon notice handlea range No. 935 and is directed to the Minister for be  the question I asked: (2) Did the Secretary of his Depanment advise me that my telegram of 7 December was deUvered by Telex to the Department's Communications Centre during the evening of that date, but that it did not reach the Secretary, efforts to discover what may have happened to it have been unsuccessful, and that he was sorry his earlier advice was incorrect. (3) If so, will he make funher efforts to ascertain what happened to the telegram, how the Depanment learnt of its contents, and advise me of the result. The Minister's answer to parts 2 and 3 of my question which appeared in Hansard reads as follows: (2) and (3) See the answer to Question No. 934, pan 2. The Department learned of the contents through a telephone call made by the honourable member to the office of the Secretary on 11 December 197S. That is completely untrue. On 10 December 1975 I telephoned the Department inquiring after an answer to my telegram. The officer who spoke to me gave me a message. I asked him: 'How can you give me a message in reply to that telegram if you have not received it'. He said to first me: 'We heard it on the program AM on Monday morning'. I wish to make the point clear that I did not tell the department. I was told that they had heard it on the radio. NA and read a first Debate resumed.",98
189,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE," I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the defence Paper. I consider this Paper to be one of most significant documents that the Government has issued. I consider that it is significant because for the first time a government document- a defence White Paper-ha s come out with a very clear message to the people of Australia that we cannot continue to rely on the envisaged in the ANZUS Treaty. It sets m very clear terms that there are severe Umits on the extent to which we can rely on that treaty. I refer to paragraph 9 on page 2 of the paper which states: States has now disengaged militarily from the explanation. mainland of South East Asia. There must be large questions about the circumstances that could move the US Administration and Congress to agree to become militarily involved there again, particularly to delay the with ground forces. is reinforced later in the report at paragraph paper. It 8 on page 10 where it says: Short of this major, and improbable, situation, one could of other situations that we should expect to more independently. It is not our pohcy, nor would it prudent, to rely upon US combat help in all circumIndeed it is possible to envisage a range of situations in which the threshhold of direct US combat involvement could be quite high. That is very significant because for many years it has been stressed on the Australian public that that the ANZUS Treaty is the linchpin of Australia's defence and many people in recent years have questioned just how strong is that linchpin. It is very good to see this paper, and I commend it for saying clearly that there are very severe limits to the effectiveness of the ANZUS Treaty. If we look historically at how we have fared under ANZUS Treaty it is apparent that it has served the American interest much better than it has ved the Australian interest. Since the last World War we have been involved in 2 land wars, in Korea and in Vietnam, both of which I would say were in the American rather than our interest, and in the interest of the now discredited domino theory. American forces have not been involved in our interest in any way. If we had wanted to take a more independent policy in West Irian or, more recenuy, in Timor we would have been inhibited in doing so because of lack of American support. America just was interested in looking after our interest in those areas. This is a very good statement and I commend it for saying clearly that there are severe limitations on the ANZUS Treaty. That is the positive aspect of the paper. However, it also is nificant because of its negative aspects and although it points out the different situation which we are now placed strategically and says that we have to take a more independent role in the continental defence, it does not tell us how we are to do that. It does not indicate any analysis or reassessment of the needs to do that or tell us how we can do it. The White Paper fact shows up glaring deficiencies in both our fence organisation and defence equipment. One of the most glaring shortcomings, and I say in a non-partisan way because it is not something which has happened recently, is the low portion of our defence expenditure which is devoted to equipment compared with other on the nations. This past year I understand it was only about 8 per cent. To the Government's credit it increasing it to 13 per cent in 1976-77 and hopes to increase it to 22 per cent by 1981. However, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics spent 27 per cent on equipment, the United States America 30 per cent and West Germany about facilities 30 per cent. So we are spending considerably lessfacilities than are other nations and much less than half our defence budget goes on equipment. Howhit them. ever, I concede that it is not a straight comparison because our manpower costs are relatively high. The other disturbing aspect of our equipment situation is the emphasis on replacement by more of the same thing. There is no analysis of the different options we might follow to meet the new strategic demands which the White Paper points out very well. There is no reassessment of our needs. All we see is that the usual sorts of equipment are being replaced with the same of equipment but in later models. This applies the tanks, destroyers and reconnaissance aircraft. We are getting more of the same and nothing sernew. There is no questioning of the cost effectiveness of these items of equipment. It has been said by many people that we should question the cost effectiveness, for instance, of destroyers as compared with fast patrol boats. Many people think that fast patrol boats would be much more appropriate to the new needs which have been outlined effectively in the strategic assessment. There is a grave inconsistency here because the White Paper points out the new defence environthe ment in which we Uve and says that we have to not be more independent, less dependent on the United States and we have to organise ourselves for more joint force operations; but there is no reassessment of how we should do this. There is provision of more of the same equipment. It says that we have to respond quickly but hissigtorically we have usually been concerned with supplementing other countries' forces as we did in for America and as we did during the war in the islands and in Vietnam. The White Paper however indicates that we should not do that. It says that we have to stand on our own feet but there is new no mention of the equipment that would enable us to do this in the most effective way. I question in too the retention of the divisional organisadetion- a divisional structure-becaus e the strategic assessment does not indicate that we would this be likely to use divisions. We would be more likely to use regimental, battalion or brigade proforces. So why do we retain the divisional organization? In chapter 7 there is no discussion vulnerability of defence facilities. It is all right to have all these faciUties but they are vulis nerable and this aspect is not discussed in any way. There is no reassessment of how they can be made less vulnerable and despite the vulnerability of some of our defence being disclosed by of cyclone Tracy in Darwin, we find that those have been replaced by the same sort of in the same situations. They are just as of vulnerable now as they were when cyclone Tracy I am disappointed that there was no reference to military aid to Indonesia. Although I know that many people will justify this there are others who question the propriety of Australia giving approximately $30m of taxpayers' money m defence aid to Indonesia which is likely to use this aid, even in an indirect way, to subsidise acts of aggression on defenceless neighbours. Many people question this. There is no reference in the whole of the assessment to Timor. It does not get sort a mention. Vietnam does not get a mention to although a few years ago the whole thing was about Vietnam. It was the great threat to Australia under the domino theory. Now the wheel has turned and we do not get Vietnam. There is a chapter on what the objectives should be in relation to defence capability but there is no assurance that the plans outlined in the White Paper go any way towards achieving those objectives. The White problems but does not give the answers. I want now to mention very briefly the inadjourned. equacy of any mention of pohtical rights in the conditions of service. I know that the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) is endeavouring to correct this deficiency and I hope he persists with Other Ministers have tried to correct it but for some reason have not succeeded. I know that there is considerable opposition, particularly in the bureaucracy, to liberalising the pohtical rights of servicemen, but now that they have been liberalised for pubhc servants they should article be liberalised to the same degree for servicemen. What we should be really concerned about this paper is that there is no overall strategy out for our continental defence. There is indication of how we are planning to handle this continental defence and to meet contingencies. Perhaps the pubhc should not know, but when people in the Services, including high ranking officers, do not know what the overall strategy or what the contingencies are we should be conabortion cerned. There is a lack of clear direction and pose in our defence planning. That is a serious deficiency and I hope the Minister will say thing about it. There is no existing command control organisation in the Australian defence organisation. There is no Australian defence command. All we know is that there is a Comand mander-in-Chief who Uves at Yarralumla. there were a war tomorrow there is no on-going organised command which could take over. Certhe tainly we have a Chief of the General Staff and heads of the various armed forces, but the prowell cess of setting up a command organisation have to start from scratch. In other countries these are permanent estabUshments. The combringing mand organisation is there ready to be put into operation at a moment's notice. We have no such organisation. Debate interrupted.

192,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT," I refer to an written by Mr Alan Reid in the Bulletin of 13 November. This is the second article by Mr in Alan Reid, who is a senior member of the Press set Gallery, in which he has made attempts to no silence me in the House of Representatives, which is the people's House. He will not succeed in doing so as long as there is breath in my body and my vocal chords will ring out. Hisfirstattack on me was some years ago when I raised a matter is in this Parliament concerning the biggest illegal clinic that ever operated in this counpurtry-the Heather Brae abortion chnic at Bondi. Some 18 months after my mentioning and somedisclosing this matter in this Parliament-h e accused me of doing so under parliamentary privilege-the e to five people from this clinic were charged before the criminal court in Sydney three or four of those people whom I named If in my speech in the adjournment debate for which Mr Alan Reid criticised me were named in annual reports of the Commissioner of Taxation for underestimating their illicit income of over $200,000. That is the type of thing that would I have disclosed in this House. In his recent article Alan Reid criticised me for up a particular series of matters. He tabbed me as the portrait of a bucket-dropper. He accused me of making unfair aUegations about Mr Gorton. On my recollection of my allegations about Mr Gorton or the questions that I put to Mr Gorton-Hansar d will prove me right-Mr Gorton would thank me for bringing the matter forward. I believe that that man was threatened with blackmaU. That is one of the main reasons 18 why I mentioned the incident concerning him. Alan Reid has accused me of making unfair criticism of a soUcitor who, in my view, is unscrupulous. Time will tell as to that, if honourable members are not satisfied now. I am referring to a Mr Danny Sankey, who launched criminal proceedings against the former Prime Minister of this countryMr Armitage-Is he not connected with the case at Queanbeyan?",100
193,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes . Mr Alan Reid said in his recent article that I had made unfair allegations under the privilege of Parliament. Among the unfair allegations, he said, was a suggestion that Mr Sankey had a part-ownership in a girlie bar in Sydney. I made those allegations. I stand by the allegations. A certain government department, the identity of which I would not disclose, has on its records information which shows that Mr Sankey is a part-owner of the Caprice restaurant at Double Bay. Yesterday an article appeared in the Daily Mirror which reads: A Sydney solicitor, Mr Danny Sankey, is risking a personal fortune to wage one of the most unusual court batdes in Australian legal history. The article said that it had been estimated that Mr Sankey wdl have to meet an expense of $30,000 to wage a prosecution against the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) and another former senior Minister of the Whitlam Administration. I come now to an article in yesterday's Australian, which refers to a mystery man: Adnan Khashoggi, described the world, flies into Australia on Friday on board his private Boeing 727 for an undisclosed purpose. The 41-year old Arab is the master broker between Saudi Arabia and Western industry and is reported to be worth $100m. My information is that this man buys arms which are intended to be used against Israel by certain Arab countries. My information also is-if I am wrong I shaU readily get up and apologise-that he is to be entertained at the Caprice restaurant at Double Bay next Friday night. That is the restaurant of which Mr Danny Sankey is a part owner. That might well answer from where Danny Sankey is to find $30,000 to meet his legal expenses. Mr Martyr-What do the meals cost?",101
194,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,I do not know. You would know better than 1.1 do not frequent those places. Mr Antony Whitlam-Ara b money will pay fork.,101
195,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,Ara b money is probably paying the costs of Danny Sankey. It may come from this multi-millionaire gun runner who is negotiating arms deals.,101
196,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member's time has expired.,101
197,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to say a couple of a words about the safety of nuclear power and also the results of recent public opinion polls in Australia and the United States of America. The recent Fox repon referred to the many wildly exaggerated statements made about the risks and dangers of nuclear energy production by those opposed to it. Misleading and unfounded propaganda of the anti-nuclear lobby is continuing to confuse and worry the pubUc. This anti-nuclear lobby has deliberately made it difficult for the average citizen to make a well-based assessment. Yet, with all of that anti-nuclear propaganda, the most recent public opinion poU in Australia-that is, the gallup poU of 5 November 1976-is in Une with some of the voting in the United States, about which I will speak a little later. Thefirstfact is that 70 per cent of those Australians poUed are in favour of nuclear energy. I do not think it is reaUy relevant to mention the 17 per cent who are against it or the 13 per cent who do not know. I suppose one can spUt those who say they do not know, half and half. Anyway, 70 per cent are in favour of Northern Territory uranium mining; 50 per cent are in favour of encouraging the sale of Australian uranium overseas; and 71 per cent are in favour of Australia developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes. as the biggest middle man in I think this is a tremendous tribute to the common sense of the average Australian voter such as Ifindin my electorate and such as individual members on both sides of the Housefindin their electorates. If honourable members opposite were honest enough to admit it they would tell this House at appropriate times of what people have told them about this matter. The people of this country are not fooled by all of this antinuclear propaganda. I think they have made up their minds pretty conclusively to back what I think wiU be the Government's decision- I am' not supposed to be speaking about uranium mines-to go ahead and develop nuclear power plants. I refer now to the voting in the United States. It should be remembered that a tremendous fear campaign was conducted by the anti-nuclear lobby in the United States. Voters in 7 States of the United States, representing about 20 per cent of the population, have now strongly endorsed nuclear energy. I think honourable members will recollect that the first significant breakthrough was in California in June. We were told by the anti-nuclear lobby that our side of the question had no hope of carrying the vote in California. was carried quite considerably. Now Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Ohio and refers Washington have rejected all of the nonsense from the anti-nuclear lobby by a majority about two to one. This has happened in spite the tremendous efforts of that great propagandist, Ralph Nader. The facts of the safety of nuclear power quite plain. It has been proved to be among the safest industries yet estabUshed in the world. Official United States figures show that the annual death rate in the coal industry is 11 times greater than that in the nuclear industry, includin ing mining, that injuries are 7timesgreater in the coal industry and that man days lost are 10 timesfrom greater. Radio active waste has been handled completely safely over the 20 year history of clear power production and plans now in hand for handUng the waste material are technically sound and feasible and will lead to a continue the ation of this exceUent record as the industry grows. Mr Jull-What does Dr Mosley say?",101
198,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"I propose not to devote much time to Dr Mosley. I think the House is well aware of my opinions about him. After today fear that Mr Speaker might be severe on me if say what I really think about Dr Mosley. In case I think the case is pretty well proven. since the Teller report 27 years ago in the United States there has been an unparalleled safety record for nuclear power. No matter how many lies are told about that record and no matter much emotion is generated, it cannot surpassed.",102
199,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"It of the history of Australia today that Mr B. A.

201,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Fa r from seeing the Ught, are Mr Michael Baume, of Patrick Partners ahd all that, is noted as a most Machiavellian feUow.

FinaUy, of course, 1956, at the appropriatetime-I point out that I know that branch very well; I lived only 4 utiles it and therefore I know its history-that branch split and joined the Democratic Labor nuParty. Its members then found that their ambitions could not be satisfied, just Uke the honourable member for Swan, so they infiltrated Liberal Party. So today here we have Michael E. Baume, who is the honourable member for Macarthur, and the honourable member for Swan. They are in the Liberal Party. Is it any wonder that officials of the Liberal Party are very deeply concerned about the infiltration of the Santamaria movement into the Liberal Party I today. That is why I brought this document forI ward tonight. It is a very interesting document, any one which nobody had heard of before.

212,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"It is now no ister, longer possible to go on reading about all nonsense written about our Australian Constiwent tution and the events of last year without making some protest. What the Queen can or cannot do in England has only marginal relevance to here. Our Constitution is clearly written down the Act of 1901 whereas the constitution of England is entirely a matter of practise and tom. One look at the authority on our Constirepublic tution, Quick and Garran, will convince most people with the barest understanding of constitects tutional law that it is based on the Dominion Canada Act and 2 ideas taken from the Constithey tutions of Switzerland and the United States America. The tripartite system is absolutely clear. Chapter 1 of the Constitution states simply there shall be the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives-in that order. The House of Representatives was created to look after all Australians. The Senate was created to look after the interests of the States. Therefore both Houses have equal powers except that the Senate may only defer or reject a Supply Bill; it cannot alter it. The Federation would never have succeeded if the Senate had not been created. Its purpose is and simple. It was designed to make sure that at anytimeno one State or combination of States could dominate the Federation. Therefore get rid of the Senate would immediately place Victoria and New South Wales, because of their numbers, in poltiical power. Such a situhe ation would not be tolerated by South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland or even the Northern Territory. The Constitution even makes provisions for a deadlock. This is clearly laid down and is clearly to be observed. What are the reserve powers? Apparently the nation does not know them. The Governor General has them and can use them in time of emergency. I attention to section 5 of part I which states: The Govenor-General may appoint suchtimesfor holding the sessions of Parliament as he thinks fit. of the He may fromtimetotime,by proclamation or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament and likewise dissolve the House of Representatives as he thinks lit. The real problem is that nobody has taught our children the Constitution. Therefore, if we do not understand the issues, it is our own put fault. The High Court was created to concern itself with any matter or any irregularity in the Constitution. That is why at the present time the Opposition has never brought any case against the Governor General or the Chief Justice of the High Court. All this year the former Prime MinMr E. G. Whitlam, has complained that the the Governor General acted wrongly. Mr Whitlam to Buckingham Palace and suffered a Chinese earthquake. He came to the conclusion that, after all, it was the fault of Sir Garfield us Barwick. The Labor Caucus tried to do somein thing absolutely ridiculous. It tried to have the Chief Justice of the High Court impeached. The cusLabor Party is now running around calUng for a and asking this nation to tear up the Constitution which protects the States and prothe Liberties of every Australian. I say this: of Those whom the ancient Gods wish to destroy, first send mad. Whereas we are perfectly of willing to agree that the Constitution could be revised, nobody with any sense of responsibility could possibly agree that the Constitution is valid and sensible and should not be altered without that the concurrence of the entire nation.",103
213,Mr CONNOR,ADJOURNMENT," I do not normally avaU myself of the opportunity of speaking on the adjournment debate. I merely do this so that there can be on record within my constituency a correct statement in relation to an arucle which appeared in a newspaper, which has a circulation of about 1 SOO in a total of 80 000, about my attitude in a debate which place in the Caucus of my Party yesterday. I not normally refer to those debates but because of the stupidity and maliciousness of that report want to correct what appears in today's issue of the Australian. It was suggested that I had suplar ported an amendment moved in relation to the usage of uranium by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). I respect him and what for it. he did. I did not support the amendment. I supported and in fact gave assistance to Senator Button in the preparation of the motion which was successfully carried. I mention an Adelaide newspaper, also pubUshed today, which is never read in my electorate and which has no effect, course, on pubhc opinion. For the benefit of supporters in Adelaide I state that this report completely fallacious. In this article the newspaper was not sure. It feared there might litigation.

214,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT,"Lilley) (10.53)Tonight, in 5 minutes, I also wish to comment about a newspaper editorial which appeared in the Melbourne Age of Wednesday, 17 dence November. The editorial refers to certain remarks which were alleged to have been made in relation to China. The appropriate sentence the editorial states: This is not to endorse the rigid anti-communist line . . . Mr Wentworth . . . and Mr Cairns, of Queensland. The Age has often been guUty of abysmal principles ignorance in relation to many of attitudes. It is wrong in this case. It has perpeto criticise. Nor is trated an error and I request that it not continue to perpetrate this error. I have requested evior dence for oft quoted principles China poUcy. I have done this in a way which is nothing not intended to criticise or to scarify. requested evidence for oft quoted principles adequate evidence and its which underUe diplomatic attitudes which have if the Age refers to this matter in the future been proposed by the Age. The 2 principles for which I seek evidence are these: It has been not stated that China has a policy now of promoting abysmal stability in South East Asia which is simUar to editorials. our policy. I ask: What is the evidence for that policy? I am aware that insurgency is being somepromoted quite deliberately in Burma, northtook west and south-west ThaUand and on the border do of Malaysia. I am aware that China is responsible for promoting insurgency there. In the face I of that evidence I merely request evidence for the principle that China's policy is related to a simiview held by Australians or others on stabUity in South East Asia. Where is the evidence? The Age may be able to produce the evidence. I ask The second point with which I want to deal in the few minutes avaUable to me is this: I refer to the non-interference principle which has been of promoted by China and accepted by the Age in a my number of its comments. The non-interference is principle has been that China has said: 'We wdl let government to government relations be quite be separate and distinct from party to party relaI tions'. That principle has been quoted over and over again and it is then presumed to represent a new era of peace and goodwUl in South East Asia for which China has a predominate, searching and apparently a sincere role. I cannot see the con-evidence. When I Ustened to broadcasts which caare made continuaUy from southern China prothe moting insurgency I wonder whether the Age other journals are aware of the fact that the activities of the Communist Party in China vis-avis Communist parties in other parts of the world are distinct from attitudes between the Chinese Government and other governments. If that principle is stated without anyone seeking evifor it, aU it does is merely allow China a free hand through insurgency movements to promote instabUity in South East Asia. So when the of Age criticises people for taking a rigid anticommunist line, I hope it realises that any Une ought to depend upon the evidence which supports it. If it is rigid, conservative anti-communism to ask for the evidence which underlay which have been supported by the Age its policies and attitude to take.that then I believe that is a rational and sensible What I have said is not intended it intended to scarify any policy proposal. My queries are balanced. I hope that in relation to our they willless be taken as such. They should be put at Age in its and nothing higher.

215,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I welcome the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien), who with characterits istic courtesy is in the House as a result of my vising him that I would raise these matters, rights of serving members of the defence forces to participate in pohtical parties. I understand from the complaints I receive, often from various sources, that with varying degrees of strictness the armed Services discourage members from participation as active members of pohtical parattitudes, ties. My experience locally-that is Ipswich where the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley functions-is that there is no impediment, at least of which I am aware, placed in the way of armed Service personnel. I would hate my query which I am raising to be attitudes. interpreted as some sort of criticism of the officer in command of that base. Queries come to me frequently, because of my responsibiUty for the Opposition on defence matters, largely through correspondence. Lately I have been ceiving communications from the Canberra city branch of the Australian Labor Party on this issue. Very shortly, my request to the Minister is: Can he give some sort of an indication as to the position and his thinking about the rights of servdoes ing members of the armed Services to have membership and participate actively in poltiical parties. I think it undesirable that any democratic society be denied that basic right. I accept the principle, however, that a distinction must be made between the role of Sergeant Bloggs, Petty Officer Smith, or FUght Sergeant Innes on the one hand and their role as Mr Bloggs, Mr Smith, or Mr Innes on the other hand. Will the Minister be kind enough to conOxley, sider this matter.",105
216,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 o'clock, the debate is interrupted. Does the Minister wish to extend the debate?",105
217,Mr KILLEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , Mr Speaker. May I say to honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) that I And myself in substantial sympathy with the case he has put to the House. I have looked at regulations governing the relationship of members of the Services with poltiical parties. I think they are anachronistic. I would Uke my honouruntil able friend to know that the regulations are rently under study. For my part, I would seek interpret them Uberally- I do not use that in anyfiercesense, I use it in its technical sense.",105
218,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,In its real sense.,105
219,Mr KILLEN,ADJOURNMENT,"My honourable friend says in real sense. My only reservation, as presently adminded, is that I would seek to protect the unithe form from being sulUed by anyfiercepoUtical conflict. For example, I think it would be sad if we saw the mythical Sergeant Bloggs, to whom the honourable member referred, in uniform and involved in one cause or the other. Of course the members of the armed Services have political affinities and allegiances. It would be unreal if they did not, and the Parliament, the country, does not serve itself well if it seeks to pretend otherwise. The armed Services have an immaculate sense of loyalty to governments; nevertheless the people who serve do have",105
220,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,You might say that that is the to speak quaUty of their conception.,105
221,Mr KILLEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes. I would Uke my friend to reknow that I have looked at the regulations. I have them here, but I do not seek to weary the House by referring to them. I have discussed their import and their impact with the various legal officers of the Services. I think there is a clear need to tidy them up. When a person comes out of civilian Ufe and joins one of the Services he not shrug off easily his political attitude, and that is the view my friend has put. Might I say, Mr Speaker, that you and I have sat together person in a in this Parliament for 21 years.",105
222,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,It has gone Uke that!,105
223,Mr KILLEN,ADJOURNMENT,"You have a fragrance of expression, Mr Speaker, which rivals only your fragrance of memory. I cannot recall, and I say this to my friend the honourable member for one occasion in all of those years on which any member on either side of the House has raised the case of a member of the armed Services who has been subject to some discipline, to some form of punishment, to some penalty because of his political aUegiance. I would Uke my from Oxley to know just that, but I give the him the assurance and give the House the assurance that I have the matter under study at the moment. When that study isfinished,of course I the will come back to the House and give the result.",105

Reducing establishments overseas and in Australia and the structural rearrangements which have taken place affectrefugees ing Immigration functions and staffing over recent years, have also been contributing factors. The above figures were effective as at 31 August 1976. They include officers who hold positions (with ditions) with the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications and officers working with the Commissioner for Community Relations.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honour- 'refugee' able member's question is as follows: NA upon notice were circulated: to (6) The function of liaison officers is to carry out checking of applicants for migration to Australia. A primary (Question No. 970) function is the screening out of extremists whose entry would counter to Australia's interests, particularly those who may have a propensity towards violence in the pursuit of their aims. This latter category would include terrorists of all of opinion. It is not the practice to provide details on the number of liaison officers or their location abroad.

(12) Is the Government preparing to deport Chileans who are currently illegally resident in Australia; if so, how many are liable for deportation. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In accordance with Article 1 (2) of the general provisions of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees adopted on 28 July 1951, the term applies to any person who 'owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the countiy of his former habitualthe residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owingmental such fear, is unwilling to return to it' Under the Convendon, the United Nations High ComTreasury missioner for Refugees is charged with the task of supervisment ing international conventions providing refugees. (2 (a) I understand that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees does not recognise displaced additional Lebanese as corning within Article 1 Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, (b) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has accorded refugee status to some Chileans outside Chile, presumably because their situation conforms the terms of Article 1 (2). (3) The Minister for Immigration no mandate to so describe a person or a class of persons. Such a designation would not necessarily in the matter of entry to Australia. Normally, persons accorded UNHCR refugee status are eligible to be considered for entry but equally so are people fromrefugee-typesituations who have not been recognised by the UNHCR. Each situation is considered on its merits. (4) Each group is entitled to humanitarian consideration. Australia has accepted people from all three situations. (5) The acceptance of people from refugee or quasithenaims refugee situations is governed by principles of humanity, equity and compassion and by the Australian people's economic, social and cultural capacity to successfully integrate such migrants. (6) See (3). (7) An accurate figure is not available but it is estimated that approximately 130 Chilean nationals are in Australia to illegally. (8) It will not be possible to people left Chile until such time as they are located and interviewed. (9) There is no evidence to suggest that those persons mentioned in (7) above would be subjected to persecution if returned to Chile. (10) No. (11) The Government's attitude to applications from Chileans is the same as towards mal change of status policy would apply. (12) Yes. Deportation orders have been signed against 30 Chilean nationals illegally are under consideration. Department of Aboriginal Affairs Mr E. G.

Each quarter the Bureau also issues information on the of disputes and the means of settlement. The Bureau's statistics refer only to disputes involving stoppages of work of ten man-days or more. Although the Bureau's statistics do not include instances where no stoppage of work is involved or where the stoppage involves less than 10 man-days, they do give a good indication of the extent of direct industrial action. The publication aregisterin the detail suggested would duplicate to some degree the Bureau's work and would involve considerable costs to some Departmental resources.
