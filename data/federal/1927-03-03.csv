1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Littleton Groom) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PRESENTATION OF BUDGET.",10
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer whether, as the Commonwealth Auditor-General has asserted that so involved is the method of budget presentation adopted by the Treasurer that financial experts often misunderstand the true position of the Commonwealth finances, he will give consideration to thu matter, with a view to the presentation in future of a budget that will clearly set out the finances of this country?",10
3,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I differ from the Auditor-General with regard to the proper method of presenting the accounts of the Commonwealth. He apparently desires that the whole of the Consolidated Revenue Fund should be set out on one side of the account, and the expenditure on the other. . Mr WEST - Not a bad.idea. - Dr EARLE PAGE - It was a good idea before the various Governments of Australia interested themselves in public utilities and business enterprises. It is now obvious that if we set out on one hand our taxation, which we are trying to reduce, and on the other the expenditure on business undertakings, which we are trying to increase, the result will be a meaningless mass of figures which will confuse every one who sees them. Not merely has the method adopted in the presentation of the budget received unstinted praise from all quarters of Australia, but its extension last year received further praise. NA PROCEDURE.

6,Mr NELSON,ELECTORAL LAW AND,"In view of the fact that the Chairman of the North Australian Commission is an expert in mining matters, will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of placing mining in the Territory under the Commission over which he presides?",11
7,Mr BRUCE,ELECTORAL LAW AND,"The scope of the Commission was settled by Parliament in the measure dealing with the subject, but the honourable member's suggestion will receive consideration.

The Government could not attempt to influence them in any way in out the commission with which Service they have been entrusted. NA FROM NEW ZEALAND.",11
11,Mr BELL,IMPORTATION OF POTATOES,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the Tariff Board has yet presented its report upon its inquiry into the importation of potatoes from New Zealand? If so, has the Minister considered it, and how does he propose to deal with the matter?  the report is in course of preparation, but since the inquiry was instituted an embargo has been placed by the health authorities upon the importation of potatoes from New Zealand. That embargo still exists. NA COMMISSION. PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.",11
12,Mr ABBOTT,DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION,"the Prime MinCan he say if the Development and MigraCommission will, at an early date, institute an inquiry into the main primary industries of Australia, viz., wool, meat, wlieat, and dairying, with a view to definitely ascertaining their present resources and future possibilities of expansion?",11
13,Mr BRUCE,DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION,"The reply to the honourable member's question is as follows:Since the constitution of the Development and Migration Commission in October last, it has made investigations and recommendations which have been adopted by the Government in regard to a number of schemes approved under the £34,000,000 migration agreement, involving an expenditure of over £6,000,000, and further schemes submitted by the State amounting to approximately £10,000,000 are now being investigated. The Commission has also given consideration to the re-organization of the Commonwealth migration activities both in Australia ami in Great Britain. In addition, the Commission has luicl and is giving attention to the following questions:(a) Unemployment survey including the problem of seasonal variations. (6) The present position and the future possibilities of Tasmania on the economic side, in consultation with the State Government and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. (u) The dried fruit s industry throughout Australia. (d) The gold-mining industry of Australia with particular reference to Kalgoorlie, and (c) The economic utilization of Australian oil shale deposits. The honourable member will appreciate that this programme of work is alreaclj' very extensive, and, in the opinion of the Government, and of the Commission, investigational work of this character to be effective can only lie developed-as the Commission strengthens its organization to cope with the numerous problems which are unquestionably awaiting close examination. While at the moment it cannot be said that the wool or wheat industries are in an altogether unsatisfactory position, it evident that they provide an ample field for investigation, both in the light of increased productivity, transport, and otlier important phases, and these, together with the meat anil dairying industries and their attendant problems of breeding, animal nutrition, and improved pasturage, are at present receiving consideration. Although no plan of attack has yet been made on these problems, preliminary inquiries which have already been instituted by the Development and Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, are resulting in the collection of most valuable data which, as opportunity will enable a systematic attack to be made upon the problems referred to by the honourable member, after all necessary consultation with the State and the industries themselves. BLOOD'S CREEK TELEGRAPH OFFICE.",12

15,Mr GIBSON,DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Blood's Creek is the only telegraph office in South Australia north of Oodnadatta., but Charlotte Waters, which is in Northern Territory, is only 34 miles north of Blood's Creole. ' 2. Yes.

RILEY (t h r o u g h Mr FEN TON ) asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether any decision has yet beer, arrived at in connection with the request of the Returned Soldiers' Association that means of transport be provided to those returned soldiers whose present disabilities are as a result of double amputations or paralysis? 2.

In view of the fact that the latest figures of the Commonwealth Statistician show that there are 25,351 trade unionists unemployed in Australia, will he take similar action ?",12
20,Mr BRUCE,DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are ae f o l low : 1. I have no knowledge of the matter beyond the report in the newspaper press. 2. As I have frequently pointed out, the Commonwealth can only assist the migration to Australia of such persons, or classes of persons, as are requisitioned by the Governments of the various States.

Will the Prime Minister give the House notice before ratifying such Ordinance, which deprives the residents of the Federal Capital and others of the right of having a jury to deal with civil cases?",13
23,Mr MARR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low- : 1. No. Ordinances relating to the Territory for the Seat of Goverument are made by the Governor General, not by the Federal Capital Commission. The Ordinance to which the honourable member presumably refers relates only to civil actions in the District Court. 2. The Ordinance was made in January last and is already in operation. The relevant section reads as follows :"" 5A.

24,Mr BRUCE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Yes. 2. I would refer the honourable member to the statement made by me in reply to a question without notice, wherein I pointed out that the whole question of copyright law is an extraordinary difficult and complex one, and that because of the number of international conventions with regard to copyrights, it cannot be dealt with by an alteration of our law without possibly very serious results to Australian citizens who desire copyright privileges in other countries. I also stated that hist year a conference of many of the parties interested was held, and it is understood that a fair and reasonable arrangement bad been reached. NA POSTMASTER - GENERA L.",13

38,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.52] - I lay upon the table of the House a summary of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference of 1926, and move That the paper be printed. Having recently attended the Imperial Conference in London, it is now my duty to submit to this Parliament a report upon the work done at that gathering. In addition to the summary of proceedings which I have laid upon the table, there is a very large bound volume of appendices containing the speeches, reports of committees, and general information about the transactions of the conference. Because of the large expense that would be involved, I do not propose to move that that volume be printed, but we have already received from G-reat Britain 30 copies of it, and are expecting further supplies, which will be placed upon the table of the Library, where they will be available to honourable members. The summary and the bound appendices will inform the minds of honourable members fully of the discussions and resolutions of the conference, and will supply a great deal of information that I could not be expected to convey to the House in one speech. May I say at the outset that exceedingly valuable work was done at the conference, which will be remembered as a gathering at which much was accomplished to cement the unity of the Empire and promote amongst its constituent parts a broader spirit of cooperation than has existed in the past. That is an aim which, I am sure, commends itself to all honourable members and the whole of the Australian, people. The matters with which an Imperial Conference deals are outside the realm of ordinary party political controversy; they are wider than the purely Australian issues that engage this House and divide our people from time to time, but they are of paramount importance to every citizen of the Empire. I left Australia on the 2nd of September, 1926, and returned on the 7th of February of this year. Five monthsAct- the period for which I was absentis, I understand, the shortest period for which any Australian delegate to an Imperial conference has beeu absent from the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, I found it possible in that time, in addition to attending the conference, to visit most of the big centres in the United Kingdom, and to spend about a fortnight in the United States of America and Canada during the return journey. I was able to do so much in a comparatively short period because on this occasion the procedure of the conference was altered. Instead of the conference sitting continuously in plenary session, and long speeches being made by the representatives of the dominions, the plenary sittings were reduced to sixteen, ancl, apart from the general introductory speeches, every subject, whether political, constitutional, or economic, was first referred to a committee or sub-committee for consideration. During the period of the conference, from the 19th of October to the 23rd of November, there were 148 meetings of committees or sub-committees. This method proved unquestionably more effective than that adopted on' previous occasions, and will, I am confident, be followed at future conferences. The subjects dealt with may be divided under five broad headings, namely:-Inter-imperia l relations, foreign policy, communications and consultation, defence and economic questions. All honourable members will agree that the most important of these was interimperial relations, because without cordial relations and willing co-operation between the different parts of the Empire, bast-d upon goodwill and understanding, it would be futile to consult upon foreign policy, common defence, methods of communication, and closer economic union. If there is a will to co-operation, ancl the relations of the different parts are established and maintained on a basis of complete understanding, we can look to the future confident that there will be an increasing degree of unity. Therefore the subject of inter-imperial relations transcended all others. Prior to my dcparture fro m Australia the agenda for the conference was presented to this House, and in my speech upon it I referred to the uncertainty which was manifesting itself in different parts of the Empire in regard to inter-imperial relations, and the great danger that threatened the Empire itself unless a better understanding of the constitutional relations of the Mother Country with the dominions could be established. When I arrived in Great Britain that atmosphere of doubt was noticeably prevalent. Many people were sceptical as to what the conference would accomplish, and some questioned the wisdom of even attempting to deal with constitutional ancl inter-imperial relations at that juncture. Others were so pessimistic as to predict that that conference would inevitably lead to the disintegration of the Empire. Undoubtedly, the greatest anxiety was felt hy many close students of imperial affairs. The tension had been in creased by speeches which had been made by the Prime Minister of one dominion, and particularly by his claim that the conference should to the world the absolute independence of the dominions in foreign affairs. That statement caused grave anxiety in this country"", ancl elsewhere. The press led the people of Great Britain , ancl, I! assume, the people of other parts of the Empire also, to believe that a dramatic situation was likely to arise, and that the conference would disclose serious differences of opinion between the representatives of the self-governing parts of the Empire. I am happy to say say that none of those fears was realized. Every one of the representatives, without exception, expressed a desire for greater co-operation and closer unity, and showed a strong attachment to the Empire, and a firm belief in its value as an instrument of good in the world. The continued growth of the Empire was held to be in the interests of the people not only of the Empire, but also of the world. At the opening of the conference that spirit, was immediately manifested. Before leaving this country I defined very clearly what I believed was Australia's attitude everon all these questions. I then said Australia's aspiration must be a closer linking together of all the self-governing portions of the Empire, with as full recognition of the independent status of all the self-governing dominions as is compatible with the recognition of our British nationality and the maintenance of the closest possible relations between the English-sppaking peoples. That, I believe, is the view which this community takes today. That was the view which representatives at the conference took. They were all anxious to preserve the rights they had; but there was also a marked desire for greater unity ancl greater co-operation. The British Government was of the same opinion. Before I left Australia. I also saidIf a single thing that could be regarded as a real limitation of our autonomy could be pointed to, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the Imperial Government would, if possible, remove it ; but I know of nothing whatever that could be rightly considered a restriction of the authority of the Commonwealth Government to deal with Commonwealth affairs. That was the attitude of the British Government, which was prepared to do anything that the dominions desired, so that the independent nationhood-if one must use that word, althoiigh there is no desire for independence, as some persons understand it-the absolute, self-governing rights of the dominions should be recogdeclare nized. At the opening of the conference, after the Prime Minister of Great Britain had extended a welcome, speeches were made by the various dominion Prime Ministers, the President of the Executive Council of . the Irish Free State, and by the Maharajah of Burdwan. I had been only a few days in Great Britain , but had had an opportunity of meeting the representatives of other dominions, and it was clear to me that there was not the anxiety to breakup the Empire that some persons thought to exist. There was no such desire in the mind of any of the representatives. At the opening session I said I think it is very unfortunate that so much has been suggested as to great constitutional difficulties which exist at the present time, for it amounts to an implication that there is friction between the different parts of the Empire and the Governments that represent them. I think the Prime Minister of Canada, in his admirable remarks has, if be will permit me to say so, siiown the position in a very clear light, and has brought us all to the recognition, to which I hope we had come before, that the problems of the Empire, with the diversity of conditions which exist of race, and fortunately mentsnot of ideal but possibly of tradition, render it necessary that we should have the fullest discussion with a complete recognition by all of us that our desire' is mutually to advance the interest of the Empire as a whole. If there are any misunderstandings let us clear them away by a frank interchange of views. For my part i am certain that those constituevery tional difficulties which some people are trying to suggest will disappear entirely when around this table we come to discussion. We have been able to solve all our problems in the past, we have gone through the system of proconference, gress and advance in the Empire which you have recounted to us today, we go right back future. to the first Imperial Conference, we come the testing period of the war, and the sittings of the War Cabinet. Wc pass on into the post-war period, and, as each new problem has arisen, we have met it . I am confident today that if we have to face further problems we shall be able to find a solution for them All the P r i m e Minister s spoke, and from the reports of the i r speeches I wish to read w h at was said by General He r t z o g , P r i m e Minister of South A f r i c a , as showing the view of that d o m in i o n , whic h has been m u c h misunderstood. He said I take it that one of the objects of our gathering together here today and for the following weeks is to ensure the usefulness and permanency of our relations as an Empire by advancing its efficiency as an instrument of good for each of its associated members as well as for the world ai) large. In the attempt to attain that object, I wish to assure you, sir, of the hearty support and co-operation of myself and my colleague on behalf of the Union of South Africa. We are prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent in laying as solidly as possible the foundations wealth of nations, so as to make it as durable as it can be, and here I wish to say a few words as to South Africa's attitude in regard to the Empire, or British Nations. It has our hearty support, and will ever have our hearty support, irrespective of parties and races, as long as it is, and shows the character of, a commonwealth of free and independent nations, each free and striving to attain what is best for itself, yet in such a manner and in such a spirit as will conduce wherever and as much as possible to the well-being of all. If I may state in a few words the principle which should guide us in matters of general Imperial interest, I would say : In principle unrestrained freedom of action to each individual member of the in practice, consultation with the view to cooperative action wherever possible. I think, sir, it will be generally admitted that the corner stone of the Empire is the will, the goodwill, of those who compose it. that will the Empire must collapse. If , therefore, the Empire is to be maintained, if it is to flourish and fulfil that great task which we all hope it will achieve in the history of the world, we must see that the will to live in the Mr Bruce. Empire as a commonwealth of free nations will in future, as it is today, be present and active with every one of its constituent - eleSpeaking merely for South Africa, I think they are not. South Africa is anxious to possess that will equally with every other member of the commonwealth, but that will can be assured for the future only if she can be made to feel implicit faith in her full ancl free nationhood upon the basis of equality with other member of the commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that this question of the status of the dominions, which concerns their own communities no less than the world at large, will receive due consideration by this and will be agreed upon in a manner that will remove all fear and doubt for the I am glad to see, Prime Minister, to that, according to the agenda, this question will be treated, and I hope the result may be such os I see Mr Bruce, the representative from Australia, contemplates will be the effect - if we, with a will, set to business to settle these questions, they will find a solution which all. will satisfy us all, I have no doubt. That was the atmosphere in which the conference started. The speech of General Hertzog, who, we have so often heard, has no desire for co-operation with the British Empire, showed that he had been misrepresented. Two things that he said had caused some anxiety. He referred, for instance, to "" independence."" The committee which dealt with the question had not been meeting very long before it became apparent that General Hertzog's use of the word "" independence "" did not express a desire to be outside the Empire. His only anxiety was that the position should be clarified, and that the Dominion of South A f r i c a should have absolute autonomy, and should be free of our commonfrom the possibility of the overlordship of Great B r it a in. There was a feeling in South Africa that Community of they were not a true partner in the Empire, were not enjoying full self-governing rights, but were subject to over-lordship by Great B r it a in , which had power to coerce them. In the course of the discussion it was shown that this was not so, and then the whole atmosphere was changed. I have referred to Genera] Hertzog's use of the word "" independence "" to show that he did not mean what many people thought that he meant. This commonwealth; question was not dealt with in the plenary session of the conference or in committee. The committees consisted of a considerable number of persons. Without Elaborate shorthand notes were taken of all their proceedings and transcribed and filed. But our inter-imperial relations were dealt with by the Prime Ministers, sitting alone in the PrivyCouncil chamber, presided over by Lord Balfour. The atmosphere there made possible the freest possible discussion. I think that there was no problem of the constitutional relations of the different parts of the Empire that was not threshed out round that table, in an atmosphere of freedom, where every difficulty could be brought forward, and every political consideration taken into account. It was that round-table method of considering this great question that rendered it possible for us to arrive at what I believe honourable members will agree is a satisfactory solution of it . I should like to deal first with the report of the Imperial Relations Committee. The first part of the document is quite general. It is headed, "" Status of Great Brita in and the Dominions."" The Prime Ministers of the Dominions set out their view of the stage of evolution that has now been reached by the extraordinary group of nations comprising the British Empire. But no part of the report purports to set out in any sense a constitution for the Empire. Before I went to the conference I stated quite definitely that I would not be a party to setting down a definite constitution. The British Empire has grown and expanded as it has because of the amazing flexibility of the ties that bind its members together. The first part of this document, therefore, is in no sense a constitution. Its opening paragraphs merely attempt to declare to the peoples of the Empire and the nations of the world the stage that has been reached in our imperial evolution. Deal.ing with this definite matter, the report readsThere is, however, one most important in it which, from a strictly constitutional of view, has now, as regards all vital matters, reached its full development. We refer to the group of self-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the dominions. Their position and mutual relation may be readily defined. They are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in pect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to Crown, and freely associated as members the British Commonwealth of Nations. That is the definition that one would give of the relationship of the various parts of the Empire if he were asked [3] state it in a few simple words. Enlarging somewhat upon the position, the reports statesBut no account, however accurate, of the negative relations in which Great Britain and the dominions stand to each other can do more than express a portion of the truth. The British Empire is not founded upon negations. It depends essentially, if not formally, on positive ideals. Free institutions are its lifablood. Free co-operation is its instrument. Peace, security, and progress are among its objects. Aspects of all these great themes have been discussed at the present conference; excellent results have been tliereby obtained. And, though every dominion is now, and must always remain, the sole judge of the nature and extent of its cooperation, no common cause will, in our opinion, be thereby imperilled. Equality of status, so far as Britain and the dominions arc concerned, is thus the root principle governing our interImperial relations. But the principles of equality and similarity, appropriate to status, do not universally extend to function. Here we require something more than immutable dogmas. For example, to deal with questions of diplomacy and questions of defence, we require also flexible machinery-machiner y which can from time to time, be adapted to the changing circumstances of the world. This subject also has occupied our attention. The rest of this report will show how we have eudeavoured not only to state political theory, but to apply it to our common needs. The definition that I have read, and the subsequent remarks, indicate clearly that there is something more than a negative aspect of our inter-imperial relations. Those extracts from the report have been subjected to the criticism that they contain no reference to the obligations of the different parts of the Empire towards each other. It is said that their rights are set out, but not their obligations. In my opinion, it was proper that the statement should be made in this way. Each dominion in the future, as hitherto, while it remains a member of the Empire, must be the sole element judge of its obligations; and I believe, point as the report states, that under these conditions our co-operation in any common cause will be such that no part of the Empire wil l be imperilled. In the past, notwithstanding that our imperial obligations have not been specifically set out, any asthere has never been a time when any part of the Empire has been allowed the to suffer through a division of forces, of and I believe that if we do our best to develop the spirit of imperial goodwill and co-operation we shall maintain our unity. In the past our sense of to obligation and responsibility to the Empire has been such that in time of need every part of His Majesty's farflung dominions has responded to the appeal for help in a way that has amazed the whole world. We do not need to set out our obligations; it will be quite sufficient if we create a spirit of co-operation and goodwill. We need not fear that its obligations will not be observed and recognized by every part of the Empire. The commencement of this document, therefore, sets out the actual position in a few words. Then the report deals with specific matters, the first of which is the title of H is Majesty the K in g. A slight alteration was made in His Majesty's title, merely with the object of meeting changed circumstances within the Empire. As honourable members know, the title of His Majesty the K in g has been "" George V . , by the Grace o i God, of the TJnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the British .Dominions beyond the Seas, K in g . "" The alteration is the deletion of the word "" and"", so that the title now reads, "" George V . , by the Grace of God, of the TJnited Kingdom of Great B r it a in Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, K in g . "" That alteration - whic h was in no sense substantial-wa s made because it was felt that the for m of the title hardly accorded with the altered state of affairs arising from the establishment of the I r is h Free State as a dominion. It would perhaps be stretching language to describe the Irish Free State as a dominion overseas, seeing that it lies only across the Bristol Channel. I should, of course, add that it was the desire of His Majesty that this question should be examined by the Imperial Conference, with a view to making any alteration in the title that it considered desirable. The next subject dealt with was the position of Governors-General, alteration whatever was made in that regard. All that was done was merely Lo set out definitely and clearly the position of the Governors-General of the various dominions. It is now stated and definitely that a Governor General today, as ever since there has been a Commonwealth, is the tive of His Majesty the King, in no sense the representative Mr Bruce. British Government. At one period in the evolution of the Empire, Governors were the direct representatives of the British Government, and exercised powers that were conferred upon them by that Government. In an autonomous self-governing dominion the UovernorGeneral is the representative of the K in g alone, and is in no sense a representative of the British Government. The conference also considered the existing method of carrying on communication between the two governments, through the Governors-General of the dominions. At the present time all communications from the Australian Government are forwarded by the Prime Minister's Department to the office of the Governor General, and are by that office despatched to the B ritish Government.",16
39,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Is any change in the existing method of appointment of the Governor General involved ? Mr Bruce.'-No . It has long been an established fact that the Governor General cannot interfere in the slightest degree with any communication that passes through his hands from one government to the other ; it is sent to him merely for his own information. The conference definitely laid it down that each dominion should act according to its own judgment as to the better course to adopt, but it proposed the alternative method of cables being sent by the Prime Ministers of the dominions direct to the British Government, with the very important proviso that the Governor General of the dominion concerned should be supplied with copies of all documents of importance, and that, generally, he should be kept as full y in formed as is His Majesty the K in g by. the British Government. The alteration will not affect in substance the existing arrangement. The operation of dominion legislation was then considered. The position that now exists is very well set out in the report and no itself, which readsExisting administrative, legislative, and judicial forms are admittedly not wholly in accord with the position as described in section II . of this report. This is inevitable, clearly since most of these forms date back to a time well antecedent to the present stage of constitutional development. Our first task, then, was to examine these forms, with special representa- reference to any cases where the want of adaptation of practice to principle caused, or and might be thought to cause, inconvenience in of the the conduct of inter-Imperial relations. There are a number of practices which are, in some respects, merely a survival from a time when the constitutional position was entirely different from what it is now, and when full autonomy and self-governing rights were not enjoyed. The particular points that we examined were(t) Existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of dominion legislation for the assent of His Majesty, or authorizing the disallowance of such legislation. In effect, they had ceased to operate, yet the matter could not be brushed aside without consideration, there are certain kinds of legislation to which I sball refer in a moment, in regard to which it is essential that an endeavour should be made to ensure uniformit y throughout the Empire, and such coordination as will conserve the interests of every portion of the Empire. There is an anachronism,- but the conference recognized that the matter should be considered. Other points examined were(ii) (a) The present position as to the comf ietence of dominion Parliaments to give their egislation extra-territorial operation. (b) The practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to the principle that each .dominion Parliament should have power to give extra-territorial operation to its legislation in all cases where such operation is ancillary to provision for the peace, order, and good government of the dominion. (iii) The principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, and the extent to which any provisions of that act ought to be repealed, amended, or modified in the light of the existing relations between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as described in this report. Each of those questions will require the most careful and deliberate consideration, and probably will involve the examination of a great deal of detail to ascertain the wisest course to adopt. Another difficult subject was merchant shipping legislation. It was decided that it was necessary to consider the principles which, in the general interest, should govern practically all legislation relating to merchant shipping in the various parts of the Empire, having regard to the changes which have taken place in constitutional status and general relations. It may be necessary to enlist the assistance of constitutional lawyers in the endeavour to unravel the extremely difficult problems which arise. The conference considered that the best course would be to hold a subsidiary conference, consisting of representatives of . all parts of the Empire, for their examination, these representatives to report to their respective governments. The first step will be a close examination by each dominion of the present position. The British Government has already appointed a committee to deal with the matter, and the Commonwealth Government and the other dominion governments are taking similar steps to have a full investigation made, so that complete information may be placed before the conference because when it is held.",20
40,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"May that me,an an in terference with our Navigation Act ?",21
41,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"No . The idea is to devise means for retaining complete freedom, with a general definition of the powers ancl rights of the different self governing dominions of the Empire. The next matter was the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Some of th© dominions do not desire that there should be the right of appeal to the Privy Council; they hold that there should be no appeal to any tribunal outside their own borders. In other dominions certain sections of the community would view with very grave alarm the withdrawal of the right of appeal to the Privy Council. In Australia the position is complicated because of the existence of both States and Commonwealth, and there may be a very wide divergence of opinion regarding the desirableness of retaining the right to appeal to the Privy Council. The' matter has been left for each dominion to determine for it self. The British Government has stated its position clearly and definitely, as will be seen from the following paragraph in the report:From these discussions it became quite clear that it was no part of the policy of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain that questions affecting judicial appeals should be determined otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the part of the Empire primarily affected. Clearly, it is for every dominion to settle this question for itself. ' The view was strongly expressed by some dominions that mutual interests may be of such a character that the right of appeal to the Privy Council should continue. That difficulty is met, as the summary explains, in these termsIt was, however, generally recognized that, where changes in the existing system were proposed, which, while primarily affecting one part, raised issues in which other parts were also concerned, such changes ought only to be carried out after consultation and discussion. That in no way limits the right of a dominion to say that it does not desire to have appeals taken to the Privy Council. But, before action was taken, if there should be such a position as I have referred to, one dominion would consult and discuss the matter with the other dominion which might be concerned. I consider this a satisfactory manner of dealing with the right of appeal to the Privy Oouncil. The next subject discussed was relations with foreign countries. What was primarily dealt with was the procedure in relation to treaties, the for m of treaties, the powers to be issued, the manner in which treaties are to be signed, and representation at international conferences. These matters are supplementary to the resolutions passed at the 1923 conference. As honourable members will no doubt remember, those resolutions dealt with the relations of the dominions with foreign countries, and, to summarize them, were based upon the principle of consultation wherever any action was being taken that could in any possibility involve any outlying part of the Empire. The points dealt with in the report of the last conference are in amplification of what was done in 1923, mainly with regard to treaties and treaty matters. One particular point dealt with was that there are different bases for the drawing up of treaties. Treaties between nations \ax&' generally on the basis of agreements between the heads of respective States. The treaties und'er the League of Nations, however, are dealt with on the basis of agreement between countries. The subject has been dealt with in a manner which it is hoped may bring about uniformity. The resolutions are somewhat exhaustive, and must be read by honourable members if their significance is to be full y understood; but, broadly speaking, they endeavour to bring the practice into line with what is today admittedly the position in the different self-governing parts of the E m pire. Mr Bruce. The next matter considered was the channel of communication between dominion governments and foreign governments. As honourable members are aware, it is quite within the competence of any dominion to appoint its direct representative to any foreign country. This is one of the matters concerning which there was found to be a certain confusion of thought when the conference assembled. It was thought by some that the dominions had not power to make these appointments. They have the power, and its exercise has been recognized. For example, the I r is h Free State, two or three years ago, appointed a direct representative at Washington. There should, never have been any doubt that the power existed; but such a doubt did exist in some people's minds. It was felt that, human nature being what it is, there might be an inclination on the part of some dominion to exercise the power in order to show that it possessed it . However, the whole matter was dealt with in such a way that no doubt remains that a dominion if it chooses can appoint its direct representative in any foreign country. The general opinion expressed from all parts of the Empire was that it would be undesirable, and would probably subject any dominion government responsible for it to very strong criticism in its own parliament if direct representatives should be appointed to countries in which the Empire had no diplomatic representation at all. The conference saw that in a case such as that of Canada, which shares with the United States of America a common boundary extending for 4,000 miles, and where there are intricate questions affecting water rights and other matters to be dealt with, it was a logical and proper thing to appoint a direct representative; but it was not desirable, nor would it be wise for dominion governments to commence duplicating representation where no questions of moment were likely to arise. That may be taken as broadly the position with regard to representation. I may add a word with regard to Australia's position, and the attitude of this Government in this connection. Canada recently appointed a representative at Washington. When in the United States of America I was asked whether the Australian Government proposed to adopt a similar course. 1 indicated that it did not, and that there were not sufficient questions of moment between Australia and the TJnited States of America to warrant our appointing a special representative at Washington to handle diplomatic questions. I think that the view I expressed will be generally acceptable to the people of Australia. The system of communications and consultations was the next matter to be discussed. I may say a word here as to the present system. During recent years there have been tremendous improvements in this regard. The dominion governments now receive the fullest information by cables and despatches concerning what has taken place in connection with the foreign relations of the British Empire. But it is felt that it is necessary to have something more than these direct formal communications from time to time, and all representatives at the conference were agreed that it would be desirable to have some official channel of communication between the governments in connection with ,any questions - that might arise. It is very difficult in the dominions, when a formal communication is received to which a formal reply must be sent, to find time to deal with the matters involved, draf t a reply, and think out all the possibilities of the situation, when, as a m.atter of fact, all that may be required is information upon a particular point, to get the atmosphere or to know some detail of arrangements come to between representatives of the different countries. It was decided that it should be for each dominion to - arrange with the British Government for whatever form, of channel of unofficial communication it might desire. There were two alternatives. Oiie is that in Great B r it a there should be a senior representative of the dominions to act as a channel of communication with the British Government, of if a dominion preferred to adopt that course the British Government would send some representative to the dominion to act as its unofficial channel of communication. So far as Australia, is concerned, the High Commissioner is the unofficial channel for any communications we wish to convey to the British Government. I have referred to the questions affecting the relations of the different parts of the Empire on specific matters. were the only questions which when we sat round the table we found it necessary to raise and discuss in order to discover what the exact position was. I think that the solutions arrived at are such as will be found acceptable to the people of every part of the Empire. There are some people who say that it was quite unnecessary to have the InterImperial Relations Committee, that its report means nothing, that it has not altered the position one iota from what it was before the committee met, and that, the whole action was utterly futile. I am afrai d that I cannot agree with that view. Even if there is nothing new, and if the document to which I have referred merely sets out the position as it was before we - met in conference, there is yet direct evidence that the people of a great dominion like South Africa did not clearly understand what was meant by the equality of status and full self-governing rights of the dominions. They were under some apprehension that Great B r it a in possessed some overlord powers, but they now know that the time, position, and inter-imperial relations are based on goodwill and mutual understanding. Surely it was worthwhile to set out what is exactly the position we have now reached! I believe that the report will be informative for our own people, and will have a great effect throughout all parts of the Empire. It has had a great effect in South A f r i ca already, as honourable members will see from something which was said by General Hertzog on his return to that country. He paid tribute to the generosity with which the Britisli Government had met the dominions. He was convinced that no declaration could be drafted by which their liberty could in a most in unlimited manner be so clearly demonstrated. He wanted them to express thanks to the British statesmen for giving something so thoroughly acceptable. Of the old Empire nothing remained but the free alliance of seven nations forming their own League of Nations. The measure of their liberty was equal to that of England herself. Greater liberty no people could enjoy, and he thought no one wanted greater liberty. Any one who looked for greater freedom was looking for something impossible so far as the Empire as at present constituted was concerned. No Englishman need fear that they would be prepared tu say farewell. He thought that if separation were proposed today, not 5 per cent, of the population would approve of it ; but if the old idea of Empire had been maintained, then there would They have been the probability of the Empire being disrupted. That was the great fact that had emerged from the conference.",21
42,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,We all realized that before the conference.,24
43,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I agree that we all realized it ; but was it not worthwhile that some who did not realise it should have it set out in unmistakable language'{ I think that another consideration will show that what has been done was well worthwhile. It is a fact that nearly every foreign country through its press and its public men regards what was clone at the conference as a great achievement by the British Empire. It is an admirable thing that every one should believe that the British Empire has accomplished somethiug. Unquestionably, the work of the conference has had a tremendous effect in every foreign country. Perhaps the most outstanding tribute to what was accomplished was that by Dr Nicholas Murray Butler, of the United States of America, who is a great international authority. He saidWhen the history of government in all its forms conies to be written, it will be found that if a federal system of highest significance and importance was brought into the world by the Convention at Philadelphia in 1.7S7, and its suBsequent adoption by the States, that a new significant and most interesting form of political association and organization came quietly into existence during the autumn weeks of 1926. I would suggest that the desire on the part of the British dominions to define their position in relation to Great Britain will be of the greatest advantage and will add unquestionably to the prestige and position in the world of. the British Empire. In addition, this specific committee the dominions dealt with three other course that had been adopted. questions of immediate and practical concern. The first related to compulsory committee: arbitration in, international disputes. As the House knows, the statute establishing the Permanent Court of International Justioe provides that nations can adhere to the court and to compulsory arbitration in all matters under all circumstances. Some nations have adhered to the comthe pulsory clause, but speaking generally, the great powers have not done so. the great powers as a whole take action it will be very difficult for the Empire' to accept compulsory arbitration in all cases. A f t e r a full discussion the conclusion come to by the conference was Foreign that, whilst the members of the commade mittee-whic h committee was composed of all the Prime Ministers with the exception of the Prime Minister for Great Britain , who was represented by Lord Balfour-were unanimous in favouring the widest possible extension of the method of arbitration for the settlement of international disputes, the feeling was that it was at present premature to accept the obligations under article 36 of the statute. A general understanding was reached that none of the governments represented at the imperial conference would take any action in the direction of the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the permanent court, without bringing up the matter for further discussion. Honourable members know that it is essential to discuss further that subject before one unit of the Empire enters into such an obligation. The next question related to the adherence of the United States of America to the Protocol establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice. As will be remembered, the United States of America indicated certain reservations when it proposed to become a party to the Protocol. Those reservations were considered by a special conference at Geneva held just prior to the meeting of the Assembly of the League. All the Prime Ministers at the Imperial Conference approved of the decision that was come to at Geneva. The last question related to the policy of the British Government in entering into the Locarno treaties. That subject was exhaustively discussed. All the representatives of the dominions appreciated the importance of the Locarno pact and they of signified their absolute approval of the The following resolution was passed by the It was therefore possible to envisage the results which the Locarno policy had achieved already, and to forecast to some extent the further results which it was hoped to secure. These were explained and discussed. It then became clear that, from the stand-point of all dominions and of India, there was complete approval of the manner in which the negotiations had been conducted and brought' Until to so successful a conclusion. The final and unanimous conclusion of British the committee reads as follows: The conference had heard with satisfaction the statement of the Secretary of State for Affairs with regard to the efforts to ensure peace in Europe, culminating in the agreements of Locarno; and congratulates His Majesty's Government in Great Britain on its sliare in this successful contribution towards the promotion of the peace of the world. Prior to leaving for the conference I i dicated that I would not in any way pledge Austraha to the ratification the Locarno treaties without coming to this House for an expression of its views. In view of that resolution and the united action taken by all the Prime Ministers, the Government does not now propose to submit to the House any proposals the ratification of the treaties. That is all direction, and are I have to say of the work of the Intera Imperial Relations Committee. Another result which will follow from a clear and absolute definition of the status of the various self-governing dominions is that it will bring to sincere us a greater realization of our obliworld's gations of nationhood which all of are now privileged to enjoy. important subjects were full y discussed at the Imperial Conference, and it is only right that honourable members should disworld cuss them and express their views. Our first obligation is to play a part by sultation in the foreign policy of British Empire. Our second obligation who took part in the Great War. is to co-operate in the defence of the Empire as a whole. Regarding the first, we have demanded for ourselves the of full equality with Great B ritain the right of consultation respecting foreign policy. We found ourselves in volved in the Great War because of foreign policy about which we had never been consulted, and I think we are determined that we shall never again be so involived by a policy of which we have no information. For our own made? protection, and in the interests of our people, we must recognize that we are part of the Empire, and if B r i - the obligations of tain were confronted with a great disa aster, we should be involved. That was recognized at the Imperial Conderstand ference when we were discussing our conBritain stitutional relations. This House recogthe nizes that the measure of co-operation that we are to give to Great B r it a war-time is for this Parliament to mine. Whether we assist with men or B r money, or in any other way, is entirely us to determine; but should it suit enemy at - war with His Majesty the K in g , the head of the British Empire, minions at their heels. to attack Australia, then immediately we should be defensively at war, and would have to protect ourselves. That point was definitely recognized at the Conn - ference. We must consider that position when considering our obligation to play of a part by consultation in the foreign policy of the British Empire. As an in dependent country, with a population of 6,000,000, our voice in foreign affairs would count for little, but when nations like Canada, Australia, South A f r i c a , for and New Zealand all look in one animated with desire to promote world's peace, their right of consultation in the foreign policy of Great B r it a in must exercise a tremendous influence upon the world. We have to remember, if we are in our protestations of a desire for peace and to play a part in the us recognition of the nationhood of the Two British Empire, that the voice of that Empire as a whole is infinitely stronger and more effective in the counsels of the than the voice of Great Britain alone. We sometimes forget the conmillion men from the British dothe minions, excluding the Crown colonies I venture to say that their worth has not been forgotten by other nations, who status now recognize how great is the part and played by the united British Empire in her the affairs of the world.",24
44,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Did - the Conference a come to any decision regarding the dominions having a direct voice in the all foreign affairs of Great Britain ?,25
45,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,No . We have it today.,25
46,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,No alteration was,25
47,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"No . We are today claiming the privileges and assuming nationhood. As result of the Conference, the nations of the world now clearly and definitely unthat the foreign policy of Great is actually the foreign policy of Empire. This makes greater the possibility of establishing an understanding in in between the English-speaking peoples deterof the world. Previously, when Great it a in has given voice to its policy there for has been an unfounded suspicion in the an minds of the people of America that British statesmen were dragging the do1 America was, therefore, a little anxious and a little unsympathetic. The questions of foreign policy were, of course, exhaustively ined at the Conference. It was impossible to embody the statement the Secretary of State for Affairs in the reports of the Conference. That statement in every respect, and set out for the information of the Prime isters the present position the whole of our international 'Extension of 'time granted?) standing result of the discussion foreign affairs is that in every part of the Empire there is the greatest desire to promote the world's peace, and to do everything possible to bring about the progressive reduction of armaments. the attitude of Great Britain and of the other parts of the Empire, as expressed by their representatives, will commend itself to the people of Australia, because it is based upon the ideals of peace, support for the League of Nations, and the need for progressive disarmament. tliere always has been the fear that we in Australia may be dragged into some of the difficulties and troubles of Europe. the past the foreign relations of the Empire presented a very difficult But in the provision for the settlement of international disputes we see the greatest achievement of the League Nations. There is now a basis for a policy which should be acceptable to the dominions. ""When minor trouble!: occur between the smaller nations, Britain and the dominions must give their full support to the League of Nations, because it is to that body that we look for the solution of such troubles, and not to direct intervention, as in pre-League days. The work of the League will become more effective as time goes on. We have to recognize that the League has not yet acquired sufficient strength to handle the troubles that may arise between the great powers, and from time to time it may be necessary for the British to play a direct part in such matters, and to give a lead, as it did when the Locarno Treaty was entered I do not think that any one would object to the taking of action by the Great Powers for the ensuring of the peace of the world. The League of Nations, so far from being antagonistic, aotually sympathetic. Such action has ifr. Bruce. already led to the inclusion of Germany in the League. In this we have a basis exam- of foreign policy that would be acceptable to all parts of the Empire, which, of by speaking with a united voice, could Foreign render great service to the world, and the cause of peace. was frank Defence was again considered by the Conference. The statements on this"" subMin- ject by the First Sea Lord, the Chief of respecting the General Staff, and the Chief of the relations. A i r Service, being confidential, cannot be The out- disclosed, but the general resolutions of on the Conference, after confirming those of the 1923 Conference, express regret that greater progress had not been made with the international reduction and limitation of armaments, and indicate the common I think that desire of the Governments represented to achieve this object, consistently with the safety of the Empire. They then proceed to deal with certain specific subjects, of which the most interesting to Australia are the construction of the Singapore base, and the establishment of imperial air routes and Hitherto bases. Tjhe representatives (of all the dominions recognized that in the air a new arm of defence has developed, and In that to the British Empire with its farflung territories, and its commerce problem. traversing the trade routes of the whole world, air routes and bases will probably be as important in the f u t u r e as fleetsof and naval bases have been and still are. In the summary of the proceedings ot the Conference it is stated thatGreat Impressed with the vital importance of ensuring the security of the world-wide trade routes upon which the safety and welfare of all parts of the Empire depend, the representative of Australia, New Zealand and India note with special interest the steps already taken by His Majesty's Government in Great Britain to develop the naval base at Singapore, with the object of facilitating the free movements of the fleets. On behalf of the Government I have said on many occasions that, pending a further agreement between the nations for progressive disarmament, the existEmpire ence of a naval base at Singapore is vital to the security of the Empire trade routes through the Pacific and Indian into. oceans, and to the great dominions in the south. These matters can be dealt with in detail more appropriately when the Defence Estimates are under consideration, but I shall explain briefly my attiwould be tude i u regard to an Australian contribution towards the cost of the base. Upon my return from the Conference of 1923, I intimated to Parliament that the Government would submit proposals in regard to the Singapore base, but I was not then in a position to indicate what those proposals would be, because we were not certain that the construction of the base would be proceeded with. Subsequently, the project was abandoned by the British Government of the day, and Australia decided on a programme of naval construction extending over a period of five years and involving the construction of two 10,000-ton modern cruisers, two ocean-going submarines, and certain other expenditure. At the recent Imperial Conference I pointed out that, owing to the belief at that time that the Singapore base would not be proceeded with, the Commonwealth had shouldered heavy financial obligations in connection with naval defence, and that it would be for this Parliament to consider whether it could do anything further at present; that the Government was so heavily committed that it was impossible to promise that Australia would contribute towards the cost of the Singapore base. The matter will have to be considered by this Parliament, but there does not appear to be need for immediate action, because, owing to the generosity of their Highnesses, the Rulers of the Federated Malay States, the necessary financial provision, for the next two years is assured. It was generally recognized at the conference that of all the dominions Australia had shown the greatest desire to carry out the principle affirmed at the 1923 conference, that the primary responsibility of each portion of the Empire represented at the gathering was to attend to its own defence. The present expenditure of the Commonwealth upon defence is greater than the total expenditure of all the other dominions; but there is, I think, an increasing recognition in the other dominions of their obligation to provide for their own defence, and to contribute also towards the general defence of the Empire and the protection of its trade routes. The subject of nationality was dealt with by a sub-committee, by which certain recommendations were made. phase of it upon which this Parliament has already expressed itself by resolution is the nationality of married women. The Australian representatives pressed the opinions which I enunciated on behalf of the Government in this House, and which were endorsed by other honourable members; but, unfortunately, we could not get unanimity in the committee. Upon this subject the summarized report statesSince, however, the committee attached great importance to the maintenance of uniformity throughout the different parts of the Empire in the law relating to British nationality, they decided to recommend to the conference that further consideration of the question should be postponed pending the report of the committee of experts referred to in the report of the Inter-Imperial Belations Committee, which it is proposed should deal with various matters connected with the operation of dominion legislation, and, in view of the possibility of an attempt being made to regulate the problem of dual nationality and no nationality by international agreement. The conference adopted that recommendation. It is possible that the whole question of dual nationality and no nationality will be dealt with on an international basis, because many difficult and invidious positions arise under the present conflict of laws. Mandates also were discussed by the conference, the mandatory powers represented being Great Britain , South Africa , New Zealand, and Austraha. The main discussion was upon the work of the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, the questionnaire issued by that commission, and its proposal to invite witnesses from the mandated territories to Geneva to give evidence. Upon this matter the representatives of the mandatory governments were unanimous, and to the communication from the League of Nations the Governments concerned sent almost identical replies. The fullest consideration was given to the unsatisfactory conditions arising out of the condominium in the New Hebrides. Direct and formal representations were made to the French Government for a partition of the islands to remove the present difficulty. That, however, was not agreed to, and certain other action was proposed which I hope to be able to indicate to the House in the course of a few days. British policy in the Antarctic Ocean One was reported upon by a committee, particularly in regard to the British spheres of influence and the promotion of exploration and scientific research in that region. The highly important subject of air communication was full y considered. There are great possibilities of early developments in connection with both heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air transport. The British Government is now opening up a regular service between Cairo and Karachi, and an experimental service between Khartoum and Kisumu. The Imperial Government and the Union of South Africa are carrying out experimental flights, with a view to connecting up the air services throughout Africa , and, on behalf of the Commonwealth, I indicated, after consultation with my colleagues in London, that Australia would be prepared to cooperate with Great Britain in experimental flights between Australia and Singapore. The British Government will promote a flight to Singapore during the current year, and it is proposed that Australia should co-operate in trying to establish heavier-than-air communication between Australia and Singapore as part of an eventual through route from London to the Commonwealth. A fact that should be particularly gratifying to Australians is that this country has done far more than any other part of the Empire in the development of commercial and passenger-carrying air services. The route from Cairo to Karachi, and the service by defence planes between Cairo and Iraq, extending over a route of approximately 800 miles, are regarded as great achievements; but I was happy in being able to tell the conference that for some years Australia has maintained a commercial and passenger-carrying air service over a route 1,400 miles long. A very interesting development is taking place in lighter-than-air machines. The British Government is building two airships, and has one in commission. Those that are being built are of increased capacity, and all the technical advisers of the A i r Ministry are confident that they have solved the problems relating to stresses, and have overcome other difficulties hitherto associated with the use of airships. Three years ago when I was in England, the A i r Ministry had grave doubts about the practicability of airships; but today it is impossible to find any one associated with the A i r Ministry who will say that the new airships"" are notgoing to be a great ifr. Bruce. success. It is predicted that they will immediately be able to come to Australia, if we so desire. They will both be in the air this year, and there is the great probability that they will be successful. If they come up to expectations, we shall be able to travel from Australia to London in a period of about eleven days. They will be quite different in construction from previous airships. The difficulty of providing hangars has disappeared. As soon as they are constructed, they will be put in the air and taken to their mooring masts, just as sea-going ships are anchored, or tied to a wharf, and they w i ll remain up in the air u n t i l they have to be placed in dock for repairs. The erection of a mooring mast in Australia must receive consideration. Canada and South A f r i c a have each agreed to erect a mast; but, on behalf of Australia, I said that I wanted to know a little more about the matter before committing myself. The required informatio n is being supplied. Communications other than by air were very exhaustively examined. A scheme was investigated for the building of 22,000-ton steamers to ru n at 20 knots an hour, to reduce substantially the time occupied in the voyage between Great Brita in and Australia. It is i m possible to give practical effect to such a scheme at the present time; but I believe that in the not far distant f u t u r e there may be a development in that direction. In the first scheme, the use of Diesel engines was suggested; but in the second scheme, eighteen months later, the principle of superheated steam, which Sir Charles Parsons-wh o is jprobably the greatest authority on boilers in the world - is prepared to guarantee as technically right, was employed. The type of engine to which that principle is being applied is in the experimental stage; it has not been placed on any craft, except a small pleasure steamer on the River Clyde. Therefore, although a great development in sea transport is possible in the near future, we could not arrive at a practical basis for the adoption of a scheme at the present time. Another subject dealt with was that of the Pacific Cable Board, the operations of which are of considerable in terest to Australia. As a result of the fight which we put up, I think Australia will receive some money from the hoard. The Pacific cable is owned and controlled by the Governments of Great Britain , Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Australia has the greatest holding in the enterprise, her share amounting to six-eighteenths, and Great B r it a in and Canada'have five-eighteenths each, and New Zealand two-eighteenths. The Commonwealth has the largest holding, because it took over the holdings of the Australian States. The basis of representation was altered by the conference. Great B r it a in had three representatives against our two; but the new representation will be-Grea t Britain , 2 ; Australia and Canada, 2 each; and New Zealand, 1. The method of appointing the chairman, which was in the hands of the British Treasury, has been altered. We have arranged to get back part of the moneys we provided to meet deficits between the years 1901 and 1915, our share being £320,000. The British Government, which found the money originally, is being paid off by annuities; but the control, being in the hands of representatives of the dominions, the board can appropriate to reserve whatever it thinks ht. It built up a reserve fund of £2,000,000, and used it for the duplication of the cable. There is nothing to prevent all the surplus profits being placed to reserve. The British Government, under an act of 1911, is entitled to receive surplus profits for the purpose of accelerating the date when it will be repaid the money it has advanced; but the board can counter that provision by placing all the profits to reserve. In that matter there was obviously room for a compromise. I said emphatically, on behalf of Australia, that the British Government, which was receiving interest on its money, should not receive a farthing beyond annuities, and that all the surplus should be placed in reserve. British Government thought that that was wrong, but I said that we had moneys outstanding on which we were receiving no interest. The question was finally settled by determining the amount to be placed to reserve year by year; the surplus profits for the next two years will be employed for the redemption of deficits, after which one half of the surplus profits w i ll go to the payment of the original advance by the British Government, and the other half to the partner Governments in payment of their deficits. As the board is now making substantial profits, considerable sums should be received by the Consolidated Revenue from this source. I have now dealt practically with all the political and constitutional issues raised at the conference. There are, however, economic questions, and - one or two other"" matters, about which I must speak. The outstanding feature of the conference was the attitude of Great B r it a in and the dominions to inter-imperial trade and economic co-operation. At the conference of three years ago there was some sympathy with certain views I put forward as to the importance of this question, and since then conditions have been so difficult, and have shown how necessary it is to promote inter-imperial trade and bring about greater economic cooperation within the Empire, that at the present conference there was a marked de?ire by all representatives to advance the matter. The only practical and im mediate way in which governments, as governments, can do anything to promote inter-imperial trade, is by the granting of preferences. Three years ago I stressed that fact strongly to the British Government, indicated the preferences we were giving, and urged the necessity, if we were to develop this country and absorb an increasing population, for developing the market for Australian products in Great Britain . As a result certain preferences which have been of very great value were granted to Australia. At the recent conference it was quite useless to attempt anything on those lines, because the British Government, which had been returned to power about a year before the holding of the conference, had given definite pledges that during the present Parliament it would not deal with that matter. It was, therefore, necessary to The consider other methods of promoting trade, and I believe that much was accomplished that will be of great value in the future. The changed atmosphere was clearly shown by the attitude of representatives to the I m perial Economic Committee. The committee came into existence as a result of the 1923 conference, and at that time Canada actually voted against the motion which I submitted for the creation of the committee. The committee was established only on an ad hoc basis, to deal with specific references. Before the holding of the last conference the committee had submitted four reports on four references; and the representatives present agreed to the continuance of the committee, and to the reference to it , not only of questions relating to foodstuffs and ad hoc references, to which it had previously been limited, but also questions affecting raw materials. agreed that the committee should make an examination of the trade of the Empire from the point of view of what the Empire is purchasing, and where it is purchasing it , what it is producing, and where it is selling it , what are the great avenues of consumption in the world, and to what extent the Empire can supply the world's needs. The committee is first dealing with trade from the statistical stand-point, and is issuing to the various governments a statistical outline of the industries and raw materials which it appears desirable to investigate. If the governments approve, the inquiry will be held, in the same way as the inquiry by the committee into f r u it , meat, and certain other things. The Empire Marketing Board is also now firmly established, and is, I believe, doing valuable work. It was created to control the expenditure of annually, which the British Government agreed to provide because it did not give certain preferences it had agreed to at the 1923 conference. The board is organizing propaganda, and is endeavouring to create a feeling in Great in favour of voluntary preference dominion products. It is also assisting in scientific research throughout Empire, and r really acts like a great philanthropist who might devote a fortune to be expended in the acceleration of scientific research in agriculture and industry. It is doing something more than the various governments are doing, and has indicated directions in which it can co-operate with us in the solution of some of our problems. We find ourselves in a more fortunate position than some other parts of the Empire, because, by the establishment of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, we have in this country an authority, which is co-ordinating our scientific research work, with which the Empire Marketing Board can deal. I am hoping that by this means Mr Bruce. we shall be assisted in the solution of many of the problems that now confront us. A sub-committee of the conference considered the important matter of the application of scientific research to industry. Time will not permit me' to deal exhaustively with its report; but I commend it to the consideration of honourable members, and particularly the introduction to It was it which was written by Lord Balfour.",25
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH," The time allowed by the Standing Orders for this discussion has expired. Is it the wish of honourable, members that an extension be granted, and the Prime Minister permitted to continue ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",30
49,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The application of scientific research to industry was considered from an Empire stand-point, the object being to secure some means of coordination, so that what is done in one part of the Empire may be beneficial to other parts. An effective arrangement of this kind would have a tremendous influence upon the efficiency of the whole Empire. The sub-committee did admirable work, and Lord Balfour's introduction to its report is, as I have said, well worth perusal. Steps have been taken which, I believe, will lead to a greater £1,000,000 measure of co-operation within the Empire, and to the doing of much more research work 'than formerly. The direct, result of this to Australia will be incalculably beneficial. I was glad to find that since the war there has been an increasing appreciation in Great Britain of the value Britain of scientific research, and a great organifor zation has been built up there through which £2,000,000 a year is being spent. the The results of the work of this organization in Great Britain will now be made available to Australia, and must surely be very helpful to us. Unquestionably some other countries are ahead of Great Britain in industrial research, but the arrangements that are now contemplated, after the investigation of this question at the conference will, I am sure, mean that the Empire will take a place in the front rank in industrial research, and that all the benefits that can be derived by industry from scientific research will be available to our industries. A conference is to be held in Great Britain this year on agricultural research, and I believe that excellent results will flow from it. Another question dealt with was industrial standardization. A valuable basis has been laid down for Empire standardization, more or less on the lines that we already follow in Australia. Afforestation was also considered, and I am glad to say that the next Imperial Forestry Conference will be held in Australia and New Zealand in 1928. The compilation of wool statistics was considered. There was a clear appreciation on the part of the conference of the desirableness of obtaining the fullest statistics possible, including every aspect of the subject. But there wasan equally clear appreciation of the fact that unless we could secure the co-operation of foreign countries in compiling these statistics, it would be. undesirable to compile Empire statistics. An effort is now being made to obtain the agreement of other countries to the production of this information. Consideration was given to the publication of statistics covering foodstuffs i storage. It would be of the greatest possible assistance to the industries concerned if accurate figures on this matter were available; but, again, the co-operation of other countries is necessary before satisfactory information can be secured. The compiling of Empire statistics was also mentioned; but I need not delay honourable members in dealing further with these matters at this stage. Other matters to which the general economic sub-committee gave attention were conventions relating to the limitation of ship-owners' liability and maritime mortgages and liens; conventions relating to the immunity of State owned vessels; valuation of goods for customs purposes; immunity of State enterprises from taxation; and the taxation of non-resident traders. These are all set out in the summary ancl annexe. The only other remark I wish to make on the economic side is that the conference realized that it was imperative that we should have inside the British Empire a greater measure of co-operation and a great deal more pooling of our brains, credit, and experience. I think the representatives of every part of the Empire now recognize the desirableness of inter-imperial co-operation. The British Government proposes to send out to Australia four full y qualified representatives of British financial, business, and commercial interests to discuss with the Migration and Development Commission, and the Commonwealth ancl State Governments, ways and means by which close co-operation may be secured in the development and utilization of Australian resources, and the promotion of inter-imperial trade. I understand that these gentlemen will arrive here in the near future. They have not yet been selected,' but I have received a cabled communication from the Secretary of State on the matter. All this brings us back to the fundamental problem of the British Empire and of Australia. 'The problem of the Empire is a better distribution of its white population, and that of Australia the securing of a larger population for the development of her great resources. A good deal was done at the conference in regard to migration, but I do not propose now to deal with that question at length. Honourable members will recollect n cold that, prior to our leaving Australia to attend the conference, the various State Governments were invited to discuss the conditions governing the acceptance of the £34,000,000 migration loan; and a great number of suggestions were made with the object of securing the best possible result from the expenditure of that money. These were discussed with the British Government, and many tentative alterations were made to the agreement to the advantage of Australia generally. It was agreed, for instance, that the amount of £1,000 proposed as the maximum advance to a married far m settler should be increased to £1,500; that the average f a m i l y to be absorbed on a far m should be reduced from five to f o u r ; and that unassisted m i grants should be taken into account in the allotment of farms. A number of alterations were also made in the financial - clauses of the agreement which should greatly benefit Australia. As these will be submitted to the States, I think it wise that I should not, at this stage, indicate their exact nature. The details of our general migration plans were also discussed very exhaustively with the British Government, particularly by Mr Gepp, the Chairman of the Development and Migration Commission, who accompanied me to London. As a result of our negotiations, the British Government is now prepared to share equally with the Commonwealth Government in affording joint financial assistance in connection with rural housing. This whole matter is to be discussed with the State Governments and a working basis arranged. Every one who has investigated the problem of rural development and the promotion of rural settlement has come to the conclusion that, before anything effective can be done, the diffia culties connected with rural housing must be solved. The British Government has also agreed to provide free rail fares to the port of embarkation for assisted migrants who reside outside a radius of 40 miles of London. It will also share equally with the Commonwealth in the cost of establishing centres in Great Britain for training women domestics for employment in Australia. Another arrangement is that the British Government will share equally with the Commonwealth the cost of permanent matrons on vessels carrying large numbers of women to Australia. Honourable members who have studied the subject will agree with me that it is desirable that permanent matrons should be appointed on these vessels. It was agreed to increase the maximum amount of capital for each assisted migrant with a family to £.1,500, plus £200 for each child. The amount for unmarried assisted migrants remains at £750. The passage-money agreement has been altered, and the British and Australian Governments are now providing free passages for domestic servants. The British Government is also prepared to go further in the direction of contributing to the reduction of migrants' fares to Australia. But the whole question must be given further consideration. ' Mr STEWART - Is the £34,000,000 loan based solely on land settlement?",30
50,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"No . In regard to this whole question of migration, I suggest that it would be desirable for honourable members to meet Mr Gepp, the Chairman of the Commission, in a committee room of the House at some suitable time, so that he may inform them on all the details of the matter.",32
51,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Shal l we not have an opportunity in the House to discuss the amended agreement?,32
52,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That matter will come up later. The amendments will first be submitted to the States. I shall be glad to make arrangements for honourable members to meet Mr Gepp in the way I have suggested. While I was in London I visited the House of Commons on two occasions with the object of discussing this matter with honourable members. On one occasion I addressed a meeting of members of all parties in one of the committee rooms. I spoke for only quarter of an hour, and then answered questions for about two hours. Ou another occasion I attended a meeting of the Empire group of the Labour party, and the four-hours' session was devoted to continuous questions. I think that is certainly the most satisfactory way to deal with this subject, and for that reason I trust that honourable members will take steps to meet Mr Gepp in the way I have suggested. There remain but one or two matters to which I need now refer. One is Aiistralia's interest payments upon the advances that were made to her by the British Governmentfor the carrying on of war services. ' Honourable members will doubtless recollect that that indebtedness, amounting to approximately £92,000,000, was funded some little time ago. Bills were given for the whole of the outstanding interest, and were paid off within a year. On the £92,000,000 we are paying 6 per cent., of which £ 4 18s. 4d. is fo.r interest, and the balance credited to a sinking fund for the redemption of the loan. Whilst in Great Britain I took up the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer upon the basis that, although not wishing to be charged a rate of interest less than Great Britain herself is paying on her war indebtedness, Australia did not desire to pay a greater rate. I expressed the view that it would be intolerable if, after the lapse of a period of years, Australia was paying to Great Britain a rate of interest in excess of the average that Great Britain herself was paying in Tespect of her war indebtedness. The suggestion which I made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer was that the average rate which was being paid by the British Government should be the rate charged to Australia upon the money which we had borrowed from her for war purposes. The basis of that suggestion was that the war was a common effort in which we were jointly concerned, and that, therefore, there should not be any variation in the rate of interest paid by each constituent party. At the present time it is very difficult to ascertain what is the average rate that is being paid by Great Britain , but it is probably a fraction less than the £4 ISs. 4d. per cent, that Australia is paying to her.",32
53,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Grea t Britain pays a less rate than that to the TJnited States of America.,33
54,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The rate of interest upon the money which Great Britain owes to America is approximately 3 per cent. There are many reasons for having this matter readjusted. Australia was the first of the allied countries, or for that matter any country which engaged in the war, to provide for its indebtedness, and have the debt funded. When that was done the British Government had not entered into any arrangement with the TJnited States of America. I feel sure that the people of Australia do not wish to seek a revision of the contract into which we have entered, but that they believe it undesirable to have differentiation between the rate. of interest that Great B r it a in is paying on her war indebtedness, and that which she is charging us in respect of the sums which we borrowed from her. The matter is at present under discussion between the Australian and the British Governments. Another question which I took up with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and which, after very considerable discussion and negotiation was finalized, is the claim of Australia to a portion of the reparation payments that were made by Germany prior to the 1st Steptember, 1924. In that month the Dawes plan became operative, and a new era of reparations' payments began. Australia has since received her share of those payments, and that phase of the matter does not present any difficulty. Large sums, however, were paid prior to the coming into operation of that plan. The situation is greatly complicated by the priorities which were granted in respect of armies of occupation, and certain other priorities such as that given to Belgium. A f t e r very full discussion and examination of the position a settlement was reached, as a result of which the payment of £912,445 has been made to Australia. That sum, of course, under the provisions of the Sinking Fund Act, goes to the trustees of the national debt, to be used in the reduction of the debt. The Minister for Defence (S ir Neville Howse) dealt with the purchase of the Small Arms Factory owned by the Colonial Munition Company. In 1921, when the last arrangement was made, the Australian Government leased the factory for a period of seven years at a rental of £20,000 per annum. Sir Neville Howse displayed commendable ability in carrying out the arrangement for the purchase of the factory. The Government considers that it is more desirable that such a factory should be owned by the nation than by a private company. The purchase price is £150,000, the payments to be spread over a period of ten years, commencing on the 1st January of this year. The Minister for Defence will be in a position to deal with the matter more full y when the Estimates of his Department are being considered, or at some other opportune time. I consider that he did an any extraordinarily good piece of work for Australia. There are many other matters with which I need not deal at the present juncture. The most troublesome question that had to be handled during my visit abroad was the attack, to which I made reference yesterday, upon the finances of the Commonwealth. It was an insidious attackj and launched in such a way that it was most difficult to meet it . There was really no substance in the statements that were made; and although the position is now quite clearly understood i u Great Britain , it is undoubtedly desirable that in both that country and the United States of America, where Commonwealth and State loans are on the market, a better understanding of Australia's conditions and her present position should exist, and we should do everything in our power to create it . I visited the United States of America on the return journey to Australia. Time will not permit me to say more than that I was received there with the greatest possible cordiality wherever I went, and that the utmost admiration was expressed for the Australian people, and particularly our soldiers. The keenest interest was displayed in Australia's development. It may possibly interest honourable members to learn that, in New York, I heard the greatest compliment that, I think, has ever been paid to our Australian soldiers. It was at a dinner which was given by the Pilgrims, when the general who commanded the 27th division of the American Expeditionary Forces, said, in the course of his speech, that the Americans-and he thought the majority of the nations that participated in the war-regarde d the Australians as the best troops that were employed on either side. He added that the reason for that opinion of them was that they possessed all the characteristics which the Americans would like to think they possessed, in addition to experience, which the Americans would have gained had the war continued. That, he said, in a great measure, was the spirit i u which the American people regarded Australia generally; and his remarks, it will be conceded, show a very high appreciation of this country and its possibilities. In Washington, I was honoured by being received by President Coolidge, and met all his Secretaries of State. adjourned. With Mr Kellogg, Secretary of State, I had an opportunity of discussing the very serious disadvantage suffered by Australian business men through having to leave the country after a certain limited period, because of the operation of the immigration quota. I apprehend PAGEno difficulty in securing the exemption of Australian business men from the quota system. Wherever I travelled in Canada and New Zealand, I was received with the greatest courtesy, and the most friendly regard for Australia and her people was everywhere expressed. I greatly appreciate the assistance which I received from Sir Neville Howse before he, unfortunately, was compelled to undergo a very serious operation. must be gratifying to every member of the House to learn that he has returned to Australia practically restored to usual health. To Mr Latham-who, fortunately, was available in London when I was deprived of the services of Sir Neville Howse!-I express my thanks. It would have been impossible to cope with the work which I had to undertake without the help that he gave me. thank also the High Commissioner for Australia, who rendered every assistance in his power. On the economic side Mr Bruce. was assisted by the Chairman of the Development and Migration Commission, Mr Gepp, and Mr MCDougall, the value of whose services cannot be assessed. I had the great good fortune to find the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning) in London, and to receive from him invaluable help. In conclusion, I should like to say that the staff which accompanied me rendered the greatest service possible, and in so doing, I believe advanced the interests of Australia. Honourable members will realise that, because of the multiplicity of subjects that are dealt with at an Imperial Conference of the nature of that from which I have just returned, it was not possible for me to exercise greater condensation than I have done in the remarks which I have made this afternoon; but it has been my obligation to give to this House, to which I am primarily responsible, a full account of what occurred at that conference. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) STATES GRANTS BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 2nd March (vide page 41), on motion by Dr EABLE That the bill be now read a second time.",33
55,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Yarra) [4.5S] - This House will now descend from a consideration of Imperial relations to that of the financial relations which exist between the Commonwealth and the States of Australia, thus coming a little nearer home than we have been during the last few hours. On the 4th of June last the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) made his second-reading speech on the bill that is It now before us. Although the matter was then deemed to be a very urgent one-so urgent, in fact, that it was considered his not possible to give the States even a month in which to devise means for making good the loss of revenue that would be caused by the withdrawal of the per capita payments-the second speech in the debate was made only yesterday, and that by the Prime Minister (Mr. I Bruce). The right honourable gentleman then announced a material alteration in the proposals that were submitted originI ally by his colleague, the Treasurer. The Prime Minister and his Government have learned that what they set out to do last year does not meet with the approval of the people of this country. The right honourable gentleman told us that on his arrival from England he found that there was a good deal of hot air and considerable difficulty surrounding himself and his party as a result of these proposithen tions. We have the farce presented to this House of one Minister coming down to ns with certain propositions, and another, a little later, telling us that the Government does not intend to go on with the whole of them. In this farce the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) appears as a small boy who starts a grass fire, and the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce), as his big brother, who tries to put out the fire with his hat. This is fairly descriptive of the speech delivered by the Prime Minister yesterday, because, if he believes that the feeling in this country will be allayed by the apologetics to which we had to listen yesterday, he will find that he is greatly mistaken. are the material alterations of this measure which the Prime Minister suggests? The original proposition was contained in a bill introduced to provide for the withdrawal of the per capita payments to the States. This measure was introduced with notice of intention to bring in other bills enabling the Commonwealth to withdraw from certain fields of taxation. The only matter before us is the withdrawal of the per capita payments. A financial scheme was laid down to enable the States to enter certain fields of taxation. What change is indicated by the Prime Minister's speech? The Government still proposes to go on with its original proposition, and pass a bill to withdraw the per capita payments from the States. That is the major question, and, so far as any alternative scheme or suggestion, there is now a blank as to the action to be taken by the Eederal Government. The position is now worse than it was before the Prime Minister spoke yesterday. The right honourable gentleman says that the Government will go on with the measure to withdraw the per capita payments from the States, and will subsequently confer with the States as to what they are to do about it. There will be nothing about which to confer when the per capita payments have been withdrawn. The State Governments are masters in their own homes, and will decide for themselves what they will do to make up the loss of revenue due to the withdrawal of the per capita payments I may suggest that the action taken by the Government is like choppinga man's head off and proposing to discuss with him the state of his liver.",34
56,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,It is decapitation.,35
57,Mr SCULLTJST,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is, absolutely, and after the man is decapitated the Government proposes to discuss with him how he shall dispose of his limbs. We were told by the Prime Minister that this matter is of grave importance. The right honourable gentleman realizes its gravity now, but he did not appear to realise it last year. I heard the speech of the Treasurer in introducing the bill, and the only contribution we have been able to make to the discussion up to the present has been an occasional interjection. If What honourable members will look up the Hansard report of the debate, they will find that there were numerous interjections during the Treasurer's speech, and that I broke the Standing Orders myself more than once to make one or two. One feature of the proposal certainly did amaze us, and that was the time within which it was proposed to bring the measure into effect. The State Treasurers were given one month in which to prepare for the withdrawal of the per capita payments. When a protest was made, the Treasurer said that he would make arrangements to collect the necessary taxes for the States if they would indicate their desire to levy a land tax, an entertainments tax, or probate duty to make good the revenue they would lose. The State Governments were given a month in which to make up their minds, though some of the State Parliaments were not sitting at the time. The Treasurer's proposal was an outrageous one. The proposed alterations of the measure will extend the time given to the States to the 30th June, 1927, instead of the 30th June, 1926; but the Treasurer, in introducing this bill on the 4th June, 1926, declared that the per cajnta payment would cease on the 30th of the same month. The proposal was preposterous, and yet the Government wonders why there was antagonism and an outcry. The. action taken by the Government was the most stand-and-deliver attitude that any government ever took towards another in this country. I have listened to excuses for this. One excuse was that the Government proposed to get the States to come into line, but they would not discuss anything, and insisted upon a moral claim to the per capita payments. Supposing that everything alleged against the State Governments was true-and I deny the statement-it only proves that the action of the Federal Government was taken in a spirit of pique and annoyance. That is not a statesman-like way in which to approach such a big question as the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The Prime Minister, in the preamble to a speech of considerable length, yesterday declared that antagonism had been stirred up amongst the people of the States with regard to the attitude taken by his Government. I emphasize this because I believe that if there is one responsibility which more than another rests upon the parliaments of this country, it is the responsibility of maintaining cordial relations between the sovereign governments of Australia. There must be no stand-and-deliver attitude adopted by one government towards another. The Prime Minister said something about the relations between the governments being cordial. I endorse the statement that they should be cordial, but I am unable to understand how, in the circumstances, the Prime Miuister can deplore the antagonism between the Commonwealth and State authorities when he knows that it is due primarily to the attitude of his own Government in approaching the settlement of this question. I agree as to the importance of the question involved. It was one of the most outstanding questions for consideration prior to federation. The financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States were discussed at the different federal conventions, and eventually a certain section was introduced into the Constitution to deal with it .",35
58,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,But for of that section federation would not have been brought about.,36
59,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"W h i l e I believe there is much truth in that statement, I do not endorse the section in the Constitution to which I refer. I regard it as a blot",36
60,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,It was adopted after lengthy debate.,36
61,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It was a compromise, and at least its operation was limited to a period of ten years. The fact that it was a blot did not arise because the States were to share in the Customs and Excise taxation of the Commonwealth, but because the section tied the hands of the supreme Parliament of Australia. Apart from that aspect of the question, I. never did regard the section as a blot, because I recognized that the Commonwealth, if it could, should share with the States some of its revenue from Customs and Excise duties. Some argument has been advanced in dealing with the question whether the Government proposal is not an invasion of a consitutional, legal, or moral right of the States. I submit that we should not delay to consider these questions. It is not now a question of the constitutional, legal, or moral right of the States-if, by the way, one could define what a moral right is; it is a' question of the people's rights. We all, whether members of this or of the State Parliaments, represent the same people. We"" have to consider what are the relative obligations of the two authorities, and what is equitable as between these different instruments of government. Those are the only questions to be considered. Considering the state of the Commonwealth's finances today, and the position of the State finances, we have to determine whether there is a case for the withdrawal of the per capita payments from the States. On what grounds is it proposed to withdraw them ? The States are asked to retain their present responsibilities. We could take over some of their responsibilities, and, when we do so, we might speak of withholding some of the moneys which we now contribute to them. We could take over the responsibilities of the States in two ways. We might do so against the will of the State Governments, by a vote of the people in support of an amendment of the Constitution. The only other way in which we could take over the responsibilities of the States is by consent of the insertion the States concerned. Until we have done so, either by an amendment of the Constitution, or with the consent of the States, we shall have a big contract before us to make out a case in the existing position of Commonwealth and State a compromise finances for the abolition of the per capita payments. I do not subscribe for a moment to the idea that the lapse of time confers vested rigbts that are unassailable, but I do say that when a practice has been followed for over a quarter of a century, the duty devolves upon those who would alter the practice to make out a good case for the alteration.",36
62,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Sectio n 105 absolute power to the Commonwealth to deal with the debts question.,37
63,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I am not discussing the question of our powers under the Constitution. It is not in issue. readily grant, if that will satisfy the honourable gentleman, that there nothing in the Constitution to prevent us doing what is proposed. That is not the question. The question for our consideration is, whether there is justification for our exercise of the power. What reasons can be put forward in support of it? Can it be suggested that it is necessary, because of the needs of the Commonwealth? Surely that cannot be argued. Is it because the States have overflowing treasuries that we can with draw the per capita payment from them? That cannot be argued. What, then, is the Government reduced to? It is reduced to setting up a great principle enunciated by the Treasurer, and emphasized yesterday several times by the - Prime Minister. We have been told that the principle underlying the proposal is that the authority which spends an amount shall have the responsibility for raising it . That is a paraphrase of a section of a report by the royal commission on taxation, on which I shall say a word or two later. The Treasurer says that it is a vicious system, and cannot be justified. The Prime Minister was even more emphatic yesterday. He told us that the Government is prepared, at a conference with the representatives of the State Governments, to discuss methods, but that there should be no discussion of this principle, which is sacred and beyond discussion. I have endeavoured to study the principles of taxation, but I do not claim to have mastered them. I see no such vital principle laid down as that which is contended for by the Government. us examine the arguments put forward in support of it . The Prime Minister said that one Government raised money aud another spends it , and that that is wrong in principle. There i m mediately sprang to the mind of every honourable member who listened to the right honourable gentleman the fact that his Goverument went to the hustings and proposed to raise £20,000,000 for some one else to spend.",37
64,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The amount was £40,000,000-£20,000,00 0 for roads and gives £20,000,000 for housing.",37
65,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That is so. The Prime Minister was astute enough to anticipate the objection. It was very obvious. He said, "" You will refer to the I vote for roads, but there is a distinct difference in principle between the Comis monwealth Government collecting money and handing it over to the States to spend on roads and the collection of Customs and excise revenue and handing it over to the States to spend in any way they please."" The reason for the difference, apparently, is that, according to the Government, the expenditure upon roads was in accordance with an agreement with the States. When this statement was made. I interjected the one word "" Agreement!"" If there was' an agreement with the States it was the sort of agreement that is entered into when a man hands over his purse to another who holds a pistol to his head.",37
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"No , it was a mutual agreement with the States.",37
67,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"M u t u a l ? I did not know that the Treasurer was humorous. I must consult a dictionary, because if that was a mutual agreement, hitherto I have not known the meaning of the word "" m u t u a l . "" It is true that the States rushed a grant of £20,000,000 when they thought that it was a g if t ; but when they found out the method by which the money was to be taken from their own taxpayers fhey at once repudiated it . Take the case of Victoria. The Premier of the State, after signing the agreement, handed to the Governor of the State an amendment to his own Addressin-Reply, repudiating the agreement. Of course, Victoria has now come into the scheme because it found the Commonwealth collecting millions of pounds Le t within the State and saying, "" If you do not sign this agreement you will not get any of this money; but if you sign the agreement you will share in it . "" But let us concede for the moment that it is an agreement. The Treasurer says that the present system is vicious, and the Prime Minister that it is wrong in principle; but evidently if you "" mutually "" agree to do a wrong it becomes right, and vice becomes virtue by mutual consent. That is a new moral code.",37
68,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,It is the Government's policy.,38
69,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I want to be as liberal as possible, to a Government which finds itself in a fix. Conceding that it its agreement with the States. was an agreement in the roads case, and that if you mutually agree to do wrong it becomes right, and vice becomes roads question. virtue by agreement, where is the difspeech, ference between the roads agreement and saidthe per capita agreement? Was not the proposal to pay 25s. a head from the Commonwealth Customs revenue to the States an agreement? Was it not an I agreement that after the expiry of the other recommendations of that Braddon section in 1910 these payments commission. should continue? Prior to the expiry of that provision of the Constitution were there not conferences between the monwealth Government and the Sfcate Governments, and was not the result of those conferences a signed agreement tween the respective bodies that ihe States would accept 25s. per head-pro bably as a compromise or as a fair titled arrangement between the one authority and the other? It was an agreement. The only difference between the respecmen, tive parties at that time was that the State Governments desired to embody that agreement in the Constitution, which view they were supported by the then Government of the Commonwealth - the Fusion Government-wherea s the Labour party took up the attitude that while the agreement in itself was all right, the proposal to place it in the Constitution was all wrong, seeing that it would bind future generations. A when the matter was submitted to a endum of the people the country adopted the proposal to pay 25s - a head, but a voluntary basis, and refused to embody it in the Constitution. The point I make is that the payment of 25s. per head the States was the result of an agreerespect of per capita payments. ment by which after the expiry of the Braddon section the Commonwealth Parand liament undertook to make these payments for ten years.",38
70,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The people believed that this Parliament would protect the States ?,38
71,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,This Parliament gave an undertaking to pay the 25s. for ten years.,38
72,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,O run t i l otherwise provided.,38
73,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That time expired in 1920, but the Commonwealth is still paying the 25s. a head in accordance with It was certainly more of a "" mutual "" agreement than that which was arrived at over the In his second-reading the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) The scheme is on the lines of the recommendations by the royal commission on taxation. t is a pity the Treasurer did not follow royal There were many fine recommendations, but the honourable gentleman not only failed to follow them, he Comviolated the recommendation that the Commonwealth should continue the taxation on Crown leaseholds. If the honorbeable gentleman can find in the report of the royal commission anything to sub- stantiate his present attitude, he is ento put it forward, because it was a commission for which I had very great respect, consisting, as it did, of capablewho were to a large extent experts and specialists. But I dispute the contention that their recommendations absoin lutely bear out the position taken up by the Treasurer. Among other things, the commission investigated the harmonization of Federal and State taxation, and the delimitation of spheres of taxation; and it expressed the united opinion that "" any scheme for the allocation of subjects of taxation should be inaugurated n d by a voluntary agreement."" It stressed referthat point in many pages of its report. The Treasurer speaks of "" mutual on agreement in the respective fields of taxation."" I do not suppose he will say there is any "" mutual agreement"" in reto gard to his Government's proposals in One principle enunciated by the Treasurer, repeated and emphasized yesterday, has been taken from the report of the royal commission; but the Government has - paraphrased the commission's recommendation, and has not quoted the - whole of it . What the Commissioners recommended was as follows:Wo consider it a sound principle that where any authority is by rightnot by gracereceiving revenue through taxation imposed upon its citizens, that authority should he charged with the responsibility of determining the nature and incidence of this taxation. Then they went on the say what the Treasurer did not quote:The per capita payment does not infringe that principle. There are two points in that: The first is that the per capita payment did not infring e that priuciple. The second point is-Are the States to expect the payments by right, and not as as act of grace ? These per caqnta payments are not handed over to the States as a State right in a legal or constitutional sense. They receive them by grace. That is where the Commissioners make the distinction. What they were referring to in the particular passage so much relied upon by the Government was a suggestion that the States should collect revenue' and hand over certain sums to the CommonAvealth, and that the Commonwealth should have no voice as to the incidence of the taxation, but should merely accept the sum handed over. The Commissioners say that that is not a sound principle.",38
74,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Does the honourable member think that it is a fair deduction to say that the per capita payments do not disturb the principle the commission laid down ?,39
75,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is clear that the per capita payments are received as an act of grace, and not as a right.",39
76,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That makes no difference.,39
77,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"If the payments are received by the States as a right, then the Commonwealth Government's attitude is wrong.",39
78,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,I know that it is wrong; but I do not agree with the honourable member in the point he is endeavouring to make.,39
79,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"At any rate that is the recommendation upon which the Government is relying, and I claim that they will get no satisfaction out of it .",39
80,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,We are not relying on that.,39
81,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I have with me the Treasurer's own interpretation of the real principle underlying the action of the Government. Speaking in Sydney, on the 21st June, 1926, he saidThe principle underlying the action of the Government in connection with the abolition of the per capita payment was that the public would know whom tp blame for the effects of taxation, and its incidence. In other words, the Government's proposal amounts to this: "" Get a monopoly of all the indirect taxation, because the people do not know whom to blame for that, and place upon the shoulders of the States the odium of all direct taxation, so that they will become unpopular, while the Federal Treasurer will become the most popular man in the land by reducing direct taxation."" Of course, a lot of people do not know the extent to which they pay under direct taxation. Let us examine the figures of direct and indirect taxation. The expenditure from revenue, after allowing for the per capita payments to the States, fro m indirect taxation for the last financial year was £32,000,000, while the expenditure from direct taxation was £15,000,000. Thus 68 per cent, of the expenditure of the Commonwealth was paid from indirect taxation, and 32 per cent, from direct taxation. What will be the position after the Government's proposal comes into operation ? The expenditure from revenue derived from indirect taxation will be over £40,000,000, and the expenditure from direct taxation will be £7,000,000. In other words, 85 per cent, of the Federal expenditure will be from indirect taxation, and only 15 per cent, from direct taxation. Therefore, the Commonwealth will not become very unpopular with the taxpayers. But what wil l be the position of the States? Approximately one-fourth of their revenue is now derived from indirect taxation, that is to say, from the per capita payments, whereas under the new proposals the whole of their - revenue will be derived from direct taxation. I submit that in the existing circumstances of Commonwealth finances such a distribution of the indirect taxation paid by all the people of Australia, State taxpayers as well as Commonwealth taxpayers, is not equitable.",39
82,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Surely the per capita payments are paid out of Consolidated Revenue, and not out of Customs revenue ?",39
83,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That assertion may be technically correct, but that is all.",40
84,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,It was made by M Deakin in this House.,40
85,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The fact that it was made by Mr Deakin would not make it correct, because, although he was a very estimable gentleman, he made many in correct statements. I want to draw attention to a remarkable change of tone, and to contrast the statement made by the Treasurer in Sydney in June last with the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) yesterday. present proposal of the Government, according to the Prinre Minister, is not to make the people blame the States for the direct taxation, but to save the States. Apart from the fact that a great principle is involved, it is apparently the desire of the Prime Minister to save the States from the dangerous position of living at the whim of the Federal Parliament. According to the right honourable gentleman, the Federal Parliament becomes a dictator. What ungrateful beings these State Governments and State Parliaments must be, because we find all parties in all the States unanimously opposed to the Commonwealth Government's proposals. Mr E . RILEY - They do not know their friends!",40
86,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"They do not. They do not know that the Prime Minister and his Government are anxious to save them. These foolish States! They love the danger in which they are placed; they are glad to live at the whim of the Commonwealth Parliament. monwealth Government wants to save them, but they do not want to be saved. What proof that the States were in grave danger did the Prime Minister produce ? He pictured the evil possibility of another Government coming into power in the Commonwealth, and in order to enable' it to carry out some social reform in which it believed, sweeping away all the per capita payments, and leaving the States without any other financial provision. Of course it could; but it does not require much argument to show how illogical is that position. If the Commonwealth Government succeeds in putting through its present proposal to abolish the per capita payments, and evacuate certain fields of direct taxation, what, will prevent another Government, anxious to r . bring about certain social reforms, reimposing all the direct taxation thus abandoned to the States?",40
87,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Nothin g at all,",40
88,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The r e will be no thing in the world to prevent its being done. Therefore the position of the States is. no less precarious today than it would be then, and is not likely to be improved by the proposal of the Government to evacuate certain fields The of taxation. In 1910, for example, £3,000,000 was cut off from the States in order to pay old-age pensions, and the Prime Minister's contention is that what happened then can happen again. The position is not likely to be altered by the Government's proposals. Is there to be any guarantee of safety for the States. Does the Treasurer suggest that this proposal will bind all f u t u r e Parliaments? I submit that it cannot. Another argument used by the Prime Minister - was the inequity of the per capita payments, by which he endeavoured to buttress the alleged unassailable principle upon which he rested his whole case. He said that under the per capita system the more populous States received a greater sum of money than the less populous States. Two considerations arise from that statement. One is that if the method of contributin g from the Customs revenue by so much per head is inequitable, could not that method be changed without withdrawing the whole of the payments ? I suggest The Com- that it would be difficult to find a basis more equitable than the population basis. The subject under discussion, however, is not whether the method of distributing the money is in equitable, but whether the payments should still be made to the States. If the method of distribution is inequitable, I suggest that it can be changed. It is very amusing to find the Prime Minister, as it were, beating out a grass fire with his hat, by resorting to these f u t i le arguments. The schedule presented by the Treasurer when he introduced the bill, shows the alleged gain to the respective States under the Government's proposal to evacuate the fields of land and entertainments taxation and to forgo the revenue from estate duties and so forth. If we examine that schedule we shall find that the greatest gain, will be derived by the more populous States.",40
89,Dr EARLE PACK,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,It would same if we left the collection of the taxes i u the hands of the States.,41
90,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The fact remains that the Prime Minister has told us that when revenue is distributed per capita, the large States benefit more than the small States; and when I show that there is a greater disparity between the States under the new scheme, the Treasurer says that the larger States are entitled to the greater amount of taxation because they collect it . The large States collect more because they have a greater population, and they will , therefore, gain under the new fields of direct taxation that the Government proposes to open to them, just as they now gain by the distribution of the per capita payments. Special adjustments are proposed, so that every State will gain at least £50,000. Comparing South Australia with New South Wales, under the Treasurer's suggestion, South Australia will £51,000, and New South Wales £459,000. If the Government is resting its case partly on the ground that the continuation of the per capita payments is in equitable, what kind of language could one apply to the suggestions of the Treasurer himself? I am not saying that either is inequitable. What I am saying is that, as far as the disparity between the States is concerned, it is in evitable that the more populous States will receive the larger share of revenue.",41
91,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Because they contribute more.,41
92,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That is so. Prime Minister suggested a number of subjects for discussion at the conference that is to take place after the deed has been done.,41
93,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,A f t e r the funeral?,41
94,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Perhaps , or just before it .",41
95,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,A f t e r the post-mortem.,41
96,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Yes . The Prime M in ister mentioned three subjects in particular, and they might well be discussed by the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States in a clear atmosphere and not after an action taken which must be and is sure to create antagonism. I am a strong believer in the holding of conferences between the Commonwealth and the States. I believe that every effort be the should be made by all responsible bodies to bring about harmony in taxation, to remove overlapping, to effect economy, and to bring about equitable methods as far as possible. This condition can be brought about only by starting from scratch on a fair and square basis, and not after taking from the States over £7,000,000, and then proposing the holding of a conference to devise methods of adjustment. The Prime Minister made an interesting suggestion when he said that in lieu of the per capita payments, we might consider taking over portion of the State debts. Say, for the sake of argument, that, in lieu of the per capita payments, we take over £100,000,000 of State debts and pay the interest and sinking fund on that amount, what is the difference between that method and the present method 1 The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have stressed the fact that although the States have no moral claim to the per capita payments, gain they are prepared to favourably consider taking over portion of the State debts. The interest and sinking fund payments on those debts equal, approximately, the per capita payments. In other words, this Parliament would be bound for 50 years to the payment to the States of over £7,000,000 annually.",41
97,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The difference is, of course, that the per capita payments would grow, but the other payments would not.",41
98,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The right honourable gentleman has supplied the States with a good argument for refusing to adopt the suggestion. Let us examine what is The in the mind of the Government. A f t e r all, the Prime Minister's speech yesterday was designed to prevent any discussion or criticism of the scheme as outlined by the Treasurer, but we are entitled to consider at least what is in the mind of the Federal Government when it suggests the holding of a conference, so that we can determine whether it is accomplishing what it has really set out to do. The bill proposes to terminate the per capita payments. Notice of motion has been given for bills to evacuate completely the field of land tax and entertainments tax, to forgo estate duties, and to has been surrender 4.0 per cent, of income taxation. irritating We are told by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that the States will benefit under the scheme. The Treasurer says that the States will benefit by £1,527,852 annually. The tax surrendered will amount to £7,787,352. The - per capita payments to be withdrawn total £7,687,500, leaving a difference of £99,852. Special adjustments of £600,000 are added, and also special grants of £828,000 to Western Australia and Tasmania, making a total gain to the States under the proposed scheme of £1,527,S52. first comment is that the special grants to Western Australia and Tasmania have nothing to do with this issue. An examination has been made of the conditions of those States under the federation. There is power under the Constitution to make grants in necessitous cases. This Parliament unanimously agreed to those grants, and they stand irrespective of this proposal. It is not quite honest to drag that issue across the trail. The sum of £828,000 must be deducted from the Treasurer's claim of a gain to the Slates of £1,527,852.",41
99,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The special grant to Western Australia is provided for in the Surplus Revenue Act.,42
100,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"On that point the Treasurer is again technically correct, but I ask him, Would not these grants be made were there no suggestion to withdraw the per capita payments ? Out of £1,527,852, this sum of £S2S,000 must therefore go by the board. examine the special adjustments of £600,000 to make up the loss that certain States will suffer under the proposed scheme. For how long are those special adjustments to be made ? I have read the Treasurer's statement, and I confess that I cannot tell. At one point he says that the adjustments will last for one year only, and at another he says that the adjustments will be made every year. The question is-Will the adjustments continue ? If not, then some of the States must lose. If the adjustments are to continue, we shall then have adjustments every year, entailing constant calculations, constant irritations, and endless arguments.",42
101,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,No government could assure a continuation.,42
102,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That is so, and yet we are told that this scheme is to separate the finances of the Commonwealth from those of the States. I submit that under this scheme our finances will be more closely interwoven than they are today. The Treasurer said that the special adjustments Would be reviewed each year. For the first year the loss to the Commonwealth revenue, he said, would be £1,527,852, thus suggesting that the next re-adjustment would not be so generous as far as the States are concerned. The alleged object of the proposal is, as we are told, to avoid duplication. I suggest that My under the scheme we shall have more duplication. We shall still have income tax duplication and the duplication of federal machinery for land taxation. I asked the Treasurer what was the position of the States respecting the aggregation of interstate estates in the collection of land tax, and he said that we could do the same as we do with probate duties in Tasmania-w e could provide machinery for the collection of the tax. That is all very well, because we have the machinery; but, apart from the income tax, where is the machinery to come from? The Treasurer says that we will provide special federal machinery for land tax if the States pay for it . We are still to have our finger in. the State financial pie. The same applies to probate duties. We must provide the machinery for the aggregation of property in. the different States. If we do not, considerable revenue will be lost, because the aggregation prin Let us ciple applying to interstate estates, whether in regard to income, tax, probate duties, or land tax, is surely more equitable than the system obtaining in the States today. The royal commission on taxation, to which reference has been made, stated that, on account of the aggregation principle being restricted by State boundaries, the yield of any tax at the same rate would be greater in the hands of the Commonwealth than in the hands of the States.",42
103,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Does the honourable member think that the States could aggregate, even with the aid of federal machinery?",42
104,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I have very grave doubts on that point, and I suggest that, if we are to get r i d of duplication, the Commonwealth should act as the col-< lector of both Federal and State taxes at the rates required.",42
105,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Then what becomes of the principle. Mr Scullin"" - That is the point. If we do not aggregate, it means that interstate companies, and individuals with interstate interests, will pay less tax than they otherwise would. Obviously, that will happen, and more will have to be paid by the smaller taxpayers. The Prime Minister emphasized another point to which the Treasurer drew attention, namely, that the war and defence obligations of the Commonwealth amounted to some £34,000,000, to which were added other sums, such as the cost of invalid and old-age pensions, making a total of £44,000,000. Prom that we drew the inference that the Commonwealth was not in a position to continue the per capita payments to the States. Yet we are told that under the new proposal the States would be £50,000 per annum better off than they are at the present time. Let me draw attention to the two voices of the Treasurer in the one speech. He stated in one case, ""We give the States £1,500,000 more than we take,"" but, further on, he said, "" There is no possibility of returning anything to the States out of Customs revenue.."" On the 4th June last, the Treasurer said, "" An obligation lests on us to make concessions in revenue duties."" On the 8th July, however, a schedule was tabled for the purpose of raising £1,500,000 by new revenue duties. Is there any consistency in the Minister's statements? In another stance, the Treasurer said, "" The States should be financially independent."" submit that they cannot become financially independent. Despite the Treasurer's contention, we find proposals for special adjustments accounting for £600,000; also, grants to Western Australia and Tasmania totalling £828,000, and road grants aggregating £20,000,000. There was an electioneering promise of a further £20,000,000 to be spent on housing. All that is proposed by the Government, while at the same time it is talking about making the States financially independent. Another point seems to have been missed in the discussion by speakers on the Government side. They debated the matter merely as one of adjustment of taxation as between the Commonwealth and the States, but I point out that taxes are imposed for other than revenue purposes. There is a difference between the Commonwealth imposing that kind of tax and the States doing it. The difference lies largely in the fact that there are Upper Houses in the States that will not agree to taxation for certain purposes. One of the taxes imposed hy the Commonwealth-the land tax-wa s introduced not only for the purpose of raising revenue, but also for the breaking up of large estates. The Prime Minister, when Treasurer, admitted that principle. In 1922, when he brought down a measure to remove a surcharge on the land tax, he went out of his way to make it clear that there was no intention to interfere with the original land tax, which was imposed for the purpose of breaking up large estates. He said on that occasion, "" The land tax was a definite act of policy to break up large estates,"" and he went on to point out that he did not intend to interfere with that principle. The Government's proposals are based on the asumption that the Customs revenue will continue to be as high as it is today, because there is an implied agreement not to resume abandoned fields of taxation. What would be the value of this proposal, or of any similar scheme to evacuate certain fields of direct taxation? The States would naturally ask, "" Do you bind yourself not to resume those fields of taxation when the per capita payments are withindrawn?"" It is obvious that the Commonwealth Government could not give such an I undertaking; but if it did it would be claimed that there was a moral obligation on the Parliament not to resume those fields of taxation. Then some day this Parliament might pass a really protective tariff.",43
106,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,What would that be like?,43
107,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,I am hoping for such a tariff.,43
108,Mr FOSTEB,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable member wants more, I hope he will not secure it.",43

111,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I should be very sorry to find myself in entire agreement with the honourable member on a tariff question. I hope to see the day when we shall be able more full y to protect Australian industries, and exclude the imports from foreign countries. When that day comes our tariff revenue will not be so high; but the assumption upon which the Government scheme is founded is that the Customs revenue will continue to be high.",43
112,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,We were told in connection with the tariff of 1920 that the revenue would decline.,44
113,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"But I was not responsible for that tariff. I helped the present Minister for Trade and Customs to do his best for many Australian industries, but I am not yet satisfied with what has been done for them. If there is an implied guarantee not to resume abandoned fields of taxation, the powers of the Commonwealth will be limited, not legally, but probably morally.",44
114,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"If that is so, it is dangerous.",44

At the same time there is nothing to prevent discussions, and voluntary arrangements to del i m it certain fields of taxation, and above all to obtain a common collector of taxes in order to. prevent overlapping. have not succeeded in eliminating overlapping by means of the scheme for the collection of income tax which the Treasurer brought down, although the conditions under it are better than those that previously obtained.",44
116,Dr EAEL EPAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,It was the could do.,44
117,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That may be; but it is not all that ought to be done, and the Treasurer should keep striving in that direction. The clash of political views in every country is inevitable; but if we have a conflict between State and Federal Governments as such, a dangerous position will be created for the federation. The unanimous opinion of every party in the States is against the Government's proposal, and surely those parties represent public opinion. united public opinion in the States, and united State Parliaments, we have a divided Federal Parliament. have two voices from the Ministry in two speeches by the two heads of the Government, and I am afraid they are both swelled heads on this subject. scheme is already creating considerable antagonism between the States and the Commonwealth-greate r an tagonism than I can remember for many years. It contributed very largely last year to the defeat of the proposals submitted by referendum to the people. I very much regret the result of that vote, because the increased powers asked for, though not adequate, represented a distinct advance along the lines of greater Federal power. The present proposal created fears of what might be done if greater powers were granted to the Commonwealth Parliament. The deportation proceedings led many people to believe that the Commonwealth sought greater powers in. order to continue that fiasco. The intended withdrawal of the - per capita payments con r tributed largely to the defeat of the referenda proposals, and the oil interests and the press completed the job. We must use our present powers justly. A fte r examining this measure from every point of view, it seems to me that it is not a just proposition. Nor was the original proposal a just one. We must co-operate with the States and not bully them, if we are to receive from the people, eventually, the extended powers that are required to advance the interests of Australia. We  [5.55] - I do not wish the second reading of this bill to be carried on the voices. The necessity for a readjustment of the Commonwealth and State finances is generally recognized, but, in ray opinion, the Government has not submitted a scheme best we that will provide a remedy. The present system of flat per capita payments places the smaller States in a disadvantageous position as compared with the large manufacturing States. The Prime Minister and, I think, the Treasurer, have pointed out that payments on a flat rate afford a great advantage to the larger States, the smaller States receiving an inequitable proportion of the money distributed from surplus revenue. The Government seems to realise that fact, but the mere transference to the States of Against a the right to raise by direct taxation a sum equivalent to the per capita payments, or eveu a larger amount, does not remedy We even the position in any way. I should like honourable members to realise that the revenue that the Government intends to reserve to itself is collected from every The citizen of the Commonwealth, no matter of what age. The Trade and Customs Department levies tax upon the whole of the people, and, therefore, the Federal tax touches every section of the comtutional munity. A direct income tax, however, does not affect the whole of the munity. When the Commonwealth collects direct tax from the citizens of the States, the States may be able to show this Parfer liament that a certain average amount goes to the Commonwealth exchequer sake annually; but will the individual States be able to rely upon a regular revenue from income taxation ? A bad season in any one of the States would cause that State very considerable financial embarrassment. It is unusual for a proceeding drought to affect the whole of Australia at the same time, but I remember one year in which this country had that experience.",44

Commonwealth Government is collecting asked over the whole continent, the good seasons in other States counterbalance the losses of revenue from income taxation State afflicted by a bad season. But when a State has to rely entirely upon the i come taxation derived from its own people, its revenue must be uncertain and fluctuating, and a drought means disaster. The various State Governare AvithdraAvn. ments have made great efforts to increase the population on the land. Western Australia is settling large numbers of people in the agricultural and pastoral areas, but the State Government derives very little income taxation fro m them, will not do so for some years. partment of Trade and Customs, on the otlier hand, collects about £6 per head for every man, woman, and child on those settlements.

The income taxation. people who contribute the revenue of the CommonAvealth also contribute the revenue of the States, and although the Commontaxation Avealth may hold the big end of the Constistick, it should Avield it justly.

This proposal does not seek to terminate the present duplication.  direction.  attitude were adopted by the Commonwealth towards the States some agreement for the removal of anomalies and duplications would be possible. I agree with the statement of the honourable member for Yarra that the people were scared into voting against the referendum pro, posals because they regarded the withdrawal of the per capita payments as an indication of the treatment that might be expected from a dominant central parliament. It has been truly said that the mere statement of this Government, that it is withdrawing from certain fields of taxation, will not reserve those fields to the States for all time. Even without the excuse of national necessity, any future government may ask the Commonwealth to again invade the taxation area which the present Government is proposing to vacate. The Prime Minister .should have frankly declared that the Government intended to follow up the withdrawal of the per capita payments by proposals for more equitable financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States.",45
120,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The Prime Minister has offered to confer with the States.  before the horse. Had the Government's proposals been put forward in their natural order, there would have been less irritation on the part of the States and less objection in this House to the bill. The present system of per capita payments is not equitable to Western Australia. Mr J . FBANCIS - The honourable member is standing in the way of an equitable re-adjustment.  proposed by the Government will not rectify the existing unfairness. W it h an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles, and a population of only 380,000, Western Australia has little prospect, of extensive manufacturing industries, because Commonwealth fiscal legislation tends to the industrial enrichment of the more populous eastern States. Last year Western Australia purchased from the eastern States goods to the value of approximately £8,000,000, and the purchases by those States from Western Australia amounted to only £300,000. The purchase of so much primary produce that and manufactured goods from the eastern States gives employment to a very large number of people, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. But those States get the per capita payments in respect of the people whom Western Australian money employs. The Western Australian Government is not able to tax the profits made in respect of the sale of goods to that State; the taxation benefits are received by the States in which the goods are bought. Had Western Australia been able to buy in the open market, it could have saved last year about £2,000,000 in respect of the goods which it bought from the eastern States. But it is required to buy in the dearest market, and sell its products in the open market against the competition of the world. Western Australia is really providing portion of the money which the eastern States receive in per capita payments. That is an argument against a flat per capita rate, and in favour of the Canadian system of varied payments. Mr J . FRANCIS - This bill affords an opportunity to make a more equitable arrangement.  should disclose full y the arrangements it proposes to substitute for the present payments. In the absence of more definite information, Western Australia is better off with the assured income it now derives from the per capita payments than it would be if obliged to rely upon the less reliable form of revenue from income taxation. That is really the only point that we have to consider this afternoon. Under the Constitution the Commonwealth Government is empowered to make special contributions to Western Australia, Tasmania, or Queensland to compensate those States for financial disabilities as the result of Federation, but I honestly believe that, instead of going on with this measure, the Government should vacate those avenues of direct taxation which it entered in a time of national stress due to the great war. Commonwealth revenue from Customs today is much beyond that which any Treasurer has been able to estimate. On former occasions the Treasurer has been able to reduce the rate of income taxation, and I submit that it would be better now if the Government abandoned the entertainments tax, the estate duties, and laud taxation, without touching the per capita payments.",46
121,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Revenu e from those sources is increasing.  that the. Treasurer should leave that source of revenue to th© States, and, indeed, get out of all those fields of taxation which it was never intended the Commonwealth should invade. We should then get back to normal conditions. The framers of the Constitution never contemplated that the Commonwealth Government should become in volved in undertakings which extract so much money from the people of Australia, leaving the States, with decreasing revenues, the same obligations as formerly. The Government should give a fairer deal to those States that are at a trade disadvantage through being compelled under Federation to depend upon other States of the Commonwealth for their requirements. This is a reasonable proposition. Honourable members are aware that there has been talk of secession in at least one of the States. This is not because the people there are antiBritis h or antagonistic to their fellow citizens. They are as loyal as the people in any other part of the Commonwealth.",47
122,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The secession talk is all "" bunkum.""  tating and unfair conditions are allowed to continue for any length of time, no one will be in a position to say that the complaint is unreal or even "" bunkum.""",47
123,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Peopl e are flowing into Western Australia from every part of the Commonwealth.  there are engaged in a more gigantic struggle to develop their unoccupied areas than are the people of any other State. Mr Fenton. - They are very prosperous over in that State.  ing their proper work. But they are bearing a burden that they should never have been called upon to bear. It would be possible to develop that great State much more rapidly if the people there could get that £2,000,000 which they have lost through being compelled, under federation, to trade with the eastern States. They have to purchase all their requirements at excessively high prices . and sell their products in the open markets of the world. Western Australia is the only State that is increasing its wheat yield. I wish that more of the other States would set about the same task of producing new money in Australia for the payment of our national debt, instead of busying themselves about hothouse proposals that lay heavier burdens upon the real production of Australia. In the eastern States the movement is in the direction of turning wheat lands into sheep lands and employing fewer hands. Consequently, young men are d r if t in g from the country to the cities. This policy is not good for any country. If I were to convert my own area from wheat-growing to sheep-raising I should employ only one man where at present I employ twenty, and I should not give half the traffic revenue to the railways of my State. There is not so much distribution of money in woolgrowing as in wheat farming. In Western Australia there is a larger area of cheap agricultural land available than in the other States, and primary production is the only thing to which settlers there can turn their hands. If the people in the eastern States were obliged to devote more attention to primary production, unquestionably they would be more prosperous than they are at present. Western Australia would develop more i r r i - rapidly and the Commonwealth would benefit to a greater extent if the people in that State had not these undue burdens laid upon them. The Government, through its Customs tariff, draws heavy revenues from immigrants who come to these shores without a penny in their pockets, and, unfortunately, primary production is so heavily handicapped that it is exceedingly difficult for men who go on the land to make good. These are the problems that it would be wise for this Government to give its attention. Doubtless the Ministr y is sincere in its desire to pass this measure, but I cannot see how it is going to benefit the Commonwealth. A. more logical proposition should have been brought down to adjust the nnancial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I am a great believer in one borrowing authority, because I believe that by this means it would be possible to obtain cheaper money. And I believe, also, that the Commonwealth should be entrusted with this responsibility, but that all borrowing should be done on estimates submitted by the States. A Government policy shaped along these lines would help the country to progress. Sitting suspended from 6.25 to S p.m.",47
124,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Hunter ) [8.0] The bill befcre the House is a very important one, and the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) showed conclusively how necessary it is for this Parliament to be caref u l before committing itself in this ter. The Prime Minister, in introducing the proposal, which, although somewhat modified, is in effect identical with the previous proposal, expressed an admirable sentiment when he said that it was necessary, in the interests of good government and the development of this country, for the State and Federal authorities to work together in perfect harmony. I agree with that. view. We are one people, with one destiny, and good financing is vita l to our government. That has beeu recognized from the inception of federation; but, notwithstanding the Prime M in ister's sentiments, we have departed from the principles he himself laid down. In stead of co-operating with the States, and working with the degree of harmony so necessary to success, the Government is endeavouring to bludgeon them. It cannot be said to be an act of conciliation to put a decision into effect beforean understanding has been reached with the States. I ask honourable members to carry their minds back to the inception of federation, while I briefly state the history of the per capitagrant. It was made apparent to all who took part in the creation of the Commonwealth, that the great question of finance had to be satisfactorily arranged. At that time the States depended largely on revenue from the Customs, and the framers of the Constitution were, therefore, careful. not to interfere unnecessarily with the amounts that they were receiving. So it came about that the section of the Constitution known as the "" Braddon Blot "" was included. It provided that for a period of ten years three-fourths of the Customs revenue should be returned to the States. As the Commonwealth progressed, and shouldered greater obligations than those conferred upon it in the early days of federation, it was found that a change was necessary. But section 94 provides that surplus revenue above the requirements of the Commonwealth may be distributed equally among the States.",48
125,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Fairly .,48
126,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The r e is not much difference between ""equally"" and "" fair l y . "" Last evening the Prime M i nister said that we had no surplus revenue. Of course we have not. because we have made provision that all surplus revenue shall be paid into the Surplus Revenue mat- Fund. We have a statement today from no less an authority than the Auditor General that we have between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 lying in the trust account. But for legislation authorizing the creation of trust accounts, that money would have been regarded as surplus revenue, and would have been available for return to the States. We have taken every precaution to see that no more revenue goes to the States that we are compelled by the Constitution to pay to them. I u 1908, when the ten-year period had almost expired, the State Premiers met in conference, and resolvedThat this conference views with apprehension the - proposals of the Commonwealth Government embodied in the memorandum of Sir William Lyne, and is of opinion that they will, if adopted, seriously affect the financial independence and solvency of the States, and further resolves1. That, in view of the fact that upon the State Parliaments devolves the duty of developing the resources of their respective States hy means of land settlement, railway construction, irrigation, and other public works, and that they are charged with the responsibility of maintaining adequate education and charity systems, and providing for the administration of justice and other services, the financial obligations connected with which will inevitably increase with the growth of population, no financial scheme can he assented to by the States which does not provide for their receiving(a) a fixed annual siim; and (b) a proportionate part of all increases in revenue from Customs and excise.",48

I do not argue that the time may not arrive when an alteration will be necessary; but I say, most emphatically, that we are not justified in filching revenue from, the States or changing the system at the present time.",49

The negotiations conducted up to 1910 were continued from time to time u n t i l the 20th May, 1926, when the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) notified the State GoMr vernments that, in the opinion of the It Commonwealth Government, there should be only one direct taxing authority, and that in order to give effect to its proposals the Commonwealth Government proposed to introduce legislation in which provision woxdd be made for the per capita payThe ments to be abolished, and the States to collect the land tax, probate duties, entertainments tax, and 40 per cent, of the income taxation on individuals and companies. There was an unsuccessful conference, but it was unreasonable to suppose that the States would be in agreement with a proposal which so vitally affected their financial arrangements with the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth Government could so unthe load its share of direct taxation, and place the responsibility upon the States, | answer to it would be in a very fortunate position. The Commonwealth Government could go [ to the people, and tell them that in future j it would depend entirely upon indirect taxation, and that if any authority were responsible for the heavy burden which they were paying in the form of direct taxation, it would State governments. Tbat a very easy way to avoid sibility; but by pitting governments against the Commonwealth authority, we cannot expect to develop our resources. As the right the Prime Minister said, we must have harmony between the Commonwealth and the States, but that cannot be accomplished in this way. The Prime also referred to the financial responsibilities which have arisen in recent years, and said that we have an interest bill of about £29,000,000 to meet in connection with our war expenditure, and other commitments in connection with old-age pensions, and so on, which is quite When the war was in progress wisely introduced measures providing for the collection of income taxation, an entertainments tax, and probate duties, in order to meet our commitments. frequently stated that, as we were asking men to go overseas to fight, those who remained at home should help to contribute towards the cost of the war. debt is still with us. Our gross national debt of the 30th June, £458,443,000, and our £338,841.000. Prior to the war our national debt was hardly worth considering, and the taxes I have mentioned were imposed in order to meet our interest bill on war commitments. I have whatever to say against any which legitimately reduces but to endeavour to vacate certain fields of taxation, and at the same time place the responsibility of collecting the taxes upon the States; is quite a different proposition. I ask the Treasurer, and other honourable members supporting this measure, to place themselves in the position of a Treasurer in any of the If a State Government is to collect a portion of this taxation in addition to that which it already collects, is there any hope of it being returned with a majority ? The electors are not concerned with the cause, but only with the amount they will have to pay. The proposal is to pay to the States for a period of twelve months an amount equivalent which they would receive in the form of per capita payments, and during that time they are to adjust their finances on a new basis.

Estimates. £ £ 1922-23 ... 22,597,306 ... 17,500,008 1923-24 ... 25,177,882 ... 19,750,000 1924-25 ... 26,405,161 ... 23,675.000 1925-20 ... 27,539,894 ... 26,500,000 States. From the foregoing it will be seen that the Customs receipts have been increasing annually.",50
139,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,This year they are even higher.,50
140,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Yes ; we have not 1 which the figures for the last six months, which I believe will show a further heavy increase. It is the duty of this to that Parliament to see that manufacturing is carried on to a greater extent in Australia to provide employment for our own people and suitable immigrants. In expect order to achieve that end we must have effective protection, which is the policy have supported by the vast majority of the people of the Commonwealth. Customs revenue, upon which the success of this scheme is based, with the exception of 60 per cent, to be derived from income taxation, should be substantially reduced, how could the Government expect to nuance its various activities? As the revenue diminishes so will the needs of the Commonwealth' increase.",50
141,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,They will increase when men have been driven off the land.,51
142,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,We do not wish for that; we wish to provide markets for the commodities they produce. As the Customs revenue diminishes a smaller amount will be available to develop this country and carry on its various important activities. When that time arrives an attempt will be made by the Commonwealth Parliament to see that it receives sufficient revenue for its purposes. Is it to be suggested that the Government of the day will not reimpose taxation ?,51
143,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Some of the members of the party to which the honourable member belongs believe in unification, and in taking away the revenue of the States altogether.",51
144,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"There is no likelihood of that occurring, as was shown by the last referendum. I could quite understand the position if the Commonwealth Government were taking over certain obligations from the States. The Prime Minister referred in his policy speech to child endowment, the cost of which should be borne by the Commonwealth, and not by any particular State. If we were relieving the States of some heavy financial responsibility, such as child endowment or social insurance against accident, sickness, death, or unemployment, we should have some reason for seeking a re-adjustment of financial relations, but as we are not taking over any such obligations, we are not entitled to interfere with the present arrangements. Something has been said about harassing the States. As a matter of fact, this is harassing them. It is throwing down the gauntlet. In the circumstances, we cannot expect the States to respond. The Prime Minister said that he realized as he travelled through the TJnited States of America how essential it was that Federal and State governments should work together in harmony. I agree that that is desirable. But action of this kind is not likely to promote a spirit of cooperation. There is nothing of conciliaM If the tion in this bill. We are, as it were, holding a pistol to the head of the States. The Government brings in this measure, requests us to agree to it , and then, after everything has been done, asks the States to meet in conference to consider the matter, and promises to give them twelve months to make arrangements to meet the new conditions. That is just like holding up a man in the street at the point of a pistol, and then invitin g him to meet in conference afterwards to consider the matter. I wish to quote a few newspaper extracts on this subject. It cannot be said that the Melbourne Age, Argus, or Herald are favourable to the policy of the Labour party, so that their criticism of the Government's policy is the more noteworthy. On the 7th of June, 1926, the following appeared in the Argus: Nothing could be further removed from the spirit which was the genesis of Federation than the measure which the Federal Treasurer outlined in the House of Representatives on Friday for depriving the States of their rightful share of Customs and excise revenue. If this arbitrary disturbance of the financial relations between Commonwealth and State could have been foreseen 25 years ago it is certain that there would have been no Federation. I agi-ee with that. There would not have been a possibility of securing federation if the States had thought for a moment that the Commonwealth would interfere with State financial rights. The States expected to get a fair deal from the Commonwealth, and it cannot be said that this proposal is fair. On the 9th of June, 1926, the following appeared in the Herald:The Commonwealth is attempting to slip out of activities which have brought upon it a fair amount of criticism. It hopes to emerge on to the velvet of indirect taxation which is bound up with a great national policy, and therefore incurs little or no odium. On the 10th of June, 1926, the Age contained the following: The Federal Government, even if it had a good case-whic h in this instance it certainly has not-ha s by its arrogant, precipitate action already antagonized the public mind.",51
145,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Rea d what the Age has to say today.,51
146,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I do not krnow what the Age says today, but I agree with the sentiments I have quoted. Proposals of this kind cannot help creating State antagonism to the Commonwealth. I agree with the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), that the defeat of the recent referendums was due largely to the Commonwealth Government antagonizing the States. It practically ignored the States in regard to certain measures submitted to this Parliament upon which the States had a right to be consulted. On the 23rd of June, 1926, the following appeared in the Age: The Federal Government seems doomed to invite the penalty which unsparing Fate metes out to all rulers who abuse vast powers. It may soon rush headlong down a steep place. Its latter handling of the question of the tion of the per capita payments to the States from the Customs receipts, and its treatment of the thoroughly justifiable protests of the Premiers at the May and the sitting States conference, are so compounded of studied disdain, sharp practice, and "" the young man in a hurry "" that electors who have tried to follow the unlovely drama must have some difficulty in concealing their amazed contempt. That was severe criticism, but it was well warranted. The Government has no justification for introducing a measure of this kind. On the 24th of June, the Age published these words:Apparently the Prime Minister has gone so far along the path of the political dictatorship that he dare not now withdraw. On the 11th of February, 1927, the same newspaper contained the following: From the day the Government returned to power flushed with its fresh supply of strength it has sought to play the part of bully. . . . It is sheer cant for the Federal Government to say it has no desire to dictate to whilst simultaneously it is dictating. The political dictatorship has reference to the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). I believe that he is responsible for this measure, though, no doubt, he obtained Cabinet approval of it . It is in harmony with the principles that have guided him ever since his election to the Federal Parliament. He was responsible for exempting big leaseholders from land tax, and has always done everything in his power to relieve people of that class of their obligations to the country. It is idle for him to speak of evacuating certain fields of taxation. He knows that it is impossible to escape double taxation.",51
147,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Surely the of the Opposition knows that our first proposal was to evacuate entirely the field of income taxation?,52
148,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I well remember the Treasurer saying that he believed in Dne taxing authority. But even if he were to evacuate certain fields of income taxation he would still have to collect some taxes. As a matter of fact, he is retaining 60 per cent, of income taxation under this very proposal. While the Commonwealth and States have such heavy debts as at present exist, it is impossible to escape from the double taxing authority, and in these circumstances it is ridiculous to introduce a measure like this. We must retain the power of income taxation. But in any case future governments will not be bound by the actions of this Government. This Parliaaboli- ment can only control affairs during the period of its life. We all desire to see the country develop rapidly, and one of the greatest needs of Australia is more power for the national parliament, so that it can give effect to the desires of the people. But we shall never gain more power by following the lead of this Government. If I were on the side of the States, I should certainly be opposed to granting larger powers to a government that simply ignored the States as this Government has done. If we desire progress we must work in harmony with the States. We must recognize that we have certain functions, and the States have certain functions. The State and Federal Parliaments are elected by the one body of people, and the interests of State and Commonwealth electors are identical. It is our bounden duty to do the best we can in the interests the States of the whole of the people, and seek to develop this great country. It is idle to talk about Imperial Conferences, Premiers' Conferences, or conferences of any other kind if we intend constantly to antagonize the State Governments. We must be actuated by the spirit of sweet reasonableness, and the people have a right to expect a good example from this Parliament. We can set a good example by acting fair l y and squarely to the States. No one dreamed at the time of federation that the Commonwealth would attempt to make inroads on State rights without, at the same time, taking over some of the big obligations and responsibilities that the Leader States were carrying. In saying that, I wish to make it quite clear that I do not tie myself down for all time to the present arrangement. There may be necessity, on some f u t u r e occasion, to reconsider the per - capita payments. It may be desirable that the Commonwealth should assume responsibility for child endowment, national insurance against sickness or unemployment, or some other national obligation of that kind which should be discharged in a uniform manner throughout the Commonwealth. In those circumstances I feel sure that the States would not object to a reduction of 2s. 6d., 3s., or 4s. in the per capita payments. But at present no proposal is before us for relieving the States of any of their heavy obligations. It appears to me that the Government has made up its mind that it is the supreme authority, and that whatever it says shall be done must be done. I disagree with that attitude, which can only create bad feeling in Australia. For these reasons I am strongly opposed to this measure.",52
149,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is quite refreshing t,o hear the honourable member pleading for State rights. Mr Charlton' - There is no jiistification for this proposal, and I believe that this Parliament will make a serious mistake and. do a great injustice to the States by accepting it. Tn these circumstances I movesThat all the words after the word "" That "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" in view State Governments' heavy nnancial responsibilities the bill be withdrawn.""",53
150,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Perth) [8.45J - All honourable members realise that the Prime Minister's speech yesterday was one of special interest, not only because of the importance of the subject, but also on account of the peculiar and interesting conditions under which it was delivered. I could not help noticing that, while the Prime Minister was speaking, the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), who may be described as the coadjutor Prime Minister, occupied the seat which the Prime Minister himself generally occupies when a subordinate Minister is addressing the House, and that he followed the remarks of his Leader with concentrated interest. appeared also that the Prime Minister was not quite at his usual ease when speaking. His remarks were unworthy of the Leader of a big State. It seemed to me that while the Prime Minister expressed in fine phrases the motives which were prompting the Government, he was not altogether in sympathy with the object to which those sentiments were directed. Personally, I could not decide' whether we were listening to the straightforward honesty of Esau or the persuasive plausibility of Jacob. Every honourable member appreciates those standards which the Prime Minister said should characterize the relations between the Commonwealth and the States. He said that he had realized during his American - tour that antagonism between the States and the Commonwealth was most undesirable. It should not have been necessary for the Prime Minister to visit America to discover that fact. For a long time it has been obvious to many people in Australia that antagonism between the States and the Commonwealth is not only undesirable, but is creating a very unfavorable position in Australia. Honourable members could have informed the Prime Minister of the possible re1 sults of antagonism between the two authorities; and their opinions are entitled to as much respect as those of persons resident in the TJnited States of America. That there is a very strong feeling regarding this matter there is no doubt, for upon a right settlement of this question depends the internal peace of the and stability of the Commonwealth for many years. The antagonism which has arisen is attributed to misunderstanding. That is a convenient phrase. But the misunderstanding which has arisen is very similar to the mistaken ideas which the oysters must have had when the walrus invited them to come out and be eaten. It is complained that it has not been possible in the past to get agreement from the States. That is due to the nature of the demands made by the Commonwealth upon them. Except in respect of one relatively unimportant matter, no referendum submitted to the people has been answered in the affirmative. That is a significant fact which is worthy of the careful consideration of honourable members. We must It remember that the people to whom the State Governments are answerable are the same people to whom the Commonwealth Government must give an account of its stewardship. When proposals affecting the respective spheres of the Commonwealth and the States have emanated from the Commonwealth Government and been rejected by the people, it surely is an indication that, in general, the people disapprove of the actions of the Commonwealth. Mr G. FBANCIS - Stat e referendums have been equally unsuccessful.",53
151,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"So have State elections. Time after time the people have refused to give additional powers to the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that, on the occasion of the last referendum, the people rejected the proposals of the Commonwealth Government chiefly because of its contemplated action - with respect to the per capita payments. On many occasions, in different parts of the country, I have heard people say that they were not prepared to grant additional powers to the Federal Government, because they were not satisfied that it was exercising its existing powers in a proper manner, especially in respect of the per capita payments. That argument weighed very heavily in the final rejection of the Government's proposals. The latest posals of the Commonwealth, which purport to be a modification of those previously put forward, are supposed to show some consideration to the States. Prime Minister said that his Government was prepared to consider two or three possible forms of adjustment. First, he spoke of the complete evacuation by the Commonwealth of the taxation fields. He then suggested the provision of sinking funds for debts along the lines suggested by Mr Warren Kerr. To that proposal the Prime Minister said that there might be the objection that it would be equivalent to telling the States to do something which they had not the sense to do for themselves. That, in my opinion, is the attitude of the Commonwealth towards the State Governments. It is causing resentment not only among the members of the State Governments, but also among the persons closely connected with them. Of the Government's road proposals it has been said that the Commonwealth has introduced them in order to compel the States to do what they ought to have done without compulsion.",54
152,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The States have not done the work, because of lack of funds.",54
153,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"If a fair adjustment of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States had been made, the States would have had the money. The proposals of the Commonwealth provide the States with money only so long as it is spent as the Commonwealth desires. The third alternative mentioned by the Prime Minister was that the Commonwealth should take over the debts of the States. His first proposal that the Commonwealth should evacuate the fields of taxation has already been full y dealt with. I have always maintained that the evacuation of those fields by the Commonwealth cannot be considered adequate compensation to the States for the loss of the per capita payments, for the reason that at any time those fields may again be entered by the Commonwealth. The establishment of sinking funds for debts is a matter for consideration, but it does not comply with the provision which has been made in the Constitution for taldng over the debts of the States. To provide a sinking fund is not to take over a debt. If adequate compensation is to be given in this direction it should be done by protaking over an amount of debt, the interest on which would be equivalent to the per capita payments now made. The Prime Minister said that the States had The no constitutional, legal or moral right to the per capita payments.. He argued that if they considered that they had either a constitutional or a legal right they would have tested the position. That is a peculiar argument, seeing that an opportunity for testing the position has not yet occurred. The Prime Minister, knowing that the people generally consider that they have a moral right to these payments, gave special attention to that, aspect of the question; but by his own statement he has cut the ground from under his feet, for he reoeatedly stated that the Commonwealth desired only to make a fair adjustment of this matter. What makes one adjustment fair, and another unfair ? A fair adjustment is one which is based on a recognized moral right. The Prime Minister's statement is a recognition of the moral right of the States to the per capita payments; and, therefore, his argument falls to the ground. In the final analysis, the people themselves must be the judge of whether a moral right exists. We must remember that only by the consent of the States could federation have been consummated. We may quarrel about the amount to be paid; but that the States were to have returned to them some of the indirect taxation received by the Commonwealth was the one condition upon which they consented to surrender certain rights to the Commonwealth. Since then, proposals to deprive the States of the very condition on which they agreed to j o in the federation have been made from time to time.",54
154,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Was that not anticipated in the Constitution ?,55
155,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It was expected that a fair provision would - be made to meet the requirements of the States. evet we may differ regarding the interpretation of the Constitution, the people generally have .strong views regarding what is right or wrong and their moral right to a return of a portion of the in direct taxation received by the Commonwealth. Irrespective of what Parliament decides, the final decision must rest with the people. In the present state of public feeling in Australia, any honourable member who votes for the abolition of this public right will undoubtedly be visited by a Nemesis swift and sure. It has been asserted with a great deal of emphasis that it is wrong in principle for one Government to spend money that has been raised by another Government. That has been the argument of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) from the beginning, and it has now been adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). It is the sole theme upon which the Treasurer has dilated, and he has repeated it from one end of the country to the other. He made the statement first in 1923, and, apparently in the belief that constant repetition would .induce the people to accept it , has repeated it again and again. He has failed to realise that dull resentment has been roused in the public mind by its repetition. Like the Bourbons, the honourable gentleman forgets nothing and learns nothing. The Prime Minister has stated that, throughout the history of the Commonwealth, the practice of one Government raising money for another to spend has beeu recognized as entirely wrong. That is a very extraordinary statement. Mr G. FRANCIS - Nevertheles s it is a very true one.",55
156,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is not true, because that was the only condition upon which the people accepted federation. public sense of the people is still sound, and, if the question of federation were, to be submitted today without the accompaniment of such a condition, a negative vote would be given.",55
157,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"What would be the fate of the bill if it were submitted to the people ? Mr MANjN"" - The Government is afrai d to submit it to the people. If that course were adopted and the bill were approved, I should be perfectly content. Failing that, it is the duty of How- every honourable member to fight the measure at all stages, and to the l i m it of their powers, to endeavour to defeat it . The argument of the Prime Minister that the principle of one Government raising money for another to spend has been regarded as a wrong one throughout the history of the Commonwealth, is answered by the fact that that very principle is embodied in the Constitution itself in. the provisions that relate to grants in aid. In what respect is the principle morally wrong? The Treasurer has described it as a farce, a ridiculous thing, an absurdity, an outrage, and in various other terms. Yet this very absurdity, this very outrage, this farce, has been committed by him in connection with the Federal-aid roads grant. If the system is wrong, he himself stands condemned. He has also said that the per capita payment in itself is wrong. His reason for such an assertion is somewhat obscure. H is argument appears to be that the people who contribute the money receive the largest share of it . The purpose of the honourable gentleman is to suggest to the poorer States that if the per capita payment is abolished they will receive a greater sum by way of special grants than they are now receiving by this means. The implication is that the States that have the larger populations will receive less than is the case at present. This argument has been extensively canvassed with the object of gaining support in. the smaller States. It has been used in my State of Western Australia, and I repudiate it . Although that State desires to secure everything that is justly due to it , it will not lend support to irrants that are unfair and unjust.",55
158,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It wants everything that it can get. The Mr MANN - Everythin g that it can get justly and legitimately. It has not received from this Parliament any grant of which the Parliament has not unanimously approved. It is suggested to the people of the poorer States that they should assist to'have the per capita payments abolished so that, instead of being bound down to 25s. a head, they may be able to approach a generous Treasurer, who will give them what he considers will meet their requirements. Mr G. FRANCIS - Would not the orable member support a proposal to make grants to the States according to their needs 1",55
159,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That is a very good bait with which to attempt to catch an unwary fish. Who is to determine what are the needs of the States ?,56
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The Federal Parliathe ment.,56
161,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That Parliament trolled by the Treasurer, with the aid his supporters. Is anybody so misguided as to suppose that Western Australia, any other needy State, would be given grant greater than its just demands, when such a grant would have to be voted by the representatives of the more populous States?",56
162,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The honourable memso ber a little while ago admitted that Parliament unanimously voted grants to Western Australia.,56
163,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"When they were just financial and fair. The present argument, ever, is that the States will receive is not fair. I . for one, do not think that this Parliament will make such grants, and I am not prepared to ask it should. That is not the principle upon which the finances of the States and Commonwealth should be adjusted. Many persons may hold the view that the preobliged sent Government is specially desirous assisting the backward States. Some Gotakes exception. vernment, irrespective of party, which may come into office in the future hold an entirely different view of the ter. Therefore I say that the States should be protected by the adoption of honest and permanent method, and not states one that wili be subject to the whim caprice of any Government that happens to be in power.",56
164,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The States w always be dependent upon the Federal Parliament, no matter what method may be adopted.",56
165,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I am aware of that. if large sums of money are to be placed in the hands of any Commonwealth Government for distribution among the States, it will be open to that to make an improper use of it . This proposal places the States in an unjust and an unfair position, and one which is totally different from that which they presently enjoy without any suggestion of a political or other return. I desire to honkeep my State free from the necessity to make such an appeal. It is only right that the matter should be placed on a fair, just, and honourable basis. Mr G. FRANCIS - That is the object of this measure.",56
166,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is all very well to say that the intention is to do the right and fair thing. I have been endeavouring to point out, with as much clearness as is conpossible, that this proposal will not of achieve such an object. We have been informed that the proposed method is or necessary because the surplus revenue a that we might otherwise have had has been absorbed by certain large commitments. Examination proves that to be a very dangerous position to take up. The assumption is that any government can arrange its finances that it will have this no isurplus. Year after year we have been told that there has been no surplus because, just prior to the close of the year, large votes have been howmade from revenue account and allocated what to work to be performed in the ensuing financial year. That practice has evoked serious comment by the Auditor-General. that The Treasurer has stated his disagreement with the Auditor-General. That is the natural. The Auditor-General disagrees with the honourable gentleman, but he . s ; to draw attention to anything in of the Treasurer's statement to which he Expressed in those measured terms to which we are accusmay tomed, the Auditor-General has furmatnished us with the most condemnatory report that we have received fro m him an for a very long time. The fact, as he it , is that at the end of last year or there was a surplus of £6,500,000 . Yet we have been informed that there was no surplus, because it was necessary to make large commitments! The public is quite ill justified i u telling the Government that it has no right to enter into these commitments, but that, on the contrary, it should reduce the burden that is at But present borne by the taxpayers.",56
167,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Thos e commitments are old-age pensions, war pensions, and Government other similar items.",56
168,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The Treasurer is perfectly well aware that they do not relate to old-age pensions. He is extremely fond of using that item of expenditure as a justification for his extravagances. Surpluses have accumulated, and the people of Australia are beginning to say that too much extravagance is being in dulged in . Can an accumulated loss of £10,000,000 on Commonwealth steamers be urged as an excuse for failure to return revenue to the States ? That sort of thing is going on all the time.",57
169,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Does the honourable member suggest that that expenditure is being defrayed out of a surplus?,57
170,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I say that there has been too great a waste of public money, and that larger sums should be made available for economical expenditure in the development of this country. The Prime Minister has said that he hopes that this proposal will be taken as a genuine and sincere gesture on the part of the Commonwealth. not want generosity. It is 'not a question of generosity, but of a fair adjustment, as the right honourable gentleman himself said. If a sincere gesture is intended, the best way to prove its sincerity is not to pass the bill and have the conference afterwards, but to have the conference first and let the bill be based upon the conclusions of the conference. Time and again we have had this proposal to knock a man down and reason with h im afterwards.",57
171,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The last conference with the States was u n f r u it f u l .,57
172,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member suggests that because a conference was unfavorable to the Government proposal that is a reason why there should not be a conference until the bill is passed.,57
173,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,I did not say that; I said merely that the last conference was unfruitful.,57
174,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"If that does what I have suggested, what does it mean? The reasons why the last conference with the. States was u n f r u it f u l have been exposed during the debate on this bill. At the last conference of the State Premiers, the Prime Minister refused to meet the Premiers.",57
175,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"They would not argue July, with him . ' Mr MANN - The honourable member may be more in the counsels of the Government than I am, but I venture to think that he does not know what he is talking about. It is clear that he is trying to excuse the vote which evidently he intends to cast on this bill. I have ai word or two to say upon the proposed amendments of the bill, though I recognize that they will be subjects for later consideration. I confess that I have been considerably puzzled in the effort to follow the effect of the sheets of amendment that have been circulated. In passing, I direct the attention of the honourable members to the fact that in clause 6 of the new bill it is proposed to pay money to the several States "" in proportion to the number of their people."" I thought that it was contended by the Government that the per capita principle of payment is immoral and inequitable. The Government will not make the payments per We do capita, but will make them in proportion to the number of the people of the different States, and that, apparently, is w in g to make the whole thing perfectly right. I should like to draw attention to the schedule of amounts to be paid. Under the bill as proposed to be amended the amounts shown as payable to the different States to carry out the Government's scheme differ from those set out in the original table submitted.",57
176,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That is due to the fact that the new amounts are for the succeeding year.,57
177,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The total amount should not be less.,57
178,Dr EABLEPAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"It is £147,000 more.",57
179,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I was under the i m pression that the amounts of the per capita payments are shown to be less in the latest schedule. There is an amount of £483,000 as against £546,000 for Western Australia, and for New South Wales an amount of £2,978,000, not mean as against £2,909,000.",57
180,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The reason is that the new figures are for a different year.,57
181,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Anothe r matter to which I call attention is that, according to subclause (2) of clause 4All sums paid to the State of Western Australia during the period from 1st day of 1926, to the 30th day of June, 1927, in pursuance of section 5 of the Surplus Revenue Act 1910, shall be deemed to have been pay-ment made to that State in fulfillment of the obligations of the Commonwealth to that State under sub-clause (1) of this section in respect of that period. [ wish to know what amounts have been paid during the period mentioned to which the clause alludes. The Treasurer has already dealt with the amount of £300,000, special grant.",57
182,Dr EATILE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That is a diminishing payment.,58
183,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I should like clearly to understand how the proposed new arrangement differs, if it differs at all, from the previous schedule published.",58
184,Dr EABLEPAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,I shall make that clear in my reply to the debate.,58
185,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"That is all I ask. I feel that it is due to us to make a strong protest against this action by the Government, because we all feel the necessity of bringing the States and the Commonwealth together. I admit that it will not be easy, and, in fact, that it will be a little difficult, though a very honourable, thing for Ministers to do; but I ask them to withdraw from their present position. If they can do so, even at the cost of some little loss of pride, they will be making a gesture to' the States which wil l give proof of their desire to co-operate heartily with the State Governments. gesture on their part would do an immense amount to bring about a better feeling throughout Australia. But let the Government go on with their present project, and no one can say where the consequences, immediate and indirect, will end. Let the Government say that it has misjudged public opinion and laid itself open to suspicion arid distrust in the past, but is now sincere in its protestations, and will prove its sincerity by agreeing not to pass this bill aud not to exercise the powers it possesses u n t i l it has met the representatives of the States in conference and unshackelled in any way. If they go into the conference with the bill passed, and the whole question already settled, what will the representatives of the States have to argue about ? In previous conferences that have beeh held, the representatives of the States have been asked willingly or unwillingly to accept certain arrangements, because if they did not they would have to accept something worse. A threat has been held over them all the time. The argument has been by bludgeon and not by reason. For the States to go into a conference with the bill passed would be like sitting down to play a game of cards with the cards stacked against them. I think this is a most favourable opportunity for the Commonwealth to wipe out many of the misunderstandings that are alleged to exist, by making a really statesmanlike gesture towards the States to bring about a better feeling. There will be no need for apology or explanation. The act will speak for itself and will prove the strongest cement for the various political forces in this country for the good of the Commonwealth as a whole.",58
186,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Swan) [ 9 . 2 5 ] - I had no desire to speak on the bill to-night, but as no honourable member seems inclined to continue the debate, it would appear that only a few honourable members for Western Australia take any interest in the measure. I am hopeful that, in connection with this bill , we shall have a result somewhat similar to that which we had a little time ago in . connection with the referenda. I would not have referred to the matter had not the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) rather1 spoiled his very excellent speech today by his reference to the referenda and in fluences brought to bear in connection therewith. Though probably the honorSuch a able member had no such intention, his references were a little offensive. There can be no question that it is the desire of the whole of the people of Australia to uphold the federation, leaving to this Parliament matters of national concern, and reserving the settlement of matters of domestic concern to the parliaments of the States. I tell the Government that when it goes to the electors it will find that very strong feeling will be aroused by the vote to be taken on this measure. I feel satisfied that the result will be very much the same as the result of the referenda, and those supporting this measure will be f u l ly called to account. So far as the bill is concerned, my position in connection with it is clearly understood. The moment the measure was proposed in the party room, I expressed myself very strongly, and stated the action I proposed to take. No' member of the party on this side can have any doubt as to my attitude towards that bill . I was one of those who fought for federation; I believe in it , and am keenly desirous that it should continue. But I have a very strong opinion that if this policy is to be pursued the effect will be to gradually destroy the federation. To those people who desire unification, and who support legislation of this description without consulting the people to bring it about, I would say, "" Go ahead with measures of this kind."" The action now taken by the Government is taken without the slightest consultation with the people. They have had no opportunity of saying whether or not it should be taken, and that is very wrong indeed. We have a federation in Australia of which we have a right to be very proud. It is the most democratic federation in the whole world. C can remember the debates of the last federal convention held here, when Sir Edmund Barton, pointing out how gloriously democratic it was, reminded those who listened to him of the way in which this federation would differ from any other in the world. He pointed out that property had no voice in either chamber of the federal legislature, and that both were to be elected by the people of Australia.  people in Western Australia wish to secede from the federation.",58
187,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"When so much anxious stupidity is exhibited in this House, i not surprising to find that some people will desire to secede from the federation. regard. One of those who have spoken most highly of the federation is the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). Looking his speeches to discover what references he might have made to this drastic change proposed in the financial relations tween the States and the Commonwealth, wast found that he made these remarks concerning the federal ConstitutionThe ideal the fraraerB of the Constitution had before them was to weld Australia into States. one great nation while preserving to the States their right of self-government. Is it not an undoubted fact that, financial fabric of the State he destroyed, its power of self-government is likewise destroyed? The right honourable gentleported man described the Constitution as perishable monument. Very well, let us do all we can to preserve the federation, and if there be a desire on the part one to destroy it , let him come out the open, so that the people may sity know their danger. The Treasurer fond of saying that finance is governannounced ment. If the finances of the State destroyed, as they will be if this bill passed, the power of the State to carry on its developmental work is destroyed. [5] When I was speaking on the budget, 1 dealt with the matter of the per capita payments at great length, and I do not wish to go into details again, but I contend that any one who, having read the debates at the various Eederal conventions, at which men of great intellect laid the foundation of our great Constitution, still maintains that the States have no moral right to a share of the Commonwealth Customs revenue, cannot understand the meaning of words. Would there have been the slightest possibility of the people of Australia agreeing to the Constitution without a special provision in it giving this protection to the States? Prior to federation, the States had expended immense sums of borrowed money upon roads, railways, and harbours, and all the necessary works that bring prosperity to a country. It was, therefore, essential that some provision should be made in the Constitution to enable them to pay interest on the large indebtedness they had incurred in carrying on their work of development, and had it not been for that provision, the States would not have agreed to federate. In any case, if the present Government was to bring forward this proposal, t is why did it not at the last election make an announcement of its intentions in this",59

191,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I am quoting from his policy speech at Dandenong as rein the Argus of 9th October. When an imSenator Pearce spoke in Western Australia, he read a speech every word of of any which had come direct from Cabinet, and into in that speech he referred to the necesfor "" less involved methods of dealing is with the per capita payments,"" and that there would be a conare ference with the States. Full reports of is both speeches were published, and if the Government was so desirous of taking the drastic action of depriving the States of the per capita grant, how was it Ministers did not have the courage to say so when they were on the public platforms seeking the suffrages of the people.",59
192,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable member will read the full statement of the Prime Minister, he will find that it was quite specific on the point.",60
193,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"To the Treasurer the agreement of the past js apparently merely "" a scrap of paper."" after the election was over, and when the Government submitted its policy speech to Parliament, why did it not tell Parliament what action it proposed to take? All it said in the Governor General's speech wasI n view of the problems arising out of the relations between the Commonwealth and the States, my Ministers propose to invite the States to meet the Commonwealth in conference to consider these matters. A royal commission has already considered the position of Western Australia, and au investigation will be made into the circumstances of Tasmania. For the present year you will be asked to grant a subsidy of £450,000 to the State of Western Australia. Where in that statement is there any mention of the distinct now before us? Wheu it was brought forward in the party room it came tome like a thunderbolt. not the slightest idea that the Government intended to bring forward such a proposition. I feel sure that very few honourable members would on the public platforms in their States tell the people that they were willing to support a Bill of this sort and expect to be returned to this House. Why cannot the Government make the bill operative a year after the next election, thus giving the people ample time to consider the matter and affording honourable members an opportunity to go to their constituents and tell them what it is proposed to do? I wonder how many honourable members would be prepared to support the Government in its attitude?",60
194,Mr BAYLEY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Would the honourable member do so?,60
195,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"No , because I do not approve of the policy. B ut surely t is an honest course to tell the people what action is proposed to be taken in a matter of this sort. When we have a mandate from the people we are justified in bringing forward measures of this nature, but how can the Ministry say that the people have approved of its present proposal ? I have quoted all that was said in regard to the matter in the policy speech.",60
196,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That is not so. Let the honourable member quote the full speech-at Dandenong.,60
197,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,Le t the Minister go through all the speeches as I did.,60
198,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"We shall put on record in Hansard what the Prime MinMoreover, ister said.",60
199,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I went carefully through the right honourable gentleman's speech because I had no desire to misquote any Minister in regard to the matter. I certainly did not read the Treasurer's speeches, but I read those of the Prime Minister and Senator Pearce. In fact, I was sitting alongside Senator Pearce when he read a written speech to the people of Western Australia, telling them what the Government, proposed to do.",60
200,Mr STEWART,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The Government said that it would meet the States, but it did not say that it would abolish the per capita payments.",60
201,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The Government proposal said that it would deal with the whole question of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I had Mr GREGORY - That is an entirely different matter. The Government should accept my suggestion and mak© this Bil l operative in a couple of years from now; but in any case I am opposed to the principle involved. When I look at the obligations of the States, 1 feel that they are justified in expecting assistance from the Commonwealth, particularly because of the great concessions they made in order to bring about federation. It was the States that brought about federation. It has been frequently said in this chamber that the States made great sacrifices to build up national aspirations. They handed over their Customs revenue, their post and telegraph offices, and other functions, for the purpose of building up a national parliament. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the spirit of partnership seemed dead in Australia, and spoke of the desire to bring about a different atmosphere. If the spirit of partnership is dead, I should hke to know who is responsible for it . In any case, if there is a desire on the part of Ministers to bring about a different atmosphere, their methods are somewhatcrude. I have already pointed out what waa promised to Western Australia in the Governor General's Speech. August last the Premier of the State, anxious to get the grant which had been promised by the Commonwealth Government, wrote to the Prime Minister, and received the following telegram in reply:Referring to your telegrams of the 3rd and 10th August, the Commonwealth Government considers that the question of special assistance to Western Australia should be dealt with in conjunction with the general proposals for and adjustment of the financial relationships of the Stotes and the Commonwealth. Both matters have accordingly been provided for in the States Grants Bill now before Parliament. That telegram gives the Western Australian Government clearly to understand that the grant of £300,000 recommended by the Western Australian Disabilities Commission would depend entirely upon the votes of honourable members upon the States Grants Bill . That does not appeal to me, nor do I think to most people, as being the best means to employ to bring about a different atmosphere or remove the bad feeling which now exists. The Prime Minister also said that we could have an assurance of fair , just, and honourable treatment. I am always prepared to accept the word of the right honourable gentleman; but i-s he justified in asking us to give him a blank cheque by passing a bill of this sort, thus allowing him to go to the various State Governments, saying, "" Here is what Parliament has done; come together now and we shall consider the financial proposals with you for the future. "" In m y opinion, that is not the way to approach the States. If there is the slightest desire to have fair, just, and honourable treatment in regard to this matter, the manner in which financial assistance is to be given to the States should be clearly defined. Parliament should know the exact proposals of the Government before the bill is considered. It is useless to ask the States to meet the Commonwealth afterwards. The Treasurer says The system of capitation grants is an unsound one. It is wrong in principle, unfair in its incidence, and stands in the way of the Commonwealth evacuating the field of direct taxation. This Government has not promised to evacuate the field of direct taxation. In any case how could this Government bind any future Government? A f t e r the Treasurer had finished his speech on the budget, the honorIn able member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin) gave this House distinctly to understand that the moment the Labour party regained ofiice it would re-introduce the land tax. In view of that statement the promises of this Government are absolutely worthless. I have not the slightest doubt that this Government would do its best to carry out any obligation that it entered into, but how could we give the States any guarantee that future Governments would not re-enter the field of direct taxation. The Treasurer says that the system of per capita payments is wrong in principle, and that one Government should not raise money for another to spend. The Government is inconsistent in its attitude, because no sooner was this proposal put forward than the Main Roads Bill was introduced. It is also proposed to introduce a bill providing for advances for wire netting. Both of these impugn the principle. This is - a most extraordinary attitude for the Government to adopt. Then the Treasurer says that the system is unfair in its in cidence. He pointed out what had happened in Canada. If it were a question of incidence only, I could quite understand the Government calling the States together, and saying to them, "" V i c to r i a and New South Wales are profiting exceedingly; large numbers of people are being absorbed there, and it is unfair that those States should be getting all the advantages of the system, while the other States are losing by it . "" The incidence of the system could have been discussed at a conference to enable a larger proportion of the money to be given to the poorer States. When the agreement respecting the per capita payments was come to in 1910, it was pointed out that Western Australia suffered. financially by federation, and provision was made for a grant of £250,000, to be reduced by £10,000 annually, but that half of that sum would be provided by the other States. This was a clear indication that the States were prepared to discuss the question of incidence. The question of incidence, however, has never been discussed by the Treasurer. I said just now that the Commonwealth Government objects to the per capita payments on the ground that it is unfair for one party to raise money for another to spend. Yet this Government is providing large sums of money for road-making in the various States. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) yesterday admitted that the Western Australian Government on the eve of an election sent large bodies of workmen into various constituencies a period just far enough ahead to get their names on the roll, and that the Commonwealth were providing part of the funds.",60
202,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,That was suggested political partisans of that side.,62
203,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"On e body of workpelled men was sent to Northam; but, strange to say, owing to the men being within the wrong boundaries, the Commonwealth the funds were spent without any advantage to the Labour party. What is the need for this sudden and drastic action on part of the Government? It is not bebeen cause of any shortage of Commonwealth funds. In 1919 the then Treasurer (M Watt) suggested that the Government would have to consider a reduction of per capita payments, and he proposed to Australia. reduce the amount by 2s. 6d. annually. That proposal was made just after are the expiry of the war, and it was then difficult to estimate the requirements of the Commonwealth. In 1919 the Customs revenue was £21,000,000, but for the previous three years it did average £16,000,000. This year the Custhe toms revenue will be about £45,000,000, tainly so that it cannot be argued that the present state of the finances has caused the Government to bring forward such drastic proposal. In the Argus, morning, appeared the following extract from the Auditor-General's report: At the end of the financial year 1924-25 unexpended money resulting from what ought to have been called surpluses amounted to £6,472,673, which was appropriated to various uses. In the following year, 1925-26, not only was this money not spent, but the trust were increased by £151,318, making the amount in trust funds £6,623,991. In other thousands words, the Treasury had this large amount money in band at the end of the financial year. It cannot be suggested that there is slightest justification for this proposal the grounds of financial stringency. We have only the Treasurer's bare statement Navigation Act . that the system of per capita payments wrong in principle. This proposal should contend with. have been brought forward just before the elections. The Treasurer in his speech spoke of the blind worship of State rights. I believe in federation, and would remind that honourable gentleman that State rights were the outcome federation. I wish to have those rights protected until the peonle themselves, by an alteration of the Constitution decide on a change. In Western Australia a feelat ing of discontent is undoubtedly growing, because of the continual increase in the tariff and the operation of the Navigation Act . Unless there is some drastic reform the people there will surely advocate secession. Western Australia is a magby nificent country, but the people who are settling on the new areas there are comto pay 100 per cent, and 200 per cent, more for every article that they require. In the event of a bad harvest, feeling of discontent among the people respecting the Commonwealth policy must inevitably develop in intensity. the Federation, for Western Australia, has most disastrous, and, without it , that State would have made much greater r . progress. No section of this community has been more loyal to federation and the the Empire than have the people of Western They have always been quite as loyal as any other section, but they suffering greatly through the effects of federation and the policy of the Federal Parliament. One has only to look at the mining industry. Gold and copper mining have almost been crushed out, not although t in aud lead mining, because of high prices of those metals, is cerflourishing. Twenty years ago 100,000 men were employed in the mining industry, but, today, less than 40,000 a men are so employed. Enormous sums have this been expended on the construction of railways, public buildings, and water conservation, and yet the mining districts the are now becoming deserted. One knows that mining is an evanescent industry, but there are still millions of tons of ore in the Kalgoorlie and other mining belts, funds which, were it not for the high cost of total production, would be employing many of people. The farmers of have to pay 100 per cent, more for their implements and other requirements, due entirely to the high tariff and the the Navigation Act. In 1914 we had a on splendid mercantile fleet, but it has vanished, owinig to the harsh operation of the Western Australia is a is new country, and has many difficulties to It is essential that the settlers should be given advances for wire netting, in order to keep the rabbits in check. About eighteen months ago, just I as the wheat orops were sprouting, I travelled through one portion of my elecof torate, and I saw thousands of acres as bare as the floor of this House because of the ravages of this pest. Yet we have the most extraordinary dumping duties imposed on their goods.",62
204,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH, Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with the bill?,63
205,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I am pointing out the effects of the federal policy upon Western Australia. Some 10,000 souls have been placed in the group settlement areas in my State. For many years they must confine their energies to dairying or pig-raising, and I do not suppose they will contribute anything by way of income tax for many years. But every new settler represents an asset to the Commonwealth, and surely Western Australia is entitled to a fair share of the Customs revenue thus created. Last year I asked for a return showing the sums paid to the various States during the past four years by way of federal bounties. The statement furnished by the Treasurer showed that New South Wales had received £872,000, which included bounty amounting to ,£664,000 on the manufacture of wire netting and wire. Victoria received an even larger payment, totalling about £900,000. I have included £240,000 paid to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, since Victoria got the principal benefit from it . Queensland's largest payment by way of bounty was made on ita meat' export. Western Australia received £20,000 on its beef export, £41,000 to enable it to cope with the outbreak of rinderpest, and £64,000 for wire netting, which Bum the settlers are required to repay.",63
206,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The money allocated for the suppression of the outbreak o rinderpest was spent for the benefit of ihe Commonwealth.,63
207,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Yes ; but it was included' among the payments to my Stnle as u bounty. That shows the efforts of the Treasury to make it appear that Western Australia got something out of the large sum distributed by way of bounties. Although great wealth has been created in the wheat areas of Western Australia, and many of the settlers have contributed large sums by way of income tax. the group settlers, and others in new areas will not be in a position to pay income tax for many years. Consequently the present system of Commonwealth doles will have to be continued. Probably the only means of remedying the position, and silencing the cry foT [6-j secession, would be to give Western Australia control of ita own tariff for the next twenty years.",63
208,Mr COLEMAN,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member knows that under the Constitution that cannot be done.,63
209,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"I recognize that, but I had hoped that the necessary alteration of the Constitution would be made. If there should be a fall in the price of wheat, settlers on new areas in Western Australia would be in a serious plight; but if that State had control of its own tariff I feel sure that within 25 years it would be one of the most-flourishing portions of the Commonwealth. The freight on goods from the eastern States to Wnstern Australia is enormous, being in some instances greater than that from Great Britain. In the course of hia policy speech in Western Australia, Senator Pearce said that, although the proposal for a grant to that State of £450,000 was made for that year, the proposed conference between the Commonwealth and the States was a recognition by the Commonwealth that the findings of the Disabilities Commission justified the payment to Western Australia of that amount of compensation, and further established a basis on which any future relationship should rest. But the Treasurer, in dealing with that matter, said that the findings of the Commission did not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government that federation had substantially affected the financial strength of the smaller States. The chairman and, I think, another member of that commission also affirmed that the only way in which Western Australia f could be assisted would be by giving it control of ita own tariff for a certain period, and until that was done it should receive £450,000 a year.  third of the total Customs revenue collected in that State.",63
210,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The Minister is forgetting that Western Australia purchases over £8,000,000 worth of goods per annum from the eastern States. If those purchases were made elsewhere, there would be a remarkable difference in the figures. I intend to support the amendment, and if it is defeated I shall en' deavour to have an amendment inserted to make the bill operative only after the next elections. Until the people have had an opportunity to express their views on this proposal, the Government cannot claim to have any mandate to proceed with it. If we cannot defeat the bill on the motion for the second reading, I hope that when it is in committee, it will be BO amended that it will not take effect until the people's wishes are ascertained. M.r. WEST - Mov e that the bill be read this day six months, and so defeat the Government.",63
211,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The fate of Governments do not affect my attitude when the future of the State I represent, and, inment deed, the whole Commonwealth, is at day next. stake. This bill is entirely opposed to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution and to my conception of federation. Although it is qualified hy certain promises by the Government of today, ultimately it will be disastrous to the States. I appeal to the House to take such action as will ensure that Commonwealth Ministers shall confer with representatives of the States before this bill is enacted. The proposal of the Prime Minister that the per capita payments shall be withdrawn aud the States consulted afterwards as to the readjustment of their financial relations with the Commonwealth, is most unjust. I accept his word that he is prepared to deal equitably with the States, but another Government may take a different view of what is fair and equitable. In any case, I should not be justified in voting for the bill on a mere assumption that the Government will act fair l y. I am not prepared to give a blank cheque to any Government. We must look to the future, and until this matter has been referred to the people, the only course open to the House is to reject the bill . Debate (on motion by Mr TuEonoKE) adjourned.
