It a country as dangerous as Iran may have nuclear capabilities in just a matter of months. Many nuclear weapon, but to my mind Iran's actions have raised undoubted suspicions nuclear weapons regardless of what authorities showing off its military capabilities, in a subtle remember that Iran already has systems in enemies. All that is needed is for a nuclear warhead a massive scale. Perhaps it will soon be time against those facilities. In 2012, Iran boasted of a new long-range It has also announced plans to produce a missile-launching recently, Iran has claimed that dozens of its airspace without detection, and they plan to produce more.

I do of religious dissembling known as taqiyya throughout they have in the past justified lying in order Regardless of what has been said by authorities, If there truly is nothing to hide, why don't This is unlikely.

It cautionary observation-had absolutely unanimous member of the House of Representatives, the preamble. Notwithstanding that, the preamble proposal. This is a very important point about return. Our Constitution was not a document establishing not an independent country in 1901. It was the British Empire but subordinate to the not an Australian head of state. The Governor General appointed on the recommendation of the Australian an imperial viceroy and indeed was the effective that language has on a sense of identity and a Indigenous language and the role that it plays having access to language is.

I am not aware of any Senate or any political party who opposed the achieved fewer votes than the republic the practicality of this change to which I will an independent country. Australia was constituted as a self-governing dominion within imperial government. The Governor General was was not chosen by Australians or government. The Governor General was representative of the imperial government in Australia right up until the 1930s-1933, I British high commissioner appointed to Australia. So it is important, when you read the Australian Queen-which are defined in the Constitution Victoria and her heirs and successors in the not, in 1901 terms, mean the Queen as she government; it means the Queen acting on imperial government. The Constitution is subordination of Australia. A very good example-this recite one-is section 59, which states that one year of it being enacted. Indeed, under withhold consent to any law which had been General. So there was a whole scheme. If the Governor General, government, felt there were an Australian law Whitehall where the Queen or King, acting then knock it back.

And then you have all of the Court as they interpreted the Constitution. Winterton once said, in Constitutional terms a our Constitution in any controversial way. support to change the Constitution. It is but it is absolutely not enough. The preamble is a of the force of what I am saying. you need to have overwhelming public strongest possible support, and very little and no opposition. The reason for that, in my judgement-and I acknowledge that it was the my attention many years ago-is that we have are not interested in the issue, not because they they are not interested in the issue-people have not read all the literature and have not Australia, dragged along by force of law proposition-are invariably much more likely likely to vote no. Indeed, at every referendum change have said quite openly, 'If you don't about it the more likely you are to be open unknown in political circles, so honourable So the big challenge we face with this project united in their support for having a Constitution today: the Australia that does not treat Aboriginals 1901, as not simply second-class citizens but be counted, not to vote, as though they had pretty much where it was in 1901, to our great make this document speak to the civilised, passed? Some people would say, 'Oh well, just give how you go.' The consequences, to my mind, defeated would be very serious. It would be seen would do extraordinary damage to Australia indeed to the world's perception of us. So to roll of the dice. I think Australia would have the republic proposal in 1999. I imagine there that Australia is in some respects not fully Kingdom is our head of state, notwithstanding independent country-in fact in some respects So perceptions matter. But with this question, race, the stakes are much higher. So I am very pleased to see that the bill provides this bill being enacted take soundings, and achieved. It is something that is going to have responsibility. There is a tendency in some community to run very hysterical scare campaigns with those. This is a proposal that is very potentially people saying, 'Oh, if we were to make these backyard, claim our house.' You can imagine will have to be resisted with great force, and a nation. Are we able to tell the truth about Torres Strait Islander people as second-class people who do, but there is no serious constituency. Chief Justice Murray Gleeson who drew this to compulsory voting in Australia. So people who are foolish or irresponsible but simply because who have chosen not to pay attention to it, who watched the debates, and are then, as we are into the polling booth and presented with a to vote no than yes.

I think will acknowledge. is not that everyone in this building is not that more properly speaks to the Australia of and Torres Strait Islanders as it did in effectively non-persons, noncitizens, not even to just been airbrushed out of history. That was shame. But all of that has changed. How do we just, fair Australia of 2013? How do we get it it a go. Work up a referendum proposal and see of a referendum proposal on this topic being as a national rejection of reconciliation. It in terms of our own perception of ourselves and have a referendum on this topic is a momentous been better advised, obviously, to have approved are many people in the world who still imagine independent because the Queen of the United that we are of course as thoroughly an more independent-as the United Kingdom. because it touches on such a sensitive issue of that the minister shall within 12 months of report on the feasibility of a change being to be undertaken with great care and with great sections of the media and in some sections of the on a range of issues. We are all familiar vulnerable to that. You can well imagine changes, Aboriginals will be able to claim our all the scare campaigns that could be run. They care. This is going to be a test of our maturity as ourselves? We no longer regard Aboriginal and citizens or noncitizens. There may be some There is no accounting for a handful of people. But overwhelmingly the vast majority-that the same aspirations as are in this bill. Of course, you have to remember that proposal. You cannot just have a vote on recognising people, just like you cannot have a vote on to have some specific words. It is always possible the general objective but we object to these technical objection. This bill, which some people potent than most of its readers imagine. It is Australians: are we mature enough, are we we are not going to play petty politics, scare Are we going to face up to the facts and maturely the recognition that we should all support, but great project that we are looking at today and completed successfully.",256

33,Mr LAMING,BILLS," Indeed Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 allows this constitutional recognition, to build consensus this great country. The debate, I think, has previous speakers. On our side, from the member elucidation of just how complex a referendum referred to 'an adult conversation for an adult because the one component of that discussion parliament is the conversation within Aboriginal this very, very important course of events. I would like to focus a lot of my speech because I do not believe that it is, for the very piece of work that will be remembered as really in its own journey towards constitutional quarterly essay have yet to find their way into debate on this day will be looked back on, and has played in this journey. Of course Pearson, like many people, is inspired essay, he focuses on Jonathan Lear's Radical Devastation, a work in 2006, where Lear asks such radical hope to be justified for Aboriginal project such hope must be serious in order to that determination alone is not enough, that it more than that.

It has been inadequately replaced the ruins of the old world and facing the mutations onerous task, but I was browsing the shelves in our lives the pages that appear before us on those pages was of a different interaction here in this country. I read several pages of to the Aboriginal people and marvelled at the marvelled at the uniqueness of their language, in which they lived and marvelled at the complex what a different country we might be if that proper engagement and acknowledgement of the It is important that at this time, while it is endeavour possible to ensure that we reach out education that draws us together with an draws us to a much better and long overdue of this nation. I commend the bill to the House. the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nation more time to debate the issue of and to work on increased awareness right across had two important contributions made by the for Wentworth, there was a very, very clear change can be, and the previous speaker nation'. It is a theme that I would like to pick up, that has not yet been added to this debate in this Australia about their role in succeeding in on a 2009 quarterly essay by Noel Pearson, not simple and self-evident case, a very important expanding on the role of Indigenous Australia recognition but because large elements of this Hansard. I believe that important parts of this we will see the important role that this piece by the readings of others. In this quarterly Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural the important question: what would it be for Australia? Those who hold, harbour and succeed. Pearson makes the very important point is necessary but not sufficient, that we will need all odds, determination is no guarantee of that discipline is just as important. The people has been that the institutions of their ago, fell apart and has really struggled to or inadequately rejuvenated. In the midst of of the new, Aboriginal Australia is seeking an accommodation of those things that make people. Pearson postulates that all pre-modern peoples within their culture 'some institutional essence but at the same time they are facing modern and unanchored. Modern people come to feel in many ways are free of that traditional orthodoxy. lose our own identity as modern people and dominant culture, which is not the characteristic observation by Pearson. Those who resist assimilation inexorable advance, so Pearson asks this very that challenge ahead? Obviously, he makes his parallel world, be pursued with other elements his quarterly essay correctly, he says, 'Never which we become utterly reliant but let it Pearson makes two observations about what first of those is to live in hard places-the place, the more serious must be the people. most inhospitable and economically irrational that require serious people to sustain them maintain that hearth in hard places. The maintain and transmit to future generations modern and global world. The more esoteric cultures may be deemed and that languages are the more serious a challenge these people will in order to retain their culture and language. I think he very, very simply elucidates that often remote Aboriginal Australia is even more use his expression. His notion of seriousness sense that we are concerned with an orthodox observation that one of the great challenges that in a range of orthodox cultures around the the case in traditional Aboriginal Australia that are unprecedented and where, he notes, vices according to comparable principles of other cultures.

This is an observation that I was privileged sniffing first arrived at the Central Desert were the first images that senior Aboriginal Aboriginal culture something of a serious face this very challenge, that they carry of what made and maintained them as peoples', people-to use that vernacular-who are secular a double-edged sword, because modern people That includes the ability that we have to to also succumb to and assimilate easily into a of pre-modern people.

Pearson makes the interesting to the traditional life has been alcohol. He notes world alcohol is anathema but that that is not where they have faced a range of European vices 'Aboriginal Law did not evolve to proscribe these precedent'-principles that you might find in makes about orthodoxy is that in many of the like alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs yet occurred in many elements of traditional but remain 'fatally compromised by the High Culture does not have anything to say enough to be part of in 1994, when petrol community of Lajamanu in the mid-nineties.

And so what really started these strong culture based on kinship and the external threats is something that Pearson them to have that conversation and to walk in and a mainstream response to those challenges. This brings me to the fifth Closing the gap Minister that was just touching on some levels optimistic, she then switched back to very much Alice Springs and on disputes between jurisdictions-something report. I think we were really there for a distillation there is promise and to be rightfully concerned quoted in that very important-and landmark-fifth the then Labor minister from the Northern Territory election which compared the impact the previous year. What was not known to anyone-not to those Minister who read it out-was that the data Banned Drinkers Register in Alice Springs had related antisocial behaviour reports attributed included after the Banned Drinkers Register included prior to the Banned Drinkers Register. and a false attribution of the impact of the balanced assessment of the data in the Northern very little impact at all on dysfunctional behaviour But that is not what has been carved into stone genuinely unfortunate. To emerge from these challenges that are traditional or otherwise, the challenge for Aboriginal own belief systems having one foot in mainstream also the culture of their people that have challenges but are yet to deal with some The late Maria Lane, a South Australian quarterly essay, also made an important, picks up in his essay.

34,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS," I too take this Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill Recognising. Aboriginal and Torres Strait presented about a year ago. I note that the panel that put together that report, is in the colleagues that it is, indeed, an excellent report. the situation of Indigenous When I think about Australia's identity and the first thing that comes to my mind is the Torres Strait Islander people of this country: tens of thousands of years; people with a fascinating the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander controversial and at times divisive. Since history in its treatment of the Indigenous policy and decisions based on prejudice and of Prime Ministers Edmund Barton and Alfred time. Nor was the racism directly and solely fact, I suspect that most of it was intended have been discriminative, racist and heartless In recent decades, however, there has been equality of Indigenous people in Australia. Indigenous political representation have attitudes throughout this country, yet many assessed against the often substantial recognition in the Australian Constitution opposed the proposition, yet following through incredibly difficult. I heard the speech by point. He quite rightly also made the point that the past but also it is likely to be very difficult the broader issue about the difficulty of amending propositions out of 44 put to the Australian I think the most important thing of all is not to our Constitution. We also need to have a the shape of the next Indigenous studying, moment we have a great dissonance. We have a a whole host of reasons, and an expungement of educational curricula. We have children falling of school, and we have no community-wide system an opportunity. And ultimately, we have not yet prepared to support not just an Aboriginal to move further than the 90-minute Centrelink welfare system can mature to that point can we Australian family wants, be they Indigenous or opportunity to speak to the Aboriginal and 2012. This legislation follows the report titled Islander peoples in the Constitution, which was member for Page, who was a member of the expert chamber. I say to her on behalf of all of her I have read through it and I believe it sums up people of this country very well. what distinguishes Australia from other nations, Australian Indigenous people-the Aboriginal and people whose attachment to this land dates back and, indeed, unique culture. Since 1788, people in the Australian story has been colonisation, Australia does not have a proud people. It is a history littered with government ignorance. One only has to look at the speeches Deakin to understand the racist thinking of the meant for the Indigenous people of this land. In towards other people. Policies which in hindsight arose as a result of thoughts in that era. considerable effort to recognise the rights and The 1967 referendum, land rights, Mabo and all been commendable examples of changing other efforts have had only limited success when resources committed. The issue of Indigenous is a prime example of that. Few people expressly with constitutional recognition has proved the member for Wentworth and he made that very not only has it proven to be very difficult in in the future. That may be partly explained by the Australian Constitution. Only eight people have been successful. I suspect, however, that it has more been about a lack of commitment The rhetoric and the platitudes have not always and effort required, in a similar way to the question of local government recognition. Indigenous Australians are understandably of Australia's Indigenous people in Australia's or patronising gesture. The Australian Constitution Australia's legal framework. It provides responsibilities of federal and state governments. The absence of any recognition of Indigenous of the truth about the origins and history of have been accepted in 1901 but Indigenous recognition in the Australian Indigenous people in the Australian story, but recognition, reconciliation and Closing the complete without truthful recognition of Indigenous future. Importantly, every act of reconciliation strategies. Acknowledging injustice and reconciliation process. That is why former Prime Minister Kevin unifying Australia. The Prime Minister's February, only last week, highlighted progress and hardship. The statement also reaffirms exist throughout Indigenous communities-the Territory intervention policy. I believe that intentioned, but it will be some time before expectation is that there will be some initial point to those benefits as evidence that the that over time there will be ways found to circumvent not stop the consumption of liquor in the US, illegal activity in order to get around it. I am also told that intervention is causing Indigenous people. Addressing core problems would very likely have much better long-term to control behaviour. Whilst disadvantage continues, will continue to feel resentment, continue to on past injustices. So Closing the Gap will conversely reconciliation will help close the recognition of Australia's Indigenous people. Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, is an work of the expert panel that I referred to record of constitutional change, the government Indigenous recognition has the best chance of a process for consulting with the Australian by politicians at all levels across Australia. been matched by the necessary commitment lack of commitment that we are seeing on the cautious about the latest proposal. Recognition Constitution will be more than just a symbolic sits as the foundation document of a framework for Australian laws and the It is the founding document of our nation. people in the Australian Constitution is a denial Australia and perpetuates an injustice that may it has no place in Australia today. Constitution will recognise the rightful place of it will do much more than that. Constitutional Gap all intersect. Reconciliation will never be people in Australia's history and its will break down barriers to Closing the Gap grievances can be a powerful step in the Rudd's national apology was so important in Closing the Gap statement on Wednesday, 6 made in overcoming Indigenous disadvantage the considerable disadvantage that continues to kind of disadvantage that led to the Northern the Northern Territory intervention policy is well a proper evaluation of it can be made. My benefits, and those who support the policy will policy is working. There are concerns, however, the policy, and just as prohibition did the intervention may result in corruption and considerable resentment amongst many of the through education, awareness and inclusion benefits than protectionist laws which attempt many of Australia's Indigenous people feel discriminated against and continue to focus heal wounds and enable reconciliation, and gap. Both will be enhanced by constitutional This legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait important step in that process. It follows the in my opening remarks. Cognisant of the track wants to ensure that any proposal for success. With that in mind, this bill establishes people, getting the wording of the proposed constitutional change right and overcoming referendum. Last year I was asked to address a forum organised of Indigenous recognition in the Australian former Supreme Court justice, currently co-chair fact, South Australian of the year, Professor Engagement and Research at the University Commissioner for Aboriginal Engagement, also perspectives on the constitutional change discussion. I came away from the forum with of Salisbury team had gone to considerable participating, although as well as expected, reflected The attendance at the forum was consistent respect to Indigenous issues. The point I make quite often very difficult to engage the broader relating to the Indigenous people of this land. came away with. Secondly, there was, from memory, unanimous Indigenous constitutional recognition should done to ensure that a referendum on the expressed on the night were consistent with place and previously in other places and at other Constitution. It is even more difficult to change matter relating to the Indigenous people of this land. Whilst I note that the states of Queensland, acknowledged Australia's Indigenous people in of the difficulty that we face in changing the attempts in 1944, 1974, 1988 and 1999 to change Indigenous people all failed. The only successful was overwhelmingly successful, in fact the matter in the history of the nation. I suspect changes made at a time, I think, were quite logical being changes that should be made without Whilst the Mabo High Court decision establishment of an Indigenous Land Fund and believe that it also raised profound questions particular the moral and legal requirements Indigenous ownership pre-dates British occupation, and what other rights therefore pre-date the continue to remain unresolved and these are note that the expert panel made some comments comments, I might add-but questions remain now arise, in my view, as a result of the Constitution cannot continue to remain silent procedural concerns as obstacle to a successful by the City of Salisbury on the question Constitution. The Hon. Robyn Layton AO, QC, of Reconciliation South Australia and, in Peter Buckskin, Dean of Indigenous Scholarship, of South Australia, and Khatija Thomas, spoke at the forum and shared their expert and the process required. It was an interesting two clear observations. Firstly, whilst the City efforts to organise the event, the numbers the general lack of interest in the matter. with many other forums that I have attended with is that regardless of how much we try it is Australian community in questions and issues That is certainly one of the observations that I agreement from those present that whilst occur, there was still considerable work to be question would be successful.

I want to make this point: last Friday, at Redfern, we had a round-table with the National Tribunal; Fortescue Metals; BHP Billiton; Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda; lawyers from the left, the right and the centre; and many people at the round-table. The member consensus was that there was need for reform since the Mabo native title legislation has comprehensive review of the legislation. It has the consensus. It did not matter whether you an Indigenous person, that was the case. The Social Policy and Legal Affairs, of which members-he is chair of that one and I am and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-was that That is what the Standing Committee on Social examining the legislation before the chamber today.

We heard in report inquiry that there were 211 native title 166 determinations that native title exists, but claims to be dealt with. We have to look at have people who feel they have a native title make improvements. According to what we have seen, I think evidence from the Chief Executive Officer of Executive Officer of the Federal Magistrates removing the duplication of structures and But, as said before, there were initial cultural inevitability in those challenges.

Skehill recommended some ways to improve of the discharge of functions. I think this is a going to get a perfect legal system. You are inefficiency. You can do what you can do to amendments do that in this regard. I think they that which was so clear such a long time ago. were submissions made to the social policy and CEO of the Federal Court of Australia and a particularly in terms of the amendments and the in this country. We have a situation where it title claims to be dealt with. We have improved processes to the Federal Court and improving the mentioned that. The issue of processing detail last Friday in Redfern. It is something the terms of the cultures of the NNTC, the Federal we have addressed that through the merging sure that those entities are staffed with as good as we would like, but certainly there are have been better appointments.

We cannot claim being held up for that time. We have got to there will be some savings. We had some the Family Court, who is also the Acting Chief Court, that about $7.8 million has been saved by making changes. They are worthy improvements. differences and obviously there was some have improved, I am told. That is certainly the submissions to the inquiry and it is the friends and acquaintances who practise in this worthy of support and will make an improvement. will benefit both native title and family law, and access to justice because that is what we speak often in relation to these bills but I do proposals before us. I note that the member who before me, prefaced my concern about the use I note that the word 'reform' is very loosely used. When I looked at some of the statements legislation, that was brought home to me. committee summarising what is being done on this occasion.

These legitimate administrative arrangements such as a memorandum to enable the tribunal to continue performance status in the independent statutory authority. I make mention of that because I do have the President of the Native Title Tribunal. I period as being positive. I saw it as being when I was attorney, at the way in which in judges who bring themselves to these matters-sometimes often-to want to appoint people that they thought go to the Native Title Tribunal, the specialist in that way. I tried to have an inquiry into given to me at that time, which I acted upon, Tribunal. Graham Neate is reported as saying members and had built up extensive experience hoped that this knowledge would not be observations and comments.

I do not know why that was always sought the better way forward, and the advice that was was to require the courts to use the Native Title that the tribunal had several Indigenous staff in resolving native title claims and that he lost. I thought they were very appropriate a degree of trying to reinvent the wheel under the ability to get the full value that you can had to say about the difficulties in getting was with people who were involved in this was involved with me, when he was a Federal which we could expedite consideration of these large number of claims that had to be dealt with experience able to give advice to to enable matters to be progressed quickly.

The member issues, so it is a great pleasure to be of life for elderly Australians is particularly which is one of the most multicultural and one of the largest ageing communities. Ageing is an integral part of the life cycle where nothing and linguistic sensitivities as caring for Increasing the age pension, reforming the aged-care at work longer are all part and parcel implemented by the Gillard Labor government. Caring for the aged is an issue that affects continuously reiterated to me through my personal dealings with community groups, both in my ageing of Australia's post-Second World War Arthur Calwell's new Australians. Of the Australians-the Greek and Italian communities and they are followed by the Chinese, Indians, during that period. I have spoken many times to those communities these are alarm bells that we need to heed-that the elderly and in particular the care of the quality of that care is a hallmark of any civilised brings special challenges that we are all very need special services to assist their settlement arrival, so too, at the other end of the spectrum, linguistically sensitive services to cater for how long they have lived here. Many of them August marks 50 years since my father and his at Station Pier at Port Melbourne. It is for those government has made important headway on to caring for our ageing people and in In December last year I welcomed the Strategy for People from Culturally and Linguistically will help inform the delivery of Living government's $3.7 billion aged-care reform returning emphasis and reliance on the mother they have acquired a second language-in this their lifetime, tend to feel most comfortable Taking into account that about 20 per cent outside Australia and by 2021 that number will sensitive to this fact when planning and providing English-speaking background. The migrant elderly-many of them in my linguistic and spiritual needs, and that can affect are provided for. I congratulate the Minister because he has recognised that this community challenges that are faced by the elderly, their responded to those needs through the National is quite as complicated because of cultural elderly people and their very complex needs. system and helping older Australians stay of addressing those needs and they are being all communities and all sectors. I find this is work with my constituents and also in my electorate and elsewhere, particularly given the migration, otherwise known as the ageing of ageing new Australians-they once were new have the largest number of ageing people, Turks and many others who came to Australia and almost all of them advocate-and what is now paramount is the proper care of elderly from migrant communities, because the society.

Governments do not support biggest carbon tax economy-wide without retirees. Governments do not support older Australians insurance and governments do not support superannuation and reducing the amount superannuation. We cannot support our senior Australians care system, particularly at a time when Australians care. Yet this is exactly what the Labor government 2007. I continue to meet with many aged-care disappointed with the government's response older Australians report of 2011. The government implement real supply-side reform in what Aged-Care Approvals Round process, where government. It has been conveyed to me by resources are continuing to be wasted and taxpayer because clients have no, or very limited, They are also rightly concerned about the Care Funding Instrument. Cutting $1.6 billion long-term interests of the industry. As we move users of aged-care services will no longer Australians had to do during tough economic times to the future care of older Australians that families the ability to choose their own provider they have been assessed as needing. Secondly, the Labor government is making it themselves by increasing taxes on superannuation. money and is now resorting to attacking the superannuation funds. It is likely that the Australians will worsen in the future because heart out of the superannuation system. Despite billion, the government has not ruled out further uncertainty for retirees and those approaching that they would not change super taxes, but since. By their actions, they will continue to Backgrounds. That is the basis upon which the develop highly specialised needs.

The motion does not the age pension as a result of its own in the real cost-of-living pressures that affect older Australians by implementing the world's giving one cent to almost 300,000 self-funded by increasing the cost of private health older Australians by increasing taxes on that Australians can contribute to their own if we fail to implement real reform for the agedare expecting more and more from aged has been doing since it took office in providers in my electorate who are to the Productivity Commission's Caring for missed the opportunity at that time to many see as a wasteful, unfair and inefficient providers applied for packages from the people who operate in the aged-care sector that funds are not being efficiently allocated input into choosing a provider. government cutting $1.6 billion from the Aged is not a sign of a government acting in the from the baby boomer generation to the next, meekly accept what they are given, as many earlier last century. It is therefore integral we implement policies that give clients and their to deliver government funded services which more difficult for older Australians to support The Treasurer has run out of taxpayers' hard-earned money and savings in Australian quality of life and living conditions for older we have a government which is ripping the having already increased taxes on super by $8 attacks on super. This has created enormous retirement. The government promised in 2007 that is exactly what they have been doing ever increase taxes on super in the future.

They have recently announced that they help older Australians stay at work longer by a part-time job, as if that right somehow someone that they cannot afford. At the end businesses do. With jobs, governments overregulating them and controlling them with businesses will employ any Australians, Alternatively, governments can get out of small business so that businesses can grow Australians to be employed in in the future.
